mathematical models for a three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)
and a two-level IGBT inverter from measurement data. It consists of
approximately 40 million multidimensional samples from a defined operating
range of the drive. This document describes how to use the published data set
\cite{Dataset} and how to extract models using introductory examples. The
examples are based on known ordinary differential equations, the least squares
method or on (deep) machine learning methods. The extracted models are used for
the prediction of system states in a model predictive control (MPC) environment
of the drive. In case of model deviations, the performance utilizing MPC
remains below its potential. This is the case for state-of-the-art white-box
models that are based only on nominal drive parameters and are valid in only
limited operation regions. Moreover, many parasitic effects (e.g. from the
feeding inverter) are normally not covered in white-box models. In order to
achieve a high control performance, it is necessary to use models that cover
the motor behavior in all operating points sufficiently well.

skin cancer classification in preliminary stages that need sensitive and
precise data analysis. For the proposed study the Kaggle skin cancer dataset is
utilized. The proposed study consists of two main phases. In the first phase,
the images are preprocessed to remove the clutters thus producing a refined
version of training images. To achieve that, a sharpening filter is applied
followed by a hair removal algorithm. Different image quality measurement
metrics including Peak Signal to Noise (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Maximum
Absolute Squared Deviation (MXERR) and Energy Ratio/ Ratio of Squared Norms
(L2RAT) are used to compare the overall image quality before and after applying
preprocessing operations. The results from the aforementioned image quality
metrics prove that image quality is not compromised however it is upgraded by
applying the preprocessing operations. The second phase of the proposed
research work incorporates deep learning methodologies that play an imperative
role in accurate, precise and robust classification of the lesion mole. This
has been reflected by using two state of the art deep learning models:
Inception-v3 and MobileNet. The experimental results demonstrate notable
improvement in train and validation accuracy by using the refined version of
images of both the networks, however, the Inception-v3 network was able to
achieve better validation accuracy thus it was finally selected to evaluate it
on test data. The final test accuracy using state of art Inception-v3 network

standard length dependence of the logarithmic average of the conductance is

In this work, we propose nonorthogonal multiple acess (NOMA) based OTFS which

and link level perspective. The challenge lies in the fact that while OTFS
transmission technology is known for its resilience to high mobility
conditions, while NOMA is known to yield high spectral efficiency in low
mobility scenarios in comparison to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We
present a minimum mean square error (MMSE)- successive interference
cancellation (SIC) based receiver for NOMA-OTFS, for which we derive expression
for symbol-wise post-processing SINR in order to evaluate system sum spectral
efficiency (SE). We develop power allocation schemes to maximize the sum SE in
the high-mobility version of NOMA. We further design a realizable codeword
level SIC (CWIC) receiver using LDPC codes along with MMSE equalization for
evaluating link level performance of such practical NOMA-OTFS system. The
system level and link level performance of the proposed NOMA-OTFS system are
compared against benchmark OMA-OTFS, OMA-orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OMA-OFDM) and NOMA-OFDM schemes. From system-level performance
evaluation, we observe interestingly that NOMA-OTFS provides higher sum SE than
OMA-OTFS. When compared to NOMA-OFDM, we find that outage SE of NOMA-OTFS is
improved at the cost of decrease in mean SE. Whereas link-level results show
that the developed CWIC based NOMA-OTFS receiver performs significantly better
than NOMA-OFDM in terms of block error rate (BLER), goodput and throughput.

physics beyond the standard cosmological model. Here I describe two early
modified gravity mechanisms that reconcile the value of $H_0$ by increasing the
expansion rate in the era of matter-radiation equality. These mechanisms, based
on viable Horndeski theories, require significantly less fine-tuned initial
conditions than early dark energy with oscillating scalar fields. In Imperfect
Dark Energy at Equality (IDEE), the initial energy density dilutes slower than
radiation but faster than matter, naturally peaking around the era of equality.
The minimal IDEE model, a cubic Galileon, is too constrained by the cosmic
microwave background (Planck) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to relieve
the $H_0$ tension. In Enhanced Early Gravity (EEG), the scalar field value
modulates the cosmological strength of gravity. The minimal EEG model, an
exponentially coupled cubic Galileon, gives a Planck+BAO value $H_0=68.7 \pm
1.5$ (68\% c.l.), reducing the tension with SH0ES from $4.4\sigma$ to
$2.6\sigma$. Additionally, Galileon contributions to cosmic acceleration may
reconcile $H_0$ via Late-Universe Phantom Expansion (LUPE). Combining LUPE, EEG
and $\Lambda$ reduces the tension between Planck, BAO and SH0ES to $2.5\sigma$.
I will also describe additional tests of coupled Galileons based on local
gravity tests, primordial element abundances and gravitational waves. While
further model building is required to fully resolve the $H_0$ problem and
satisfy all available observations, these examples show the wealth of
possibilities to solve cosmological tensions beyond Einstein's General
Relativity.

for matter to rest not only inside halos but also within cosmic voids and in

additional contributions (1Void, 2Void, Halo-Void, etc.) to the predictions of
correlation functions, spectra and profiles for both halos and voids. Whereas

Model extends those for void statistics and halo-void cross-correlations. We
provide recipes for all new ingredients of the Halo Void (Dust) Model, such as
the void abundance, linear bias and density profile and test their validity in

the transition between the 1Halo and the 2Halo terms by up to $\sim 6\%$. It
also eliminates the need to include low-mass structures on the normalization of
large-scale terms, suggesting that halos and voids are complementary cosmic

molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shear-rate dependence of the

existence of a distinct cross-over from Newtonian to non-Newtonian behavior

due to the decrease in the connectivity of the hydrogen-bond network. Moreover,
the shear thinning intensifies as the degree of supercooling increases, whereas

neighbor queries. Often, multimedia data are represented as a collection of
important high-dimensional feature vectors. Existing Locality Sensitive Hashing
(LSH) techniques require users to find top-k similar feature vectors for each
of the feature vectors that represent the query object. This leads to wasted
and redundant work due to two main reasons: 1) not all feature vectors may
contribute equally in finding the top-k similar multimedia objects, and 2)
feature vectors are treated independently during query processing.
Additionally, there is no theoretical guarantee on the returned multimedia
results. In this work, we propose a practical and efficient indexing approach
for finding top-k approximate nearest neighbors for multimedia data using LSH
called mmLSH, which can provide theoretical guarantees on the returned
multimedia results. Additionally, we present a buffer-conscious strategy to
speed up the query processing. Experimental evaluation shows significant gains
in performance time and accuracy for different real multimedia datasets when
compared against state-of-the-art LSH techniques.

socioeconomic position in childhood, young adulthood, and mid-life. However,
the vast majority of these studies are unable to quantify how these
associations vary over time and with respect to several demographic factors.
Varying coefficient (VC) models, which treat the covariate effects in a linear
model as nonparametric functions of additional effect modifiers, offer an
appealing way to overcome these limitations. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art VC
modeling methods require computationally prohibitive parameter tuning or make
restrictive assumptions about the functional form of the covariate effects.
  In response, we propose VCBART, which estimates the covariate effects in a VC
model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With simple default
hyperparameter settings, VCBART outperforms existing methods in terms of
covariate effect estimation and prediction. Using VCBART, we predict the
cognitive trajectories of 4,167 subjects from the Health and Retirement Study
using multiple measures of socioeconomic position and physical health. We find
that socioeconomic position in childhood and young adulthood have small effects
that do not vary with age. In contrast, the effects of measures of mid-life
physical health tend to vary with respect to age, race, and marital status. An

aggregates states according to a novel two-way consistency objective, adapting
classic state aggregation criteria to goal-conditioned RL: two states are
redundant when they are interchangeable both as goals and as starting states.
Theoretically, we prove that merging nodes according to two-way consistency
leads to an increase in shortest path lengths that scales only linearly with

Armstrong, and the third one between 5250 and 10300 Armstrong. From the
one-dimensional, time dependent spectra we constructed white and chromatic
light curves, the latter with typical integration band widths of ~200

taking into consideration WASP-76's companion. The resulting transmission
spectrum of WASP-76 b is dominated by a spectral slope of increasing opacity
towards shorter wavelengths of amplitude of about three scale heights under the
assumption of planetary equilibrium temperature. If the slope is caused by
Rayleigh scattering, we derive a lower limit to the temperature of ~870 K.
Following-up on previous detection of atomic sodium derived from high
resolution spectra, we re-analyzed HST data using narrower bands centered
around sodium. From an atmospheric retrieval of this transmission spectrum, we
report evidence of sodium at 2.9-sigma significance. In this case, the

$\sim$ 50 TeV, at the top of the atmosphere, produces more than 90\% of the
secondary particles registered at ground level, i.e., they are subject to solar
modulation. The modulation is consistent with at least two components: The
first is the modulation of the amplitude of the cosmic rays diurnal variation,
anti-correlated with the solar-wind speed. The second one occurs during the
high-speed stream (HSS), the baseline of the cosmic rays diurnal variation
train falls, following the time profile of the solar-wind speed inversely.

other premises, such as the latitude dependence on diurnal variation and the
inclusion of drift processes in the propagation of GCR, a semi-empirical
description of the modulation is possible to do, and it hereafter is called as

to the rapid development of deep learning and its widespread potential
applications. One key point to obtain good performance for the lip reading task
depends heavily on how effective the representation can be to capture the lip
movement information and meanwhile to resist the noises resulted from the
change of pose, lighting conditions, speaker's appearance and so on. Towards
this target, we propose to introduce the mutual information constraints on both
the local feature's level and the global sequence's level to enhance the
relations of the features with the speech content. On the one hand, we
constraint the features generated at each time step to enable them carry a
strong relation with the speech content by imposing the local mutual
information maximization constraint (LMIM), leading to improvements over the
model's ability to discover fine-grained lip movements and the fine-grained
differences among words with similar pronunciation, such as ``spend'' and
``spending''. On the other hand, we introduce the mutual information
maximization constraint on the global sequence's level (GMIM), to make the
model be able to pay more attention to discriminate key frames related with the
speech content, and less to various noises appeared in the speaking process. By
combining these two advantages together, the proposed method is expected to be
both discriminative and robust for effective lip reading. To verify this
method, we evaluate on two large-scale benchmark. We perform a detailed
analysis and comparison on several aspects, including the comparison of the
LMIM and GMIM with the baseline, the visualization of the learned
representation and so on. The results not only prove the effectiveness of the
proposed method but also report new state-of-the-art performance on both the
two benchmarks.

learning methods are interpretable by human. In general, deep neural networks
(DNNs) can provide accurate predictions, although it is difficult to interpret
why such predictions are obtained by DNNs. On the other hand, interpretation of
linear models is easy, although their predictive performance would be low since
real-world data is often intrinsically non-linear. To combine both the benefits
of the high predictive performance of DNNs and high interpretability of linear
models into a single model, we propose neural generators of sparse local linear
models (NGSLLs). The sparse local linear models have high flexibility as they
can approximate non-linear functions. The NGSLL generates sparse linear weights
for each sample using DNNs that take original representations of each sample
(e.g., word sequence) and their simplified representations (e.g., bag-of-words)
as input. By extracting features from the original representations, the weights
can contain rich information to achieve high predictive performance.
Additionally, the prediction is interpretable because it is obtained by the
inner product between the simplified representations and the sparse weights,
where only a small number of weights are selected by our gate module in the
NGSLL. In experiments with real-world datasets, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the NGSLL quantitatively and qualitatively by evaluating
prediction performance and visualizing generated weights on image and text
classification tasks.

  We also prove that every finitely differentiably generating set of capacities

infeasible. We present a simulation approach that models ultrasound propagation
in the human brain while it is moving due to the complex shear shock wave
deformation from a traumatic impact. Finite difference simulations can model
ultrasound propagation in complex media such as human tissue. Recently, we have
shown that a finite difference approach can be used to represent displacements
that are much smaller than the grid size, such as the motion encountered in
shear wave propagation from ultrasound elastography. However, this
subresolution displacement model, called impedance flow, was only implemented
and validated for acoustical media composed of randomly distributed scatterers.
Here we propose a generalization of the impedance flow method that describes
the continuous subresolution motion of structured acoustical maps, and in
particular of acoustical maps of the human brain. It is shown that the average
error in the subresolution displacement method is small compared to the
wavelength. The method is applied to acoustical maps of a moving human brain,
imposed by the propagation of a shear shock wave. Then the Fullwave simulation
tool is used to model transmit-receive imaging sequences based on an L7-4
imaging transducer. The simulated radiofrequency data is beamformed using a
conventional delay-and-sum method and a normalized cross-correlation method
designed for shock wave tracking is used to determine the tissue motion. It is
shown that the proposed generalized impedance flow method accurately captures
the shear shock wave motion. This method can lead to improvements in image
sequence design that takes into account the aberration and multiple reflections
from the brain and in the design of tracking algorithms that can more
accurately capture the complex brain motion that occurs during a traumatic
impact.

thought to provide insight into the complex spatially distributed interactions
in neural systems. In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring
during resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis
that the brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial
communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant
dynamics, characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are
universal in neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the
analysis of avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a
framework for using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is
unclear how the framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive
variability, whether across individuals and/or tasks. To address this, we
analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity of healthy humans during rest as well
as two distinct task conditions that varied in cognitive demands and produced
behavioral measures unique to each individual. In both rest and task conditions
we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate scale-invariant
characteristics, but differ in their specific features, demonstrating
individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized engagement, which
estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce high-amplitude bursts,
we also investigated regional features of avalanche dynamics. Normalized
engagement showed not only the expected individual and task dependent
variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual
behavior. Our findings expand our understanding of avalanche features and are
supportive of the emerging theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active
human brain operate close to a critical-like region and not a singular
critical-state.

available edge devices by using data- or model-parallelism methods is not an
effective solution. To benefit from available compute resources with low
communication overhead, we propose the first DNN parallelization method for
reducing the communication overhead in a distributed system. We propose a
low-communication parallelization (LCP) method in which models consist of
several almost-independent and narrow branches. LCP offers close-to-minimum
communication overhead with better distribution and parallelization
opportunities while significantly reducing memory footprint and computation
compared to data- and model-parallelism methods. We deploy LCP models on three

evaluate the performance of LCP models on a customized hardware (tailored for
low latency) implemented on a small edge FPGA and as a 16mW 0.107mm2 ASIC @7nm

represented as a collection of deformable parts, and each part is semantically
coherent across different instances of the same category (e.g., wings on birds
and wheels on cars). Therefore, by leveraging self-supervisedly learned part
segmentation of a large collection of category-specific images, we can
effectively enforce semantic consistency between the reconstructed meshes and
the original images. This significantly reduces ambiguities during joint
prediction of shape and camera pose of an object, along with texture. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to try and solve the single-view
reconstruction problem without a category-specific template mesh or semantic
keypoints. Thus our model can easily generalize to various object categories
without such labels, e.g., horses, penguins, etc. Through a variety of

demonstrate that our unsupervised method performs comparably if not better than

optimizing interventions retrospectively allows us a regulatory compliant
pathway to prospective clinical testing of the learned policies in a clinical
deployment. We focus on infections in intensive care units which are one of the
major causes of death and difficult to treat because of the complex and opaque
patient dynamics, and the clinically debated, highly-divergent set of
intervention policies required by each individual patient, yet intensive care
units are naturally data rich. In our work, we build on RL approaches in
healthcare (""AI Clinicians""), and learn off-policy continuous dosing policy of
pharmaceuticals for sepsis treatment using historical intensive care data under
partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). POMPDs capture uncertainty in patient state
better by taking in all historical information, yielding an efficient
representation, which we investigate through ablations. We compensate for the
lack of exploration in our retrospective data by evaluating each encountered
state with a best-first tree search. We mitigate state distributional shift by
optimizing our policy in the vicinity of the clinicians' compound policy.
Crucially, we evaluate our model recommendations using not only conventional
policy evaluations but a novel framework that incorporates human experts: a
model-agnostic pre-clinical evaluation method to estimate the accuracy and
uncertainty of clinician's decisions versus our system recommendations when
confronted with the same individual patient history (""shadow mode"").

sparse recovery approach for PDEs based on compressive sensing. CossIGA
assembles only a small portion of a suitable IGA Petrov-Galerkin discretization
and is effective whenever the PDE solution is sufficiently sparse or
compressible, i.e., when most of its coefficients are zero or negligible. The
sparsity of the solution is promoted by employing a multilevel dictionary of
B-splines as opposed to a basis. Thanks to sparsity and the fact that only a
fraction of the full discretization matrix is assembled, the proposed technique
has the potential to lead to significant computational savings. We show the
effectiveness of CossIGA for the solution of the 2D and 3D Poisson equation
over nontrivial geometries by means of an extensive numerical investigation.

optimally sort connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a multi-lane platoon

firstly discretized into a grid system, where a CAV moves from one cell to
another in the discrete time-space domain. Then, the cooperative sorting
problem is modeled as a path-finding problem in the graphic domain. The problem
is solved by the deterministic Astar algorithm with a stepwise strategy, where
only one vehicle can move within a movement step. The resultant shortest path
is further optimized with an integer linear programming algorithm to minimize
the sorting time by allowing multiple movements within a step. To improve the
algorithm running time and address multiple shortest paths, a distributed
stochastic Astar algorithm (DSA) is developed by introducing random
disturbances to the edge costs to break uniform paths (with equal path cost).
Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed DSA method. The results report shorter sorting time and significantly
improved algorithm running time due to the use of DSA. In addition, we find
that the optimization performance can be further improved by increasing the
number of processes in the distributed computing system.

complexity properties of the population model, which assumes $n$ anonymous,
computationally-bounded nodes, interacting at random, and attempting to jointly
compute global predicates. Significant work has gone towards investigating
majority and consensus dynamics in this model: assuming that each node is
initially in one of two states $X$ or $Y$, determine which state had higher
initial count.
  In this paper, we consider a natural generalization of majority/consensus,
which we call comparison. We are given two baseline states, $X_0$ and $Y_0$,
present in any initial configuration in fixed, possibly small counts.
Importantly, one of these states has higher count than the other: we will
assume $|X_0| \ge C |Y_0|$ for some constant $C$. The challenge is to design a
protocol which can quickly and reliably decide on which of the baseline states
$X_0$ and $Y_0$ has higher initial count.
  We propose a simple algorithm solving comparison: the baseline algorithm uses
$O(\log n)$ states per node, and converges in $O(\log n)$ (parallel) time, with
high probability, to a state where whole population votes on opinions $X$ or
$Y$ at rates proportional to initial $|X_0|$ vs. $|Y_0|$ concentrations. We
then describe how such output can be then used to solve comparison. The
algorithm is self-stabilizing, in the sense that it converges to the correct
decision even if the relative counts of baseline states $X_0$ and $Y_0$ change
dynamically during the execution, and leak-robust, in the sense that it can
withstand spurious faulty reactions. Our analysis relies on a new martingale
concentration result which relates the evolution of a population protocol to
its expected (steady-state) analysis, which should be broadly applicable in the
context of population protocols and opinion dynamics.

insulator is that, in the linear limit, it simultaneously supports two

edge soliton can bifurcate from a linear topological edge state. Such solitons
are unidirectional and are localized in both directions, along the interface

the existence of stable topological vector edge solitons. In our case, these

linear systems (MJLSs) with partial information, where the interdependency
arises as the transition of the mode of one system depends on the states of the
other system. First, we formulate a framework for the two interdependent MJLSs
to capture the interactions between various entities in the system, where the
modes of the system cannot be observed directly. Instead, a signal which
contains information of the modes can be obtained. Then, depending on the scope
of the available system state information (global or local), we design
centralized and distributed controllers, respectively, that can stochastically
stabilize the overall interdependent MJLS. In addition, the sufficient
stabilization conditions for the system under both types of information
structure are derived. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate
the effectiveness of the designed controllers.

preferences in high dimensions, this work presents LineCoSpar, a
human-in-the-loop preference-based framework that enables optimization over
many parameters by iteratively exploring one-dimensional subspaces.
Additionally, this work identifies gait attributes that characterize broader

verify that LineCoSpar is a sample-efficient approach for high-dimensional

nets as NSFnets. Analytical solutions and direct numerical simulation (DNS)
databases provide proper initial and boundary conditions for the NSFnet
simulations. The spatial and temporal coordinates are the inputs of the
NSFnets, while the instantaneous velocity and pressure fields are the outputs
for the VP-NSFnet, and the instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields are the
outputs for the VV-NSFnet. These two different forms of the Navier-Stokes

the loss function of the PINNs. No data is provided for the pressure to the
VP-NSFnet, which is a hidden state and is obtained via the incompressibility
constraint without splitting the equations. We obtain good accuracy of the
NSFnet simulation results upon convergence of the loss function, verifying that
NSFnets can effectively simulate complex incompressible flows using either the
VP or the VV formulations. We also perform a systematic study on the weights
used in the loss function for the data/physics components and investigate a new
way of computing the weights dynamically to accelerate training and enhance
accuracy. Our results suggest that the accuracy of NSFnets, for both laminar

battery management tasks, including charging control, state-of-charge

existing methods generally depend on cumbersome and time-consuming procedures
to extract battery parameters from data. Departing from the literature, this
paper sets the unique aim of identifying all the parameters offline in a
one-shot procedure, including the resistance and capacitance parameters and the
parameters in the parameterized function mapping from the state-of-charge to
the open-circuit voltage. Considering the well-known Thevenin's battery model,
the study begins with the parameter identifiability analysis, showing that all
the parameters are locally identifiable. Then, it formulates the parameter
identification problem in a prediction-error-minimization framework. As the
non-convexity intrinsic to the problem may lead to physically meaningless
estimates, two methods are developed to overcome this issue. The first one is
to constrain the parameter search within a reasonable space by setting
parameter bounds, and the other adopts regularization of the cost function
using prior parameter guess. The proposed identifiability analysis and
identification methods are extensively validated through simulations and
experiments.

optimizations at the compiler level are leveraged for inference accelerations
on devices. With the proposed framework, users could avoid the time-consuming
pruning process for non-experts and directly benefit from compressed models.

classification in a new domain, by adapting out-of-domain classifiers with
domain adaptation. Existing approaches often align different domains in a
single, global feature space (or view), which may fail to fully capture the
richness of the languages used for expressing stances, leading to reduced
adaptability on stance data. In this paper, we identify two major types of
stance expressions that are linguistically distinct, and we propose a tailored
dual-view adaptation network (DAN) to adapt these expressions across domains.
The proposed model first learns a separate view for domain transfer in each

These approaches perform well for the matching of isolated query images.
However, their evaluation over a trajectory is limited. In this paper, we
evaluate cross-view matching for the task of localizing a ground vehicle over a
longer trajectory. We treat these cross-view matches as sensor measurements
that are fused using a particle filter. We evaluate the performance of this
method using a city-wide dataset collected in a photorealistic simulation by
varying four parameters: height of aerial images, the pitch of the aerial

baselines in a clustering task to identify patients with different complex

stratify patients within a certain condition, ConvAE led to various clinically
relevant subtypes for different disorders, including type 2 diabetes,
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, largely related to comorbidities,
disease progression, and symptom severity. With these results, we demonstrate
that ConvAE can generate patient representations that lead to clinically

world is one of ``potentialities or possibilities'' and that the classical
realm is one of ``things or facts''. After ascertaining that his categories
most naturally have the structure of ontological equivalence classes, we show
that they cannot be seriously introduced into the quantum formalism without
rendering it incoherent, as under some circumstances the formalism permits an
equality between members of distinct equivalence classes. This is labeled the
`equality of inequivalents problem'. Three possible reactions are discussed:
First, one could deny the problem by challenging some of the assumptions that
underlie its formulation; second, one could accept the problem and take it to
be grounds for dismissing Heisenberg's or similar distinctions altogether;
third, one could accept the problem but take its source to be not Heisenberg's
distinction but the quantum formalism. A plausibility argument in support of
the third reaction is given by analogy: it is shown that axiomatic probability
suffers from a similar problem if one wishes to seriously distinguish between
things which are possibilities and things which are not. An enriched
axiomatization of probability is proposed which captures the concept of
probability as a measure over possibilities and thereby overcomes the equality
of inequivalents problem in axiomatic probability.

education and developing algorithms that enable robots to perform surgical
subtasks. To model anatomy, Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations have been
held as the gold standard for calculating accurate soft-tissue deformation.
Unfortunately, their accuracy is highly dependent on the simulation parameters,
which can be difficult to obtain.
  Methods In this work, we investigate how live data acquired during any
robotic endoscopic surgical procedure may be used to correct for inaccurate FEM
simulation results. Since FEMs are calculated from initial parameters and
cannot directly incorporate observations, we propose to add a correction factor
that accounts for the discrepancy between simulation and observations. We train
a network to predict this correction factor.
  Results To evaluate our method, we use an open-source da Vinci Surgical
System to probe a soft-tissue phantom and replay the interaction in simulation.
We train the network to correct for the difference between the predicted mesh
position and the measured point cloud. This results in 15-30% improvement in
the mean distance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across a
large range of simulation parameters.
  Conclusion We show a first step towards a framework that synergistically
combines the benefits of model-based simulation and real-time observations. It
corrects discrepancies between simulation and the scene that results from
inaccurate modeling parameters. This can provide a more accurate simulation
environment for surgeons and better data with which to train algorithms.

are too cold for water ice to generate an appreciable coma via sublimation.
Despite this, numerous high perihelion objects (HPOs) including many comets and
recently escaped Kuiper belt objects (``Centaurs'') are observed to be active
out at least to the orbit of Saturn ($q \sim$ 10 AU). Peak equilibrium
temperatures at 10 AU ($\sim$125 K), while far too low to sublimate water ice,
are sufficient to sublimate super-volatiles such as CO and CO$_2$ ice.
Temperatures at 10 AU are also high enough to trigger the rapid crystallization
of exposed amorphous ice, thus constituting another possible driver of distant
activity. While supervolatile ices can sublimate strongly (as $r_H^{-2}$) to at
least Kuiper belt (30 AU) distances, crystallization is an exponential function
of temperature that cannot be sustained much beyond $\sim$10 AU. The
heliocentric dependence of the activity thus suggests an observational test. If
activity in high perihelion objects is triggered by crystallization, then no
examples of activity should be found with perihelia $q >>$ 10 AU. If, on the
other hand, activity is due to free sublimation of exposed supervolatile ices,
or another cause, then distant activity might be detected. We obtained
sensitive, high resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations of HPOs to
search for activity beyond the crystallization zone. No examples of activity
were detected in 53 objects with $q >$ 15 AU, consistent with the
crystallization trigger hypothesis. However, sensitivity limits are such that
we cannot reject the alternative hypothesis that mass loss is driven by the
sublimation of supervolatile ices. We also searched for binary companions in
our sample, finding none and setting an empirical 3$\sigma$ limit to the binary

several advantages: they obey dihedral symmetry relations at all points, not

density and steeper pressure gradients, dust coagulation, fragmentation and
drift (to the vortex center) are all quite efficient, producing dust particles
ranging from micron to $\sim 1.0\ {\rm cm}$, as well as overall high
dust-to-gas ratio (above unity). In addition, the dust size distribution is
quite non-uniform inside the vortex, with the mass weighted average dust size
at the vortex center ($\sim 4.0$ mm) being a factor of $\sim10$ larger than
other vortex regions. Both large ($\sim$ mm) and small (tens of micron)
particles contribute strongly to affect the gas motion within the vortex. As
such, we find that the inclusion of dust coagulation has a significant impact
on the vortex lifetime and the typical vortex lifetime is about 1000 orbits.
After the initial gaseous vortex is destroyed, the dust spreads into a ring
with a few remaining smaller gaseous vortices with a high dust concentration

renormalization is an old school problem in this case, it has not yet been
completely done in position space. The most important difference with
well-known differential renormalization is that we do the whole procedure in
coordinate space without need to transformation to momentum space. Specially,
we directly derive the conterterms in real space. This problem becomes
important when the translational symmetry of the system breaks somehow
explicitly (for example by nontrivial boundary condition (BC) on the fields).
In this case, one is not able to move to momentum space by a simple Fourier
transformation. Therefore, in the context of renormalized perturbation theory,
by imposing the renormalization conditions, counterterms in coordinate space
will depend directly on the fields BCs (or background topology). Trivial BC or
trivial background lead to the usual standard conterterms. If the counterterms
modify then the quantum corrections of any physical quantity are different from
those in free space where we have the translational invariance. We also show
that, up to order $\alpha$, our counterterms are reduced to usual standard
terms derived in free space.

paper focuses on distinguishable observational signatures of torsion that could
not be otherwise explained with a scalar field in pseudo-Riemannian geometry.
We show that when torsion is present, the cosmic duality relation between the
angular diameter distance, $D_{\mathrm A}$, and the luminosity distance,
$D_{\mathrm L}$, is broken. We show how the deviation described by the
parameter $\eta = D_{\mathrm L}/[ D_{\mathrm A}(1+z)^2] -1 $ is linked to
torsion and how different forms of torsion lead to special-case
parametrisations of $\eta$, including $\eta_0 z$, $\eta_0 z/(1+z)$, and $\eta_0
\ln (1+z)$. We also show that the effects of torsion could be visible in
low-redshift data, inducing biases in supernovae-based $H_0$ measurements. We
also show that torsion can impact the Clarkson-Bassett-Lu (CBL) function ${\cal
C}(z) = 1 + H^2 (D D'' - D'^2) + H H' D D'$, where $D$ is the transverse
comoving distance. If $D$ is inferred from the luminosity distance, then, in
general non-zero torsion models, ${\cal C}(z) \ne 0$. For pseudo-Riemannian
geometry, the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric has ${\cal

  problems",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recovery of sparse generative models from few noisy measurements is an
important and challenging problem. Many deterministic algorithms rely on some
form of $\ell_1$-$\ell_2$ minimization to combine the computational convenience
of the $\ell_2$ penalty and the sparsity promotion of the $\ell_1$. It was
recently shown within the Bayesian framework that sparsity promotion and
computational efficiency can be attained with hierarchical models with
conditionally Gaussian priors and gamma hyperpriors. The related Gibbs energy
function is a convex functional and its minimizer, which is the MAP estimate of
the posterior, can be computed efficiently with the globally convergent
Iterated Alternating Sequential (IAS) algorithm \cite{CSS}. Generalization of
the hyperpriors for these sparsity promoting hierarchical models to generalized
gamma family yield either globally convex Gibbs energy functionals, or can
exhibit local convexity for some choices for the hyperparameters. \cite{CPrSS}.
The main problem in computing the MAP solution for greedy hyperpriors that
strongly promote sparsity is the presence of local minima. To overcome the
premature stopping at a spurious local minimizer, we propose two hybrid
algorithms that first exploit the global convergence associated with gamma
hyperpriors to arrive in a neighborhood of the unique minimizer, then adopt a
generalized gamma hyperprior that promote sparsity more strongly. The
performance of the two algorithms is illustrated with computed examples.

agent to sequentially inquire about symptoms for discriminating diseases.
However, since the dialogue records used to build a patient simulator are
collected passively, the data might be deteriorated by some task-unrelated
biases, such as the preference of the collectors. These biases might hinder the
diagnostic agent to capture transportable knowledge from the simulator. This
work attempts to address these critical issues in MDA by taking advantage of
the causal diagram to identify and resolve two representative non-causal
biases, i.e., (i) default-answer bias and (ii) distributional inquiry bias.
Specifically, Bias (i) originates from the patient simulator which tries to
answer the unrecorded inquiries with some biased default answers. Consequently,
the diagnostic agents cannot fully demonstrate their advantages due to the
biased answers. To eliminate this bias and inspired by the propensity score
matching technique with causal diagram, we propose a propensity-based patient
simulator to effectively answer unrecorded inquiry by drawing knowledge from
the other records; Bias (ii) inherently comes along with the passively
collected data, and is one of the key obstacles for training the agent towards
""learning how"" rather than ""remembering what"". For example, within the
distribution of training data, if a symptom is highly coupled with a certain
disease, the agent might learn to only inquire about that symptom to
discriminate that disease, thus might not generalize to the out-of-distribution
cases. To this end, we propose a progressive assurance agent, which includes
the dual processes accounting for symptom inquiry and disease diagnosis
respectively. The inquiry process is driven by the diagnosis process in a
top-down manner to inquire about symptoms for enhancing diagnostic confidence.

assessing the occurrence times of vertices or faces; degenerate faces can be
removed according to the outer product of two edges; since isolated vertices do
not appear in any face vertices, they can be deleted directly;
self-intersecting faces are detected using an AABB tree and remeshed afterward;
by simulating whether multiple random rays that shoot from a face can reach

rather fast due to D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation. The latter arises from
spin-orbit coupling, which induces wave-vector-dependent spin rotations that,
in conjunction with random disorder scattering, generate spin decoherence.
However, symmetries occurring under certain conditions can prevent the
relaxation of particular homogeneous and inhomogeneous spin textures. The
inhomogeneous spin texture, termed as persistent spin helix, is especially
appealing as it enables us to manipulate the spin orientation while retaining a
long spin lifetime. Recently, it was predicted that such symmetries can be
realized in zinc-blende two-dimensional electron gases if at least two
growth-direction Miller indices agree in modulus and the coefficients of the
Rashba and linear Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings are suitably matched [PRL
117, 236801 (2016)]. In the present paper, we systematically analyze the impact
of the symmetry-breaking cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which
generically coexists in these systems, on the stability of the emerging spin
helices with respect to the growth direction. We find that, as an interplay
between orientation and strength of the effective magnetic field induced by the
cubic Dresselhaus terms, the spin relaxation is weakest for a low-symmetry
growth direction that can be well approximated by a [225] lattice vector. These
quantum wells yield a 30\% spin-helix lifetime enhancement compared to
[001]-oriented electron gases and, remarkably, require a negligible Rashba
coefficient. The rotation axis of the corresponding spin helix is only slightly
tilted out of the quantum-well plane. This makes the experimental study of the
spin-helix dynamics readily accessible for conventional optical spin
orientation measurements where spins are excited and detected along the
quantum-well growth direction.

vorticity within the medium by means of a vertex coupling quarks and thermal
gluons that, for a uniform temperature, is proportional to the global angular
velocity and inversely proportional to the temperature. We use realistic
estimates for the angular velocities for different collision energies and show
that the effect of the quark mass is to reduce the relaxation times as compared
to the massless quark case. Using these relaxation times we estimate the
intrinsic quark and antiquark polarizations produced by the thermal vorticity.
We conclude by pointing out that, in spite of the former being larger than the

parameterizations often cause dramatic instability when coupled to atmospheric
fluid dynamics. This paper introduces tools for interpreting their behavior
that are customized to the parameterization task. First, we assess the
nonlinear sensitivity of a neural network to lower-tropospheric stability and
the mid-tropospheric moisture, two widely-studied controls of moist convection.
Second, we couple the linearized response functions of these neural networks to
simplified gravity-wave dynamics, and analytically diagnose the corresponding
phase speeds, growth rates, wavelengths, and spatial structures. To demonstrate
their versatility, these techniques are tested on two sets of neural networks,
one trained with a super-parametrized version of the Community Atmosphere Model

though the SPCAM simulation has a warmer climate than the cloud-resolving
model, both neural networks predict stronger heating/drying in moist and
unstable environments, which is consistent with observations. Moreover, the
spectral analysis can predict that instability occurs when GCMs are coupled to
networks that support gravity waves that are unstable and have phase speeds
larger than 5 m/s. In contrast, standing unstable modes do not cause
catastrophic instability. Using these tools, differences between the SPCAM- vs.
GCRM- trained neural networks are analyzed, and strategies to incrementally

protocol to enable a client to employ some relaying full nodes (e.g. two or
one) to read the blockchain. The protocol is ""generic"", i.e., it can be
deployed disregarding the underlying consensuses, and also ""superlight"", i.e.,
the computational cost of the light client to predicate the (non)existence of a
transaction in the blockchain becomes a small constant. Since our protocol
resolves a fundamental challenge of broadening the usage of blockchain
technology, it captures a wide variety of important use-cases such as
multi-chain wallets, DApp browsers and more.

investigate the electronic structures, topological phase transition (TPT) and
topological properties of layered magnetic compound MnSb2Te4. It has the
similar crystal and magnetic structure as the magnetic topological insulator
MnBi2Te4. We find that when the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered, the
band structure of MnSb2Te4 in antiferromagnetic (AFM) state has no band
inversion at {\Gamma}. This is due to the SOC strength of Sb is less than that
of Bi. The band inversion can be realized by increasing the SOC of Sb by 0.3
times, which drives MnSb2Te4 from a trivial AFM insulator to an AFM topological
insulator (TI) or axion insulator. Uniaxial compressive strain along the layer
stacking direction is another way to control the band inversion. The interlayer
distance shorten by 5% is needed to drive the similar TPT. For the
ferromagnetic (FM) MnSb2Te4 with experimental crystal structure, it is a normal
FM insulator. The band inversion can happen when SOC is enhanced by 0.1 times
or the interlayer distance is decreased by more than 1%. Thus, FM MnSb2Te4 can
be tuned to be the simplest type-I Weyl semimetal with only one pair of Weyl
nodes on the three-fold rotational axis. These two Weyl nodes are projected
onto (1-10) surface with one Fermi arc connecting them.

costs $O(1)$ time each step for sampling from equilibrium distributions (Gibbs

We decompose the interacting potential into two parts, one is of long range but
is smooth, and the other one is of short range but may be singular. To displace
a particle, we first evolve a selected particle using the stochastic
differential equation (SDE) under the smooth part with the idea of random
batches, as commonly used in stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. Then, we
use the short range part to do a Metropolis rejection. Different from the
classical Langevin dynamics, we only run the SDE dynamics with random batch for
a short duration of time so that the cost in the first step is $O(p)$, where
$p$ is the batch size. The cost of the rejection step is $O(1)$ since the
interaction used is of short range. We justify the proposed random-batch Monte
Carlo method, which combines the random batch and splitting strategies, both in
theory and with numerical experiments. While giving comparable results for
typical examples of the Dyson Brownian motion and Lennard-Jones fluids, our
method can save more time when compared to the classical Metropolis-Hastings

significantly improves upon all known algorithms. This algorithm is applicable
to all NP-complete problems. Moreover, the algorithm has memory complexity
$M=O(C_n^k)$, which makes our algorithm applicable to real-world problems. At
first, we show how to use the algorithm for small dimensions $m=4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8$.
After that we establish a general methodology for $m>8$. The main idea is to
split the original set $X_n$ (the algorithm becomes even faster with sorted

a kink. This kind of systems will be realized on the surface of topological
insulators where Dirac fermions exist. The fermion number is fractionalized and
this is related to the presence of fermion zero-energy excitation modes. A
zero-energy mode can be regarded as a Majorana fermion mode when the chemical
potential vanishes. Our discussion includes the case where there is a half-flux
quantum vortex associated with a kink in a magnetic field in a bilayer

introduce an auxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of
targeted VQA model, and achieve dominating performance on VQA-CP. However,
since the complexity of design, current methods are unable to equip the
ensemble-based models with two indispensable characteristics of an ideal VQA
model: 1) visual-explainable: the model should rely on the right visual regions
when making decisions. 2) question-sensitive: the model should be sensitive to
the linguistic variations in question. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) training scheme. The CSS generates
numerous counterfactual training samples by masking critical objects in images
or words in questions, and assigning different ground-truth answers. After
training with the complementary samples (ie, the original and generated
samples), the VQA models are forced to focus on all critical objects and words,
which significantly improves both visual-explainable and question-sensitive
abilities. In return, the performance of these models is further boosted.
Extensive ablations have shown the effectiveness of CSS. Particularly, by
building on top of the model LMH, we achieve a record-breaking performance of
58.95% on VQA-CP v2, with 6.5% gains.

has widely spread across the whole field of computer vision for their powerful

sensing image change detection problem with deep learning techniques. We
firstly propose an end-to-end dual-branch architecture, termed as the W-Net,
with each branch taking as input one of the two bi-temporal images as in the
traditional change detection models. In this way, CNN features with more
powerful representative abilities can be obtained to boost the final detection
performance. Also, W-Net performs differencing in the feature domain rather
than in the traditional image domain, which greatly alleviates loss of useful
information for determining the changes. Furthermore, by reformulating change
detection as an image translation problem, we apply the recently popular
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in which our W-Net serves as the
Generator, leading to a new GAN architecture for change detection which we call
CDGAN. To train our networks and also facilitate future research, we construct
a large scale dataset by collecting images from Google Earth and provide
carefully manually annotated ground truths. Experiments show that our proposed

addition, these GW events can be treated as the standard sirens to constrain

networks for identifying the SBBHs' host galaxy groups, rather than their host

matter halos for measuring the cosmological parameters. In our analysis, the
group catalog of SDSS DR7 with redshift $z\in(0.01,0.1)$ is considered as an

that all five detectors in the network are in lock 100\% of the time. For the
3G detector network, this number becomes $(3.9-40.0)$ yr$^{-1}$. We also
investigate the potential constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ by these GW

galaxy groups. We find that, by five-year's full time observations, 2G detector

of the flow is determined by interaction of vortices arising at the nonlinear
stage of the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability development and by turbulent
friction. In the framework of the shallow water theory and a three-layer
representation of the flow, one-dimensional models of a mixing layer are
proposed. The obtained equations allow one to determine averaged boundaries of
the region of intense fluid mixing. Stationary solutions of the governing
equations are constructed and analysed. Using the averaged flow characteristics
obtained by one-dimensional equations, a hyperbolic system for determining the
velocity profile and Reynolds shear stress across the mixing layer is derived.
Comparison with the experimental results of the evolution of turbulent jet

velocity-integrated-intensity ratios of HCN/CO and HCO$^+$/CO) and the ratio
$R_\text{31}$ (CO 3-2/1-0) decline towards larger galactocentric distances, but
increase with higher SFR surface density. The radial variation and the large

conditions in different regions of the galactic disc. The relationships of
$f_\text{dense}$ versus $\Sigma_\text{stellar}$, and SFE$_\text{dense}$ versus

$\Sigma_\text{stellar}$ in this galaxy, which is inconsistent with previous

might have different effects on the high-$J$ HCN and HCO$^+$ than their low-$J$

higher $f_\text{dense}$, which is consistent with previous works, and it
suggests that the ability of the dense gas to form stars diminishes when the

involves a double loop: a loop for amino acid sequence changes and a loop for
an exhaustive conformational search for each amino acid sequence. Herein, we
propose a novel statistical mechanical design method using Bayesian learning,
which can design lattice proteins without the exhaustive conformational search.
We consider a thermodynamic hypothesis of the evolution of proteins and apply
it to the prior distribution of amino acid sequences. Furthermore, we take the
water effect into account in view of the grand canonical picture. As a result,
on applying the 2D lattice hydrophobic-polar (HP) model, our design method
successfully finds an amino acid sequence for which the target conformation has
a unique ground state. However, the performance was not as good for the 3D
lattice HP models compared to the 2D models. The performance of the 3D model
improves on using a 20-letter lattice proteins. Furthermore, we find a strong
linearity between the chemical potential of water and the number of surface
residues, thereby revealing the relationship between protein structure and the
effect of water molecules. The advantage of our method is that it greatly
reduces computation time, because it does not require long calculations for the
partition function corresponding to an exhaustive conformational search. As our
method uses a general form of Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics and
is not limited to lattice proteins, the results presented here elucidate some
heuristics used successfully in previous protein design methods.

investigated magnetically using dc and ac magnetic susceptibility. The dc
magnetic susceptibility does not exhibit any long-range ordering down to 1.8 K
and the negative value of Curie Constant (~ - 4 K) indicate the dominance of
antiferromagnetic interactions between the Dy (III) spins. Ac susceptibility
exhibits absence of single molecular magnet behavior at zero dc magnetic field
and shows signal of quantum tunneling magnetization (QTM) below 8 K. However,
on the superimposition of dc magnetic field (3 kOe), frequency dependent
relaxation peak emerged at T_f = 5 K and QTM signal suppress at higher fields.
The intermediate value of Mydosh parameter calculated from the shift in peak
position (T_f) in ac susceptibility reflects the formation of superparamagnetic
state. Further, the temperature dependence of Tf is analyzed with Arrhenius and
Cole-Cole plot. The magnetic susceptibility analysis yields characteristics
pre-relaxation factor 1.40x10^(-12) sec and energy barrier {\Delta}E/k_B = 93.4
K, indicating the slow spin relaxation. The Cole-Cole fit to the ac
susceptibility data shows further evidence for the single ion spin relaxation.
Thus, the magnetic measurements support the single-molecule magnet behavior in
Dy-CP under the application of dc magnetic field.

long way. Concretely, we offer a solution that can provide approximate answers
to aggregate queries, relying on Machine Learning (ML), which is able to work
alongside Cloud systems. Our developed lightweight ML-led system can be stored
on an analyst's local machine or deployed as a service to instantly answer
analytic queries, having low response times and monetary/computational costs
and energy footprint. To accomplish this we leverage the knowledge obtained by
previously answered queries and build ML models that can estimate the result of
new queries in an efficient and inexpensive manner. The capabilities of our
system are demonstrated using extensive evaluation with both real and synthetic

Galactic Centre using the ANTARES and IceCube neutrino telescopes. For dark
matter particles with masses from 50 to 1000 GeV, the sensitivities on the
self-annihilation cross section set by ANTARES and IceCube are comparable,
making this mass range particularly interesting for a joint analysis. Dark
matter self-annihilation through the $\tau^+\tau^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $b\bar{b}$
and $W^+W^-$ channels is considered for both the Navarro-Frenk-White and
Burkert halo profiles. In the combination of 2,101.6 days of ANTARES data and
1,007 days of IceCube data, no excess over the expected background is observed.
Limits on the thermally-averaged dark matter annihilation cross section
$\langle\sigma_A\upsilon\rangle$ are set. These limits present an improvement
of up to a factor of two in the studied dark matter mass range with respect to
the individual limits published by both collaborations. When considering dark
matter particles with a mass of 200 GeV annihilating through the $\tau^+\tau^-$
channel, the value obtained for the limit is $7.44 \times 10^{-24}
\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}$ for the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile. For the
purpose of this joint analysis, the model parameters and the likelihood are
unified, providing a benchmark for forthcoming dark matter searches performed
by neutrino telescopes.

electronic correlations in quantum matter. This ordered many-body state
rigorously organizes electrons at zero temperature in progressively higher
momentum states, up to the Fermi surface. As such, it displays rigidity against
perturbations. Such rigidity generates Fermi-surface resonances which manifest
as longitudinal and transverse collective modes. Although these Fermi-liquid
collective modes have been analyzed and observed in electrically neutral liquid
helium, they remain unexplored in charged solid-state systems up to date. In
this paper I analyze the transverse shear response of charged three-dimensional
Fermi liquids as a function of temperature, excitation frequency and momentum,
for interactions expressed in terms of the first symmetric Landau parameter. I
consider the effect of momentum-conserving quasiparticle collisions and
momentum-relaxing scattering in relaxation-time approximation on the coupling
between photons and Fermi-surface collective modes, thus deriving the
Fermi-liquid optical conductivity and dielectric function. In the
high-frequency, long-wavelength excitation regime the electrodynamic response
entails two coherent and frequency-degenerate polaritons, and its spatial
nonlocality is encoded by a frequency- and interaction-dependent generalized
shear modulus; in the opposite high-momentum low-frequency regime anomalous
skin effect takes place. I identify observable signatures of propagating shear
collective modes in optical spectroscopy experiments, with applications to the
surface impedance and the optical transmission of thin films.

environments and estimate their own state. Traditional depth estimation
methods, like structure from motion and stereo vision matching, are built on
feature correspondences of multiple viewpoints. Meanwhile, the predicted depth
maps are sparse. Inferring depth information from a single image (monocular
depth estimation) is an ill-posed problem. With the rapid development of deep
neural networks, monocular depth estimation based on deep learning has been
widely studied recently and achieved promising performance in accuracy.
Meanwhile, dense depth maps are estimated from single images by deep neural
networks in an end-to-end manner. In order to improve the accuracy of depth
estimation, different kinds of network frameworks, loss functions and training
strategies are proposed subsequently. Therefore, we survey the current
monocular depth estimation methods based on deep learning in this review.
Initially, we conclude several widely used datasets and evaluation indicators
in deep learning-based depth estimation. Furthermore, we review some
representative existing methods according to different training manners:
supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. Finally, we discuss the
challenges and provide some ideas for future researches in monocular depth
estimation.

framework that yields fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for
problems in this family that meet certain conditions. We use our framework to
design explicit FPTASs for two such problems, namely Two-Set Subset-Sum Ratio
and Factor-$r$ Subset-Sum Ratio, with running time
$\mathcal{O}(n^4/\varepsilon)$, which coincides with the best known running

element between linearly-polarized deuteron states, and it could be
investigated in proton-deuteron collisions in addition to lepton-deuteron
scattering. The linear polarization of photon is often used, whereas it is
rarely used for the spin-1 deuteron. Therefore, it is desirable to express
deuteron-reaction cross sections in term of conventional deuteron spin
polarizations for actual experimental measurements. In this work, we
investigate how proton-deuteron Drell-Yan cross sections are expressed by the
conventional polarizations for finding the gluon transversity distribution. In
particular, we show that the gluon transversity can be measured in the
proton-deuteron Drell-Yan process by taking the cross-section difference
between the deuteron spin polarizations along the two-transverse axes. Since
the gluon transversity does not exist for the spin-1/2 nucleons, a finite gluon
transversity of the deuteron could indicate an ""exotic"" mechanism beyond the
simple bound system of the nucleons in the deuteron. Therefore, the gluon
transversity is an interesting and appropriate observable to shed light on a
new hadronic mechanism in nuclei.

outperforms GGA, and the latter is better than LDA. This discovery indicates
the possibility and necessity to include higher-order density derivatives

assuming small deformations. Although deterministic linear poroelasticity
models and finite element methods for solving them numerically have been well
studied, there is little work to date on robust algorithms for solving
poroelasticity models with uncertain inputs and for performing uncertainty

establish that the weak solution is stable with respect to variations in key

coincide at a first-order liquid-liquid transition (LLT). In this work, the
relevant pressure-temperature conditions are thoroughly explored with
first-principles molecular dynamics. We show there is a large dependency on
exchange-correlation functional and significant finite size effects. We use
hysteresis in a number of measurable quantities to demonstrate a first-order
transition up to a critical point, above which molecular and atomic liquids are
indistinguishable. At higher temperature beyond the critical point,
H2-dissociation becomes a smooth cross-over in the supercritical region that
can be modelled by a pseudo-transition, where the H2-2H transformation is
localized and does not cause a density discontinuity at metallization.
Thermodynamic anomalies and counter-intuitive transport behavior of protons are
also discovered even far beyond the critical point, making this dissociative
transition highly relevant to the interior dynamics of Jovian planets. Below
the critical point, simulation also reveals a dynamic H2-2H chemical
equilibrium with rapid interconversion, showing that H2 and H are miscible. The
predicted critical temperature lies well below the ionization temperature. Our
calculations unequivocally demonstrate that there are three distinct regimes in
the liquid-liquid transition of warm dense hydrogen.

The process of autofocusing is the main influence of the performance of WSI.
Traditional autofocusing methods either are time-consuming due to repetitive

to current WSI systems. In this paper, we propose the concept of
\textit{virtual autofocusing}, which does not rely on mechanical adjustment to
conduct refocusing but instead recovers in-focus images in an offline

two-shot imaging, in contrast traditional methods commonly need to conduct as
many as 21 times image shooting in each tile scanning. Considering that the two
captured out-of-focus images retain pieces of partial information about the
underlying in-focus image, we propose a U-Net-inspired deep neural network
based approach for fusing them into a recovered in-focus image. The proposed
scheme is fast in tissue slides scanning, enabling a high-throughput generation
of digital pathology images. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme
achieves satisfactory refocusing performance.

from a multi-antenna base station (BS). Nevertheless, in the actual network
operation, the IRS operator can be selfish or have its own objectives due to
competing/limited resources as well as deployment/maintenance cost. Therefore,
in this paper, we develop a Stackelbeg game model to analyze the interaction

equation can be written in reduced variables as a Mathieu equation for which
numerically-exact solutions for the band structure and wave functions are
obtained. The band structure has band gaps that increase with increasing
amplitude q of the cosine potential. In the extended-zone scheme, the energy
gaps decrease with increasing index n of the Brillouin-zone boundary ka = n pi
where k is the crystal momentum of the electron. The wave functions at the
bottoms and tops of the bands are found to be real or imaginary, respectively,
corresponding to standing waves at these energies. Irrespective of the wave
vector k within the first Brillouin zone, the electron probability density is
found to be periodic with the lattice. The Fourier components of the wave
functions are derived versus q, which reveal multiple reciprocal-lattice-vector
components with variable amplitudes in the wave functions unless q = 0. The
magnitudes of the Fourier components are found to decrease exponentially as a
power of n for n ~ 3 to 45 for ka = pi/2 and q = 2 and a precise fit is
obtained to the data. The probability densities and probability currents
obtained from the wave functions are also discussed. The probability currents
are found to be zero for crystal momenta at the tops and bottoms of the energy

labeled source-domain dataset to an unlabeled target-domain dataset. The task
of UDA on open-set person re-identification (re-ID) is even more challenging as
the identities (classes) do not have overlap between the two domains. One major
research direction was based on domain translation, which, however, has fallen
out of favor in recent years due to inferior performance compared to
pseudo-label-based methods. We argue that the domain translation has great
potential on exploiting the valuable source-domain data but existing methods
did not provide proper regularization on the translation process. Specifically,
previous methods only focus on maintaining the identities of the translated
images while ignoring the inter-sample relations during translation. To tackle
the challenges, we propose an end-to-end structured domain adaptation framework
with an online relation-consistency regularization term. During training, the
person feature encoder is optimized to model inter-sample relations on-the-fly
for supervising relation-consistency domain translation, which in turn,
improves the encoder with informative translated images. The encoder can be
further improved with pseudo labels, where the source-to-target translated
images with ground-truth identities and target-domain images with pseudo
identities are jointly used for training. In the experiments, our proposed
framework is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple UDA
tasks of person re-ID. With the synthetic-to-real translated images from our
structured domain-translation network, we achieved second place in the Visual
Domain Adaptation Challenge (VisDA) in 2020.

efficient, however, this comes with increased computational cost. Recently, a
Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) method has been proposed which exploits
models of different granularity. The prediction over the control horizon is
split into short-term predictions with a detailed model using MPC and long-term
predictions with a coarse model using RMPC. In many applications robustness is
required for the short-term future, but in the long-term future, subject to
major uncertainty and potential modeling difficulties, robust planning can lead
to highly conservative solutions. We therefore propose combining RMPC on a
detailed model for short-term predictions and Stochastic MPC (SMPC), with
chance constraints, on a simplified model for long-term predictions. This
yields decreased computational effort due to a simple model for long-term
predictions, and less conservative solutions, as robustness is only required
for short-term predictions. The effectiveness of the method is shown in a
mobile robot collision avoidance simulation.

at different tag times for identification, the method focuses on imposing
appropriate structural constraints on the linear time-invariant (LTI)
reformulation of LTP systems. This method adopts a periodically-switched
truncated infinite impulse response model for LTP systems, where the structural
constraints are interpreted as the requirement to place the poles of the
non-truncated models at the same locations for all sub-models. This constraint
is imposed by combining the atomic norm regularization framework for LTI
systems with the group lasso technique in regression. As a result, the
estimated system is both uniform and low-order, which is hard to achieve with
other existing estimators. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the grouped atomic
norm method does not only show better results compared to other regularized
methods, but also outperforms the subspace identification method under high
noise levels in terms of model fitting.

of combustion pulses, the soliton-like interactions between these combustion
fronts, and the fundamental, underlying Hopf bifurcation to time-periodic
modulation of the waves. In this framework, the mode-locked structures are
classified as autosolitons, or stably-propagating nonlinear waves where the
local physics of nonlinearity, dispersion, gain, and dissipation exactly
balance. We find that the global dominant balance physics in the RDE combustion
chamber are dissipative and multi-scale in nature, with local fast scale (nano-
to microseconds) combustion balances generating the fundamental mode-locked
autosoliton state, while slow scale (milliseconds) gain-loss balances determine
the instabilities and structure of the total number of autosolitons. In this
manner, the global multi-scale balance physics give rise to the stable
structures - not exclusively the frontal dynamics prescribed by classical
detonation theory. Experimental observations and numerical models of the RDE
combustion chamber are in strong qualitative agreement with no parameter
tuning. Moreover, numerical continuation (computational bifurcation tracking)
of the RDE analog system establishes that a Hopf bifurcation of the steadily
propagating pulse train leads to the fundamental instability of the RDE, or
time-periodic modulation of the waves. Along branches of Hopf orbits in
parameter space exist a continuum of wave-pair interactions that exhibit
solitonic interactions of varying strength.

In
this problem, there are multiple agents in the system, and each agent only

compute a common minimum of the aggregate of all their local cost functions. In
principle, this problem is solvable using a distributed variant of the
traditional gradient-descent method, which is an iterative method. However, the
speed of convergence of the traditional gradient-descent method is highly

Specifically, the method requires a large number of iterations to converge to a

  In this paper, we propose an iterative pre-conditioning approach that can
significantly attenuate the influence of the problem's conditioning on the
convergence-speed of the gradient-descent method. The proposed pre-conditioning

subset $S_t\subseteq [n]$ of sellers to the arriving buyer at time $t$ to
maximize the expected revenue derived over the entire horizon while respecting
the inventory constraints. Given an assortment $S_t$ at time $t$, it is assumed
that the buyer will select an item from $S_t$ based on the well-known
multinomial logit model, a well-justified choice model from the economic
literature. In this model, the revenue obtained from selling an item $i$ at a

we devise a constant competitive algorithm for the online assortment problem

heterogeneous buyers does not admit a constant competitive algorithm. To
compensate for that issue, we then consider the assortment problem under an
offline setting with heterogeneous buyers. Under a mild market consistency
assumption, we show that the generalized Bertrand game admits a pure Nash
equilibrium over general buyer-seller bipartite graphs. Finally, we develop an
$O(\ln m)$-approximation algorithm for optimal market segmentation of the
generalized Bertrand game which allows the platform to derive higher revenues

constrained economic dispatch (SCED). Prior work has shown that FDI attacks can
be designed via an attacker-defender bi-level linear program (ADBLP) to cause
physical overflows after re-dispatch using DCOPF. In this paper, it is shown
that attacks designed using DCOPF fail to cause overflows on $N-1$ reliable
systems because the system response modeled is inaccurate. An ADBLP that
accurately models the system response is proposed to find the worst-case
physical consequences, thereby modeling a strong attacker with system level
knowledge. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas system with 2000 buses
show that even with the new enhanced attacks, for systems operated
conservatively due to $N-1$ constraints, the designed attacks only lead to
post-contingency overflows. Moreover, the attacker must control a large portion
of measurements and physically create a contingency in the system to cause
consequences. Therefore, it is conceivable but requires an extremely
sophisticated attacker to cause physical consequences on $N-1$ reliable power
systems operated with RTCA and SCED.

different architectures and compared their performance with a handcrafted
feature-based machine learning approach. Support vector machine (SVM) was used
as classifier and Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) was used as feature for
handcrafted feature-based machine learning. 3D CNN models with sequential
architecture, inception module and residual module were trained from scratch.
CNN models achieved higher cross-validation accuracy than handcrafted
feature-based machine learning. Moreover, testing on an independent dataset, 3D
CNN models greatly outperformed handcrafted feature-based machine learning.
This study underscored the potential of CNN for identifying patients with
schizophrenia using 3D brain MR images and paved the way for imaging-based
individual-level diagnosis and prognosis in psychiatric disorders.

categorization of plasma data between different regions of the magnetosphere
and identification of the boundary regions between them. Without computerized
automation this means sorting large amounts of data to hand-pick regions. Using
hand-labeled data created to support calibration of the Fast Plasma Instrument,
this task was automated for the MMS mission with 99.9% accuracy. The method
partitions the number density and ion temperature plane into sub-planes for
each region, fitting boundaries between the sub-planes using a machine learning
technique known as the support vector machine. This method presented in this
paper is novel because it offers both statistical automation power and
interpretability that yields scientific insight into how the task is performed.

active users, paying active users and inactive users. A State Space time series
approach is then used to model the daily conversion rates between the different
groups, i.e., the probability of transitioning from one group to another. This
allows, not only for predictions on how these rates are to evolve, but also for
a deeper understanding of the impact that in-game planning and calendar effects
have. It is also used in this work for the detection of marketing and promotion
campaigns about which no information is available. In particular, two different
State Space formulations are considered and compared: an Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average process and an Unobserved Components approach, in
both cases with a linear regression to explanatory variables. Both yield very
close estimations for covariate parameters, producing forecasts with similar
performances for most transition rates. While the Unobserved Components
approach is more robust and needs less human intervention in regards to model
definition, it produces significantly worse forecasts for non-paying user
abandonment probability. More critically, it also fails to detect a plausible
marketing and promotion campaign scenario.

fluid dynamic simulations, machine learning methods have been introduced to
flow dynamic simulations in recent years. However, most of studies focus mainly
on existing fluid fields learning, the prediction of spatio-temporal nonlinear
fluid flows in varying parameterized space has been neglected. In this work, we
propose a hybrid deep adversarial autoencoder (DAA) to integrate generative
adversarial network (GAN) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for predicting
parameterized nonlinear fluid flows in spatial and temporal space.
High-dimensional inputs are compressed into the low-representation
representations by nonlinear functions in a convolutional encoder. In this way,
the predictive fluid flows reconstructed in a convolutional decoder contain the
dynamic flow physics of high nonlinearity and chaotic nature. In addition, the
low-representation representations are applied into the adversarial network for
model training and parameter optimization, which enables a fast computation
process. The capability of the hybrid DAA is demonstrated by varying inputs on
a water collapse example. Numerical results show that this hybrid DAA has
successfully captured the spatio-temporal flow features with CPU speed-up of
three orders of magnitude. Promising results suggests that the hybrid DAA can
play a critical role in efficiently and accurately predicting complex flows in
future.

S\'er., 1979] and B\'enilan & Crandall [Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1981], it is
well-known that first-order evolution problems governed by a nonlinear but
homogeneous operator admit the smoothing effect that every corresponding mild
solution is Lipschitz continuous at every positive time. Moreover, if the
underlying Banach space has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property, then these mild
solution is a.e. differentiable, and the time-derivative satisfies global and
point-wise bounds.
  In this paper, we show that these results remain true if the homogeneous
operator is perturbed by a Lipschitz continuous mapping. More precisely, we
establish global $L^1$ Aronson-B\'enilan type estimates and point-wise
Aronson-B\'enilan type estimates. We apply our theory to derive global
$L^q$-$L^{\infty}$-estimates on the time-derivative of the perturbed diffusion
problem governed by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator associated with the
$p$-Laplace-Beltrami operator and lower-order terms on a compact Riemannian
manifold with a Lipschitz boundary.

that produces bits according to some unknown computable distribution on the

suggested to use universal semimeasure $m$ for solving this task. He proved
that for every computable distribution $P$ and for every $b \in \{0,1\}$ the
following holds: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{x: l(x)=n} P(x) (P(b | x) - m(b |

Solomonoff theorem for our way of prediction. Also we show that our method of
prediction has no that negative aspect as Solomonoff's method.
