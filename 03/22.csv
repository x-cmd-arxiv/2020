applications in different scientific disciplines, e.g., chemistry, material
science, soil science, and biomedical engineering. The mathematical challenge
in these type of model systems is to match the solutions of the time-dependent
diffusion equation in each layer, such that the boundary conditions at the
interfaces between them are satisfied. As the number of layers increases, the
solutions may become increasingly complicated. Here, we describe an alternative
computational approach to multi-layer diffusion problems, which is based on the
description of the overdamped Brownian motion of particles via the underdamped
Langevin equation. In this approach, the probability distribution function is
computed from the statistics of an ensemble of independent single particle
trajectories. To allow for simulations of Langevin dynamics in layered systems,
the numerical integrator must be supplemented with algorithms for the
transitions across the discontinuous interfaces. Algorithms for three common
types of discontinuities are presented: (i) A discontinuity in the friction
coefficient, (ii) a semi-permeable membrane, and (iii) a step-function chemical
potential. The general case of an interface where all three discontinuities are
present (Kedem-Katchalsky boundary) is also discussed. We demonstrate the
validity and accuracy of the derived algorithms by considering a simple
two-layer model system and comparing the Langevin dynamics statistics with
analytical solutions and alternative computational results.

undesirable effects like spectral diffusion and strong background emission. By
placing a monolayer WSe$_2$ directly on a rough gold substrate, here we show a
selective enhancement of sharp defect-bound exciton peaks, coupled with a
suppressed spectral diffusion and strong quenching of background luminescence.
By combining the experimental data with detailed electromagnetic simulations,
we reveal that such selective luminescence enhancement originates from a
combination of the Purcell effect and a wavelength dependent increment of the
excitation electric field at the tips of tall rough features, coupled with a
localized strain induced exciton funneling effect. Notably, insertion of a thin
hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) sandwich layer between WSe$_2$ and the Au film
results in a strong enhancement of the background luminescence, obscuring the

monolayer WSe$_2$ supported by thin metal film that offers a possibility of
achieving quantum light sources with high purity, high brightness, and

usage and simulation time of PyCARL using functionality tests, synthetic SNNs,

puffier, denser, and more connected to massive objects, whereas long filaments
are thinner, less dense, and more connected to less massive structures. These
two populations trace different environments and may correspond to bridges of
matter between over-dense structures (short filaments), and to cosmic filaments

intermediate product in the solid-state reaction scheme that leads to the
formation of water on icy dust grains. When HOOH desorbs from the icy grains,
it can be detected in the gas phase. In combination with water detections, it
may provide additional information on the water reaction network. Hydrogen
peroxide has previously been found toward $\rho$ Oph A. However, further
searches for this molecule in other sources failed. Hydrogen peroxide plays a
fundamental role in the understanding of solid-state water formation and the
overall water reservoir in young stellar objects (YSOs). Without further HOOH
detections, it is difficult to assess and develop suitable chemical models that
properly take into account the formation of water on icy surfaces. Aims: The
objective of this work is to identify HOOH in YSOs and thereby constrain the
grain surface water formation hypothesis. Methods: Using an astrochemical model
based on previous work in combination with a physical model of YSOs, the
sources R CrA-IRS\,5A, NGCC1333-IRAS\,2A, L1551-IRS\,5, and L1544 were
identified as suitable candidates for an HOOH detection. Long integration times
on the APEX 12m and IRAM 30m telescopes were applied to search for HOOH
signatures in these sources. Results: None of the four sources under
investigation showed convincing spectral signatures of HOOH. The upper limit
for HOOH abundance based on the noise level at the frequency positions of this
molecule for the source R CrA-IRS\,5A was close to the predicted value. For
NGC1333-IRAS 2A, L1544, and L1551-IRS\,5, the model overestimated the hydrogen
peroxide abundances.

resolution of O(3km) is driven by a global channel model at a resolution of
O(20km), enabling a more detailed comparison on the weather scale than is
available with current climate models. Further, using the RCP8.5 warming
scenario, the results are analysed. In the future scenario, there is an
increase in the number of days where the summer (JJA) model temperatures exceed
25{\deg}C. There is a future warming of 1.2{\deg}C (BRB) and 1.1{\deg}C (HPC)
in the mean JJA maximum daily temperatures compared with the control values and
an average annual maximum daily temperature warming of 1.2{\deg}C (BRB) and
0.5{\deg}C (HPC). For the control period, the model under-predicts both the
maximum and particularly the minimum temperatures. Results indicate there will
be a >25% increase in the number of summer days when the maximum temperature
exceeds 25{\deg}C, a 60% increase when the temperature exceeds the minimum of
13{\deg}C, (Tables 3, 4) and an increase in heat wave events per annum of
greater than 10 days, [Gadian et al. 2018]. The increases in summer
temperatures are larger than those predicted in the 2013 IPCC assessment

increased number of hot days listed in UKCP18 [Met Office 2019(b)]. The higher

establish the validity of the semi-analytical calculation of the radio signal

excess profile of the showers and a parameterization of the vector potential in
the far-field region of the shower at the Cherenkov angle that we also provide.
Our methodology avoids tracking the contributions to the electric field from

over mobile networks using deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to minimize
the accumulated energy consumption of each base station over a complete video
streaming session under the constraint that avoids video playback
interruptions. To handle the continuous state and action spaces, we resort to
deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for solving the formulated
problem. In contrast to previous predictive power allocation policies that
first predict future information with historical data and then optimize the
power allocation based on the predicted information, the proposed policy
operates in an on-line and end-to-end manner. By judiciously designing the
action and state that only depend on slowly-varying average channel gains, we
reduce the signaling overhead between the edge server and the base stations,
and make it easier to learn a good policy. To further avoid playback
interruption throughout the learning process and improve the convergence speed,
we exploit the partially known model of the system dynamics by integrating the
concepts of safety layer, post-decision state, and virtual experiences into the
basic DDPG algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed policies
converge to the optimal policy that is derived based on perfect large-scale
channel prediction and outperform the first-predict-then-optimize policy in the
presence of prediction errors. By harnessing the partially known model, the
convergence speed can be dramatically improved.

IIn supernova (SN) 2013L obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project II

characterized by three components attributed to different regions. A unique
feature of this Type IIn SN is that the blue shifted line profile is dominated
by the macroscopic velocity of the expanding shock wave of the SN. We are
therefore able to trace the evolution of the shock velocity in the dense and
partially opaque circumstellar medium (CSM), from $\sim 4800~km~s^{-1}$ at +48
d, decreasing as $t^{-0.23}$ to $\sim 2700~km~s^{-1}$ after a year. We perform
spectral modeling of both the broad- and intermediate-velocity components of
the H$\alpha$ line profile. The high-velocity component is consistent with
emission from a radially thin, spherical shell located behind the expanding
shock with emission wings broadened by electron scattering. We propose that the
intermediate component originates from pre-ionized gas from the unshocked dense
CSM with the same velocity as the narrow component, $\sim 100~km~s^{-1}$, but
also broadened by electron scattering. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
of SN 2013L after +132 d are well reproduced by a two-component black-body (BB)
model. The circumstellar-interaction model of the bolometric light curve
reveals a mass-loss rate history with large values ($1.7\times 10^{-2} -
0.15~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$) over the $\sim $25 - 40 years before explosion. The drop
in the light curve at $\sim 350$ days and presence of electron scattering wings
at late epochs indicate an anisotropic CSM. The mass-loss rate values and the
unshocked CSM velocity are consistent with the characteristics of a massive
star, such as a luminous blue variable (LBV) undergoing strong eruptions,

low levels of testing and an almost complete absence of testing for community
spread, there is significant risk that we may be missing out on the actual
nature of outbreak. India still has an apparently low current caseload, with
possibly a small window of time to act, and should therefore aggressively and
systematically expand random testing for community spread, including for
asymptomatic cases. This will help understand true transmission characteristics

The existing networks for person re-id are designed to extract discriminative

are fed into the neural networks and all the regions in a frame are equally
treated. This may be a suboptimal choice because many regions, e.g., background
regions in the video, are not related to the person. Furthermore, the person of
interest may be occluded by another person or something else. These unrelated

novel gating mechanism to deep neural networks. Our gating mechanism will learn
which regions are helpful for person re-identification and let these regions

filtered out by the gate. In each frame, the color channels and optical flow
channels provide quite different information. To better leverage such

optimizing the maximum number of fields that can be scheduled, and by splitting
up the lobes within the skymap by right ascension to be scheduled individually.

controllability, only account for nonlinear systems that do not explicitly
depend on time, or, for time-varying systems, they only account for the linear
case. In this paper, the general analytic conditions are provided. The paper
shows that both these two new conditions (the extended observability rank

known rank conditions for observability and controllability in the two simpler
cases of time-varying linear systems and time-invariant nonlinear systems. The
proposed new conditions work automatically and can deal with any system,
independently of its complexity (state dimension, type of nonlinearity, etc).
Simple examples illustrate both these conditions. In addition, the two new
conditions are used to study the observability and the controllability
properties of a lunar module. For this system, the dynamics exhibit an explicit
time-dependence due to the variation of the weight and the variation of the
moment of inertia. These variations are a consequence of the fuel consumption.

the extended observability rank condition and the extended controllability rank
condition introduced by this paper are required. The paper shows that, even

$(L,{\mathcal D}_d)$-colouring is a generalization of an equitable list
coloring, introduced by Kostochka at al., and an equitable list arboricity
presented by Zhang. Such a model can be useful in the network decomposition
where some structural properties on subnets are imposed.
  In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm that for a given
$(k,d)$-partition of $G$ with a $t$-uniform list assignment $L$ and $t\geq k$,
returns its equitable $(L,\mathcal{D}_{d-1})$-colouring. In addition, we show
that 3-dimensional grids are equitably $(L,\mathcal{D}_1)$-colorable for any
$t$-uniform list assignment $L$ where $t\geq 3$.

  Danger","This manuscript will be submitted to IEEE Access",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many parties claim the technical significance of Dedicated Short-Range
Communications (DSRC) in intelligent transportation system (ITS) for promotion
of transportation safety. The main challenge in this key vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) standard is high odds of network congestion. Furthermore, in accordance
with a V2X network being inherently dynamic in key parameters such as vehicle
density and velocity, the networking behavior of a DSRC system is usually
highly complicated to analyze. In addition, the United States Federal
Communications Commission (US FCC) recently announced the ""5.9 GHz band
reform,"" which reduced the dedicated bandwidth for DSRC to 10 MHz from 75 MHz.
Motivated from these, the necessity of ""lightening"" the networking load of a
DSRC network has become essential to keep safety-related operations without
performance deterioration. To this end, this paper proposes a protocol that
prioritizes transmission of a basic safety message (BSM) at a vehicle according
to the level of danger that the vehicle experiences. The proposed protocol uses
the distance between a danger source and a vehicle as the metric to determine
the priority for transmission. Our results show that this protocol prioritizes
the transmission opportunity to dangerous vehicles, and hence results in higher
performance in terms of key metrics--i.e., average delay, throughput, and
inter-reception time ($\mathsf{IRT}$).

heterogeneities of the kind arising from non-ferromagnetic metal implants, with
reduced artifacts and shorter scan times.
  Methods: An excitation scheme relying on cross-term spatio-temporal encoding
(xSPEN) was used as basis for developing the new inhomogeneity-insensitive,
slice-selective pulse scheme. The resulting Fully refOCUSED cross-term
SPatiotemporal ENcoding (FOCUSED-xSPEN) approach involved four adiabatic
sweeps. The method was evaluated in silico, in vitro and in vivo using mice
models, and compared against a number of existing and of novel alternatives
based on both conventional and swept RF pulses, including an analogous method
based on LASER's selectivity spatial selectivity.
  Results: Calculations and experiments confirmed that multi-sweep derivatives
of xSPEN and LASER can deliver localized excitation profiles, centered at the
intended positions and endowed with enhanced immunity to B0 and B1 distortions.
This, however, is achieved at the expense of higher SAR than non-swept
counterparts. Furthermore, single-shot FOCUSED-xSPEN and LASER profiles covered
limited off-resonance ranges. This could be extended to bands covering
arbitrary off-resonance values with uniform slice widths, by looping the
experiments over a number of scans possessing suitable transmission and
reception offsets.
  Conclusions: A series of novel approaches were introduced to select slices
near metals, delivering robustness against Bo and B1+ field inhomogeneities.

links encode information on the pairwise influences among the nodes. Yet, in

that higher-order interactions between oscillators can significantly affect
synchronization. However, these early studies have mostly considered
interactions up to 4 oscillators at time, and analytical treatments are limited
to the all-to-all setting. Here, we propose a general framework that allows us
to effectively study populations of oscillators where higher-order interactions
of all possible orders are considered, for any complex topology described by
arbitrary hypergraphs, and for general coupling functions. To this scope, we
introduce a multi-order Laplacian whose spectrum determines the stability of
the synchronized solution. Our framework is validated on three structures of
interactions of increasing complexity. First, we study a population with
all-to-all interactions at all orders, for which we can derive in a full
analytical manner the Lyapunov exponents of the system, and for which we
investigate the effect of including attractive and repulsive interactions.
Second, we apply the multi-order Laplacian framework to synchronization on a
synthetic model with heterogeneous higher-order interactions. Finally, we
compare the dynamics of coupled oscillators with higher-order and pairwise
couplings only, for a real dataset describing the macaque brain connectome,
highlighting the importance of faithfully representing the complexity of
interactions in real-world systems. Taken together, our multi-order Laplacian
allows us to obtain a complete analytical characterization of the stability of
synchrony in arbitrary higher-order networks, paving the way towards a general
treatment of dynamical processes beyond pairwise interactions.

charge and spin dynamics of these systems is described by evaluating the
generalized charge and spin density response function calculated from
first-principles linear response time dependent density functional theory
within adiabatic local spin density approximation. We observe that the formally
non-interacting Kohn-Sham system features strong coupling between the
magnetization and charge dynamics in the longitudinal channel and that the
coupling is effectively removed upon the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction
in the charge channel and the resulting appearance of plasmons. The
longitudinal spin fluctuations acquire a collective character without the
emergence of the Goldstone boson, similar to the case of paramagnon excitations
in non-magnetic metals like Pd. In ferromagnetic Fe and Ni the longitudinal
spin dynamics is governed by interactions between low-energy intraband
electron-hole pairs while in quasi two dimensional antiferromagnet FeSe it is
dominated by the interband transitions with energies of the order of exchange
splitting. In the later material, the collective longitudinal magnetization
fluctuations feature well defined energies and long life times for small
momenta and appear below the particle-hole continuum. The modes become strongly
Landau-damped for growing wave-vectors. We relate our theoretical findings to
existing experimental spin-polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy results.
In bulk bcc Fe, the longitudinal magnetic modes appear above the typical
energies of transverse spin-waves, have energies comparable with the Stoner
spin-flip excitation continuum, and are order of magnitude less energetic than
the charge dynamics.

costs and computational requirements of AVs, reduce the number of overlapping
sensors mapping an area, and to allow for a multiplicity of LiDAR sensing
applications with the same shared LiDAR map data. Since ELiDs have been removed
from the vehicle, their data must be processed externally in the cloud or on
the edge, necessitating an optimized backhaul system that allocates data
efficiently to compute servers. In this paper, we address this need for an
optimized backhaul system by formulating a mixed-integer programming problem
that minimizes the average latency of the uplink and downlink hop-by-hop
transmission plus computation time for each ELiD while considering different

set $ I \subset [N]^d $ into a collection of much smaller rank-1 lattices which
allow for accurate and efficient reconstruction of trigonometric polynomials
with coefficients in $ I $ (and, therefore, for the approximation of
multivariate periodic functions). The total number of sampling points in the
resulting multiple rank-1 lattices is theoretically shown to be less than $
\mathcal{O}\left( |I| \log^{ 2 }(N |I|) \right) $ with constants independent of
$d$, and by performing one-dimensional fast Fourier transforms on samples of
trigonometric polynomials with Fourier support in $ I $ at these points, we
obtain exact reconstruction of all Fourier coefficients in fewer than $
\mathcal{O}\left(d\,|I|\log^4 (N|I|)\right) $ total operations.
  Additionally, we present a second multiple rank-1 lattice construction
algorithm which constructs lattices with even fewer sampling points at the cost
of only being able to reconstruct exact trigonometric polynomials rather than
having additional theoretical approximation. Both algorithms are tested
numerically and surpass the theoretical bounds. Notably, we observe that the
oversampling factors #samples$/|I|$ appear to grow only logarithmically in $

first validated against the predictions of the previously developed

material properties of the host plasma. In many hot, dilute astrophysical
systems, such as the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, the rarity
of particle--particle collisions allows departures from local thermodynamic
equilibrium. These departures exert anisotropic viscous stresses on the plasma
motions that inhibit their ability to stretch magnetic-field lines. We present
a numerical study of the fluctuation dynamo in a weakly collisional plasma
using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations endowed with a field-parallel viscous
(Braginskii) stress. When the stress is limited to values consistent with a
pressure anisotropy regulated by firehose and mirror instabilities, the
Braginskii-MHD dynamo largely resembles its MHD counterpart. If instead the
parallel viscous stress is left unabated -- a situation relevant to recent
kinetic simulations of the fluctuation dynamo and to the early stages of the
dynamo in a magnetized ICM -- the dynamo changes its character, amplifying the
magnetic field while exhibiting many characteristics of the saturated state of
the large-Prandtl-number (${\rm Pm}\gtrsim{1}$) MHD dynamo. We construct an
analytic model for the Braginskii-MHD dynamo in this regime, which successfully
matches magnetic-energy spectra. A prediction of this model, confirmed by our
simulations, is that a Braginskii-MHD plasma without pressure-anisotropy
limiters will not support a dynamo if the ratio of perpendicular and parallel
viscosities is too small. This ratio reflects the relative allowed rates of
field-line stretching and mixing, the latter of which promotes resistive
dissipation of the magnetic field. In all cases that do exhibit a dynamo, the
generated magnetic field is organized into folds that persist into the

come at the expense of other road uses such as traffic lanes, transit lanes,
bike lanes, or parklets; drivers looking for parking contribute substantially
to traffic congestion and hence to greenhouse gas emissions; safety is reduced
both due to the fact that drivers looking for spots are more distracted than
other road users and that people exiting parked cars pose a risk to cyclists.
These social costs may not be worth paying when off-street parking lots are
nearby and have surplus capacity. To see where this might be true in downtown
Vancouver, we used artificial intelligence techniques to estimate the amount of
time it would take drivers to both park on and off street for destinations
throughout the city. For on-street parking, we developed (1) a deep-learning
model of block-by-block parking availability based on data from parking meters
and audits and (2) a computational simulation of drivers searching for an
on-street spot. For off-street parking, we developed a computational simulation
of the time it would take drivers drive from their original destination to the
nearest city-owned off-street lot and then to queue for a spot based on traffic
and lot occupancy data. Finally, in both cases we also computed the time it
would take the driver to walk from their parking spot to their original
destination. We compared these time estimates for destinations in each block of
Vancouver's downtown core and each hour of the day. We found many areas where
off street would actually save drivers time over searching the streets for a
spot, and many more where the time cost for parking off street was small. The
identification of such areas provides an opportunity for the city to repurpose
valuable curbside space for community-friendly uses more in line with its
transportation goals.

supervised using sparse LIDAR points, which enables us to leverage available
open source datasets with camera-LIDAR sensor suites during training.
Currently, accurate and affordable range sensor is not readily available.
Stereo cameras and LIDARs measure depth either inaccurately or sparsely/costly.
In contrast to the current point-to-point loss evaluation approach, the
proposed 3D loss treats point clouds as continuous objects; therefore, it
compensates for the lack of dense ground truth depth due to LIDAR's sparsity
measurements. We applied the proposed loss in three state-of-the-art monocular
depth prediction approaches DORN, BTS, and Monodepth2. Experimental evaluation
shows that the proposed loss improves the depth prediction accuracy and
produces point-clouds with more consistent 3D geometric structures compared
with all tested baselines, implying the benefit of the proposed loss on general

Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have been successfully employed as accurate and
flexible variational wave functions for clean quantum many-body systems. In
this article we explore their use in simulations of disordered quantum spin
models. The standard dense RBM with all-to-all inter-layer connectivity is not
particularly appropriate for large disordered systems, since in such systems
one cannot exploit translational invariance to reduce the amount of parameters
to be optimized. To circumvent this problem, we implement sparse RBMs, whereby
the visible spins are connected only to a subset of local hidden neurons, thus
reducing the amount of parameters. We assess the performance of sparse RBMs as
a function of the range of the allowed connections, and compare it with the one
of dense RBMs. Benchmark results are provided for two sign-problem free
Hamiltonians, namely pure and random quantum Ising chains. The RBM ansatzes are
trained using the unsupervised learning scheme based on projective quantum
Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithms. We find that the sparse connectivity facilitates
the training process and allows sparse RBMs to outperform the dense
counterparts. Furthermore, the use of sparse RBMs as guiding functions for PQMC
simulations allows us to perform PQMC simulations at a reduced computational
cost, avoiding possible biases due to finite random-walker populations. We
obtain unbiased predictions for the ground-state energies and the magnetization
profiles with fixed boundary conditions, at the ferromagnetic quantum critical
point. The magnetization profiles agree with the Fisher-de Gennes scaling
relation for conformally invariant systems, including the scaling dimension

examine the impact axions would have on mergers, considering both the
possibility that they free-stream through the dense nuclear matter and the case
where they are trapped. We calculate the mean free path of axions in merger
conditions, and find that they would free-stream through the merger in all
thermodynamic conditions. In contrast to previous calculations, we integrate
over the entire phase space while using a relativistic treatment of the
nucleons, assuming the matrix element is momentum-independent. In particular,
we use a relativistic mean field theory to describe the nucleons, taking into
account the precipitous decrease in the effective mass of the nucleons as
density increases above nuclear saturation density. We find that within current
constraints on the axion-neutron coupling, axions could cool nuclear matter on
timescales relevant to neutron star mergers. Our results may be regarded as
first steps aimed at understanding how axions affect merger simulations and

sufficient separation, inspiraling black holes can be regarded as isolated
objects, hence their temperature can still be defined. Due to their intrinsic
radiation, inspiraling black holes lose part of their masses during the
inspiral phase. As a result, coalescence speeds up, introducing a correction to
the orbital phase. We show that this dephasing may allow us to constrain the
temperature of inspiraling black holes through gravitational-wave detection.
Using the binary black-hole coalescences of the first two observing runs of the
Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, we constrain the temperature of parental
black holes to be less than about $ 10^9 $ K. Such a constraint corresponds to
luminosity of about $ 10^{-16} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1} $ for a black hole of $ 20
M_{\odot} $, which is about 20 orders of magnitude below the peak luminosity of

model for dynamical analysis of spatio-temporal data. Like other factor
analysis methods, DMSTF approximates high dimensional data by a product between
time dependent weights and spatially dependent factors. These weights and
factors are in turn represented in terms of lower dimensional latents inferred
using stochastic variational inference. The innovation in DMSTF is that we
parameterize weights in terms of a deep Markovian prior extendable with a
discrete latent, which is able to characterize nonlinear multimodal temporal
dynamics, and perform multidimensional time series forecasting. DMSTF learns a
low dimensional spatial latent to generatively parameterize spatial factors or
their functional forms in order to accommodate high spatial dimensionality. We
parameterize the corresponding variational distribution using a bidirectional
recurrent network in the low-level latent representations. This results in a
flexible family of hierarchical deep generative factor analysis models that can
be extended to perform time series clustering or perform factor analysis in the
presence of a control signal. Our experiments, which include simulated and
real-world data, demonstrate that DMSTF outperforms related methodologies in
terms of predictive performance for unseen data, reveals meaningful clusters in
the data, and performs forecasting in a variety of domains with potentially
nonlinear temporal transitions.

telescope with a cadence of approximately three weeks in three observing bands.
A comprehensive description of the pulsar observing systems employed at the
telescope since 2004 is provided, including the calibration methodology and an
analysis of the stability of system components. We attempt to provide full
accounting of the reduction from the raw measured Stokes parameters to pulse
times of arrival to aid third parties in reproducing our results. This
conversion is encapsulated in a processing pipeline designed to track
provenance. Our data products include pulse times of arrival for each of the
pulsars along with an initial set of pulsar parameters and noise models. The
calibrated pulse profiles and timing template profiles are also available.
These data represent almost 21,000 hrs of recorded data spanning over 14 years.
After accounting for processes that induce time-correlated noise, 22 of the
pulsars have weighted root-mean-square timing residuals of < 1 ${\mu}$s in at
least one radio band. The data should allow end users to quickly undertake
their own gravitational-wave analyses (for example) without having to
understand the intricacies of pulsar polarisation calibration or attain a
mastery of radio-frequency interference mitigation as is required when

only observing the winning bid at the end of each auction, learns to adaptively
bid in order to maximize her cumulative payoff. To achieve this goal, the
bidder faces a censored feedback: if she wins the bid, then she is not able to
observe the highest bid of the other bidders, which we assume is \textit{iid}
drawn from an unknown distribution. In this paper, we develop the first
learning algorithm that achieves a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret bound, by exploiting two structural properties of first-price auctions,
i.e. the specific feedback structure and payoff function.
  The feedback in first-price auctions combines the graph feedback across
actions (bids), the cross learning across contexts (private values), and a
partial order over the contexts; we generalize it as the partially ordered
contextual bandits. We establish both strengths and weaknesses of this
framework, by showing a curious separation that a regret nearly independent of
the action/context sizes is possible under stochastic contexts, but is
impossible under adversarial contexts. In particular, this framework leads to
an $O(\sqrt{T}\log^{2.5}T)$ regret for first-price auctions when the bidder's
private values are \emph{iid}.
  Despite the limitation of the above framework, we further exploit the special
payoff function of first-price auctions to develop a sample-efficient algorithm
even in the presence of adversarially generated private values. We establish an
$O(\sqrt{T}\log^3 T)$ regret bound for this algorithm, hence providing a
complete characterization of optimal learning guarantees for first-price
auctions.

  seasonality",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Western honeybees (Apis Mellifera) serve extremely important roles in our
ecosystem and economics as they are responsible for pollinating $ 215 billion
dollars annually over the world. Unfortunately, honeybee population and their
colonies have been declined dramatically. The purpose of this article is to
explore how we should model honeybee population with age structure and validate
the model using empirical data so that we can identify different factors that
lead to the survival and healthy of the honeybee colony. Our theoretical study
combined with simulations and data validation suggests that the proper age
structure incorporated in the model and seasonality are important for modeling
honeybee population. Specifically, our work implies that the model assuming
that (1) the adult bees are survived from the {egg population} rather than the
brood population; and (2) seasonality in the queen egg laying rate, give the
better fit than other honeybee models. The related theoretical and numerical
analysis of the most fit model indicate that (a) the survival of honeybee
colonies requires a large queen egg-laying rate and smaller values of the other
life history parameter values in addition to proper initial condition; (b) both
brood and adult bee populations are increasing with respect to the increase in
the {egg-laying rate} and the decreasing in other parameter values; and (c)
seasonality may promote/suppress the survival of the honeybee colony.

  Networks and Learning Systems",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-rank Multi-view Subspace Learning (LMvSL) has shown great potential in
cross-view classification in recent years. Despite their empirical success,
existing LMvSL based methods are incapable of well handling view discrepancy
and discriminancy simultaneously, which thus leads to the performance
degradation when there is a large discrepancy among multi-view data. To
circumvent this drawback, motivated by the block-diagonal representation
learning, we propose Structured Low-rank Matrix Recovery (SLMR), a unique
method of effectively removing view discrepancy and improving discriminancy
through the recovery of structured low-rank matrix. Furthermore, recent
low-rank modeling provides a satisfactory solution to address data contaminated
by predefined assumptions of noise distribution, such as Gaussian or Laplacian
distribution. However, these models are not practical since complicated noise
in practice may violate those assumptions and the distribution is generally
unknown in advance. To alleviate such limitation, modal regression is elegantly
incorporated into the framework of SLMR (term it MR-SLMR). Different from
previous LMvSL based methods, our MR-SLMR can handle any zero-mode noise
variable that contains a wide range of noise, such as Gaussian noise, random
noise and outliers. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
framework and half-quadratic theory are used to efficiently optimize MR-SLMR.
Experimental results on four public databases demonstrate the superiority of
MR-SLMR and its robustness to complicated noise.

However, previous proofs of shadowing methods wrongly assume that shadowing
trajectories are representative. In contrast, the linear response formula is
proved rigorously, but is more difficult to compute.
  We prove that $v$ gives only a part, called the shadowing contribution, of
the linear response; hence, the other part, the unstable contribution, is the
systematic error of shadowing methods. For systems with a small ratio of
unstable dimensions, with some further statistical assumptions, we show that
the unstable contribution is small. We also briefly describe an algorithm for

diffraction, and transport measurements, in combination with crystal structure
prediction (CSP) based on the evolutionary approach and first principles
calculations. We found that TlInTe$_2$ undergoes a pressure driven
semiconductor to semimetal transition at 4 GPa, followed by a superconducting
transition at 5.7 GPa (with Tc = 3.8 K) induced by a Lifshitz transition. The
Lifshitz transition is initiated by the appearance of new electron pockets on
the Fermi surface, which evolve with pressure and connect to the adjacent
electron pockets forming an umbrella shaped Fermi surface at the top and bottom
of the Brillouin zone. An unusual giant phonon softening (Ag mode) concomitant
with a V-shaped Tc behavior appears at 10-12 GPa as a result of the interaction
of optical phonons with the conduction electrons, resulting in Fano line shaped
asymmetry in Ag mode. A prominent Tc anomaly concurrent with the Ag mode
softening at 19-20 GPa is correlated to the semimetal to metal transition. The
CSP calculations reveal that these transitions are not accompanied by any
structural phase transitions up to the maximum pressure achieved, 33.5 GPa. Our
findings on TlInTe$_2$ open up a new platform to study a plethora of unexplored
high pressure novel phenomena in TlSe family induced by Lifshitz transition

attributes have led to numerous demonstrations of field-effect devices ranging
from transistors to triodes. By exploiting the controlled, substitutional

the passivated surfaces of 2D semiconductors, one can construct devices that

better refined estimates, making the receiver wait more for every refinement,
or to be fast but loose and send new information in every communication

ideal spherical codes is universally optimal asymptotically for a large

not meet the ideal performance required for this optimality, and they typically
will have a bias in the form of a fixed additive error. Interestingly, our
analysis shows that the fast but loose scheme is not an optimal choice in the

By defining an \emph{activity operator}, a tight upper bound on the charging

the activity operator and the quantum Fisher information. The variance of the
activity operator may be interpreted as a generalized thermodynamic force,
while the quantum Fisher information describes the speed of evolution in the

the time domain called FTNet for monaural speech enhancement, where the
proposed network consists of three principal components. The first part is
called stage recurrent neural network, which is introduced to effectively
aggregate the deep feature dependencies across different stages with a memory
mechanism and also remove the interference stage by stage. The second part is
the convolutional auto-encoder. The third part consists of a series of
concatenated gated linear units, which are capable of facilitating the
information flow and gradually increasing the receptive fields. Feedback
learning is adopted to improve the parameter efficiency and therefore, the
number of trainable parameters is effectively reduced without sacrificing its
performance. Numerous experiments are conducted on TIMIT corpus and
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network can achieve
consistently better performance in terms of both PESQ and STOI scores than two
state-of-the-art time domain-based baselines in different conditions.

social influence analysis. Over the last decade, a great effort has been
devoted to developing efficient algorithms for influence maximization, so that
identifying the ``best'' algorithm has become a demanding task. In SIGMOD'17,
Arora, Galhotra, and Ranu reported benchmark results on eleven existing
algorithms and demonstrated that there is no single state-of-the-art offering
the best trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality.
  In this paper, we report a high-level experimental study on three
well-established algorithmic approaches for influence maximization, referred to
as Oneshot, Snapshot, and Reverse Influence Sampling (RIS). Different from
Arora et al., our experimental methodology is so designed that we examine the
distribution of random solutions, characterize the relation between the sample
number and the actual solution quality, and avoid implementation dependencies.
Our main findings are as follows: 1. For a sufficiently large sample number, we
obtain a unique solution regardless of algorithms. 2. The average solution
quality of Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS improves at the same rate up to scaling
of sample number. 3. Oneshot requires more samples than Snapshot, and Snapshot
requires fewer but larger samples than RIS. We discuss the time efficiency when
conditioning Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS to be of identical accuracy. Our
conclusion is that Oneshot is suitable only if the size of available memory is
limited, and RIS is more efficient than Snapshot for large networks; Snapshot
is preferable for small, low-probability networks.

predetermined number of channels in each layer which is suboptimal; and model
averaging effects and poor ranking correlation caused by weight coupling and

this paper, a Broadening-and-Shrinking One-Shot NAS (BS-NAS) framework is
proposed, in which `broadening' refers to broadening the search space with a
spring block enabling search for numbers of channels during training of the

turning off those underperforming operations. The above innovations broaden the
search space for wider representation and then shrink it by gradually removing

biology and surface science. Recent studies have used liquid drops to probe the
surface mechanics of elastomeric networks. Experiments suggest an intricate
surface elasticity, also known as the Shuttleworth effect, where surface
tension is not constant but depends on substrate deformation. However,
interpretations have remained controversial due to singular elastic
deformations, induced exactly at the point where the droplet pulls the network.
Here we reveal the nature of the elastocapillary singularity on a hyperelastic
substrate with various constitutive relations for the interfacial energy.
First, we finely resolve the vicinity of the singularity using goal-adaptive
finite element simulations. This confirms the universal validity, also at large
elastic deformations, of the previously disputed Neumann's law for the contact
angles. Subsequently, we derive exact solutions of nonlinear elasticity that
describe the singularity analytically. These solutions are in perfect agreement
with numerics, and show that the stretch at the contact line, as previously
measured experimentally, consistently points to a strong Shuttleworth effect.
Finally, using Noether's theorem we provide a quantitative link between wetting
hysteresis and Eshelby-like forces, and thereby offer a complete framework for
soft wetting in the presence of the Shuttleworth effect.

dispersity on the phase behaviour of freely-rotating hard cuboids, here
modelled as self-dual-shaped nanoboards. This peculiar anisotropy, exactly in
between oblate and prolate geometry, has been proposed as the most appropriate
to promote phase biaxiality. We observe that size dispersity radically changes
the phase behaviour of monodisperse systems and leads to the formation of the
elusive biaxial nematic phase, being found in an large region of the packing
fraction vs polydispersity phase diagram. Although our results confirm the
tendencies reported in past experimental observations on colloidal dispersions
of slightly prolate goethite particles, they cannot reproduce the direct
isotropic-to-biaxial nematic phase transition observed in these experiments.

system possesses a number of remarkable observational features, but no
convincing merger scenario, explaining the shape and location of the radio
relic in harmony with the orientation of the cometary X-ray tails, has been

suggests that the cometary X-ray tail of A115 might be a slingshot tail and can
arise $\sim0.3$ Gyrs after the impact and before the two subclusters reach
their apocenters. This scenario can predict the location and orientation of the

our study indicates that diffusive shock acceleration alone cannot generate the

when adapting an NLU model to a new domain. To address this issue, a novel
label embedding based slot filling framework is proposed in this paper. Here,
distributed label embedding is constructed for each slot using prior knowledge.
Three encoding methods are investigated to incorporate different kinds of prior
knowledge about slots: atomic concepts, slot descriptions, and slot exemplars.
The proposed label embeddings tend to share text patterns and reuses data with
different slot labels. This makes it useful for adaptive NLU with limited data.
Also, since label embedding is independent of NLU model, it is compatible with
almost all deep learning based slot filling models. The proposed approaches are
evaluated on three datasets. Experiments on single domain and domain adaptation
tasks show that label embedding achieves significant performance improvement
over traditional one-hot label representation as well as advanced zero-shot
approaches.

previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model
learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In
this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the

that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through

ADFFRLS includes two new proposals in the existing DFF-RLS; The first is an
excitation tag that changes the behavior of the DFFRLS and the EKF according to
the dynamics of the input data. The second is auto-tuning that automatically
finds the optimal value of RLS forgetting factor based on condition number
(CN). Based on this, we proposed a joint estimation algorithm of ADFF-RLS and
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm,
we used experimental data of hybrid pattern battery cells mixed with dynamic
and static patterns. In addition, we added a current measurement error that
occurs when measuring at EV, and realized data that is closer to actual
environment. This data was applied to two conventional estimation algorithms
(Coulomb counting, Single EKF), two joint estimation algorithms (RLS & EKF,
DFF-RLS & EKF) and ADFF-RLS & EKF. As a result, the proposed algorithm showed
higher SOC and SOH estimation accuracy in various driving patterns and actual
EV driving environment than previous studies.

from semiconducting to metallic behavior. The contrasting behavior indicates
changes in electronic structure upon IL gating, due to the formation of oxygen
defect states. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical
simulations based on a model density of states incorporating a gating induced

fundamental tests. However, a direct spectroscopy at modern x-ray sources such
as synchrotrons or x-ray free electron lasers is challenging, because of the
broad spectral bandwidth of the delivered x-ray pulses, and because of a
limited spectral resolution offered by x-ray optics and detectors. To overcome
these challenges, here, we propose a spectroscopy technique based on a
spectrally narrow reference absorber that is rapidly oscillating along the
propagation direction of the x-ray light. The motion induces sidebands to the
response of the absorber, which we scan across the spectrum of the unknown
target to gain spectral information. The oscillation further introduces a
dependence of the detected light on the motional phase at the time of x-ray
excitation as an additional controllable degree of freedom. We show how a
Fourier analysis with respect to this phase enables one to selectively extract
parts of the recorded intensity after the actual experiment, throughout the
data analysis. This allows one to improve the spectral recovery by removing
unwanted signal contributions. Our method is capable of gaining spectral
information from the entire measured intensity, and not only from the intensity
at late times after the excitation, such that a significantly higher part of
the signal photons can be used. Furthermore, it not only enables one to measure
the amplitude of the spectral response, but also its phase.

more entwined, especially with the advent of smart audio guides, virtual and

vision are important components of this ongoing integration, enabling new
interaction modalities between user and museum. Nonetheless, the most frequent
way of interacting with paintings and statues still remains taking pictures.
Yet images alone can only convey the aesthetics of the artwork, lacking is
information which is often required to fully understand and appreciate it.
Usually this additional knowledge comes both from the artwork itself (and
therefore the image depicting it) and from an external source of knowledge,
such as an information sheet. While the former can be inferred by computer
vision algorithms, the latter needs more structured data to pair visual content
with relevant information. Regardless of its source, this information still
must be be effectively transmitted to the user. A popular emerging trend in
computer vision is Visual Question Answering (VQA), in which users can interact
with a neural network by posing questions in natural language and receiving
answers about the visual content. We believe that this will be the evolution of
smart audio guides for museum visits and simple image browsing on personal
smartphones. This will turn the classic audio guide into a smart personal
instructor with which the visitor can interact by asking for explanations
focused on specific interests. The advantages are twofold: on the one hand the
cognitive burden of the visitor will decrease, limiting the flow of information
to what the user actually wants to hear; and on the other hand it proposes the

altered. We show that without increasing the size of the network, the capacity
of lightweight neural networks can be enhanced by TanhExp with only a few

in Sakai (Commun. Math. Phys., 272 (2007): 283--344). It is an identity that
involves an alternating series of the lace-expansion coefficients. In the same
paper, we claimed that the expansion coefficients obey certain diagrammatic
bounds which imply faster $x$-space decay (as the two-point function cubed)
above the critical dimension $d_c$ ($=4$ for finite-variance models), if the
spin-spin coupling is ferromagnetic, translation-invariant, summable and
symmetric with respect to the underlying lattice symmetries. However, we
recently found a flaw in the proof of Lemma 4.2 in Sakai (2007), a key lemma to
the aforementioned diagrammatic bounds.
  In this paper, we no longer use the problematic Lemma 4.2 of Sakai (2007),
and prove new diagrammatic bounds on the expansion coefficients that are
slightly more complicated than those in Proposition 4.1 of Sakai (2007) but
nonetheless obey the same fast decay above the critical dimension $d_c$.
Consequently, the lace-expansion results for the Ising and $\varphi^4$ models
so far are all saved. The proof is based on the random-current representation
and its source-switching technique of Griffiths, Hurst and Sherman, combined
with a double expansion: a lace expansion for the lace-expansion coefficients.

reconstructed as objects of the derived category in terms of its truncation in

admits a lifting to $W_2(k)$, in which case the first nonzero differential in
the conjugate spectral sequence appears no earlier than on page $\max(p,3)$

trends obtained by IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover,
the obtained position of the upper crossover pressure is in good agreement with

outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a

SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of
paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an
effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a
new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on
whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The
distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because
non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than
diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain
misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic
phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop
life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires
hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the
healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be
redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic
containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19
epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different
possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.

governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

retrieval task for searching natural images given free-hand sketches under the
zero-shot scenario. Most existing methods solve this problem by simultaneously
projecting visual features and semantic supervision into a low-dimensional
common space for efficient retrieval. However, such low-dimensional projection
destroys the completeness of semantic knowledge in original semantic space, so
that it is unable to transfer useful knowledge well when learning semantic from
different modalities. Moreover, the domain information and semantic information
are entangled in visual features, which is not conducive for cross-modal
matching since it will hinder the reduction of domain gap between sketch and
image. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Domain-independent Feature
Decomposition (PDFD) network for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, with the supervision of
original semantic knowledge, PDFD decomposes visual features into domain
features and semantic ones, and then the semantic features are projected into
common space as retrieval features for ZS-SBIR. The progressive projection
strategy maintains strong semantic supervision. Besides, to guarantee the
retrieval features to capture clean and complete semantic information, the
cross-reconstruction loss is introduced to encourage that any combinations of
retrieval features and domain features can reconstruct the visual features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our PDFD over
state-of-the-art competitors.

best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source
network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial
release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we
generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases,
with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the
best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes
predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain
deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can
aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible

relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready
solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the

accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning

edge AI applications. Conventional approaches to training DNNs are generally
implemented at central servers or cloud centers for centralized learning, which
is typically time-consuming and resource-demanding due to the transmission of a
large amount of data samples from the device to the remote cloud. To overcome
these disadvantages, we consider accelerating the learning process of DNNs on
the Mobile-Edge-Cloud Computing (MECC) paradigm. In this paper, we propose
HierTrain, a hierarchical edge AI learning framework, which efficiently deploys
the DNN training task over the hierarchical MECC architecture. We develop a
novel \textit{hybrid parallelism} method, which is the key to HierTrain, to
adaptively assign the DNN model layers and the data samples across the three
levels of edge device, edge server and cloud center. We then formulate the
problem of scheduling the DNN training tasks at both layer-granularity and
sample-granularity. Solving this optimization problem enables us to achieve the
minimum training time. We further implement a hardware prototype consisting of
an edge device, an edge server and a cloud server, and conduct extensive
experiments on it. Experimental results demonstrate that HierTrain can achieve
up to 6.9x speedup compared to the cloud-based hierarchical training approach.

classifying semantic relations between documents is a solvable task and
motivates the development of recommender systems based on the evaluated

postulate that the superstructures originate from a misfit between tungsten and

Moreover, we show that the two structures, indicated as 113- and 337-phases due
to the characteristic directions of the respective moir\'e patterns, differ
considerably in their symmetry properties. This suggests that oxygen atoms in
the two overlayers occupy different adsorption sites on average. In particular,
the 113-phase features rotational domains that retain mirror symmetries with
respect to the [001] and [1-10] directions, whereas the 337-phase is
characterized by the appearance of additional domains due to the breaking of
these symmetries. We propose structural models for both phases that
consistently explain their unusual properties and suggest a universal mechanism

the inverse participation ratio reveals a super-ballistic diffusion of the

two initially localized excitations, intriguing, and complex dynamical
scenarios emerge for different initial separations due to the competition
between the Rydberg-Rydberg and exchange interactions. In particular, the

purposes: on one hand, it provides means for software developers to document
their intent; on the other hand, it furnishes tools for automatic detection of
potential violations. This dual rationale facilitates compliance with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other emerging data protection
and privacy regulations. In addition to a brief review of the state-of-the-art
of static analysis in the data protection context and the design of the
proposed analysis method, a concrete tool is presented to demonstrate a
practical implementation for the Java programming language.

transfer learning technique to tackle the lack of massive labeled action

class-specific information, we apply an attention mechanism on the output
feature maps of the CNN to extract more discriminative and powerful features
for classification of human actions. Moreover, we use eight different
pre-trained CNNs in our framework and investigate their performance on Stanford

enhance the overall accuracy of action classification by combining the

  Spanners","An earlier version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of SODA
  2021",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new measure for quantifying the amount of information that the
nodes in a network need to learn to jointly solve a graph problem. We show that
the local information cost ($\textsf{LIC}$) presents a natural lower bound on
the communication complexity of distributed algorithms. For the synchronous
CONGEST-KT1 model, where each node has initial knowledge of its neighbors' IDs,
we prove that $\Omega(\textsf{LIC}_\gamma(P)/ \log\tau \log n)$ bits are
required for solving a graph problem $P$ with a $\tau$-round algorithm that
errs with probability at most $\gamma$. Our result is the first lower bound
that yields a general trade-off between communication and time for graph
problems in the CONGEST-KT1 model.
  We demonstrate how to apply the local information cost by deriving a lower
bound on the communication complexity of computing a $(2t-1)$-spanner that
consists of at most $O(n^{1+1/t + \epsilon})$ edges, where $\epsilon =
\Theta(1/t^2)$. Our main result is that any $O(\textsf{poly}(n))$-time
algorithm must send at least $\tilde\Omega((1/t^2) n^{1+1/2t})$ bits in the
CONGEST model under the KT1 assumption. Previously, only a trivial lower bound
of $\tilde \Omega(n)$ bits was known for this problem.
  A consequence of our lower bound is that achieving both time- and
communication-optimality is impossible when designing a distributed spanner
algorithm. In light of the work of King, Kutten, and Thorup (PODC 2015), this
shows that computing a minimum spanning tree can be done significantly faster
than finding a spanner when considering algorithms with $\tilde O(n)$
communication complexity. Our result also implies time complexity lower bounds
for constructing a spanner in the node-congested clique of Augustine et al.
(2019) and in the push-pull gossip model with limited bandwidth.

continuous target variables using a shared set of predictors. Two key
challenges in multi-target regression are: (a) modelling target dependencies
and (b) scalability to large output spaces. In this paper, a new multi-target
regression method is proposed that tries to jointly address these challenges
via a novel problem transformation approach. The proposed method, called MRQ,
is based on the idea of quantizing the output space in order to transform the
multiple continuous targets into one or more discrete ones. Learning on the
transformed output space naturally enables modeling of target dependencies
while the quantization strategy can be flexibly parameterized to control the
trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments
on a large collection of benchmark datasets show that MRQ is both highly
scalable and also competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy.
In particular, an ensemble version of MRQ obtains the best overall accuracy,

is diagonalized by Bogliubov transformation and the eigen-states at each

interpretation is supported by the known cosmological red-shift formula and the
on-shell condition of 4-momentum for a free field. Though the mathematics is
carried out in term of conformal coordinates for the sake of convenience, the
whole theory can be transformed into any other coordinates based on general

non-vacuum states at later times. Formalism of perturbational is provided with

problem. Supernovae (SNe) are supposed to play a key role in forming
large-scale galactic winds by removing important amounts of gas from galaxies.
SNe are efficient accelerators of non-thermal particles, so-called cosmic rays
(CRs), which can substantially modify the dynamics of the gas and conditions to
form large-scale galactic winds. We investigate how CR injection by SNe impacts
the star formation and the formation of large-scale winds in dwarf galaxies,
and whether it can produce galaxy star-formation rates (SFR) and wind
properties closer to observations. We ran CR magneto-hydrodynamical simulations
of dwarf galaxies at high resolution (9 pc) with the adaptive mesh refinement
code ramses. Disc galaxies are embedded in isolated halos of mass of $10^{10}$
and $10^{11} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, and CRs are injected by SNe. We included CR
isotropic and anisotropic diffusion with various diffusion coefficients, CR
radiative losses, and CR streaming. The injection of CR energy into the
interstellar medium smooths out the highest gas densities, which reduces the
SFR by a factor of 2-3. Mass outflow rates are significantly greater with CR
diffusion, by 2 orders of magnitudes for the higher diffusion coefficients.
Without diffusion and streaming, CRs are inefficient at generating winds. CR
streaming alone allows for the formation of winds but which are too weak to
match observations. The formation of galactic winds strongly depends on the
diffusion coefficient: for low coefficients, CR energy stays confined in high
density regions where CR energy losses are highest, and higher coefficients,
which allow for a more efficient leaking of CRs out of dense gas, produce
stronger winds. CR diffusion leads to colder and denser winds than without CRs,
and brings outflow rates and mass loading factors much closer to observations.

to the least-squares problem in a tightly coupled manner. For abnormal motion
situations, such as skidding and abduction, this paper adopts the Mecanum
mobile chassis control method, based on torque control. This method uses the
motion constraint error to estimate the reliability of the wheel speed
measurement. At the same time, in order to prevent incorrect chassis speed
measurements from negatively influencing robot pose estimation, this paper uses
three methods to detect abnormal chassis movement and analyze chassis movement
status in real time. When the chassis movement is determined to be abnormal,
the wheel odometer pre-integration measurement of the current frame is removed
from the state estimation equation, thereby ensuring the accuracy and
robustness of the state estimation. Experimental results show that the accuracy
and robustness of the method in this paper are better than those of a monocular

for the class of strongly connected graphs, we show that the notion of the

approach for generating the lowest-energy states of a given system is by
employing adiabatic state preparation (ASP). In the present work, we
investigate a variational method for determining the optimal scheduling
procedure within the context of ASP. In the absence of quantum error
correction, running a quantum device for any meaningful amount of time causes a
system to become susceptible to the loss of relevant information. Therefore, if
accurate quantum states are to be successfully generated, it is crucial to find
techniques that shorten the time of individual runs during iterations of
annealing. We demonstrate our variational method toward this end by
investigating the hydrogen and P4 molecules, as well as the Ising model problem
on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. In both cases, the time required for
one iteration to produce accurate results is reduced by several orders of
magnitude in comparison to what is achievable via standard ASP. As a result,
the required quantum coherence time to perform such a calculation on a quantum
device becomes much less stringent with the implementation of this algorithm.
In addition, our variational method is found to exhibit resilience against
control errors, which are commonly encountered within the realm of quantum
computing.

optical measurements at very low light levels. Single-photon detectors
combining high efficiency and high time resolution are pivotal in such
experiments. By using relatively thick films of NbTiN (8-11\,nm) and improving
the pattern fidelity of the nano-structure of the superconducting nanowire
single-photon detectors (SNSPD), we fabricated devices demonstrating superior
performance over all previously reported detectors in the combination of
efficiency and time resolution. Our findings prove that small variations in the
nanowire width, in the order of a few nanometers, can lead to a significant
penalty on their temporal response. Addressing these issues, we consistently
achieved high time resolution (best device 7.7\,ps, other devices
$\sim$10-16\,ps) simultaneously with high system detection efficiencies
($80-90\%$) in the wavelength range of 780-1000\,nm, as well as in the telecom

large-area multi-pixel devices with homogeneous pixel performance. We first
fabricated and characterized a $100\times100\, \mu m^2$ 16-pixel detector and
showed there was little variation among individual pixels. Additionally, to
showcase the power of our platform, we fabricated and characterized 4-pixel
multimode fiber-coupled detectors and carried out photon correlation
experiments on a nanowire quantum dot resulting in $g^2(0)$ values lower than

for about 40 years, until it was recently disproved by Cohen-Addad et al.
(2017). However, coloring planar graphs with restrictions on cycle lengths is
still an active area of research, and the interest in this particular graph
class remains. Let $G$ be a planar graph without $4$-cycles and $5$-cycles. For
integers $d_1$ and $d_2$ satisfying $d_1+d_2\geq8$ and $d_2\geq d_1\geq 2$, it

into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while
allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i)
predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii)
robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements
over short time scales. In turn -- while not eliminating the virus -- this fast
switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until
a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs
associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of
1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days
working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on
measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the
potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown
mitigation. All code is available on Github
(https://github.com/V4p1d/FPSP_Covid19). A software tool has also been
developed so that interested parties can explore the proof-of-concept system.

produces an image of the model wearing the product. Most methods essentially
compute warps from the product image to the model image and combine using image
generation methods. However, obtaining a realistic image is challenging because
the kinematics of garments is complex and because outline, texture, and shading
cues in the image reveal errors to human viewers. The garment must have
appropriate drapes; texture must be warped to be consistent with the shape of a
draped garment; small details (buttons, collars, lapels, pockets, etc.) must be
placed appropriately on the garment, and so on. Evaluation is particularly
difficult and is usually qualitative.
  This paper uses quantitative evaluation on a challenging, novel dataset to
demonstrate that (a) for any warping method, one can choose target models
automatically to improve results, and (b) learning multiple coordinated
specialized warpers offers further improvements on results. Target models are
chosen by a learned embedding procedure that predicts a representation of the
products the model is wearing. This prediction is used to match products to
models. Specialized warpers are trained by a method that encourages a second
warper to perform well in locations where the first works poorly. The warps are
then combined using a U-Net. Qualitative evaluation confirms that these
improvements are wholesale over outline, texture shading, and garment details.

suitable for minimizing an expensive objective function in as few function
evaluations as possible. While BO budgets are typically given in iterations,
this implicitly measures convergence in terms of iteration count and assumes
each evaluation has identical cost. In practice, evaluation costs may vary in
different regions of the search space. For example, the cost of neural network
training increases quadratically with layer size, which is a typical
hyperparameter. Cost-aware BO measures convergence with alternative cost
metrics such as time, energy, or money, for which vanilla BO methods are
unsuited. We introduce Cost Apportioned BO (CArBO), which attempts to minimize
an objective function in as little cost as possible. CArBO combines a
cost-effective initial design with a cost-cooled optimization phase which

students to alternate between full-time and part-time enrollment each semester

strategies on academic outcomes. In this paper, we applying a Hidden Markov
Model to identify and cluster students' enrollment strategies into three
different categorizes: full-time, part-time, and mixed-enrollment strategies.
Based the enrollment strategies we investigate and compare the academic
performance outcomes of each group, taking into account differences between

collected from the University of Central Florida from 2008 to 2017 indicates
that first-time-in-college students that apply a mixed enrollment strategy are
closer in performance to full-time students, as compared to part-time students.
More importantly, during their part-time semesters, mixed-enrollment students
significantly outperform part-time students. Similarly, analysis of transfer
students shows that a mixed-enrollment strategy is correlated a similar
graduation rates as the full-time enrollment strategy, and more than double the
graduation rate associated with part-time enrollment. Such a finding suggests
that increased engagement through the occasional full-time enrollment leads to
better overall outcomes.

cryptocurrencies with a specific focus on the applications of this technology.
However, slow confirmation times of transactions and unforeseeable high fees
hamper their wide adoption for micro-payments. The idea of establishing payment
channel networks is one of the many proposed solutions to address this
scalability issue where nodes, by utilizing smart contracting, establish
payment channels between each other and perform off-chain transactions.
However, due to the way these channels are created, both sides have a certain
one-way capacity for making transactions. Consequently, if one sides exceeds
this one-way capacity, the channel becomes useless in that particular
direction, which causes failures of payments and eventually creates an
imbalance in the overall network. To keep the payment channel network
sustainable, in this paper, we aim to increase the overall success rate of
payments by effectively exploiting the fact that end-users are usually
connected to the network at multiple points (i.e., gateways) any of which can
be used to initiate the payment. We propose an efficient method for selection
of the gateway for a user by considering the gateway's inbound and outbound
payment traffic ratio. We then augment this proposed method with split payment
capability to further increase success rate especially for large transactions.
The evaluation of the proposed method shows that compared to greedy and
maxflow-based approaches, we can achieve much higher success rates, which are
further improved with split payments.

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The trajectory prediction is a critical and challenging problem in the design
of an autonomous driving system. Many AI-oriented companies, such as Google
Waymo, Uber and DiDi, are investigating more accurate vehicle trajectory
prediction algorithms. However, the prediction performance is governed by lots
of entangled factors, such as the stochastic behaviors of surrounding vehicles,
historical information of self-trajectory, and relative positions of neighbors,
etc. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based information sharing network
(GISNet) that allows the information sharing between the target vehicle and its
surrounding vehicles. Meanwhile, the model encodes the historical trajectory
information of all the vehicles in the scene. Experiments are carried out on
the public NGSIM US-101 and I-80 Dataset and the prediction performance is
measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The quantitative and qualitative
experimental results show that our model significantly improves the trajectory
prediction accuracy, by up to 50.00%, compared to existing models.

presented based on the convolutional recurrent autoencoder networks. The
methodology is developed in the context of the overall data-driven
reduced-order model framework proposed in the paper. The basic idea behind the
methodology is to obtain the low dimensional representations via convolutional
neural networks and evolve these low dimensional features via recurrent neural
networks in the time domain. The high dimensional representations are
constructed from the evolved low dimensional features via transpose
convolutional neural networks. With an unsupervised training strategy, the
model serves as an end to end tool which can evolve the flow state of the
nonlinear dynamical system. The convolutional recurrent autoencoder network
model is applied to the problem of flow past bluff bodies for the first time.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, two canonical problems
namely the flow past a plain cylinder and the flow past side-by-side cylinders
are explored in this paper. Pressure and velocity fields of the unsteady flow
are predicted in future via the convolutional recurrent autoencoder model. The
performance of the model is satisfactory for both the problems. Specifically,
the multiscale nature and the gap flow dynamics of the side-by-side cylinders
are captured by the proposed data-driven model reduction methodology. The error
metrics, the normalized squared error, and the normalized reconstruction error
are considered for the assessment of the data-driven framework.

there are few works on the protection of the self-driving system. This paper
presents a decentralized self-protection framework called Guardauto to protect
the self-driving system against runtime threats. First, Guardauto proposes an
isolation model to decouple the self-driving system and isolate its components
with a set of partitions. Second, Guardauto provides self-protection mechanisms
for each target component, which combines different methods to monitor the
target execution and plan adaption actions accordingly. Third, Guardauto
provides cooperation among local self-protection mechanisms to identify the
root-cause component in the case of cascading failures affecting multiple
components. A prototype has been implemented and evaluated on the open-source
autonomous driving system Autoware. Results show that Guardauto could
effectively mitigate runtime failures and attacks, and protect the control
system with acceptable performance overhead.

years. The evolution of processor and storage technologies has enabled more
advanced ASR mechanisms, fueling the development of virtual assistants such as
Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and Google Home. The interest in
such assistants, in turn, has amplified the novel developments in ASR research.
However, despite this popularity, there has not been a detailed training
efficiency analysis of modern ASR systems. This mainly stems from: the
proprietary nature of many modern applications that depend on ASR, like the
ones listed above; the relatively expensive co-processor hardware that is used
to accelerate ASR by big vendors to enable such applications; and the absence
of well-established benchmarks. The goal of this paper is to address the latter
two of these challenges. The paper first describes an ASR model, based on a
deep neural network inspired by recent work in this domain, and our experiences
building it. Then we evaluate this model on three CPU-GPU co-processor
platforms that represent different budget categories. Our results demonstrate
that utilizing hardware acceleration yields good results even without high-end
equipment. While the most expensive platform (10X price of the least expensive
one) converges to the initial accuracy target 10-30% and 60-70% faster than the
other two, the differences among the platforms almost disappear at slightly
higher accuracy targets. In addition, our results further highlight both the
difficulty of evaluating ASR systems due to the complex, long, and resource
intensive nature of the model training in this domain, and the importance of
establishing benchmarks for ASR.

the significant charger transfer is a sign that the interaction between the

surveillance and preparedness. Existing technologies employ different machine
learning approaches to predict incoming disasters from historical environmental
data. However, for short-term disasters (e.g., earthquakes), historical data
alone has a limited prediction capability. Therefore, additional sources of
warnings are required for accurate prediction. We consider social media as a
supplementary source of knowledge in addition to historical environmental data.
However, social media posts (e.g., tweets) is very informal and contains only
limited content. To alleviate these limitations, we propose the combination of
semantically-enriched word embedding models to represent entities in tweets
with their semantic representations computed with the traditionalword2vec.
Moreover, we study how the correlation between social media posts and typhoons

importance because of their immutable nature. Symbolic tools like OYENTE and
MAIAN are typically used for vulnerability prediction in smart contracts. As
these tools are computationally expensive, they are typically used to detect
vulnerabilities until some predefined invocation depth. These tools require
more search time as the invocation depth increases. Since the number of smart
contracts is increasing exponentially, it is difficult to analyze the contracts
using these traditional tools. Recently a machine learning technique called
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been used for binary classification, i.e., to
predict whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not. This technique requires
nearly constant search time as the invocation depth increases. In the present
article, we have shown a multi-class classification, where we classify a smart
contract in Suicidal, Prodigal, Greedy, or Normal categories. We used Average
Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM), which is a variant
of LSTM, to perform classification. We reduced the class imbalance (a large
number of normal contracts as compared to other categories) by considering only
the distinct opcode combination for normal contracts. We have achieved a
weighted average Fbeta score of 90.0%. Hence, such techniques can be used to
analyze a large number of smart contracts and help to improve the security of
these contracts.

to extract material parameters and interpret them thanks to data analysis
and/or physical modelling. RHEOS (RHEology, Open-Source) is a software package
designed to make the analysis of rheological data simpler, faster and more
reproducible. RHEOS is currently limited to the broad family of linear
viscoelastic models. A particular strength of the library is its ability to
handle rheological models containing fractional derivatives which have
demonstrable utility for the modelling of biological materials but have
hitherto remained in relative obscurity-possibly due to their mathematical and
computational complexity. RHEOS is written in Julia, which greatly assists
achievement of our aims as it provides excellent computational efficiency and
approachable syntax. RHEOS is fully documented and has extensive testing
coverage. It should be noted that RHEOS is not an optimisation package. It
builds on another optimisation package, NLopt, by adding a large number of
abstractions and functionality specific to the exploration of viscoelastic
