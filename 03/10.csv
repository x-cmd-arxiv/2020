by a sequence $ \lambda = \left( \lambda_{n} \right) \in \left( 0,\frac{1}{2}

)-C(\lambda )$ of $C(\lambda )$ is one of three possible sets: a finite union
of closed intervals, a Cantor set, and a Cantorval. Our main result describes
effective conditions for $(\lambda_{n})$ which guarantee that $C(\lambda

in several equivalent forms. Under additional assumptions, the measure of the
Cantorval $C(\lambda )-C(\lambda )$ is established. We give an application of
the proved theorems for the achievement sets of some fast convergent series.

of degeneracy (EPD) in two uniform (i.e., invariant along z) lossless and
gainless coupled transmission lines (CTLs), namely, a degenerate band edge
(DBE). Until now the DBE has been shown only in periodic structures. In
contrast, the CTLs considered here are uniform and subdivided into four cases
where the two TLs support combinations of forward propagation, backward
propagation and evanescent modes (when neglecting the mutual coupling). We
demonstrate for the first time that a DBE is supported in uniform CTLs when
there is proper coupling between: (i) propagating modes and evanescent modes,
(ii) forward and backward propagating modes, or (iii) four evanescent modes
(two in each direction). We also show that the loaded quality factor of uniform
CTLs exhibiting a fourth order EPD at k=0 is robust to series losses due to the
fact that the degenerate modes do not advance in phase. We also provide a
microstrip possible implementation of a uniform CTL exhibiting a DBE using
periodic series capacitors with very sub-wavelength unit-cell length. Finally,
we show an experimental verification of the existence DBE for a microstrip
implementation of a CTL supporting coupled propagating and evanescent modes.

incorporate sensors, distributed traffic controllers and V2X communication
technologies to provide fine-grained traffic control to mitigate congestion. As
in many other cyber-physical systems, smart traffic management systems
typically lack security measures. This allows numerous opportunities for
adversarial entities to craft attacks on the sensor networks, wireless data
sharing and/or the distributed traffic controllers. We show that such
vulnerabilities can be exploited to disrupt mobility in a large urban area and
cause unsafe conditions for drivers and the pedestrians on the roads.
Specifically, in this paper, we look into vulnerabilities in model-based
traffic controllers and show that, even with state-of-the-art attack detectors
in place, false-data injection can be used to hamper mobility. We demonstrate a
replay attack by modeling an isolated intersection in VISSIM, a popular traffic
simulator and also discuss countermeasures to thwart such attacks.

need for mechanisms whereby users can verify if service providers comply with

formal framework to study the design of such verification mechanisms for data
deletion requests -- also known as machine unlearning -- in the context of
systems that provide machine learning as a service (MLaaS). Our framework
allows the rigorous quantification of any verification mechanism based on
standard hypothesis testing. Furthermore, we propose a novel backdoor-based
verification mechanism and demonstrate its effectiveness in certifying data
deletion with high confidence, thus providing a basis for quantitatively
inferring machine unlearning.
  We evaluate our approach over a range of network architectures such as
multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN), residual

ML service's accuracy but provides high confidence verification of unlearning.
Our proposed mechanism works even if only a handful of users employ our system

5% of users participating, modifying half their data with a backdoor, and with
merely 30 test queries, our verification mechanism has both false positive and

(PnP) problem with the introduction of semantic centroids (SCs). The
closed-form solution of this PnP problem has been well researched and can be
found with existing PnP methods. Since the semantic centroid of the point cloud
usually does not accurately match with that of the corresponding image, the
accuracy of parameters are not improved even after a nonlinear refinement
process. Thus, a cost function based on the constraint of the correspondence
between semantic elements from both point cloud and image data is formulated.
Subsequently, optimal extrinsic parameters are estimated by minimizing the cost
function. We evaluate the proposed method either with GT or predicted semantics
on KITTI dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with the baseline method

built upon any (potentially distributed) algorithm that optimally solves the
NUM Problem and ensures all agents to obey the algorithm. We then extend this
idea to the dynamic case, when agents' types are dynamically evolving as a
controlled Markov process. In this case, the mechanism leads to incentive
compatible actions of agent for each time slot.

bounce scenario is studied where the form of the scale factor is given by $a(t)
= (a_0t^2 + 1)^n$. The ghost free character of the model is ensured by the
presence of a Lagrange multiplier, as developed in \cite{Nojiri:2018ouv}. The
conditions under which, in this model, the speed of gravitational waves becomes
equal to the speed of light (equal to one, in natural units), thus becoming
compatible with the striking event GW170817, is investigated. It is shown that
this happens for a class of Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling functions ($h(t)$) which
satisfies a constraint equation of the form $\ddot{h} = \dot{h}H$, with $H$ the
Hubble parameter. This constraint is then imposed on the ghost free
$f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity theory to be consistent with the GW170817 event,
subsequently, the corresponding non-singular bouncing cosmology with the
aforementioned scale factor is extensively studied. The forms of the coupling
function and Lagrange multiplier in the ""low curvature limit"" of the theory are
reconstructed, yielding a viable approximation for $n < 1/2$. Correspondingly,
by solving the cosmological perturbation equation, the main observable
quantities, namely the spectral index, tensor to scalar ratio, and the running
index are determined and confronted with the latest Planck 2018 data.
Consistency with the data is proven for those parametric regimes that which
correspond to $n < 1/2$. This makes the low curvature approximation a viable
one for calculating the scalar and tensor power spectra.

  Methods. We make use of full spectropolarimetric data from the CRisp Imaging

of a photospheric spectral line, which is used to infer the various physical
parameters of different quiet Sun regions by means of the solution of the

the north polar region and their comparison to the same analysis applied to
data taken at disc centre and low-latitude quiet Sun regions for reference. We
also analyse the spatial distribution of magnetic structures throughout the

  Results. We find that the physical properties of the polar region
(line-of-sight velocity, magnetic flux, magnetic inclination and magnetic
azimuth) are compatible with those found for the quiet Sun at disc centre and
are similar to the ones found at low latitudes close to the limb. Specifically,
the polar region magnetism presents no specific features. The structures for

related average liquid flow rate entrained over a thin disc for various

ballistic mechanism as liquid is lifted out of the pool by the rotating disc.
We then show that the flow rate in the entrained liquid film is controlled by
both viscous and surface tension forces as in the classical
Landau-Levich-Deryaguin problem despite the three dimensional, non-uniform and
unsteady nature of the flow, and also despite the large values of the film
thickness based flow Reynolds number. When the characteristic Froude and Weber
numbers become significant, strong inertial effects influence the entrained
liquid flux over the disc at large radius-to-immersion-depth ratio, namely via
entrainment by the disc's lateral walls and via a contribution to the flow rate

and provide useful guidelines for the design of AoI-efficient scheduling

that the update-size information can be leveraged for achieving a substantially
improved AoI compared to non-size-based (or arrival-time-based) policies. Then,
by utilizing both the update-size and arrival-time information, we propose
three AoI-based policies. Observing improved AoI performance of policies that
allow service preemption and that prioritize informative updates, we further
propose preemptive, informative, AoI-based scheduling policies. Our simulation
results show that such policies empirically achieve the best AoI performance
among all the considered policies. However, compared to the best
delay-efficient policies (such as Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (SRPT)),
the AoI improvement is rather marginal in the settings with exogenous arrivals.
Interestingly, we also prove sample-path equivalence between some size-based
policies and AoI-based policies. This provides an intuitive explanation for why
some size-based policies (such as SRPT) achieve a very good AoI performance.

process, where the evolution of the spin system is affected by the random field

can be treated as a random walk in phase space described either by a normal or
fractional phase diffusion equation. Based on these phase diffusion equations,
the NMR relaxation rates and equations can be obtained, exemplified in the
analysis of relaxations affected by an arbitrary random field, and by dipolar
coupling for both like and unlike spins. The obtained theoretical results are
consistent with the reported results in the literature. Additionally, the
anomalous relaxation expression obtained from the Mittag-Leffler function based
time correlation function can successfully fit the previously reported 13C T1

rank quantum integrable lattice models [1], we introduce some foundations to go
beyond the obtained complete transfer matrix spectrum description, and open the
way to the computation of matrix elements of local operators. This first
amounts to obtain simple expressions for scalar products of the so-called
separate states (transfer matrix eigenstates or some simple generalization of
them). In the higher rank case, left and right SoV bases are expected to be
pseudo-orthogonal, that is for a given SoV co-vector, there could be more than
one non-vanishing overlap with the vectors of the chosen right SoV basis. For
simplicity, we describe our method to get these pseudo-orthogonality overlaps
in the fundamental representations of the $\mathcal{Y}(gl_3)$ lattice model
with $N$ sites, a case of rank 2. The non-zero couplings between the co-vector
and vector SoV bases are exactly characterized. While the corresponding
SoV-measure stays reasonably simple and of possible practical use, we address
the problem of constructing left and right SoV bases which do satisfy standard
orthogonality. In our approach, the SoV bases are constructed by using families
of conserved charges. This gives us a large freedom in the SoV bases
construction, and allows us to look for the choice of a family of conserved
charges which leads to orthogonal co-vector/vector SoV bases. We first define
such a choice in the case of twist matrices having simple spectrum and zero
determinant. Then, we generalize the associated family of conserved charges and
orthogonal SoV bases to generic simple spectrum and invertible twist matrices.
Under this choice of conserved charges, and of the associated orthogonal SoV

  We prove for any finite poset $P$ that $sat(n,P)\le 2^{|P|-2}$, a bound

  Our main new tool is a special ordering of the sets based on the
colexicographic order. It turns out that if $P$ is given, processing the sets
in this order and adding the sets greedily into our family whenever this does
not ruin non-induced [induced] $P$-freeness, we tend to get a small size

proposes inverse feature learning (IFL) as a representation learning approach
that learns a set of high-level features based on the representation of error
for classification or clustering purposes. The proposed perspective about error
representation is fundamentally different from current learning methods, where
in classification approaches they interpret the error as a function of the
differences between the true labels and the predicted ones or in clustering
approaches, in which the clustering objective functions such as compactness are
used. Inverse feature learning method operates based on a deep clustering
approach to obtain a qualitative form of the representation of error as
features. The performance of the proposed IFL method is evaluated by applying
the learned features along with the original features, or just using the
learned features in different classification and clustering techniques for
several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads
to promising results in classification and especially in clustering. In
classification, the proposed features along with the primary features improve
the results of most of the classification methods on several popular data sets.
In clustering, the performance of different clustering methods is considerably
improved on different data sets. There are interesting results that show some
few features of the representation of error capture highly informative aspects
of primary features. We hope this paper helps to utilize the error
representation learning in different feature learning domains.

sources, i.e. consuming energy in stages and ejecting used stages, to
progressively reduce the mass of aerial vehicles in-flight which reduces power
consumption, and consequently increases flight time. A flight time vs. energy
storage mass analysis is presented to show the endurance benefit of staging to
multirotors. We consider two specific problems in discrete staging -- optimal
order of staging given a certain number of energy sources, and optimal
partitioning of a given energy storage mass budget into a given number of
stages. We then derive results for two continuously staged cases -- an internal
combustion engine driving propellers and a rocket engine. Notably, we show that
a multicopter powered by internal combustion has an upper limit on achievable
flight time independent of the available fuel mass, but no such limit exists
for rocket propulsion. Lastly, we validate the analysis with flight experiments
on a custom two-stage battery-powered quadcopter. This quadcopter can eject a
battery stage after consumption in-flight using a custom-designed mechanism,
and continue hovering using the next stage. The experimental flight times match
well with those predicted from the analysis for our vehicle. We achieve a 19%
increase in flight time using the batteries in two stages as compared to a

realized mathematically by adopting the Brink-Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\""opke
(Brink-THSR) wave functions as the bases to construct the interior wave
functions. The Bloch-Schr\""odinger equation is used to match the interior wave
functions continuously with the asymptotic boundary conditions of the resonant
and scattering states at the channel radius, which leads eventually to
solutions of the problem. As a first test of the formalism, the low-lying
resonant states of ${}^{8}$Be and the phase shifts of the $\alpha+\alpha$
elastic scattering are studied. The numerical results agree well with the
experimental data, which shows the validity of the theoretical framework.

kick and spin is imparted by partial fallback in an asymmetric explosion. Black
hole (BH) kicks of several hundred $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and spin

fallback results, and the remnant kick and spin remain small. If the explosion

find that the neutron star (NS) is spun up to millisecond periods. The high

formation around black holes. Fallback may thus be a pathway towards
millisecond-magnetar or collapsar-type engines for hypernovae and gamma-ray

higher accuracy because of their ability to select against low-redshift
quiescent and faint dusty interloper galaxies. We also explore the near-IR

procedure that associates H$_2$ to dark-matter haloes based on a series of
scaling relations inferred from observations, ii) a model that assumes chemical
equilibrium between the H$_2$ formation and destruction rates, and iii) a model
that fully solves the out-of-equilibrium rate equations and accounts for the
unresolved structure of molecular clouds. We study the impact of finite spatial
resolution and show that robust H$_2$ masses at redshift $z\approx 4$ can only
be obtained for galaxies that are sufficiently metal enriched in which H$_2$
formation is fast. This corresponds to H$_2$ reservoirs with masses
$M_{\mathrm{H_2}}\gtrsim 6\times 10^9 \mathrm{M}_\odot$. In this range,
equilibrium and non-equilibrium models predict similar molecular masses (but
different galaxy morphologies) while the semi-empirical method produces less

10 Schwarzschild radii from the event horizon, we observe plasmoids forming,
after which they can merge, grow to macroscopic scales of the order of a few
Schwarzschild radii, and are ultimately advected along the jet's sheath or into
the disk. Large plasmoids are energized to relativistic temperatures via
reconnection and contribute to the jet's limb-brightening. We find that only
hot spots forming in magnetically arrested disks can potentially explain the
energetics of Sgr A* flares. The flare period is determined by the reconnection
rate, which we find to be between 0.01c and 0.03c in all cases, consistent with
studies of reconnection in isolated Harris-type current sheets. We quantify
magnetic dissipation and non-ideal electric fields which can efficiently inject
non-thermal particles. We show that explicit resistivity allows for converged
numerical solutions, such that the electromagnetic energy evolution and
dissipation become independent of the grid scale for the extreme resolutions
considered here.

processes and can typically be studied through polarization observations.
Polarimetric interferometry capabilities of modern (sub)millimeter telescope
facilities have made it possible to obtain detailed velocity resolved maps of
molecular line polarization. To properly analyze these for the information they
carry regarding the magnetic field, the development of adaptive
three-dimensional polarized line radiative transfer models is necessary. Aims.
We aim to develop an easy-to-use program to simulate the polarization maps of
molecular and atomic (sub)millimeter lines in magnetized astrophysical regions,
such as protostellar disks, circumstellar envelopes, or molecular clouds.
Methods. By considering the local anisotropy of the radiation field as the only
alignment mechanism, we can model the alignment of molecular or atomic species
inside a regular line radiative transfer simulation by only making use of the
converged output of this simulation. Calculations of the aligned molecular or
atomic states can subsequently be used to ray trace the polarized maps of the
three-dimensional simulation. Results. We present a three-dimensional radiative
transfer code, POlarized Radiative Transfer Adapted to Lines (PORTAL), that can
simulate the emergence of polarization in line emission through a magnetic
field of arbitrary morphology. Our model can be used in stand-alone mode,
assuming LTE excitation, but it is best used when processing the output of
regular three-dimensional (nonpolarized) line radiative transfer modeling
codes. We present the spectral polarization map of test cases of a collapsing
sphere and protoplanetary disk for multiple three-dimensional magnetic field
morphologies.

reproduced with a Gaussian abundance distribution spatially centred on the

separating the light of a faint off-axis source from that of its parent star.
Forthcoming space facilities, such as WFIRST/LUVOIR/HabEX, are expected to use
coronagraphic instruments capable of imaging and spectroscopy in order to
understand the physical properties of remote worlds. The primary technological
challenge that drives the design of these instruments involves the precision
control of wavefront phase and amplitude errors. Several FPWS and control
techniques have been proposed and demonstrated in laboratory to achieve the
required accuracy. However, these techniques have never been tested and
compared under the same laboratory conditions. This paper compares two of these
techniques in a closed loop in visible light: the pair-wise (PW) associated
with electric field conjugation (EFC) and self-coherent camera (SCC). We first
ran numerical simulations to optimize PW wavefront sensing and to predict the
performance of a coronagraphic instrument with PW associated to EFC wavefront
control, assuming modeling errors for both PW and EFC. Then we implemented the
techniques on a laboratory testbed. We introduced known aberrations into the
system and compared the wavefront sensing using both PW and SCC. The speckle
intensity in the coronagraphic image was then minimized using PW+EFC and SCC
independently. We demonstrate that both SCC and PW+EFC can generate a dark hole
in space-like conditions in a few iterations. Both techniques reach the current
limitation of our laboratory bench and provide coronagraphic contrast levels of

Their identification result builds on a monotonicity condition with respect to

that the structure and shape of the fireball, and consequently the

${\mathcal{E}}_n(\eta)$. This leads to eccentricity decorrelation between
different $\eta$, driving the longitudinal flow decorrelations observed in the

structure, we have estimated the eccentricity decorrelations and related them
to the measured flow decorrelation coefficients for elliptic flow $n=2$ and
triangular flow $n=3$. We investigated the dependence of eccentricity
decorrelations on the choice of collision system in terms of the size,
asymmetry and deformation of the nuclei. We found that these nuclear geometry

perturbations, e.g., Moreton or EIT waves.
  Aims. Our aim is to analyze the properties of large-amplitude oscillations
using realistic prominence models and the triggering mechanism by external
disturbances.
  Methods. We perform time-dependent numerical simulations of LAOs using a
magnetic flux rope model with two values of the shear angle and the density
contrast. We study the internal modes of the prominence using the horizontal
and vertical triggering. In addition, we use the perturbation that arrives from
outside in order to understand how such external disturbance can produce LAOs.
  Results. The period of longitudinal oscillations and its behavior with height
show good agreement with the pendulum model. The period of transverse
oscillations remains constant with height, suggesting a global normal mode. The
transverse oscillations typically have shorter periods than the longitudinal
oscillations.
  Conclusions. The periods of the longitudinal and transverse oscillations show
only weak dependence on the shear angle of the magnetic structure and the
prominence density contrast. The external disturbance perturbs the flux rope
exciting oscillations of both polarizations. Their properties are a mixture of
those excited by purely horizontal and vertical driving.

second order methods. In this paper, we illustrate how to apply the MB4 method
to a concrete ordinary differential equation using the nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger-type equation on a two-dimensional grid as an example. This
system is a prototypical model of two-dimensional disordered organic material
and is difficult to solve with standard methods like the classical Runge--Kutta
methods due to the nonlinearity and the $\delta$-function like potential coming
from defects. Numerical tests show that the method can solve the equation
stably and preserves the total energy to 16-digit accuracy throughout the
simulation. It is also shown that parallelization of the method yields up to
2.8 times speedup using 3 computational nodes.

explore the obscuration properties of these red AGNs with both X-ray
spectroscopy and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In this study, we
re-visit the relation between optical/MIR extinction and X-ray absorption. We
use IR selection criteria, specifically the $W1$ and $W2$ WISE bands, to
identify 4798 AGNs in the $\it{XMM-XXL}$ area ($\sim 25$deg$^2$). Application
of optical/MIR colours ($r- W2 > 6$) reveals 561 red AGNs (14$\%$). Of these,
47 have available X-ray spectra with at least 50 net (background-subtracted)
counts per detector. For these sources, we construct SEDs from the optical to
the MIR using the CIGALE code. The SED fitting shows that 44 of these latter 47
sources present clear signs of obscuration based on the AGN emission and the
estimated inclination angle. Fitting the SED also reveals ten systems
($\sim20\%$) which are dominated by the galaxy. In these cases, the red colours
are attributed to the host galaxy rather than AGN absorption. Excluding these
ten systems from our sample and applying X-ray spectral fitting analysis shows
that up to $76\%$ (28/37) of the IR red AGNs present signs of X-ray absorption.
Thus, there are nine sources ($\sim20\%$ of the sample) that although optically
red, are not substantially X-ray absorbed. Approximately $50\%$ of these
sources present broad emission lines in their optical spectra. We suggest that
the reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the r-W2 criterion is
sensitive to smaller amounts of obscuration relative to the X-ray spectroscopy.
In conclusion, it appears that the majority of red AGNs present considerable
obscuration levels as shown by their SEDs. Their X-ray absorption is moderate

with random coupling where the fraction of antiferromagnetic links $a$ can be
gradually tuned. We show that, upon increasing such fraction, the behavior
changes in a radical way. Small $a$ does not prevent the system from a complete
ordering, but this occurs in an extremely (logarithmically) slow manner.
However, larger values of this parameter destroy complete ordering, due to
frustration, and the evolution is comparatively faster (algebraic). Our study
shows a precise correspondence between the kind of developing order,
ferromagnetic versus frustrated, and the speed of evolution. The aging
properties of the system are studied by focusing on the scaling properties of
two-time quantities, the autocorrelation and linear response functions. We find
that the contribution of equilibrium and an aging part to these functions
occurs differently in the various regions of the phase diagram of the model.
When quenching inside the ferromagnetic phase, the two-time quantities are
obtained by the addition of these parts. Instead, in the paramagnetic phase,
these two contributions enter multiplicatively. Both of the scaling forms are
shown with excellent accuracy, and the corresponding scaling functions and
exponents have been determined and discussed.

around hundreds of thousands of FGK dwarf stars. He, Ford, & Ragozzine (2019)
(arXiv:1907.07773) applied forward modeling to infer the distribution of
intrinsic architectures of planetary systems, developed a clustered Poisson
point process model for exoplanetary systems (SysSim) to reproduce the marginal
distributions of the observed Kepler population, and they showed that orbital
periods and planet radii are clustered within a given planetary system. Here,
we extend the clustered model to explore correlations between planetary systems
and their host star properties. We split the sample of Kepler FGK dwarfs into
two halves and model the fraction of stars with planets (between 0.5-10
$R_\oplus$ and 3--300 days), $f_{\rm swpa}$, as a linear function of the Gaia
DR2 color. We confirm previous findings that the occurrence of these planetary
systems rises significantly toward later type (redder) stars. The fraction of
stars with planets increases from $f_{\rm swpa} = 0.32_{-0.11}^{+0.12}$ for F2V
dwarfs to $f_{\rm swpa} = 0.96_{-0.19}^{+0.04}$ for mid K-dwarfs. About half
($f_{\rm swpa} = 0.57_{-0.10}^{+0.14}$) of all solar-type (G2V) dwarfs harbor a
planetary system between 3 and 300 days. This simple model can closely match
the observed multiplicity distributions of both the bluer and redder halves in
our sample, suggesting that the architectures of planetary systems around stars
of different spectral types may be similar aside from a shift in the overall
fraction of planet hosting stars.

string theory, where one interprets the domain walls that separate up spins
from down spins as two-dimensional string worldsheets. The usual Ising
Hamiltonian measures the area of these domain walls. This theory has string
coupling of unit magnitude. We add new local terms to the Ising Hamiltonian
that further weight each spin configuration by a factor depending on the genus
of the corresponding domain wall, resulting in a new 3d Ising model that has a
tunable bare string coupling $g_s$. We use a combination of analytical and
numerical methods to analyze the phase structure of this model as $g_s$ is
varied. We study statistical properties of the topology of worldsheets and
discuss the prospects of using this new deformation at weak string coupling to
find a worldsheet description of the 3d Ising transition.

of the one-dimensional (1D) quantum well extracts similarities and differences
of the R\'{e}nyi $R(\alpha)$ as well as Tsallis $T(\alpha)$ entropies between
these two geometries. It is shown, in particular, that for either BC the
dependencies of the R\'{e}nyi position components on the parameter $\alpha$ are
the same for all orbitals but the lowest Neumann one for which the
corresponding functional $R$ is not influenced by the variation of $\alpha$.
Lower limit $\alpha_{TH}$ of the semi infinite range of the dimensionless
R\'{e}nyi/Tsallis coefficient where {\em momentum} entropies exist crucially
depends on the {\em position} BC and is equal to one quarter for the Dirichlet
requirement and one half for the Neumann one. At $\alpha$ approaching this
critical value, the corresponding momentum functionals do diverge. The gap
between the thresholds $\alpha_{TH}$ of the two BCs causes different behavior
of the R\'{e}nyi uncertainty relations as functions of $\alpha$. For both
configurations, the lowest-energy level at $\alpha=1/2$ does saturate either
type of the entropic inequality thus confirming an earlier surmise about it. It
is also conjectured that the threshold $\alpha_{TH}$ of one half is
characteristic of any 1D non-Dirichlet system. Other properties are discussed
and analyzed from the mathematical and physical points of view.

matches perovskites optical absorption depth, opening the possibility to design
new optoelectronic device architectures with improved performances, and

Networks (MANET) with vehicles as mobile nodes. VANET facilitate vehicles to
share safety and non-safety information through messages. Safety information
includes road accidents, natural hazards, roadblocks, etc. Non-safety
information includes tolling information, traveler information, etc. The main
goal behind sharing this information is to enhance road safety and reduce road
accidents by alerting the driver about the unexpected hazards. However, routing
of messages in VANET is challenging due to packet delays arising from high
mobility of vehicles, frequently changing topology and high density of
vehicles, leading to frequent route breakages and packet losses. This report
summarizes the performance analysis of safety and non-safety message
dissemination techniques in VANET based on the fog computing technique. Three
main metrics to improve the performance of message dissemination are: 1) delay,
2) probability of message delivery, and 3) throughput. Analysis of such metrics
plays an important role to improve the performance of existing message
dissemination techniques. Simulations are usually conducted based on the
metrics using ns-2 and Java discrete event simulator. The above three
performance metrics and results published in literature help one to understand
and increase the performance of various message dissemination techniques in a
VANET environment.

fifteen years ago with the multiparameter reweighting method by studying Fisher
zeros. We first reproduce the old result with an exact algorithm (not known at
the time) and with statistics larger by an order of magnitude. As an extension
of the old analysis we introduce stout smearing in the fermion action in order
to reduce the finite lattice spacing effects. First we show that increasing the
smearing parameter $\rho$ the crossover at $\mu = 0$ gets weaker, i.e., the
leading Fisher zero gets farther away from the real axis. Furthermore as the
chemical potential is increased the overlap problem gets severe sooner than in
the unimproved case, therefore shrinking the range of applicability of the
method. Nevertheless certain qualitative features remain, even after
introducing the smearing. Namely, at small chemical potentials the Fisher zeros
first get farther away from the real axis and later at around $a\mu _q = 0.1 -
0.15$ they start to get closer, i.e., the crossover first gets weaker and later
stronger as a function of $\mu$. However, because of the more severe overlap
problem the CEP is out of reach with the smeared action.

often termed ""superadditive capacity"". In this paper, we consider the simplest
scenario where a large superadditive capacity is known: a pure-loss channel

described by an inner product that is a function of the mean photon number per

""belief-propagation with quantum messages"" (BPQM) (arXiv:1607.04833). We
quantify its performance improvement over the Dolinar receiver that performs

different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the

face two common problems: 1) these converge to different settings with
different initial conditions and; 2) the number of clusters has to be
arbitrarily decided beforehand. This problem has become critical in the realm
of big data. Recently, clustering algorithms have emerged which can speedup
computations using parallel processing over the grid but face the
aforementioned problems. Goals: Our goals are to find methods to cluster data
which: 1) guarantee convergence to the same settings irrespective of the
initial conditions; 2) eliminate the need to establish the number of clusters
beforehand, and 3) can be applied to cluster large datasets. Methods: We
introduce a method that combines probabilistic and combinatorial clustering
methods to produce repeatable and compact clusters that are not sensitive to
initial conditions. This method harnesses the power of k-means (a combinatorial
clustering method) to cluster/partition very large dimensional datasets and
uses the Gaussian Mixture Model (a probabilistic clustering method) to validate
the k-means partitions. Results: We show that this method produces very compact
clusters that are not sensitive to initial conditions. This method can be used
to identify the most 'separable' set in a dataset which increases the
'clusterability' of a dataset. This method also eliminates the need to specify
the number of clusters in advance.

dwarf spheroidal galaxy NGC 5253. We show that a large turbulent pressure in
the central zones of D1 cluster may cause individual wind-blown bubbles to
reach pressure confinement before encountering their neighbors. In this case
stellar winds are added to the hot shocked wind pockets of gas around
individual massive stars that leads them to meet and produce a cluster wind in
time-scales less than $10^5$ yrs. In order to inhibit the possibility of cloud
dispersal, or the early negative star formation feedback, one should account
for mass loading that may come, for example, from pre-main sequence (PMS)
low-mass stars through photo-evaporation of their proto-stellar disks. Mass
loading at a rate in excess of 8$\times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ per each
PMS star is required to extend the hidden star cluster phase in this particular
cluster. In this regime, the parental cloud remains relatively unperturbed,
while pockets of molecular, photoionized and hot gas coexist within the star
forming region. Nevertheless, the most likely scenario for cloud D1 and its
embedded cluster is that the hot shocked winds around individual massive stars
should merge at an age of a few millions of years when the PMS star
proto-stellar disks vanish and mass loading ceases that allows a cluster to
form a global wind.

accurate localization is needed. However, these systems are expensive and most
require a fixed setup. Recently, visual-inertial odometry and similar methods
have advanced to a point where autonomous UAVs can rely on them for
localization. The main limitation in this case comes from the environment, as
well as in long-term autonomy due to accumulating error if loop closure cannot

into a vast network of filamentary structures colloquially termed the Cosmic
Web. Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark)
or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are
limited. Wide-field surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy
distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10% of baryonic
matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) via

the Physarum polycephalum slime mold that is able to infer the density field of

action executions are becoming increasingly complex, ranging from simulators
that do physics-based reasoning to precomputed analytical motion primitives.
However, robots operating in the real world often face situations not modeled
by these models before execution. This imperfect modeling can lead to highly
suboptimal or even incomplete behavior during execution. In this paper, we
propose CMAX an approach for interleaving planning and execution. CMAX adapts
its planning strategy online during real-world execution to account for any
discrepancies in dynamics during planning, without requiring updates to the
dynamics of the model. This is achieved by biasing the planner away from
transitions whose dynamics are discovered to be inaccurately modeled, thereby
leading to robot behavior that tries to complete the task despite having an
inaccurate model. We provide provable guarantees on the completeness and
efficiency of the proposed planning and execution framework under specific
assumptions on the model, for both small and large state spaces. Our approach
CMAX is shown to be efficient empirically in simulated robotic tasks including
4D planar pushing, and in real robotic experiments using PR2 involving a 3D
pick-and-place task where the mass of the object is incorrectly modeled, and a
7D arm planning task where one of the joints is not operational leading to
discrepancy in dynamics. The video of our physical robot experiments can be

under combined dc and ac drives, a series of steps can appear in the velocity
force curves that are known as Shapiro steps. Here we show that for skyrmions
driven over a two-dimensional periodic obstacle array with a dc drive and an ac
drive that is either parallel or perpendicular to the dc drive, the system
exhibits numerous transverse and longitudinal synchronization dynamics due to
the Magnus force. These phenomena originate in interactions between two
different types of phase locking effects: Shapiro steps and directional
locking. In some cases, the skyrmion Hall angle is constant but longitudinal
Shapiro steps appear, while in other regimes the skyrmion Hall angle can either
increase or decrease with increasing dc drive during the phase locking as the
skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the obstacle lattice. For a
transverse ac drive we find that strong Hall angle overshoots can occur in
certain locked phases where the skyrmion is moving at an angle that is
considerably larger than the intrinsic Hall angle. For the strongest Magnus
force, the phase locking effects are reduced and there are larger regions of
disordered dynamics. We show that the skyrmion Hall angle can be controlled by
fixing the dc drive and changing the amplitude of the ac drive.

one follows a system of differential equations for a random time, after which
the environmental state changes, and one follows a different set of

Finally, we look at stochastic differential equations with switching, which
take into account both the white noise fluctuations and the random

deformations. Because of their deformational response to external magnetic
fields, magnetic gels and elastomers represent ideal candidates for such tasks.
Mostly, linear magnetostrictive deformations, that is, elongations or
contractions along straight axes are discussed in this context. In contrast to
that, we here suggest to realize a twist actuator that responds by torsional
deformations around the axis of the applied magnetic field. For this purpose,
we theoretically investigate the overall mechanical response of a basic model
system containing discrete magnetizable particles in a soft elastic matrix. Two
different types of discrete particle arrangements are used as starting
conditions in the nonmagnetized state. These contain globally twisted
anisotropic particle arrangements on the one hand, and groups of discrete
helical-like particle structures positioned side by side on the other hand.
Besides the resulting twist upon magnetization, we also evaluate different
other modes of deformation. Our analysis supports the construction of
magnetically orientable and actuatable torsional mixing devices in fluidic
applications or other types of soft actuators that initiate relative rotations
between different components.

  Using Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a crucial step to achieve effective semantic segmentation of lane
marking during the construction of the lane level high-precision map. In recent
years, many image semantic segmentation methods have been proposed. These
methods mainly focus on the image from camera, due to the limitation of the
sensor itself, the accurate three-dimensional spatial position of the lane
marking cannot be obtained, so the demand for the lane level high-precision map
construction cannot be met. This paper proposes a lane marking semantic
segmentation method based on LIDAR and camera fusion deep neural network.
Different from other methods, in order to obtain accurate position information
of the segmentation results, the semantic segmentation object of this paper is
a bird's eye view converted from a LIDAR points cloud instead of an image
captured by a camera. This method first uses the deeplabv3+ [\ref{ref:1}]
network to segment the image captured by the camera, and the segmentation
result is merged with the point clouds collected by the LIDAR as the input of
the proposed network. In this neural network, we also add a long short-term
memory (LSTM) structure to assist the network for semantic segmentation of lane
markings by using the the time series information. The experiments on more than
14,000 image datasets which we have manually labeled and expanded have shown
the proposed method has better performance on the semantic segmentation of the
points cloud bird's eye view. Therefore, the automation of high-precision map
construction can be significantly improved. Our code is available at

consider is characterized by four degrees of freedom which are the mass and
electric charge of the black hole, the mass of the graviton field, and a
cosmological constant. For the charged and neutral cases separately, we present
various constraints among scalar polynomial curvature invariants which could
invariantly characterize our desired spacetimes. Specially, an appropriate
scalar polynomial curvature invariant and a Cartan curvature invariant which
together could detect the black hole horizon would be explicitly constructed.
Using algorithms related to the focusing properties of a bundle of light rays
on the horizon which are accounted for by the Raychaudhuri equation, a
procedure for isolating the black hole parameters, as the algebraic
combinations involving the curvature invariants, would be presented. It will be
shown that this technique could specially be applied for black holes with zero
electric charge, contrary to the cases of solutions of lower-dimensional
non-massive gravity. In addition, for the case of massive (2+1)-dimensional
black hole, the irreducible mass, which quantifies the maximum amount of energy
which could be extracted from a black hole would be derived. Therefore, we show
that the Hawking temperatures of these black holes could be reduced to the pure
curvature properties of the spacetimes. Finally, we comment on the relationship
between our analysis and the novel roles it could play in numerical quark-gluon
plasma simulations and other QCD models and also black hole information paradox

they can be predicted in the initial linear density field from the coalescence
of critical points with increasing smoothing scale, used here as a proxy for
cosmic time. Beyond the mergers of peaks with saddle points (a proxy for halo
mergers), we consider the coalescence and nucleation of all sets of critical
points, including wall-saddle to filament-saddle and wall-saddle to minima (a
proxy for filament and void mergers respectively), as they impact the geometry
of galactic infall, and in particular filament disconnection. Analytical
predictions of the one-point statistics are validated against multiscale
measurements in 2D and 3D realisations of Gaussian random fields (the
corresponding code being available upon request) and compared qualitatively to
cosmological $N$-body simulations at early times ($z\geq 10$) and large scales
($\geq 5\, \mathrm{Mpc}/h$). The rate of filament coalescence is compared to
the merger rate of haloes and the two-point clustering of these events is
computed, along with their cross-correlations with critical points. These
correlations are qualitatively consistent with the preservation of the
connectivity of dark matter haloes, and the impact of the large scale
structures on assembly bias. The destruction rate of haloes and voids as a
function of mass and redshift is quantified down to $z=0$ for a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. The one-point statistics in higher dimensions are also presented,
together with consistency relations between critical point and critical event

profit-maximizing investors receive an information signal regarding the

initial inventory, who trades against a competitive limit order book populated
by liquidity suppliers. We show that an equilibrium exists for bounded signal
distributions, obtain closed form solutions for Bernoulli-type signals and
propose a straightforward iterative algorithm to compute the equilibrium order
book for the general case. We obtain the exact analytic asymptotics for the
market impact of large trades and show that the functional form depends on the
tail distribution of the private signal of the insiders. In particular, the
impact follows a power law if the signal has fat tails while the law is
logarithmic in case of lighter tails. Moreover, the tail distribution of the
trade volume in equilibrium obeys a power law in our model. We find that the
liquidity suppliers charge a minimum bid-ask spread that is independent of the
amount of `noise' trading but increasing in the degree of informational
advantage of insiders in equilibrium. The model also predicts that the order
book flattens as the amount of noise trading increases converging to a model
with proportional transactions costs.. Competition among the insiders leads to
aggressive trading causing the aggregate profit to vanish in the limiting case
$N\to\infty$. The numerical results also show that the spread increases with
the number of insiders keeping the other parameters fixed. Finally, an
equilibrium may not exist if the liquidation value is unbounded. We conjecture
that existence of equilibrium requires a sufficient amount of competition among
insiders if the signal distribution exhibit fat tails.

state transitions and rewards are affected by the environmental context.
Specifically, we consider a demonstrator agent that has access to a

goal is to transfer this experience, excluding the underlying contextual
information, to a learner agent that does not have access to the environmental

well known that, disregarding the causal effect of the contextual information,
can introduce bias in the transition and reward models estimated by the
learner, resulting in a learned suboptimal policy. To address this challenge,
in this paper, we develop a method to obtain causal bounds on the transition

causal bounds on the value functions. Using these value function bounds, we
propose new Q learning and UCB-Q learning algorithms that converge to the true
value function without bias. We provide numerical experiments for robot motion

demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively make use of the data

issue by taking into account the region irregularity into their comparison
model. Nevertheless, they remain sub-optimal to provide robust and accurate
superpixel neighborhood descriptors, since they only compute features within

this work, we address these limitations by introducing the dual superpatch, a
novel superpixel neighborhood descriptor. This structure contains features
computed in reduced superpixel regions, as well as at the interfaces of
multiple superpixels to explicitly capture contour structure information. A
fast multi-scale non-local matching framework is also introduced for the search

the leading-order improvements to model forecast skill using this distributed

compare forecast skill to the same model without data assimilation. Even with a
basic assimilation strategy as used here, we find remarkable improvements to
forecast accuracy from the incorporation of wave buoy observations, with a 27%
reduction in root-mean-square error in significant waveheights overall. For an
extreme event, where forecast accuracy is particularly relevant, we observe
considerable improvements in both arrival time and magnitude of the swell on

Refinements to the assimilation strategy are straightforward to achieve and

polymer. For example, a polymer dissolved in a poor solvent collapses, whereas
in a good solvent it opens up. While this standard understanding is generally
valid, there are examples when a polymer collapses even in a mixture of two
good solvents. This phenomenon, commonly known as co-non-solvency, is usually
associated with smart polymers. Moreover, recent experiments have shown that
the elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) show co-non-solvency behavior in
aqueous-ethanol mixtures. In this study, we investigate the phase behavior of
ELPs in aqueous binary mixtures using molecular dynamics simulations of
all-atom and complementary explicit solvent generic models. The model is
parameterized by mapping the solvation free energy obtained from the all-atom
simulations onto the generic interaction parameters. For this purpose, we
derive segment based generic parameters for four different peptides, namely
proline (P), valine (V), glycine (G) and alanine (A). Here we compare the
conformational behavior of two ELP sequences, namely VPGGG and VPGVG, in
aqueous-ethanol and -urea mixtures. Consistent with recent experiments, we find
that ELPs show co-non-solvency in aqueous-ethanol mixtures. Ethanol molecules
have preferential binding with all ELP residues and thus driving the
coil-to-globule transition. On the contrary, ELP conformations show weak
variation in aqueous-urea mixtures. Our simulations suggest that the glycine
residues dictate the overall behavior of ELPs in aqueous-urea, where urea
molecules have a rather weak preferential binding with glycine, i.e., less than
kT. While the validation of the latter findings will require more detailed
experimental investigation, the results presented here may provide a new twist
to the present understanding of cosolvent interactions with peptides and
proteins.

so-called ""minihaloes"", with masses of $\sim10^5$-$10^8\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
accreting their gas from the intergalactic medium through H$_2$ cooling. Such
molecularly cooled galaxies (MCGs) mostly formed in pristine environments,
hosted massive, metal-free stars, and were eventually sterilized by the
build-up of a disassociating (Lyman-Werner; LW) background. Therefore, their
properties might be very different from the galaxies we see in the later
Universe. Although MCGs are probably too faint to be observed directly, we
could nevertheless infer their properties from the imprint they leave in the
cosmic 21-cm signal. Here we quantify this imprint by extending the public
simulation code 21cmFAST to allow for a distinct population of MCGs. We allow
MCGs to have different properties from other galaxies, including unique scaling
relations for their stellar-to-halo mass ratios, ionizing escape fractions, and
spectral energy distributions. We track inhomogeneous recombinations,
disassociative LW feedback, and photoheating from reionization. After
demonstrating how MCGs can shape the 21-cm signal, we explore to what extent
current observations can already place constraints on their properties. The
cosmic microwave background optical depth from Planck sets an upper limit on
the product of the ionizing escape fraction and the stellar mass in MCGs. When
including also the timing of the putative EDGES absorption signal, we find an
additional strong degeneracy between the stellar mass and the X-ray luminosity
of MCGs. If proven to be of cosmic origin, the timing of the EDGES signal would
have been set by MCGs.

which is impossible to implement in real-time applications. One method of
control is to apply the mean-field game (MFG) framework which substantially
reduces communications among the UAVs. However, to realize this framework,
powerful processors are required to obtain the control laws at different UAVs.
This requirement limits the usage of the MFG framework for real-time
applications such as massive UAV control. Thus, a function approximator based
on neural networks (NN) is utilized to approximate the solutions of
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations.
Nevertheless, using an approximate solution can violate the conditions for
convergence of the MFG framework. Therefore, the federated learning (FL)

railroads to a halt in the 1950s. Presently, the U.S. has no high-speed trains,
aside from sections of Amtrak s Acela line in the Northeast Corridor that can
reach 150 mph for only 34 miles of its 457-mile span. The average speed between
New York and Boston is about 65 mph. On the other hand, China has the world s
fastest and largest high-speed rail network, with more than 19,000 miles, of
which the vast majority was built in the past decade. Japan s bullet trains can
reach nearly 200 miles per hour and dates to the 1960s. That system moved more
than 9 billion people without a single passenger casualty. In this systematic
review, we studied the effect of High-Speed Rail (HSR) on the U.S. and other
countries including France, Japan, Germany, Italy, and China in terms of energy
consumption, land use, economic development, travel behavior, time use, human
health, and quality of life.

candidate detection, aims to detect suspicious pulmonary nodules. However,
detected candidates include many false positives and thus in the following
stage, false positive reduction, such false positives are reliably reduced.
Note that this task is challenging due to 1) the imbalance between the numbers
of nodules and non-nodules and 2) the intra-class diversity of non-nodules.
Although techniques using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown
promising performance, they suffer from high computational complexity which
hinders constructing deep networks. To efficiently address these problems, we
propose a novel framework using the ensemble of 2D CNNs using single views,
which outperforms existing 3D CNN-based methods.
  Methods: Our ensemble of 2D CNNs utilizes single-view 2D patches to improve
both computational and memory efficiency compared to previous techniques
exploiting 3D CNNs. We first categorize non-nodules on the basis of features
encoded by an autoencoder. Then, all 2D CNNs are trained by using the same
nodule samples, but with different types of non-nodules. By extending the
learning capability, this training scheme resolves difficulties of extracting
representative features from non-nodules with large appearance variations. Note
that, instead of manual categorization requiring the heavy workload of
radiologists, we propose to automatically categorize non-nodules based on the
autoencoder and k-means clustering.

the non-uniform array (NUA) case. Traditionally, gridless DOA estimation and
root-MUSIC are only applicable for measurements from a uniform linear array

Toeplitz structure, and both algorithms are based on the Vandermonde
decomposition of a Toeplitz matrix. The Vandermonde decomposition breaks a
Toeplitz matrix into its harmonic components, from which the DOAs are
estimated. First, we present the `irregular' Toeplitz matrix and irregular
Vandermonde decomposition (IVD), which generalizes the Vandermonde
decomposition to apply to a more general set of matrices. It is shown that the
IVD is related to the MUSIC and root-MUSIC algorithms. Next, gridless DOA is
generalized to the NUA case using IVD. The resulting non-convex optimization
problem is solved using alternating projections (AP). A numerical analysis is
performed on the AP based solution which shows that the generalization to NUAs

these challenges, we present a semi-supervised machine learning approach for
detecting fingerprinting scripts. Our approach is based on the core insight
that fingerprinting scripts have similar patterns of API access when generating
their fingerprints, even though their access patterns may not match exactly.
Using this insight, we group scripts by their JavaScript (JS) execution traces
and apply a semi-supervised approach to detect new fingerprinting scripts. We
detail our methodology and demonstrate its ability to identify the majority of
scripts ($\geqslant$94.9%) identified by existing heuristic techniques. We also
show that the approach expands beyond detecting known scripts by surfacing
candidate scripts that are likely to include fingerprinting. Through an
analysis of these candidate scripts we discovered fingerprinting scripts that
were missed by heuristics and for which there are no heuristics. In particular,
we identified over one hundred device-class fingerprinting scripts present on
hundreds of domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
device-class fingerprinting has been measured in the wild. These successes
illustrate the power of a sparse vector representation and semi-supervised

times, have been widely used in optical fiber and waveguide based quantum
communications. With the recent developments in distributed quantum
computation, it is logical to ask whether time-bin encoded qubits may be useful
in that context. We have recently realized a time-bin qubit controlled-phase
(C-Phase) gate using a 2 X 2 optical switch based on a lithium niobate
waveguide, with which we demonstrated the generation of an entangled state.
However, the experiment was performed with only a pair of input states, and
thus the functionality of the C-Phase gate was not fully verified. In this
research, we used quantum process tomography to establish a process fidelity of
97.1%. Furthermore, we demonstrated the controlled-NOT gate operation with a
process fidelity greater than 94%. This study confirms that typical two-qubit
logic gates used in quantum computational circuits can be implemented with
time-bin qubits, and thus it is a significant step forward for realization of
distributed quantum computation based on time-bin qubits.

visual servoing methods. The training procedure for our model enables effective
learning of the kinematics, feature structure, and camera parameters,
simultaneously. This can be done with no prior information about the robot,
structure, and cameras that observe it. Learning is done sample-efficiently and
shows strong generalization to test data. Since our formulation is modular, we
can modify components of our setup, like cameras and objects, and relearn them
quickly online. Our method can handle noise in the observed state and noise in
the controllers that we interact with. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

However, recent work has shown limitations of this approach when label

conditioned on the label, there exists a representation of the input that is
invariant between the source and target domains. Under $GLS$, we provide
theoretical guarantees on the transfer performance of any classifier. We also
devise necessary and sufficient conditions for $GLS$ to hold, by using an
estimation of the relative class weights between domains and an appropriate
reweighting of samples. Our weight estimation method could be straightforwardly
and generically applied in existing domain adaptation (DA) algorithms that
learn domain-invariant representations, with small computational overhead. In

their performance on standard and artificial DA tasks. Our algorithms

pseudosymmetry by building upon the dictionary indexing method and augmenting
it with the application of global optimization to fit accurate pattern centers,
clustering of the Hough-indexed orientations to focus the dictionary in
orientation space, and interpolation to improve the accuracy of the indexed
solution. The proposed method is demonstrated to resolve pseudosymmetry with
100% accuracy in simulated patterns of tetragonal ZrO2, even with high degrees
of binning and noise. The method is then used to index an experimental dataset,
which confirms its ability to efficiently and accurately resolve pseudosymmetry
in these materials. The present method can be applied to resolve pseudosymmetry
in a wide range of materials, possibly even some more challenging than
tetragonal ZrO2. Source code for this implementation is available online.

tomography (CT) imaging. A popular class of MAR methods replace sinogram
measurements that are corrupted by metal with artificial data. While these
``projection completion'' approaches are successful in eliminating severe
artifacts, secondary artifacts may be introduced by the artificial data. In
this paper, we propose an approach which uses projection completion to generate
a prior image, which is then incorporated into an iterative reconstruction
algorithm based on the superiorization framework. The prior image is
reconstructed using normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR), a popular
projection completion approach. The iterative algorithm is a modified version
of the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), which reduces
artifacts by incorporating a polyenergetic forward model, least-squares
weighting, and superiorization. The penalty function used for superiorization
is a weighted average between a total variation (TV) term and a term promoting
similarity with the prior image, similar to penalty functions used in prior
image constrained compressive sensing. Because the prior is largely free of
severe metal artifacts, these artifacts are discouraged from arising during
iterative reconstruction; additionally, because the iterative approach uses the
original projection data, it is able to recover information that is lost during
the NMAR process. We perform numerical experiments modeling a simple geometric
object, as well as several more realistic scenarios such as metal pins,
bilateral hip implants, and dental fillings placed within an anatomical
phantom. The proposed iterative algorithm is largely successful at eliminating
severe metal artifacts as well as secondary artifacts introduced by the NMAR

promising content delivery paradigm by employing a large crowd of existing edge
devices (EDs) to cache and share popular contents. The successful technology
adoption of Crowd-MECS relies on a comprehensive understanding of the
complicated economic interactions and strategic decision-making of different
stakeholders. In this paper, we focus on studying the economic and strategic
interactions between one content provider (CP) and a large crowd of EDs, where
the EDs can decide whether to cache and share contents for the CP, and the CP
can decide to share a certain revenue with EDs as the incentive of caching and
sharing contents. We formulate such an interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg
game. In Stage I, the CP aims to maximize its own profit by deciding the ratio
of revenue shared with EDs. In Stage II, EDs aim to maximize their own payoffs
by choosing to be agents who cache and share contents, and meanwhile gain a
certain revenue from the CP, or requesters who do not cache but request
contents in the on-demand fashion. We first analyze the EDs' best responses and
prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium in Stage II by using the
non-atomic game theory. Then, we identify the piece-wise structure and the
unimodal feature of the CP's profit function, based on which we design a
tailored low-complexity one-dimensional search algorithm to achieve the optimal
revenue sharing ratio for the CP in Stage I. Simulation results show that both
the CP's profit and the EDs' total welfare can be improved significantly (e.g.,
by 120% and 50%, respectively) by using the proposed Crowd-MECS, comparing with
the Non-MEC system where the CP serves all EDs directly.

discretization that is completely tailored towards the quantity of interest. As
is natural in deep learning, we use an artificial neural network to define the

recently proposed f-differential privacy. In contrast to the existing
composition theorems using the central limit theorem, our new privacy bounds
under composition gain improved tightness by leveraging the refined
approximation accuracy of the Edgeworth expansion. Our approach is easy to
implement and computationally efficient for any number of compositions. The
superiority of these new bounds is confirmed by an asymptotic error analysis
and an application to quantifying the overall privacy guarantees of noisy
stochastic gradient descent used in training private deep neural networks.

  Design in UAV-Enabled Wireless Network",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This letter aims to maximize the average throughput via the joint design of
the transmit power and trajectory for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled
network. The conventional way to tackle this problem is based on the
alternating optimization (AO) method by iteratively updating power and
trajectory until convergence, resulting in a non-convex trajectory subproblem
which is difficult to deal with. To develop more efficient methods, we propose
a novel AO method by incorporating both power and trajectory into an
intermediate variable, and then iteratively updating power and the newly
introduced variable. This novel variable transformation makes it easier to
decompose the original problem into two convex subproblems, namely a throughput
maximization subproblem and a feasibility subproblem. Consequently, both of
these subproblems can be solved in a globally optimal fashion. We further
propose a low-complexity algorithm for the feasibility subproblem by exploiting
the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step
is performed in closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed method reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, while
achieving higher performance than the conventional methods.

tolerate approximate computation with no limit on the number of arithmetic
operations applicable to the corresponding ciphertexts. A critical shortcoming
of HE is the high computation complexity of ciphertext arithmetic; especially,
HE multiplication (HE Mul) is more than 10,000 times slower than the
corresponding multiplication between unencrypted messages. This leads to a
large body of HE acceleration studies, including ones exploiting FPGAs;
however, those did not conduct a rigorous analysis of computational complexity

research. Bayesian approaches including Bayesian Neural Nets (BNNs) do not
scale well to modern computer vision tasks, as they are difficult to train, and
have poor generalization under dataset-shift. This motivates the need for
effective ensembles which can generalize and give reliable uncertainty
estimates. In this paper, we target the problem of generating effective
ensembles of neural networks by encouraging diversity in prediction. We
explicitly optimize a diversity inducing adversarial loss for learning the
stochastic latent variables and thereby obtain diversity in the output
predictions necessary for modeling multi-modal data. We evaluate our method on

methods have achieved considerable successes in environments where exploration
is difficult such as Montezuma's Revenge, which assign additional bonuses
(e.g., intrinsic rewards) to guide the agent to rarely visited states. Since
the bonus is calculated according to the novelty of the next state after
performing an action, we call such methods as the next-state bonus methods.
However, the next-state bonus methods force the agent to pay overmuch attention
in exploring known states and ignore finding unknown states since the
exploration is driven by the next state already visited, which may slow the
pace of finding reward in some environments. In this paper, we focus on
improving the effectiveness of finding unknown states and propose action
balance exploration, which balances the frequency of selecting each action at a
given state and can be treated as an extension of upper confidence bound (UCB)
to deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose action balance RND that
combines the next-state bonus methods (e.g., random network distillation
exploration, RND) and our action balance exploration to take advantage of both
sides. The experiments on the grid world and Atari games demonstrate action
balance exploration has a better capability in finding unknown states and can
improve the performance of RND in some hard exploration environments

stacking 2D quantum Hall effects with interlayer coupling much weaker than the
Landau level spacing, quasi-2D quantum Hall effects have been experimentally
observed3~7, due to the similar physical origin of the 2D counterpart.
Recently, in a real 3D electronic gas system where the interlayer coupling is
much stronger than the Landau level spacing, 3D quantum Hall effect has been
observed in ZrTe58. In this Letter, we report the electronic transport features
of its sister bulk material, i.e., HfTe5, under external magnetic field. We
observe a series of plateaus in Hall resistance \r{ho}xy as magnetic field
increases until it reaches the quantum limit at 1~2 Tesla. At the plateau
regions, the longitudinal resistance \r{ho}xx exhibits local minima. Although
\r{ho}xx is still nonzero, its value becomes much smaller than \r{ho}xy at the
last few plateaus. By mapping the Fermi surface via measuring the Shubonikov-de
Haas oscillation, we find that the strength of Hall plateau is proportional to
the Fermi wavelength, suggesting that its formation may be attributed to the
gap opening from the interaction driven Fermi surface instability. By comparing
the bulk band structures of ZrTe5 and HfTe5, we find that there exists an extra
pocket near the Fermi level of HfTe5, which may lead to the finite but nonzero
longitudinal conductance.

model-driven deep learning method is developed to learn the update rule of
descent direction, which is formalized as a nonlinear combination of historical

the proposed adaptive direction guarantees convergence for convex functions.
Empirical study shows that the learned algorithm significantly outperforms some
well-known classical optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent,
conjugate descent and BFGS, and performs well on ill-posed functions. The
escaping phase from local optimum is modeled as a Markov decision process with
a fixed escaping policy. We further propose to learn an optimal escaping policy

verified by optimizing synthesized functions and training a deep neural network

practice, e.g, a point cloud $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point $x\in X$
has a density function value $f_X(x)$ associated to it. An augmented metric
space $(X, d_X, f_X)$ naturally gives rise to a 2-parameter filtration
$\mathcal{K}$. However, the resulting 2-parameter persistent homology
$\mathrm{H}_{\bullet}(\mathcal{K})$ could still be of wild representation type,
and may not have simple indecomposables. In this paper, motivated by the
elder-rule for the zeroth homology of 1-parameter filtration, we propose a
barcode-like summary, called the elder-rule-staircode, as a way to encode
$\mathrm{H}_0(\mathcal{K})$. Specifically, if $n = |X|$, the
elder-rule-staircode consists of $n$ number of staircase-like blocks in the

then the barcode of $\mathrm{H}_0(\mathcal{K})$ is equal to the
elder-rule-staircode. Furthermore, regardless of the interval decomposability,
the fibered barcode, the dimension function (a.k.a. the Hilbert function), and
the graded Betti numbers of $\mathrm{H}_0(\mathcal{K})$ can all be efficiently
computed once the elder-rule-staircode is given. Finally, we develop and
implement an efficient algorithm to compute the elder-rule-staircode in
$O(n^2\log n)$ time, which can be improved to $O(n^2\alpha(n))$ if $X$ is from
a fixed dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the

In this paper, we investigate the stability of non-isothermal fermionic dark
matter halos. We show that in the presence of temperature gradient, the force
due to the pressure has both inward and outward components. In some regions of
halos, the inward force that provides stability is due to the pressure rather
than gravity. Moreover, it is shown that higher temperature gradients lead to
halos with lower mass and size. We prove that if the temperature is left as a
free positive profile, one can place no phase-space lower bound on the mass of
dark matter. For halos that are in the low degeneracy classic domain, we derive
an analytic expression of their temperature in terms of their mass density and

learning algorithms are deployed at the network edge for training artificial

this paper, we consider the framework of partitioned edge learning for
iteratively training a large-scale model using many resource-constrained
devices (called workers). To this end, in each iteration, the model is
dynamically partitioned into parametric blocks, which are downloaded to worker
groups for updating using data subsets. Then, the local updates are uploaded to
and cascaded by the server for updating a global model. To reduce resource
usage by minimizing the total learning-and-communication latency, this work
focuses on the novel joint design of parameter (computation load) allocation
and bandwidth allocation (for downloading and uploading). Two design approaches
are adopted. First, a practical sequential approach, called partially
integrated parameter-and-bandwidth allocation (PABA), yields two schemes,
namely bandwidth aware parameter allocation and parameter aware bandwidth
allocation. The former minimizes the load for the slowest (in computing) of
worker groups, each training a same parametric block. The latter allocates the
largest bandwidth to the worker being the latency bottleneck. Second, PABA are
jointly optimized. Despite its being a nonconvex problem, an efficient and
optimal solution algorithm is derived by intelligently nesting a bisection
search and solving a convex problem. Experimental results using real data
demonstrate that integrating PABA can substantially improve the performance of
partitioned edge learning in terms of latency (by e.g., 46%) and accuracy (by
e.g., 4%).

serious bottleneck is acquiring enough data to ensure accurate and fair models.
Recent techniques including crowdsourcing provide cost-effective ways to gather
such data. However, simply acquiring data as much as possible is not
necessarily an effective strategy for optimizing accuracy and fairness. For
example, if an online app store has enough training data for certain slices of
data (say American customers), but not for others, obtaining more American
customer data will only bias the model training. Instead, we contend that one
needs to selectively acquire data and propose Slice Tuner, which acquires
possibly-different amounts of data per slice such that the model accuracy and
fairness on all slices are optimized. This problem is different than labeling
existing data (as in active learning or weak supervision) because the goal is
obtaining the right amounts of new data. At its core, Slice Tuner maintains
learning curves of slices that estimate the model accuracies given more data
and uses convex optimization to find the best data acquisition strategy. The
key challenges of estimating learning curves are that they may be inaccurate if
there is not enough data, and there may be dependencies among slices where
acquiring data for one slice influences the learning curves of others. We solve
these issues by iteratively and efficiently updating the learning curves as
more data is acquired. We evaluate Slice Tuner on real datasets using
crowdsourcing for data acquisition and show that Slice Tuner significantly
outperforms baselines in terms of model accuracy and fairness, even when the
learning curves cannot be reliably estimated.

Green tensor of the system, which breaks Onsager reciprocity. This enables us
to find that for frequencies smaller than the maximum band gap, the system is
sensitive to time reversal symmetry-breaking, whereas for much larger
frequencies the system becomes insensitive, with implications for the
discrimination of the state of a circularly polarised dipole emitter. We also
study the impact of a van Hove singularity on the surface-induced correction to
the transition rate, finding that it can enhance its amplitude by a few orders
of magnitude compared to the case where the conductivity is set to its static
value. By considering configurations in which the dipole is circularly

semi-classical (SE) physics model, which works in the region of large pores
(pore size $R >$ 1 nm), with the conventional Tao-Eldrup (TE) model, which is
applicable only for the small-pore region ($R <$ 1 nm). Thus, the proposed
model, called the hybrid (HYB) model, is able to smoothly connect the $o$-Ps
lifetimes in the two regions of the pore. Moreover, by introducing the $o$-Ps
diffusion probability parameter ($D$), the HYB model has reproduced quite well
the experimental $o$-Ps lifetimes in the whole region of pore sizes. It is even
in a better agreement with the experimental data than the most up-to-date
rectangular TE (RTE) and Tokyo models. In particular, by adjusting the value of
$D$, the HYB model can also describe very well the two defined sets of
experimental $o$-Ps lifetimes in the pores with spherical and channel
geometries. The merit of the present model, in comparison with the previously
proposed ones, is that it is applicable for the pore size in the universal
range of $0.2 - 400$ nm for most of porous materials with different geometries.

computational cost and the compatibility with off-the-shelf hardware devices.
Among existing works, weights are typically removed using a predefined global
threshold, or a threshold computed from a predefined metric. The predefined
global threshold based designs ignore the variation among different layers and
weights distribution, therefore, they may often result in sub-optimal
performance caused by over-pruning or under-pruning. In this paper, we present
a simple yet effective method, termed Optimal Thresholding (OT), to prune
channels with layer dependent thresholds that optimally separate important from
negligible channels. By using OT, most negligible or unimportant channels are
pruned to achieve high sparsity while minimizing performance degradation. Since
most important weights are preserved, the pruned model can be further
fine-tuned and quickly converge with very few iterations. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, especially when compared to the
state-of-the-art designs at high levels of sparsity. On CIFAR-100, a pruned and

inferior generalization, grounding and explainability. Grounded language
learning approaches offer the promise of deeper understanding by situating
learning in richer, more structured training environments, but are limited in

both worlds: grounded, general NLU? Following extensive contemporary cognitive
science, we propose treating environments as ""first-class citizens"" in semantic

Importantly, models should also be partners in the creation and configuration

large-scale, offline common-sense knowledge mining. To this end we propose an

Under these assumptions large classes of solutions are admitted by the field
equations. We isolate a particular class with the ansatz of the Vaidya--Tikekar

elementary requirements for physical applicability and stability. The parameter
values chosen are consistent with observed star models. A significant effect of
the higher curvature terms is to reduce the speed of sound and to drastically
reduce the values of the surface gravitational redshift compared to the
Einstein counterpart. These latter results have implications for
interpretations of observations in relativistic astrophysics which are often
made against the background of the standard general theory of relativity.

stereo video, and its output includes a dense map of the static environment, 3D
model of the moving objects and the trajectories of the camera and the moving
objects. We at first detect and match the interesting points between successive
frames by using traditional SLAM methods. Then the interesting points belonging
to different motion models (including ego-motion and motion models of rigid
moving objects) are segmented by a multi-model fitting approach. Based on the
interesting points belonging to the ego-motion, we are able to estimate the
trajectory of the camera and reconstruct the static background. The interesting
points belonging to the motion models of rigid moving objects are then used to
estimate their relative motion models to the camera and reconstruct the 3D
models of the objects. We then transform the relative motion to the
trajectories of the moving objects in the global reference frame. Finally, we
then fuse the 3D models of the moving objects into the 3D map of the
environment by considering their motion trajectories to obtain a 4D (3D+time)
sequence. DymSLAM obtains information about the dynamic objects instead of
ignoring them and is suitable for unknown rigid objects. Hence, the proposed
system allows the robot to be employed for high-level tasks, such as obstacle
avoidance for dynamic objects. We conducted experiments in a real-world

  Attention","Accepted by IEEE TPAMI, 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Channel attention mechanisms have been commonly applied in many visual tasks
for effective performance improvement. It is able to reinforce the informative
channels as well as to suppress the useless channels. Recently, different
channel attention modules have been proposed and implemented in various ways.
Generally speaking, they are mainly based on convolution and pooling
operations. In this paper, we propose Gaussian process embedded channel
attention (GPCA) module and further interpret the channel attention schemes in
a probabilistic way. The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among
the channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables.
As the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution,
we utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem. To
specify, we adapt a Sigmoid-Gaussian approximation, in which the Gaussian
distributed variables are transferred into the interval [0,1]. The Gaussian
process is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In
this case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can
be efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the
CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed GPCA module. Codes are available at https://github.com/PRIS-CV/GPCA.

a pair of Lyapunov equations for two Gramians and uses them to construct a
reduced-order model. Although advances in solving such equations have been
made, it is still the most expensive step of this reduction method. Parametric
model order reduction aims to determine reduced-order models for
parameter-dependent systems. Popular techniques for parametric model order
reduction rely on interpolation. Nevertheless, the interpolation of Gramians is
rarely mentioned, most probably due to the fact that Gramians are symmetric
positive semidefinite matrices, a property that should be preserved by the
interpolation method. In this contribution, we propose and compare two
approaches for Gramian interpolation. In the first approach, the interpolated
Gramian is computed as a linear combination of the data Gramians with positive
coefficients. Even though positive semidefiniteness is guaranteed in this
method, the rank of the interpolated Gramian can be significantly larger than
that of the data Gramians. The second approach aims to tackle this issue by
performing the interpolation on the manifold of fixed-rank positive
semidefinite matrices. The results of the interpolation step are then used to
construct parametric reduced-order models, which are compared numerically on
two benchmark problems.

ground-based telescopes must overcome atmospheric extinction effects.
Differential photometry by reference to an ensemble of reference stars which
closely match the target in terms of magnitude and colour can mitigate these
effects. This Paper describes the design, implementation and operation of a new
algorithm, The Locus Algorithm; which enables optimised differential
photometry. The Algorithm is intended to identify, for a given target and
observational parameters, the Field of View (FoV) which includes the target and
the maximum number of reference stars similar to the target. A collection of
objects from a catalogue (e.g. SDSS) is filtered to identify candidate
reference stars and determine a rating for each which quantifies its similarity
to the target. The algorithm works by defining a locus of points around each
candidate reference star, upon which the FoV can be centred and include the
reference at the edge of the FoV. The Points of Intersection (PoI) between
these loci are identified and a score for each PoI is calculated. The PoI with
the highest score is output as the optimum pointing. The steps of the algorithm
are precisely defined in this paper. The application of The Locus Algorithm to
a sample target, SDSS1237680117417115655, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is
described in detail. The algorithm has been defined here and implemented in
software which is available online. The algorithm has also been used to
generate catalogues of pointings to optimise Quasar variability studies and to
generate catalogues of optimised pointings in the search for Exoplanets via the

deformation in 3D as a function of three factors: pose, shape and style
(garment geometry), while retaining wrinkle detail. This goes beyond prior
models, which are either specific to one style and shape, or generalize to
different shapes producing smooth results, despite being style specific. Our
hypothesis is that (even non-linear) combinations of examples smooth out high
frequency components such as fine-wrinkles, which makes learning the three
factors jointly hard. At the heart of our technique is a decomposition of
deformation into a high frequency and a low frequency component. While the
low-frequency component is predicted from pose, shape and style parameters with
an MLP, the high-frequency component is predicted with a mixture of shape-style
specific pose models. The weights of the mixture are computed with a narrow
bandwidth kernel to guarantee that only predictions with similar high-frequency
patterns are combined. The style variation is obtained by computing, in a
canonical pose, a subspace of deformation, which satisfies physical constraints
such as inter-penetration, and draping on the body. TailorNet delivers 3D
garments which retain the wrinkles from the physics based simulations (PBS) it
is learned from, while running more than 1000 times faster. In contrast to PBS,
TailorNet is easy to use and fully differentiable, which is crucial for
computer vision algorithms. Several experiments demonstrate TailorNet produces
more realistic results than prior work, and even generates temporally coherent
deformations on sequences of the AMASS dataset, despite being trained on static
poses from a different dataset. To stimulate further research in this
direction, we will make a dataset consisting of 55800 frames, as well as our

of the gate and tunnel couplings can pump electrons and energy from the left to

operating protocol that can optimally pump energy and hence, we investigate
energy transfer and the coefficient of performance of the device. We compare
our device to a two-stroke pump and find that the latter's lower performance is
due to the bi-directional flow of energy currents resulting in low net energy
currents. The performance of our four-stroke pump can be improved, up to a
point, by increasing the net energy carried by the pumped electrons through
energy charging via the gate potential. This is achieved by increasing the
durations of energy charging and discharging strokes in the pump's protocol.
However, despite the large energy output for long charging and discharging
strokes, the energy required to maintain the strokes become large too resulting
in a stagnant pump performance. Our pump operates effectively only in the
strong lead coupling regime and becomes a dud in the weak coupling regime due
to the net output energy flowing in the reverse direction. We use
nonequilibirum Green's functions techniques to calculate the currents and
capture the effects of strong lead-channel coupling exactly while
simultaneously incorporating three time-varying parameters. Results from our

on a timescale of minutes typically requires differential observations with
reference to an ensemble of reference stars. For optimal performance, these
reference stars should have similar colour and magnitude to the target quasar.
In addition, the greatest quantity and quality of suitable reference stars may
be found by using a telescope pointing which offsets the target object from the
centre of the field of view. By comparing each quasar with the stars which
appear close to it on the sky in the SDSS Catalogue, an optimum pointing can be

disks from the fixed base to a free end. In most such robots, the routing of
the cables are straight or a smooth helical curve. In this paper, we analyze
the experimental and theoretical deformations of a 3D printed continuum robot,
for 6 different kinds of cable routings. The results are compared for discrete
optimization based kinematic modelling as well as static modelling using
Cosserat rod theory. It is shown that the experimental results match the
theoretical results with an error margin of 2%. It is also shown that the
optimization based approach is faster than the one based on Cosserat rod
theory. We also present a three-fingered gripper prototype where each of the
fingers are 3D printed continuum robots with general cable routing. It is
demonstrated that the prototype can be used for gripping objects and for its
manipulation.

important role in a range of phenomena in biology, colloidal science and
solid-state physics. Here, an easily implementable strategy that allows for the
collective and monitored transport of microparticles at fluid-fluid interfaces
is introduced. Adsorbed magnetic microparticles are carried on time-dependent
magnetic potentials, generated by a dynamic self-assembled lattice of
different-sized magnetic particles. In such binary systems, the sudden
reorientation of the applied field triggers the rapid exchange between
attractive and repulsive configurations, enabling for the ballistic transfer of
the carriers through the lattice. As the number of motile entities increases,
the induced current increases, before reaching a maximum, while the loaded
interface gradually displays bidirectional transport. The described methodology
can be tuned through the applied field and exploited for the monitored guidance
of adsorbed molecules on liquid surfaces, the segregation of colloidal
mixtures, the induced motion of defects in photonic crystals or the design of
new self-assembled microrobots.

applications is still in the early stages of development. We take a fresh look
at neural networks and examine them via nonlinear eigenvalue analysis. The
field of nonlinear spectral theory is still emerging, providing insights about
nonlinear operators and systems. In this paper we view a neural network as a
complex nonlinear operator and attempt to find its nonlinear eigenvectors. We
first discuss the existence of such eigenvectors and analyze the kernel of ReLU
networks. Then we study a nonlinear power method for generic nonlinear
operators. For proximal operators associated to absolutely one-homogeneous
convex regularization functionals, we can prove convergence of the method to an
eigenvector of the proximal operator. This motivates us to apply a nonlinear
method to networks which are trained to act similarly as a proximal operator.
In order to take the non-homogeneity of neural networks into account we define
a modified version of the power method.
  We perform extensive experiments for different proximal operators and on
various shallow and deep neural networks designed for image denoising. Proximal
eigenvectors will be used for geometric analysis of graphs, as clustering or
the computation of distance functions. For simple neural nets, we observe the
influence of training data on the eigenvectors. For state-of-the-art denoising
networks, we show that eigenvectors can be interpreted as (un)stable modes of
the network, when contaminated with noise or other degradations.

interface can be driven mechanically. % e.g. by a difference in the respective
homeostatic stress of the different cell types. Computer simulations of growing
tissues are employed to study the stability of the interface between two
tissues on a substrate. From a mechanical perspective, the dynamics and
stability of this system is controlled mainly by four parameters of the
respective tissues: (i) the homeostatic stress (ii) cell motility (iii) tissue
viscosity and (iv) substrate friction. For propagation driven by a difference
in homeostatic stress, the interface is stable for tissue-specific substrate
friction even for very large differences of homeostatic stress; however, it
becomes unstable above a critical stress difference when the tissue with the
larger homeostatic stress has a higher viscosity. A small difference in
directed bulk motility between the two tissues suffices to result in
propagation with a stable interface, even for otherwise identical tissues.
Larger differences in motility force, however, result in a finite-wavelength
instability of the interface. Interestingly, the instability is apparently
bound by nonlinear effects and the amplitude of the interface undulations only
grows to a finite value in time.

three scenarios in which a robot is controlled to keep within lane markings by
using an event-based neuromorphic vision sensor. We further demonstrate the

volatility uncertainty. The uncertainty about the volatility is modeled by a
G-Brownian motion, which drives the forward rate dynamics. The absence of
arbitrage is ensured by a drift condition. Such a setting leads to a sublinear
pricing measure for additional contracts, which yields either a single price or
a range of prices. Similar to the forward measure approach, we define the
forward sublinear expectation to simplify the pricing of cashflows. Under the
forward sublinear expectation, we obtain a robust version of the expectations
hypothesis, and we show how to price options on forward prices. In addition, we
develop pricing methods for contracts consisting of a stream of cashflows,
since the nonlinearity of the pricing measure implies that we cannot price a
stream of cashflows by pricing each cashflow separately. With these tools, we
derive robust pricing formulas for all major interest rate derivatives. The
pricing formulas provide a link to the pricing formulas of traditional models
without volatility uncertainty and show that volatility uncertainty naturally

Israel and Stewart (1979), which is, to date, one of the most successful
theories for relativistic dissipation. Although the generality of the principle
makes it applicable to any dissipative fluid, a connection of the
Israel-Stewart theory with microphysics has been established, through kinetic
theory, only for the case of ideal quantum gases. By performing a convenient
change of variables, we provide, for the case of bulk viscosity, an equivalent
reformulation of the equations at the basis of extended irreversible
thermodynamics. This approach maps any thermodynamic process which contributes
to the bulk viscosity into a set of chemical reactions, whose reaction
coordinates are abstract parameters describing the displacement from local
thermodynamic equilibrium of the fluid element. We apply our new formalism to
the case of the relativistic fluids, showing that the Israel-Stewart model for
bulk viscosity is just the second-order expansion of a minimal model belonging
to a larger class of non-perturbative theories for bulk viscosity which include
the nuclear-reaction-mediated bulk viscosity of neutron star matter as a
particular case. Furthermore, we show with concrete examples that our formalism

the degree given by the cohomological dimension $\mathrm{cd}(\Gamma) =
\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. We are concerned with the internal structure of the

associate classes $\{\mathsf{P}\}$ for which the corresponding summand
$H^{\mathrm{cd}(\Gamma)}_{\mathrm{\{\mathsf{P}\}}}(\Gamma, E)$ vanishes. On the
other hand, in the remaining cases of associate classes we construct various

$H^{\mathrm{cd}(\Gamma)}_{\mathrm{\{\mathsf{Q}\}}}(\Gamma, \mathbb{C})$.
Finally, in the case of a principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(q)$, $q =
p^{\nu} > 5$, $p\geq 3$ a prime, we give lower bounds for the size of these
spaces if not even a precise formula for its dimension for certain associate
classes $\{\mathsf{Q}\}$.

However, source-to-target translation enlarges the bias in translated images

too weak as compared with blue and green ones. To clarify the problem, we have
performed power and temperature dependent, as well as time-resolved
measurements of photoluminescence (PL) in NRs of different In content and
diameter. These studies have shown that the dominant PL bands originate from
nonpolar and semipolar QWs, while a broad yellow-red band arises mostly from
defects in the GaN core. Intensity of red emission from the polar QWs at the NR
tip is fatally small. Our calculation of electromagnetic field distribution
inside the NRs shows a low density of photon states in the tip that suppresses
the red radiation. We suggest a design of hybrid NRs, in which polar QWs,
located inside the GaN core, are pumped by UV-blue radiation of nonpolar QWs.
Possibilities of radiative recombination rate enhancement by means of the

sources identified in optical images within 1\arcmin~separation. The area
covered by the cluster sample is $\sim$ 27 deg$^{2}$. The clusters span a wide
redshift range (0.05 < z < 0.6) and 88 clusters benefit from spectrosopically
confirmed redshifts using data from SDSS Data Release 14. We present an
automated pipeline to derive the X-ray properties of the clusters in three
distinct apertures: R\textsubscript{500} (at fixed mass overdensity),
R\textsubscript{fit} (at fixed signal-to-noise ratio), R\textsubscript{300kpc}
(fixed physical radius). The sample extends over wide temperature and
luminosity ranges: from 1 to 10 keV and from 6$\times$10$^{42}$ to

luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation of the XC1-RM sample and find a slope
equals to 3.03 $\pm$ 0.26. It is steeper than predicted by self-similar
assumptions, in agreement with independent studies. A simplified approach is
developed to estimate the amount and impact of selection biases which might be

single-crystalline as well as textured doped and undoped In2O3(111) films grown
by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy to extract transport properties of
the SEAL by means of Hall effect measurements at room temperature while
controlling the oxygen adsorbate coverage via illumination. The resulting sheet
electron concentration and mobility of the SEAL are 1.5E13 cm^-2 and 150
cm^2/Vs, respectively, both of which get strongly reduced by oxygen-related
surface adsorbates from the ambient air. Our transport measurements further
demonstrate a systematic reduction of the SEAL by doping In2O3 with the deep
compensating bulk acceptors Ni or Mg. This finding is supported by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the surface band bending and SEAL
electron emission. Quantitative analyses of these XPS results using
self-consistent, coupled Schroedinger-Poisson calculations indicate the
simultaneous formation of compensating bulk donor defects (likely oxygen
vacancies) which almost completely compensate the bulk acceptors. Finally, an
enhancement of the thermopower by reduced dimensionality is demonstrated in
In2O3: Seebeck coefficient measurements of the surface 2DEG with partially
reduced sheet electron concentrations between 3E12 and 7E12 cm^-2
(corresponding average volume electron concentration between 1E19 and 2E19
cm^-3 indicate a value enhanced by 80% compared to that of bulk Sn-doped In2O3
with comparable volume electron concentration.

approaches in the literature. Note, however, that each of the existing

testing high-dimensional mean vectors, which, in essence, provides a good
balance between the existing approaches. To effectively utilize the correlation
information, we construct the new test statistics as the summation of
Hotelling's test statistics for the covariate pairs with strong correlations
and the squared $t$ statistics for the individual covariates that have little
correlation with others. We further derive the asymptotic null distributions
and power functions for the proposed Hotelling tests under some regularity
conditions. Numerical results show that our new tests are able to control the
type I error rates, and can achieve a higher statistical power compared to
existing methods, especially when the covariates are highly correlated. Two
real data examples are also analyzed and they both demonstrate the efficacy of
our pairwise Hotelling tests.

statistical quantities related to convective flows including: average velocity,
vorticity, local enstrophy, and penetration depth beneath a convection zone.
These statistics are produced during stationary, steady-state compressible
convection in the star's convection zone. Our simulations with the MUSIC code
confirm the common result that two-dimensional simulations of stellar
convection have a higher magnitude of velocity on average than
three-dimensional simulations. Boundary conditions and the extent of the
spherical shell can affect the magnitude and variability of convective
velocities. The difference between 2D and 3D velocities is dependent on these
background points; in our simulations this can have an effect as large as the
difference resulting from the dimensionality of the simulation. Nevertheless,
radial velocities near the convective boundary are comparable in our 2D and 3D
simulations. The average local enstrophy of the flow is lower for
two-dimensional simulations than for three-dimensional simulations, indicating
a different shape and structuring of 3D stellar convection. We perform a
statistical analysis of the depth of convective penetration below the
convection zone, using the model proposed in our recent study (Pratt et al.

simulations, and compare the results to identically set-up 2D simulations. In

provide a unique probe of extragalactic asteroid belts (EABs), based on our
previously-proposed pulsar-EAB impact model, in which repeating FRBs arise from
an old-aged, slowly-spinning, moderately-magnetized pulsar traveling through an
EAB around another stellar-mass object. These two objects form a binary and
thus the observed period is in fact the orbital period. We show that this model
can be used to well interpret all of the observed data of FRB 180916.J0158+65.
Furthermore, we constrain the EAB's physical properties and find that (1) the
outer radius of the EAB is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of
its analogue in the solar system, (2) the differential size distribution of the
EAB's asteroids at small diameters (large diameters) is shallower (steeper)

synchrotron emission from the jet. While our SED fitting confirms that the
source remained in the low/hard state during its outburst, we determine an
X-ray spectral break at frequency 3.1 < nu_break < 3.4 x 10^14 Hz, and a radio
spectral break at 10^12 Hz < nu_break < 10^13 Hz. We also show that the system

high-spectral resolution of our data, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and
centre-to-limb variation have a strong contribution. Here, we present the first
detection of Fe I and the confirmation of absorption features of Fe II in the
atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-2b/KELT-20b, by using three transit
observations with HARPS-N. After combining all transit observations we find a
high cross-correlation signal of Fe I and Fe II with signal-to-noise ratios of
10.5 +/- 0.4 and 8.6 +/- 0.5, respectively. The peak absorption for both
species appear to be blue-shifted with velocities of -6.3 +/- 0.8 km/s for Fe I
and -2.8 +/- 0.8 km/s for Fe II, suggesting the presence of winds from the day-
to night-side of the planet's atmosphere. These results confirm previous
studies of this planet and add a new atomic species (Fe I) to the long list of
detected species in the atmosphere of MASCARA-2b, making it, together with
KELT-9b, the most feature-rich ultra-hot Jupiter to date.

applications. Unfortunately, common viewpoint qualities suffer from two major
drawbacks: dependency on clean surface meshes, which are not always available,
and the lack of closed-form expressions, which requires a costly search
involving rendering. To overcome these limitations we propose to separate
viewpoint selection from rendering through an end-to-end learning approach,
whereby we reduce the influence of the mesh quality by predicting viewpoints
from unstructured point clouds instead of polygonal meshes. While this makes
our approach insensitive to the mesh discretization during evaluation, it only
becomes possible when resolving label ambiguities that arise in this context.
Therefore, we additionally propose to incorporate the label generation into the
training procedure, making the label decision adaptive to the current network
predictions. We show how our proposed approach allows for learning viewpoint
predictions for models from different object categories and for different
viewpoint qualities. Additionally, we show that prediction times are reduced
from several minutes to a fraction of a second, as compared to state-of-the-art
(SOTA) viewpoint quality evaluation. We will further release the code and
training data, which will to our knowledge be the biggest viewpoint quality

Several
nucleosynthetic channels at different phases of stellar evolution have been
suggested, but these must be constrained by observations. For this, the
fluorine abundance trend with metallicity spanning a wide range is required.
Our aim is to determine stellar abundances of fluorine for -1.1<[Fe/H]<+0.4. We
determine the abundances from HF lines in infrared K-band spectra (at 2.3
microns) of cool giants, observed with the IGRINS and Phoenix high-resolution
spectrographs. We derive accurate stellar parameters for all our observed K
giants, which is important since the HF lines are very temperature sensitive.
We find that [F/Fe] is flat as a function of metallicity at [F/Fe]~0, but
increases as the metallicity increases. The fluorine slope shows a clear
secondary behavior in this metallicity range. We also find that the [F/Ce]
ratio is relatively flat for -0.6<[Fe/H]<0, and that for two metal-poor
([Fe/H]<-0.8), s-process element enhanced giants, we do not detect an elevated
fluorine abundance. We interpret all these observational constraints to
indicate that several major processes are at play for the cosmic budget of
fluorine over time; from those in massive stars at low metallicities, through
the asymptotic giant branch-star contribution at -0.6<[Fe/H]<0, to processes
with increasing yields with metallicity at super-solar metallicities. The
origins of the latter, and whether or not Wolf-Rayet stars and/or novae could
contribute at super-solar metallicities, is currently not known. To quantify
these observational results, theoretical modelling is required. More

well as strong light-matter coupling, we demonstrate the high tunability of an
effective interaction between quasiparticles formed by minority component
polaritons interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a majority

exchange of sound modes in the BEC can be made strong enough to support a bound

different symmetry sectors in the low-lying primary excited states of a
conformal field theory (CFT) with an internal U(1) symmetry. Our findings
extend recent results for the ground state. We derive a general expression for
the charged moments, i.e. the generalised cumulant generating function, which
can be written in terms of correlation functions of the operator that define
the state through the CFT operator-state correspondence. We provide explicit
analytic computations for the compact boson CFT (aka Luttinger liquid) for the
vertex and derivative excitations. The Fourier transform of the charged moments
gives the desired symmetry resolved entropies. At the leading order, they
satisfy entanglement equipartition, as in the ground state, but we find, within
CFT, subleading terms that break it. Our analytical findings are checked
against free fermions calculations on a lattice, finding excellent agreement.
As a byproduct, we have exact results for the full counting statistics of the
U(1) charge in the considered excited states.

  on Only One Annotated Pixel per Class",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic segmentation tasks based on weakly supervised condition have been
put forward to achieve a lightweight labeling process. For simple images that
only include a few categories, researches based on image-level annotations have
achieved acceptable performance. However, when facing complex scenes, since
image contains a large amount of classes, it becomes difficult to learn visual
appearance based on image tags. In this case, image-level annotations are not
effective in providing information. Therefore, we set up a new task in which
only one annotated pixel is provided for each category. Based on the more
lightweight and informative condition, a three step process is built for pseudo
labels generation, which progressively implement optimal feature representation
for each category, image inference and context-location based refinement. In
particular, since high-level semantics and low-level imaging feature have
different discriminative ability for each class under driving scenes, we divide
each category into ""object"" or ""scene"" and then provide different operations
for the two types separately. Further, an alternate iterative structure is
established to gradually improve segmentation performance, which combines
CNN-based inter-image common semantic learning and imaging prior based
intra-image modification process. Experiments on Cityscapes dataset demonstrate
that the proposed method provides a feasible way to solve weakly supervised
semantic segmentation task under complex driving scenes.

black-boxes, lacking interpretability; an issue that hinders human
understanding of ANNs' behaviors. A need exists to generate a meaningful
sequential logic of the ANN for interpreting a production process of a specific
output. On the other hand, decision trees exhibit better interpretability and
expressive power due to their representation language and the existence of
efficient algorithms to transform the trees into rules. However, growing a
decision tree based on the available data could produce larger than necessary
trees or trees that do not generalise well. In this paper, we introduce two
novel multivariate decision tree (MDT) algorithms for rule extraction from
ANNs: an Exact-Convertible Decision Tree (EC-DT) and an Extended C-Net
algorithm. They both transform a neural network with Rectified Linear Unit
activation functions into a representative tree, which can further be used to
extract multivariate rules for reasoning. While the EC-DT translates an ANN in
a layer-wise manner to represent exactly the decision boundaries implicitly
learned by the hidden layers of the network, the Extended C-Net combines the
decompositional approach from EC-DT with a C5 tree learning algorithm to form
decision rules. The results suggest that while EC-DT is superior in preserving
the structure and the fidelity of ANN, Extended C-Net generates the most
compact and highly effective trees from ANN. Both proposed MDT algorithms
generate rules including combinations of multiple attributes for precise
interpretations for decision-making.

detectors for semantic line detection. However, these methods neglect the
inherent characteristics of lines, leading to sub-optimal performance. Lines
enjoy much simpler geometric property than complex objects and thus can be
compactly parameterized by a few arguments. To better exploit the property of
lines, in this paper, we incorporate the classical Hough transform technique
into deeply learned representations and propose a one-shot end-to-end learning
framework for line detection. By parameterizing lines with slopes and biases,
we perform Hough transform to translate deep representations into the
parametric domain, in which we perform line detection. Specifically, we
aggregate features along candidate lines on the feature map plane and then
assign the aggregated features to corresponding locations in the parametric
domain. Consequently, the problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial
domain is transformed into spotting individual points in the parametric domain,
making the post-processing steps, i.e. non-maximal suppression, more efficient.
Furthermore, our method makes it easy to extract contextual line features eg
features along lines close to a specific line, that are critical for accurate
line detection. In addition to the proposed method, we design an evaluation
metric to assess the quality of line detection and construct a large scale
dataset for the line detection task. Experimental results on our proposed
dataset and another public dataset demonstrate the advantages of our method
over previous state-of-the-art alternatives.

recommend an appropriate sticker to user based on multi-turn dialog context
history without any external labels. Two main challenges are confronted in this
task. One is to learn semantic meaning of stickers without corresponding text
labels. Another challenge is to jointly model the candidate sticker with the
multi-turn dialog context. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sticker
response selector (SRS) model. Specifically, SRS first employs a convolutional
based sticker image encoder and a self-attention based multi-turn dialog
encoder to obtain the representation of stickers and utterances. Next, deep
interaction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the sticker
with each utterance in the dialog history. SRS then learns the short-term and
long-term dependency between all interaction results by a fusion network to
output the the final matching score. To evaluate our proposed method, we
collect a large-scale real-world dialog dataset with stickers from one of the
most popular online chatting platform. Extensive experiments conducted on this
dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for all
commonly-used metrics. Experiments also verify the effectiveness of each
component of SRS. To facilitate further research in sticker selection field, we
release this dataset of 340K multi-turn dialog and sticker pairs.

  Established security models including split counter mode encryption and
Bonsai Merkle tree (BMT) authentication have been introduced against such data
integrity attacks. However, these security methods are not readily compatible

support crash recovery for secure NVMM. We highlight that prior research has
substantially under-estimated the cost of BMT persistence and propose several

transport within the framework of the disk/halo diffusion model, namely a
scenario in which the matter and the Cosmic Ray sources in our Galaxy are
confined to a thin disk, while Cosmic Ray propagation occurs in a much larger
halo with negligible matter density. We solve the Cosmic Ray transport equation
accounting for spallation reactions, decay and ionization losses as well as
advection. We find that the $^{60}$Fe/$^{56}$Fe ratio at the source must be
very close to the value detected in the local Cosmic Ray spectrum at Earth, due
to the fact that spallation reactions are more effective for $^{56}$Fe than for

three-dimensional numerical simulations. We consider the effect of capillary
number, volume fraction and membrane inextensibility on the particle
deformation and on the effective suspension viscosity and normal stress
differences of the suspension. The suspension displays a shear-thinning
behaviour which is a characteristic of soft particles such as emulsion
droplets, vesicles, strain-softening capsules, and red blood cells. We find
that the membrane inextensibility plays a significant role on the rheology and
can almost suppress the shear-thinning. For concentrated suspensions a
non-monotonic dependence of the normal stress differences on the membrane
inextensibility is observed, reflecting a similar behaviour in the particle
shape. The effective suspension viscosity, instead, grows and eventually
saturates, for very large inextensibilities, approaching the solid particle
limit. In essence, our results reveal that strain-hardening capsules share
rheological features with both soft and solid particles depending on the ratio
of the area dilatation to shear elastic modulus. Furthermore, the suspension
viscosity exhibits a universal behaviour for the parameter space defined by the
capillary number and the membrane inextensibility, when introducing the
particle geometrical changes at the steady-state in the definition of the
volume fraction.

latter is well known to be organized in hierarchical and modular way. While it
is assumed that structural networks shape their functional counterparts, it is
also hypothesized that alterations of brain dynamics come with transformations
of functional connectivity. In this computational study, we introduce a novel
methodology to monitor the persistence and breakdown of hierarchical order in

on both synthetic and real structural connectomes. We show that hierarchical
connectivity appears in functional networks in a persistent way if the dynamics
is set to be in the quasi-critical regime associated with optimal processing
capabilities and normal brain function, while it breaks down in other
(supercritical) dynamical regimes, often associated with pathological
conditions. Our results offer important clues for the study of optimal
neurocomputing architectures and processes, which are capable of controlling
patterns of activity and information flow. We conclude that functional
connectivity patterns achieve optimal balance between local specialized
processing (i.e. segregation) and global integration by inheriting the
hierarchical organization of the underlying structural architecture.

UFOMap. UFOMap uses an explicit representation of all three states in the map,
i.e., occupied, free, and unknown. This gives, surprisingly, a more memory
efficient representation. Furthermore, we provide methods that allow for
significantly faster insertions into the octree. This enables real-time colored
volumetric mapping at high resolution (below 1 cm). UFOMap is contributed as a
C++ library that can be used standalone but is also integrated into ROS.

  estimation: Two elbows for the quadratic functional",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local differential privacy has recently received increasing attention from
the statistics community as a valuable tool to protect the privacy of
individual data owners without the need of a trusted third party. Similar to
the classical notion of randomized response, the idea is that data owners
randomize their true information locally and only release the perturbed data.
Many different protocols for such local perturbation procedures can be
designed. In most estimation problems studied in the literature so far,
however, no significant difference in terms of minimax risk between purely
non-interactive protocols and protocols that allow for some amount of
interaction between individual data providers could be observed. In this paper
we show that for estimating the integrated square of a density, sequentially
interactive procedures improve substantially over the best possible
non-interactive procedure in terms of minimax rate of estimation. In
particular, in the non-interactive scenario we identify an elbow in the minimax
rate at $s=\frac34$, whereas in the sequentially interactive scenario the elbow
is at $s=\frac12$. This is markedly different from both, the case of direct
observations, where the elbow is well known to be at $s=\frac14$, as well as
from the case where Laplace noise is added to the original data, where an elbow
at $s= \frac94$ is obtained. We also provide adaptive estimators that achieve
the optimal rate up to log-factors, we draw connections to non-parametric
goodness-of-fit testing and estimation of more general integral functionals and
conduct a series of numerical experiments. The fact that a particular locally
differentially private, but interactive, mechanism improves over the simple
non-interactive one is also of great importance for practical implementations
of local differential privacy.

(ODsymNMF), that does not take into account the diagonal entries of the input

symNMF. First, ODsymNMF is theoretically much more sound as there always exists
an exact factorization of size at most $\nicefrac{n(n-1)}{2}$ where $n$ is the
dimension of the input matrix. Second, it makes more sense in practice as
diagonal entries of the input matrix typically correspond to the similarity
between an item and itself, not bringing much information. Third, it makes the
optimization problem much easier to solve. In particular, it will allow us to
design an algorithm based on coordinate descent that minimizes the
component-wise $\ell_1$ norm between the input matrix and its approximation. We
prove that this norm is much better suited for binary input matrices often

friction along the discontinuities as they are subjected to significant
confining pressures. This friction plays a critical role in the growth of these
shear fractures, as revealed by the fracture mechanics theory of Palmer and
Rice decades ago. In this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model of shear
fracture in pressure-sensitive geomaterials, honoring the role of friction in
the fracture propagation mechanism. Building on a recently proposed phase-field
method for frictional interfaces, we formulate a set of governing equations for
different contact conditions (or lack thereof) in which frictional energy
dissipation emerges in the crack driving force during slip. We then derive the
degradation function and the threshold fracture energy of the phase-field model
such that the stress-strain behavior is insensitive to the length parameter for
phase-field regularization. This derivation procedure extends a methodology
used in recent phase-field models of cohesive tensile fracture to shear
fracture in frictional materials in which peak and residual strengths coexist
and evolve by confining pressure. The resulting phase-field formulation is
demonstrably consistent with the theory of Palmer and Rice. Numerical examples
showcase that the proposed phase-field model is a physically sound and
numerically efficient method for simulating shear fracture processes in
geologic materials, such as faulting and slip surface growth.

based on a two-level low-rank structure imposed on the functional regression
surfaces. A global low-rank structure identifies a small set of latent
principal functional responses and predictors that drives the underlying
regression association. A local low-rank structure then controls the complexity
and smoothness of the association between the principal functional responses

boils down to an interesting integrated matrix approximation task, where the

developed. We establish the consistency of NRRR and also show through
non-asymptotic analysis that it can achieve at least a comparable error rate to

effectiveness of NRRR. We apply NRRR in an electricity demand problem, to

regression relationships, increasingly so in the era of data explosion. In such

to identify the predictors that are associated with the outcome, but also to
distinguish the true sources of heterogeneity, i.e., to identify the predictors
that have different effects among the clusters and thus are the true
contributors to the formation of the clusters. We clarify the concepts of the
source of heterogeneity that account for potential scale differences of the
clusters and propose a regularized finite mixture effects regression to achieve
heterogeneity pursuit and feature selection simultaneously. As the name
suggests, the problem is formulated under an effects-model parameterization, in
which the cluster labels are missing and the effect of each predictor on the
outcome is decomposed to a common effect term and a set of cluster-specific
terms. A constrained sparse estimation of these effects leads to the
identification of both the variables with common effects and those with
heterogeneous effects. We propose an efficient algorithm and show that our

in the viscosities in molten states in Al2O3 vs. MgO explains the differences

rotational tomography method, along with a method to narrow streamers and
refine the density estimate, to COR2A/STEREO observations from a period near
solar minimum and maximum, gaining density maps for heights between 4 and 8\Rs.
The coronal structure is highly radial at these heights, and the streamers are
very narrow, in some regions only a few degrees in width. The mean densities of
streamers is almost identical between solar minimum and maximum. However,
streamers at solar maximum contain around 50\%\ more total mass due to their
larger area. By assuming a constant mass flux, and constraints on proton flux
measured by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we estimate an outflow speed within solar
minimum streamers of 50-120\kms\ at 4\Rs, increasing to 90-250\kms\ at 8\Rs.
Accelerations of around 6\mss\ are found for streamers at a height of 4\Rs,
decreasing with height. The solar maximum slow wind shows a higher acceleration
to extended distances compared to solar minimum. To satisfy the solar wind
speeds measured by PSP, there must be a mean residual acceleration of around
1-2\mss\ between 8 and 40\Rs. Several aspects of this study strongly suggest
that the coronal streamer belt density is highly variable on small scales, and
that the tomography can only reveal a local spatial and temporal average.

smaller stellar mass surface density, smaller star formation rate surface

location of the fault by changing the impedance seen by the relay. The extent

To solve the problem associated with these compensators, two instruments for
separation and analysis of three-line currents, from the relay point of view at

the high-frequency components of the three-line currents, and the support

consistency model (MCM) of processors in such SoCs specifies the ordering rules
which constrain the values that can be read by load instructions in parallel
programs running on such systems. The implementation of required MCM orderings
can span components which may be designed and implemented by many different
teams. Ideally, each team would be able to specify the orderings enforced by
their components independently and then connect them together when conducting
MCM verification. However, no prior automated approach for formal hardware MCM
verification provided this.
  To bring automated hardware MCM verification in line with the realities of
the design process, we present RealityCheck, a methodology and tool for
automated formal MCM verification of modular microarchitectural ordering
specifications. RealityCheck allows users to specify their designs as a
hierarchy of distinct modules connected to each other rather than a single flat
specification. It can then automatically verify litmus test programs against
these modular specifications. RealityCheck also provides support for
abstraction, which enables scalable verification by breaking up the
verification of the entire design into smaller verification problems. We
present results for verifying litmus tests on 7 different designs using
RealityCheck. These include in-order and out-of-order pipelines, a non-blocking
cache, and a heterogeneous processor. Our case studies cover the TSO and RISC-V
(RVWMO) weak memory models. RealityCheck is capable of verifying 98 RVWMO
litmus tests in under 4 minutes each, and its capability for abstraction
enables up to a 32.1% reduction in litmus test verification time for RVWMO.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1910.12032",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating 3D human pose from a single image is a challenging task. This work
attempts to address the uncertainty of lifting the detected 2D joints to the 3D
space by introducing an intermediate state-Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets
(HEMlets), which shortens the gap between the 2D observation and the 3D
interpretation. The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the
relative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In
our approach, a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) is first trained to predict
HEMlets from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap
regression. We leverage on the integral operation to extract the joint
locations from the volumetric heatmaps, guaranteeing end-to-end learning.
Despite the simplicity of the network design, the quantitative comparisons show
a significant performance improvement over the best-of-grade methods (e.g.
$20\%$ on Human3.6M). The proposed method naturally supports training with
""in-the-wild"" images, where only weakly-annotated relative depth information of
skeletal joints is available. This further improves the generalization ability
of our model, as validated by qualitative comparisons on outdoor images.
Leveraging the strength of the HEMlets pose estimation, we further design and
append a shallow yet effective network module to regress the SMPL parameters of
the body pose and shape. We term the entire HEMlets-based human pose and shape
recovery pipeline HEMlets PoSh. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments on the existing human body recovery benchmarks justify the
state-of-the-art results obtained with our HEMlets PoSh approach.

only useful for estimation in terms of the original stochastic model of
interest, but can be used in stochastic gradient algorithms which benefit from
unbiased estimates. Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that our estimator
is not only unbiased but of finite variance. In addition, when implemented on a
single processor, we show that the cost to achieve a given level of error is
comparable to multilevel Monte Carlo methods, both practically and

confirmed cases for 1,005 U.S. counties. Participants: A total of 69,498 cases
in China and 740,843 cases in the U.S. are used for calculating the effective

impact of temperature and relative humidity on the effective reproductive

higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19.
Specifically, an increase in temperature by 1 degree Celsius is associated with
a reduction in the R value of COVID-19 by 0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in

These blocks adaptively recalibrate the channel-wise feature responses by
utilizing a self-gating mechanism of the global information embedding of the
feature maps. (II) To strengthen feature propagation and encourage feature
reuse, we use densely connected convolutions in the last convolutional layer of
the encoding path. (III) Instead of a simple concatenation in the skip
connection of U-Net, we employ BConvLSTM in all levels of the network to
combine the feature maps extracted from the corresponding encoding path and the
previous decoding up-convolutional layer in a non-linear way. The proposed

servers and $K$ users, each equipped with a local cache memory. In the delivery
phase, each user connects randomly to any $\rho$ out of $P$ servers. Thanks to
the availability of multiple servers, which model small-cell base stations
(SBSs), demands can be satisfied with reduced storage capacity at each server
and reduced delivery rate per server; however, this also leads to reduced
multicasting opportunities compared to the single-server scenario. A joint
storage and proactive caching scheme is proposed, which exploits coded storage
across the servers, uncoded cache placement at the users, and coded delivery.
The delivery \textit{latency} is studied for both \textit{successive} and
\textit{parallel} transmissions from the servers. It is shown that, with
successive transmissions the achievable average delivery latency is comparable
to the one achieved in the single-server scenario, while the gap between the
two depends on $\rho$, the available redundancy across the servers, and can be
reduced by increasing the storage capacity at the SBSs. The optimality of the
proposed scheme with uncoded cache placement and MDS-coded server storage is
also proved for successive transmissions.

the existence of a metric linear connection of zero curvature. Such a linear
connection $\nabla$ plays an important role in the differential geometry of
non-Riemannian surfaces in the sense that the Riemannian quadratic forms can be
changed into Minkowski functionals in the tangent planes such that the
Minkowskian length of the tangent vectors is invariant under the parallel
translation with respect to $\nabla$ (compatibility condition). A smoothly
varying family of Minkowski functionals in the tangent planes is called a
Finslerian metric function under some regularity conditions. Especially, the
existence of a compatible linear connection provides the Finsler surface to be
a so-called generalized Berwald surface. It is an alternative of the Riemannian
geometry for $\nabla$. Using some general observations and topological
obstructions we concentrate on explicit examples. In some representative cases

for a quantum field theory. We examine their application to Horndeski gravity
models reconstructed from the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. This
enables us to assess whether particular phenomenological parameterizations of
the EFT functions reconstruct theories that respect or violate the positivity
bounds. We find that commonly adopted EFT parametrizations, cast in terms of
the dark energy density or power laws of the scale factor, only satisfy the
positivity bounds in non-trivial regions of the parameter space. We then
examine parameterizations of the inherently stable EFT basis, constructed to
avoid gradient and ghost instabilities by default. In stark contrast, in this
basis the positivity bounds either only provide constraints in a-priori
unrealistic regions of the parameter space or do not provide any constraints on
parameter values at all. The application of positivity bounds to common
parametrizations of the standard EFT functions can therefore lead to artificial
conclusions that the region of viable Horndeski modifications of gravity is
highly constrained. Our results provide a strong motivation, in addition to the
default avoidance of theoretical instabilities, for instead adopting
parametrizations of the inherently stable EFT basis when testing dark energy
and modified gravity models with forthcoming cosmological survey data.

with the Sun is the ubiquitous presence of relatively small-scale structures
standing out as sudden deflections of the magnetic field. They were called
switchbacks as some of them show up the full reversal of the radial component
of the magnetic field and then return to regular conditions. Analyzing the
magnetic field and plasma perturbations associated with switchbacks we identify
three types of structures with slightly different characteristics: 1. Alfvenic
structures, where the variations of the magnetic field components take place
while the magnitude of the field remains constant; 2. Compressional, the field
magnitude varies together with changes of the components; 3. Structures
manifesting full reversal of the magnetic field (extremal class of Alfvenic
structures). Processing of structures boundaries and plasma bulk velocity
perturbations lead to the conclusion that they represent localized magnetic
field tubes with enhanced parallel plasma velocity and ion beta moving together
with respect to surrounding plasma. The magnetic field deflections before and
after the switchbacks reveal the existence of total axial current. The electric
currents are concentrated on the relatively narrow boundary layers on the
surface of the tubes and determine the magnetic field perturbations inside the
tube. These currents are closed on the structure surface, and typically have
comparable azimuthal and the axial components. The surface of the structure may
also accommodate an electromagnetic wave, that assists to particles in carrying
currents. We suggest that the two types of structures we analyzed here may
represent the local manifestations of the tube deformations corresponding to a
saturated stage of the Firehose instability development.

exposed to currents leading to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of the
structure. This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of
fatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great
importance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with
elastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural
and hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present
frequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been
computed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to
inconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements
and experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor
of 10 - 20 in the riser design, which increases development cost and adds extra
constraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the
simplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive
parameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is
to demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy
by applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step
approach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed
to identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These
parameters will be grouped using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal
hydrodynamic parameters will be identified for each data group by optimisation
against measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response using the obtained parameters
will be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. The correct
hydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases can be obtained from the
clustering. This concept has been demonstrated with examples from experimental
data.

most of them employ time-consuming ray-tracing methodology, where particles are
randomly sampled from relevant distributions. In addition, they tend not to

presents the development of a vulnerability assessment model, which relies on a
fully statistical procedure: the debris fluxes are directly used combining them
with the concept of the vulnerable zone, avoiding the random sampling the
debris fluxes. A novel methodology is presented to predict damage to internal

various graph analysis tasks, e.g., node classification, link prediction, and
graph clustering. However, they expose uncertainty and unreliability against
the well-designed inputs, i.e., adversarial examples. Accordingly, a line of
studies has emerged for both attack and defense addressed in different graph
analysis tasks, leading to the arms race in graph adversarial learning. Despite
the booming works, there still lacks a unified problem definition and a
comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we investigate and summarize the
existing works on graph adversarial learning tasks systemically. Specifically,
we survey and unify the existing works w.r.t. attack and defense in graph
analysis tasks, and give appropriate definitions and taxonomies at the same
time. Besides, we emphasize the importance of related evaluation metrics,
investigate and summarize them comprehensively. Hopefully, our works can
provide a comprehensive overview and offer insights for the relevant

method to measure the similarity between a MIDI file and an arbitrary musical
style delineated by a collection of MIDI files. MIDI files are encoded using a
novel set of features and an embedding is learned using Random Forests.
Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with
human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank
generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus. In
addition, similarity can be measured with respect to a single feature, allowing
specific discrepancies between generated samples and a particular musical style

unsupervised methods, during training, generate speech by computing style from
the corresponding ground truth sample and use a decoder to combine the style

information into the style vector. The decoder can use the leaked content and
ignore some of the input text to minimize the reconstruction loss. At inference
time, when the reference speech does not match the content input, the output
may not contain all of the content of the input text. We refer to this problem
as ""content leakage"", which we address by explicitly estimating and minimizing
the mutual information between the style and the content through an adversarial
training formulation. We call our method MIST - Mutual Information based Style

autonomous driving. Humans, when not distracted or drunk, are still the best
drivers you can currently find. For this reason we take inspiration from two
theoretical ideas about the human mind and its neural organization. The first
idea concerns how the brain uses a hierarchical structure of neuron ensembles
to extract abstract concepts from visual experience and code them into compact
representations. The second idea suggests that these neural perceptual
representations are not neutral but functional to the prediction of the future
state of affairs in the environment. Similarly, the prediction mechanism is not
neutral but oriented to the current planning of a future action. We identify
within the deep learning framework two artificial counterparts of the
aforementioned neurocognitive theories. We find a correspondence between the
first theoretical idea and the architecture of convolutional autoencoders,
while we translate the second theory into a training procedure that learns
compact representations which are not neutral but oriented to driving tasks,
from two distinct perspectives. From a static perspective, we force groups of
neural units in the compact representations to distinctly represent specific
concepts crucial to the driving task. From a dynamic perspective, we encourage
the compact representations to be predictive of how the current road scenario
will change in the future. We successfully learn compact representations that
use as few as 16 neural units for each of the two basic driving concepts we
consider: car and lane. We prove the efficiency of our proposed perceptual
representations on the SYNTHIA dataset. Our source code is available at

enable efficient computational analysis. In the present work, we propose a
novel methodology to obtain a parameterization of a component's plastic

many application domains, for example, when optimizing the crash behavior in

using the vector logic, a matrix-vectors formalism for logical functions and
truth values. Inside this formalism, the counterfactuals can be transformed in
complex matrices preprocessing an implication matrix with one of the square
roots of NOT, a complex matrix. This mathematical approach puts in evidence the
virtual character of the counterfactuals. This happens because this
representation produces a valuation of a counterfactual that is the
superposition of the two opposite truth values weighted, respectively, by two
complex conjugated coefficients. This result shows that this procedure gives an
uncertain evaluation projected on the complex domain. After this basic
representation, the judgment of the plausibility of a given counterfactual
allows us to shift the decision towards an acceptance or a refusal. This shift
is the result of applying for a second time one of the two square roots of NOT.

efforts for its reduction. Current approaches show promising progress towards
debiasing single bias dimensions such as gender or race. In this paper, we
present a joint multiclass debiasing approach that is capable of debiasing
multiple bias dimensions simultaneously. In that direction, we present two
approaches, HardWEAT and SoftWEAT, that aim to reduce biases by minimizing the
scores of the Word Embeddings Association Test (WEAT). We demonstrate the
viability of our methods by debiasing Word Embeddings on three classes of
biases (religion, gender and race) in three different publicly available word
embeddings and show that our concepts can both reduce or even completely
eliminate bias, while maintaining meaningful relationships between vectors in
word embeddings. Our work strengthens the foundation for more unbiased neural

of wireless networks, particularly in recent year. Sensors are randomly
positioned in the region, every node senses the surroundings and sends the data
collected to the cluster head (CH), which aggregates and transmits obtained
information to the Base Station (BS). A non-rechargeable battery is included on
each WSN node. The sensor energy and network life extension of WSN are the most
important considerations in the academia and industry. And thus, many routing
protocols have been proposed to solve this issue, one of these is LEACH, the
early protocol that introduced the clustering idea to extend the life of the
WSN. LEACH is affected by the number of heads of the Clusters as it is randomly
selected, and this has an impact on network lifetime, furthermore, the nodes
are randomly joined in each cluster, this means that some of the cluster heads
work more than others with fewer cluster nodes. In this paper, it is proposed
an algorithm Maximum Optimal Number of Cluster Heads (MONCH) to identify the
optimum cluster heads in WSN and to find which is the nearest one to BS and
helps to integrate nodes with the most appropriate cluster. The results show
improved energy consumption performance for the LEACH algorithm.

  security vulnerabilities",,,,,"cs.PL cs.CR cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reasoning about correctness and security of software is increasingly
difficult due to the complexity of modern microarchitectural features such as
out-of-order execution. A class of security vulnerabilities termed Spectre that
exploits side effects of speculative, out-of-order execution was announced in
2018 and has since drawn much attention. In this paper we formalise speculative
execution and its side effects with the intention of allowing speculation to be
reasoned about abstractly at the program level, limiting the exposure to
processor-specific or low-level semantics. To this end we encode and expose
speculative execution explicitly in the programming language, rather than
solely in the operational semantics; as a result the effects of speculative
execution are captured by redefining the meaning of a conditional statement,
and introducing novel language constructs that model transient execution of an
alternative branch. We add an abstract cache to the global state of the system,
and derive some general refinement rules that expose cache side effects due to
speculative loads. Underlying this extension is a semantic model that is based
on instruction-level parallelism. The rules are encoded in a simulation tool,
which we use to analyse an abstract specification of a Spectre attack and
vulnerable code fragments.

limited to laboratory settings. By incorporating micron-scale diamond particles
at an annular interface within the cross section of a silicate glass fiber, a
high-sensitivity and robust fiber platform for magnetic field sensing is
demonstrated here. The fluorescence and spin properties of NV centers embedded
in the diamond crystals are well preserved during the fiber drawing process,
leading to enhanced continuous-wave diamond-magnetometry in fiber-transmitted
sensing configurations. The interface doping of diamond particles also leads to
reduced fiber propagation loss and benefits the guidance of NV-fluorescence in
the hybrid fiber. Using the diamond-fiber system, magnetic field readout
through 50 cm of fiber is achieved. This study paves the way for novel
fiber-based diamond sensors for field-deployable quantum metrology

addressed in quantum domain. A variant of $k$-clique problem that lists all

circuit for the maximum clique problem in classical-quantum hybrid

generalized in nature. The proposed approach of solving $k$-clique problem has
exhibited a reduction of qubit cost and circuit depth as compared to the

framework that can map the automated generated circuit for clique problem to
