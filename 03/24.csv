it has been criticized for relying on a ""cross-world"" independence assumption
that is empirically difficult to verify and problematic to justify based on
background knowledge. In the present article we aim to assist the applied
researcher in understanding this assumption. Synthesizing what is known about
the cross-world independence assumption, we discuss the relationship between
assumptions for causal mediation analyses, causal models, and non-parametric
identification of natural direct and indirect effects. In particular we give a
practical example of an applied setting where the cross-world independence
assumption is violated even without any post-treatment confounding. Further, we
review possible alternatives to the cross-world independence assumption,
including the use of computation of bounds that avoid the assumption
altogether. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which the cross-world
independence assumption is violated to assess the ensuing bias in estimating
natural direct and indirect effects. We conclude with recommendations for
carrying out causal mediation analyses.

spin-exchange anisotropy, collapses with increasing Rh content, prior to the
suppression of the Mott-insulating state and in contrast to electron doping via
La substitution of the Sr site. At the same time, despite heavy damping, the
d-d excitation spectra retain their overall amplitude and dispersion character.
A careful study of the spin-wave spectrum reveals that deviations from the
J1-J2-J3 Heisenberg used to model the pristine system disappear at intermediate
doping levels. These findings are interpreted in terms of a modulation of Ir-Ir
correlations due to the influence of Rh impurities upon nearby Ir wave
functions, even as the single-band Jeff=1/2 model remains valid up to full
carrier delocalization. They underline the importance of the transition metal
site symmetry when doping pseudospin systems such as Sr2IrO4.

requires less communication overhead compared to the centralized version. Among

set-based observers using interval-based and set-membership approaches for a
linear discrete-time dynamical system with bounded modeling and measurement
uncertainties. Both algorithms utilize a new over-approximating zonotopes

since our intersection of zonotopes formula resembles the traditional diffusion
step in the stochastic Kalman filter. Our new zonotopes intersection takes
linear time. Our set-based diffusion step decreases the estimation errors and
the size of estimated sets and can be seen as a lightweight approach to achieve
partial consensus between the distributed estimated sets. Every node shares its
measurement with its neighbor in the measurement update step. The neighbors
intersect their estimated sets constituting our proposed set-based diffusion
step. We represent sets as zonotopes since they compactly represent
high-dimensional sets, and they are closed under linear mapping and Minkowski
addition. The applicability of our algorithms is demonstrated by a localization
example. All used data and code to recreate our findings are publicly available

target and organ-at-risk delineation and enable online adaptive image-guided
treatment. Spatial distortions resulting from non-linearities in the gradient
fields and non-uniformity in the main magnetic field must be accounted for
across the imaging field-of-view to prevent systematic errors during treatment
delivery. This work presents a modular phantom and software application to
characterize geometric distortion (GD) within the large field-of-view MRI
images required for radiation therapy simulation. The modular phantom is
assembled from a series of rectangular foam blocks containing high-contrast
fiducial markers in a known configuration. The modular phantom design
facilitates transportation of the phantom between different MR scanners and
MR-guided linear accelerators and allows the phantom to be adapted to fit
different sized bores or coils. The phantom was evaluated using a 1.5T
MR-guided linear accelerator (MR-Linac) and 1.5T and 3.0T diagnostic scanners.
Performance was assessed by varying acquisition parameters to induce image
distortions in a known manner. Imaging was performed using T1 and T2 weighted
pulse sequences with 2D and 3D distortion correction algorithms and the
receiver bandwidth (BW) varied as 250-815 Hz/pixel. Phantom set-up
reproducibility was evaluated across independent set-ups. The software was
validated by comparison with a non-modular phantom. Average geometric
distortion was 0.94+/-0.58 mm for the MR-Linac, 0.90+/-0.53 mm for the 1.5 T
scanner, and 1.15+/-0.62 mm for the 3.0T scanner, for a 400 mm diameter
volume-of-interest. GD increased, as expected, with decreasing BW, and with the
2D versus 3D correction algorithm. Differences in GD attributed to phantom
set-up were 0.13 mm or less. Differences in GD for the two software
applications were less than 0.07 mm.

disordered tubular aggregates of optically active molecules. It has been shown
previously that such tubular structures allow for excitons delocalized over
more than a thousand molecules, owing to the combined effects of long-range
dipole-dipole interactions and the higher-dimensional (not truly
one-dimensional) nature of the aggregate. Such large delocalization sizes
prompt the question to what extent in experimental systems the delocalization
may still be determined by the aggregate size (diameter and length) and how
this affects the aggregate's optical response and dynamics. We perform a
systematic study of the size effects on the localization properties, using
numerical simulations of the exciton states in a cylindrical model structure
inspired by the previously derived geometry of a cylindrical aggregate of
cyanine dye molecules (C8S3). To characterize the exciton localization, we
calculate the participation ratio and the autocorrelation function of the
exciton wave function. Also, we calculate the density of states and absorption
spectrum. We find strong effects of the tube's radius on the localization and
optical properties in the range of parameters relevant to experiment. In
addition, surprisingly, we find that even for tubes as long as 750 nm, the
localization size is limited by the tube's length for disorder values that are
relevant to experimental circumstances, while observable effects of the tube's
length in the absorption spectrum still occur for tube lengths up to about 150
nm. The latter may explain changes in the optical spectra observed during the
aging process of bromine-substituted C8S3 aggregates. For weak disorder, the
exciton wave functions exhibit a scattered, fractal-like nature, similar to the
quasi-particles in two-dimensional disordered systems.

semimetals occupy a special place - the electronic band topology in these
materials is related to three-dimensional bulk, rather than to surface, states.
A great variety of different realizations of electronic band crossings (the
nodes) leads to a plethora of different electronic properties, ranging from the
chiral anomaly to solid-state realizations of a black-hole horizon. The
different nodal phases have similar low-energy band structure and quasiparticle
dynamics, which both can be accessed experimentally by a number of methods.
Optical measurements with their large penetration depth and high energy
resolution are ideally suited as such a bulk probe; especially at low energies
where other spectroscopic methods often lack the required resolution. In this
contribution, we review recent optical-conductivity studies of different nodal
semimetals, discuss possible limitations of such measurements, and provide a
comparison between the experimental results, simple theoretical models, and

And at what maximum rate? These questions lie at the heart of quantum
technology, but remain unanswered because of non-additivity -- a fundamental
synergy which allows quantum devices (aka quantum channels) to send more
information than expected. Previously, non-additivity was known to occur in
very noisy channels with coherent information much smaller than that of a
perfect channel; but, our work shows non-additivity in a simple low-noise
channel. Our results extend even further. We prove a general theorem concerning
positivity of a channel's coherent information. A corollary of this theorem
gives a simple dimensional test for a channel's capacity. Applying this
corollary solves an open problem by characterizing all qubit channels whose
complement has non-zero capacity. Another application shows a wide class of
zero quantum capacity qubit channels can assist an incomplete erasure channel
in sending quantum information. These results arise from introducing and
linking logarithmic singularities in the von-Neumann entropy with quantum
transmission: changes in entropy caused by this singularity are a mechanism
responsible for both positivity and non-additivity of the coherent information.
Analysis of such singularities may be useful in other physics problems.

is one of the most challenging problems in modern condensed matter physics. The
long-range Coulomb interaction and the fermion-phonon interaction can lead to a
variety of intriguing properties. In the strong-coupling regime, weak-coupling
perturbation theory breaks down. The validity of $1/N$ expansion with $N$ being
the fermion flavor is also in doubt since $N$ equals to $2$ or $4$ in realistic
systems. Here, we investigate the interaction between (1+2)- and
(1+3)-dimensional massless Dirac fermions and a generic scalar boson, and
develop an efficient non-perturbative approach to access the strong-coupling
regime. We first derive a number of self-consistently coupled Ward-Takahashi
identities based on a careful symmetry analysis and then use these identities
to show that the full fermion-boson vertex function is solely determined by the
full fermion propagator. Making use of this result, we rigorously prove that
the full fermion propagator satisfies an exact and self-closed Dyson-Schwinger
integral equation, which can be solved by employing numerical methods. A major
advantage of our non-perturbative approach is that there is no need to employ
any small expansion parameter. Our approach provides a unified theoretical
framework for studying strong Coulomb and fermion-phonon interactions. It may
also be used to approximately handle the Yukawa coupling between fermions and
order-parameter fluctuations around continuous quantum critical points. Our
approach is applied to treat the Coulomb interaction in undoped graphene. We
find that the renormalized fermion velocity exhibits a logarithmic
momentum-dependence but is nearly energy independent, and that no excitonic gap
is generated by the Coulomb interaction. These theoretical results are
consistent with experiments in graphene.

pathological states, spike train synchrony has become an important measure to
analyze experimental neuronal data. Many different measures of spike train
synchrony have been proposed, but there is no gold standard allowing for
comparison of results between different experiments. This work aims to provide
guidance on which synchrony measure is best suitable to quantify the effect of
epileptiform inducing substances (e.g. bicuculline (BIC)) in in vitro neuronal
spike train data. Spike train data from recordings are likely to suffer from
erroneous spike detection, such as missed spikes (false negative) or noise
(false positive). Therefore, different time-scale dependent (cross-correlation,
mutual information, spike time tiling coefficient) and time-scale independent
(Spike-contrast, phase synchronization, A-SPIKE-synchronization,
A-ISI-distance, ARI-SPIKE-distance) synchrony measures were compared in terms
of their robustness to erroneous spike trains. As a result of the in silico
manipulated data, Spike-contrast was the only measure being robust to false
negative as well as false-positive spikes. Analyzing the experimental data set
revealed that all measures were able to capture the effect of BIC in a
statistically significant way, with Spike-contrast showing the highest
statistical significance even at low spike detection thresholds. In summary, we
suggest the usage of Spike-contrast to complement established synchrony
measures, as it is time scale independent and robust to erroneous spike trains.

incorporating time delay information, not requiring the unknown source
position. It is found that this avoids a possible bias that leads to
""over-focusing"" the images, i.e. providing source position estimates that lie
in a considerably smaller region than the true positions. The second is
inspired by previous reconstructions of the cluster of galaxies MACS
J1149.6+2223, where a multiply-imaged background galaxy contained a supernova,
SN Refsdal, of which four additional images were produced by the presence of a
smaller cluster galaxy. The inversion for the cluster as a whole, was not able
to recover sufficient detail interior to this quad. We show how constraints on
such different scales, from the entire cluster to a single member galaxy, can
now be used, allowing such small scale substructures to be resolved. Finally,
the addition of weak lensing information to this method is investigated. While
this clearly helps recover the environment around the strong lensing region,
the mass sheet degeneracy may make a full strong and weak inversion difficult,
depending on the quality of the ellipticity information at hand. We encounter
ring-like structure at the boundary of the two regimes, argued to be the result
of combining strong and weak lensing constraints, possibly affected by

features. Most importantly, it allows for incorporating expert knowledge into
the learning, and hence leading to much faster learning and better
generalization compared to the standard deep reinforcement learning. However,
most of the existing RRL approaches are either incapable of incorporating
expert background knowledge (e.g., in the form of explicit predicate language)
or are not able to learn directly from non-relational data such as image. In
this paper, we propose a novel deep RRL based on a differentiable Inductive
Logic Programming (ILP) that can effectively learn relational information from
image and present the state of the environment as first order logic predicates.
Additionally, it can take the expert background knowledge and incorporate it
into the learning problem using appropriate predicates. The differentiable ILP
allows an end to end optimization of the entire framework for learning the
policy in RRL. We show the efficacy of this novel RRL framework using
environments such as BoxWorld, GridWorld as well as relational reasoning for
the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.

temporal driving has attracted a huge interest recently as it was shown that
certain fast drivings can create new topological effects, while a strong
driving leads to e.g. Anderson localization physics. In this work, we focus on
the intermediate regime to observe a quantum chaos transport mechanism called
chaos-assisted tunneling which provides new possibilities of control for
quantum simulation. Indeed, this regime generates a rich classical phase space
where stable trajectories form islands surrounded by a large sea of unstable
chaotic orbits. This mimics an effective superlattice for the quantum states
localized in the regular islands, with new controllable tunneling properties.
Besides the standard textbook tunneling through a potential barrier,
chaos-assisted tunneling corresponds to a much richer tunneling process where
the coupling between quantum states located in neighboring regular islands is
mediated by other states spread over the chaotic sea. This process induces
sharp resonances where the tunneling rate varies by orders of magnitude over a
short range of parameters. We experimentally demonstrate and characterize these
resonances for the first time in a quantum system. This opens the way to new
kinds of quantum simulations with long-range transport and new types of control
of quantum systems through complexity.

By contrast, the second event, GW190425, with $M_{\rm

While GW190425 is compatible with a scenario in which the merger has lead to a
prompt collapse to a black hole and little ejected matter to power a
counterpart, determining the mass ratio and the effective spin $\tilde{\chi}$
of the binary remains difficult. This is because gravitational waveforms cannot

is a critical challenge of modern deep learning. Recently, Liu et al.[19]
proposed a splitting steepest descent (S2D) method that jointly optimizes the
neural parameters and architectures based on progressively growing network
structures by splitting neurons into multiple copies in a steepest descent
fashion. However, S2D suffers from a local optimality issue when all the
neurons become ""splitting stable"", a concept akin to local stability in
parametric optimization. In this work, we develop a significant and surprising
extension of the splitting descent framework that addresses the local
optimality issue. The idea is to observe that the original S2D is unnecessarily
restricted to splitting neurons into positive weighted copies. By simply
allowing both positive and negative weights during splitting, we can eliminate
the appearance of splitting stability in S2D and hence escape the local optima
to obtain better performance. By incorporating signed splittings, we
significantly extend the optimization power of splitting steepest descent both
theoretically and empirically. We verify our method on various challenging
benchmarks such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet and ModelNet40, on which we outperform
S2D and other advanced methods on learning accurate and energy-efficient neural
networks.

has at least $r$ infected neighbors. In this paper, we focus on a random graph
model named the stochastic hierarchical blockmodel, which is a special case of
the well-studied stochastic blockmodel. When the graph is not exceptionally
sparse, in particular, when each edge appears with probability
$\omega(n^{-(1+1/r)})$, under certain mild assumptions, we prove that the
optimal seeding strategy is to put all the seeds in a single community. This
matches the intuition that in a nonsubmodular cascade model placing seeds near
each other creates synergy. However, it sharply contrasts with the intuition
for submodular cascade models (e.g., the independent cascade model and the
linear threshold model) in which nearby seeds tend to erode each others'
effects. Our key technique is a novel time-asynchronized coupling of four
cascade processes. Finally, we show that this observation yields a polynomial
time dynamic programming algorithm which outputs optimal seeds if each edge
appears with a probability either in $\omega(n^{-(1+1/r)})$ or in $o(n^{-2})$.

focused on explaining this phenomenon by characterizing the local curvature
near critical points of the loss function, where the gradients are near zero,
and demonstrating that neural network losses enjoy a no-bad-local-minima
property and an abundance of saddle points. We report here that the methods
used to find these putative critical points suffer from a bad local minima
problem of their own: they often converge to or pass through regions where the
gradient norm has a stationary point. We call these gradient-flat regions,
since they arise when the gradient is approximately in the kernel of the
Hessian, such that the loss is locally approximately linear, or flat, in the
direction of the gradient. We describe how the presence of these regions
necessitates care in both interpreting past results that claimed to find
critical points of neural network losses and in designing second-order methods

crucial, yet it has thus far remained elusive at XFELs due to inherent timing
and phase jitter, which can be orders of magnitude larger than the timescale of
Auger decay. Here, we develop a new approach termed self-referenced attosecond

scale variance in semantic representation, named dynamic routing. The proposed
framework generates data-dependent routes, adapting to the scale distribution
of each image. To this end, a differentiable gating function, called soft
conditional gate, is proposed to select scale transform paths on the fly. In
addition, the computational cost can be further reduced in an end-to-end manner
by giving budget constraints to the gating function. We further relax the
network level routing space to support multi-path propagations and
skip-connections in each forward, bringing substantial network capacity. To
demonstrate the superiority of the dynamic property, we compare with several
static architectures, which can be modeled as special cases in the routing
space. Extensive experiments are conducted on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 to

stress-driven spin-down flow of a viscous fluid inside a spherical shell, both
within the incompressible and anelastic approximations, and in the asymptotic
limit of small viscosities. From boundary layer analysis, we derive an
analytical geostrophic solution for the 3D incompressible steady flow, inside
and outside the cylinder $\mathcal{C}$ that is tangent to the inner shell. The
Stewartson layer that lies on $\mathcal{C}$ is composed of two nested shear
layers of thickness $O(E^{2/7})$ and $O(E^{1/3})$. We derive the lowest order
solution for the $E^{2/7}$-layer. A simple analysis of the $E^{1/3}$-layer
laying along the tangent cylinder, reveals it to be the site of an upwelling
flow of amplitude $O(E^{1/3})$. Despite its narrowness, this shear layer
concentrates most of the global meridional kinetic energy of the spin-down
flow. Furthermore, a stable stratification does not perturb the spin-down flow
provided the Prandtl number is small enough. If this is not the case, the
Stewartson layer disappears and meridional circulation is confined within the
thermal layers. The scalings for the amplitude of the anelastic secondary flow
have been found to be the same as for the incompressible flow in all three
regions, at the lowest order. However, because the velocity no longer conforms
the Taylor-Proudman theorem, its shape differs outside the tangent cylinder
$\mathcal{C}$, that is, where differential rotation takes place. Finally, we
find the settling of the steady-state to be reached on a viscous time for the
weakly, strongly and thermally unstratified incompressible flows. Large density
variations relevant to astro- and geophysical systems, tend to slightly shorten
the transient.

and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a DFRC system, which utilizes
generalized spatial modulation (GSM) to realize coexisting radar and
communications waveforms. Our proposed GSM-based scheme, referred to as spatial
modulation based communication-radar (SpaCoR) system, allocates antenna
elements among the subsystems based on the transmitted message, thus achieving
increased communication rates by embedding additional data bits in the antenna
selection. We formulate the resulting signal models, and present a dedicated
radar processing scheme. To evaluate the radar performance, we characterize the
statistical properties of the transmit beam pattern. Then, we present a
hardware prototype of the proposed DFRC system, demonstrating the feasibility
of the scheme. Our results show that the proposed GSM system achieves improved
communication performance compared to techniques utilizing fixed allocations
operating at the same data rate. For the radar subsystem, our experiments show
that the spatial agility induced by the GSM transmission improves the angular
resolution and reduces the sidelobe level in the transmit beam pattern compared
to using fixed antenna allocations.

with medical doctors in the front line. MVM is designed for large-scale
production in a short amount of time and at a limited cost, as it relays on
off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide. Operation of the MVM
requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and
electrical power. Initial tests of a prototype device with a breathing

over many tiles and within single tiles. The load balancing algorithm can be
used with three different topologies, including two space-filling curves. We
tested this implementation in the code OSIRIS and show low overhead and
improved scalability with OpenMP thread number on simulations with both uniform

our algorithm gives order-of-magnitude improvement in parallel scalability for

problems arising in high-dimensional inference tasks. Here one produces an
estimator of an unknown parameter from independent samples of data by
iteratively optimizing a loss function. This loss function is random and often
non-convex. We study the performance of the simplest version of SGD, namely
online SGD, from a random start in the setting where the parameter space is
high-dimensional.
  We develop nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples needed for
consistent estimation as one varies the dimension. Our thresholds depend only
on an intrinsic property of the population loss which we call the information
exponent. In particular, our results do not assume uniform control on the loss
itself, such as convexity or uniform derivative bounds. The thresholds we
obtain are polynomial in the dimension and the precise exponent depends
explicitly on the information exponent. As a consequence of our results, we
find that except for the simplest tasks, almost all of the data is used simply
in the initial search phase to obtain non-trivial correlation with the ground
truth. Upon attaining non-trivial correlation, the descent is rapid and
exhibits law of large numbers type behavior.
  We illustrate our approach by applying it to a wide set of inference tasks
such as phase retrieval, and parameter estimation for generalized linear
models, online PCA, and spiked tensor models, as well as to supervised learning
for single-layer networks with general activation functions.

opportunities for the development of deployable systems that undergo large and
complex yet predictable shape transformations. There has been growing interest
in such structural systems that can extend uniaxially into tubes and booms. The
Kresling origami pattern, which arises from the twist buckling of a thin
cylinder and can exhibit multistability, offers great potential for this
purpose. However, much remains to be understood regarding the characteristics
of Kresling origami deployment. Prior studies have been limited to Kresling
structures' kinematics, quasi-static mechanics, or low-amplitude wave
responses, while their dynamic behaviors with large shape change during
deployment remain unexplored. These dynamics are critical to the system design
and control processes, but are complex due to the strong nonlinearity,
bistability, and potential for off-axis motions. To advance the state of the
art, this research seeks to uncover the deployment dynamics of Kresling
structures with various system geometries and operating strategies. A full,
six-degree-of-freedom model is developed and employed to provide insight into
the axial and off-axis dynamic responses, revealing that the variation of key
geometric parameters may lead to regions with qualitatively distinct mechanical
responses. Results illustrate the sensitivity of dynamic deployment to changes
in initial condition and small variations in geometric design. Further,
analyses show how certain geometries and configurations affect the stiffness of
various axial and off-axis deformation modes, offering guidance on the design
of systems that deploy effectively while mitigating the effects of off-axis
disturbances. Overall, the research outcomes suggest the strong potential of
Kresling-based designs for deployable systems with robust and tunable

answering and reasoning. However, they often contain errors and are missing
information. Vibrant research in KG refinement has worked to resolve these
issues, tailoring techniques to either detect specific types of errors or
complete a KG.
  In this work, we introduce a unified solution to KG characterization by
formulating the problem as unsupervised KG summarization with a set of
inductive, soft rules, which describe what is normal in a KG, and thus can be
used to identify what is abnormal, whether it be strange or missing. Unlike
first-order logic rules, our rules are labeled, rooted graphs, i.e., patterns
that describe the expected neighborhood around a (seen or unseen) node, based
on its type, and information in the KG. Stepping away from the traditional
support/confidence-based rule mining techniques, we propose KGist, Knowledge
Graph Inductive SummarizaTion, which learns a summary of inductive rules that
best compress the KG according to the Minimum Description Length principle---a
formulation that we are the first to use in the context of KG rule mining. We
apply our rules to three large KGs (NELL, DBpedia, and Yago), and tasks such as
compression, various types of error detection, and identification of incomplete
information. We show that KGist outperforms task-specific, supervised and
unsupervised baselines in error detection and incompleteness identification,
(identifying the location of up to 93% of missing entities---over 10% more than
baselines), while also being efficient for large knowledge graphs.

Conditioned U-Net (C-U-Net) uses a control mechanism to train a single model

EBW aims to neutralize the effect of the training bias arising from the

provide three-fold advantages compared to C-UNet: 1) Fewer effective training

the covariances usually employed underestimate the effects of coherent motion
of the supernova host galaxies. Contrary to previous studies which asserted
that peculiar velocities have negligible effect on cosmological parameter
estimation, we find that when such correlations are taken into account the JLA
data favour significantly smaller values of the dark energy density than in the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model. A joint fit to simultaneously determine the
cosmological parameters and the bulk flow indicates that the latter is around
250 km/s even beyond 200/h Mpc. The local bulk flow is thus an essential
nuisance parameter to be included in analyses of the supernova Hubble diagram.

news. Multimodal information, e.g., enriching text with photos, is typically
used to convey the news more effectively or to attract attention. Photo content
can range from decorative, depict additional important information, or can even
contain misleading information. Therefore, automatic approaches to quantify
cross-modal consistency of entity representation can support human assessors to
evaluate the overall multimodal message, for instance, with regard to bias or
sentiment. In some cases such measures could give hints to detect fake news,
which is an increasingly important topic in today's society. In this paper, we
introduce a novel task of cross-modal consistency verification in real-world
news and present a multimodal approach to quantify the entity coherence between
image and text. Named entity linking is applied to extract persons, locations,
and events from news texts. Several measures are suggested to calculate
cross-modal similarity for these entities using state of the art approaches. In
contrast to previous work, our system automatically gathers example data from
the Web and is applicable to real-world news. Results on two novel datasets
that cover different languages, topics, and domains demonstrate the feasibility
of our approach. Datasets and code are publicly available to foster research
towards this new direction.

interpolate between the heterogeneous (non-identically distributed data) and
iid-data settings, recovering linear convergence rates in many special cases,
for instance for over-parametrized models. Our proofs rely on weak assumptions
(typically improving over prior work in several aspects) and recover (and
improve) the best known complexity results for a host of important scenarios,

learning paradigm that scales up Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by
progressively increasing the population of training agents in a stage-wise
manner. Furthermore, EPC uses an evolutionary approach to fix an objective
misalignment issue throughout the curriculum: agents successfully trained in an
early stage with a small population are not necessarily the best candidates for
adapting to later stages with scaled populations. Concretely, EPC maintains
multiple sets of agents in each stage, performs mix-and-match and fine-tuning
over these sets and promotes the sets of agents with the best adaptability to
the next stage. We implement EPC on a popular MARL algorithm, MADDPG, and

three chemical potentials ($T,\mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S$), a strangeness
under-saturation factor ($\gamma_S$) has been used to incorporate the partial

not vary much with centrality, whereas chemical potentials and $\gamma_S$ seem

a complete chemical equilibrium at freeze-out at the peripheral collisions.
This deviation appears to be more prominent as the collision energy decreases
at lower RHIC-BES energies. We have also shown that this departure from

powerful tool for observing structural modifications taking place in
heterogeneous catalysts under reaction conditions. However, to strengthen the
link between catalyst structure and functionality, an $\textit{operando}$
measurement must be performed in which reaction kinetics and catalyst structure
are simultaneously determined. To determine chemical kinetics for gas-phase
catalysis, it is necessary to develop a reliable chemical engineering model to
describe catalysis as well as heat and mass transport processes within the ETEM
cell. Here, we establish a finite element model to determine the gas and
temperature profiles during catalysis in an open-cell operando ETEM experiment.
The model is applied to a $SiO_2$-supported Ru catalyst performing CO
oxidation. Good agreement is achieved between simulated compositions and those
measured experimentally across a temperature range of 25 - 350 {\deg}C. In
general, for lower conversions, the simulations show that the temperature and
gas are relatively homogeneous within the hot zone of the TEM holder where the
catalyst is located. The uniformity of gas and temperature indicates that the
ETEM reactor system behavior approximates that of a continuously stirred tank
reactor. The large degree of gas-phase uniformity also allows one to estimate
the catalytic conversion of reactants in the cell to within 10 percent using
electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Moreover, the findings indicate that for
reactant conversions below 30 percent, one can reliably evaluate the
steady-state reaction rate of catalyst nanoparticles that are imaged on the TEM

undergoes gravitomagnetic tidal resonances as it inspirals toward its final
merger. These have a dynamical impact on the phasing of the emitted
gravitational waves. The resonances are produced by the inertial modes of
vibration of the rotating star. Four distinct modes are involved, and the
resonances occur within the frequency band of interferometric
gravitational-wave detectors when the star spins at a frequency that lies
within this band. The resonances are driven by the gravitomagnetic tidal field
created by the companion star; this is described by a post-Newtonian vector
potential, which is produced by the mass currents associated with the orbital
motion. These resonances were identified previously by Flanagan and Racine
[Phys. Rev. D 75, 044001 (2007)], but these authors accounted only for the
response of a single mode, the r-mode, a special case of inertial modes. All
four relevant modes are included in the analysis presented in this paper. The
total accumulated gravitational-wave phase shift is shown to range from
approximately $10^{-2}$ radians when the spin and orbital angular momenta are
aligned, to approximately $10^{-1}$ radians when they are anti-aligned. Such
phase shifts will become measurable in the coming decades with the deployment
of the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors (Cosmic Explorer,
Einstein Telescope); they might even come to light within this decade, thanks
to planned improvements in the current detectors. With good constraints on the
binary masses and spins gathered from the inspiral waveform, the phase shifts
deliver information regarding the internal structure of the rotating neutron
star, and therefore on the equation of state of nuclear matter.

Project page: https://github.com/cszn/USRNet",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are continuously
showing superior effectiveness and efficiency over traditional model-based

model-based methods that can handle the SISR problem with different scale
factors, blur kernels and noise levels under a unified MAP (maximum a
posteriori) framework, learning-based methods generally lack such flexibility.
To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end trainable unfolding
network which leverages both learning-based methods and model-based methods.
Specifically, by unfolding the MAP inference via a half-quadratic splitting
algorithm, a fixed number of iterations consisting of alternately solving a
data subproblem and a prior subproblem can be obtained. The two subproblems
then can be solved with neural modules, resulting in an end-to-end trainable,
iterative network. As a result, the proposed network inherits the flexibility
of model-based methods to super-resolve blurry, noisy images for different
scale factors via a single model, while maintaining the advantages of
learning-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed deep unfolding network in terms of flexibility, effectiveness and
also generalizability.

between predictions and observations of GRBs prompt emission spectra starts to
be solved. We found that the observed spectra can be produced by the
synchrotron process, if the emitting particles do not completely cool. Evidence
for incomplete cooling was recently found in Swift GRBs spectra with prompt
observations down to 0.5 keV (Oganesyan et al. 2017, 2018), characterized by an
additional low-energy break. In order to search for this break at higher
energies, we analysed the 10 long and 10 short brightest GRBs detected by the
Fermi satellite in over 10 years of activity. We found that in 8/10 long GRBs
there is compelling evidence of a low energy break (below the peak energy) and
the photon indices below and above that break are remarkably consistent with
the values predicted by the synchrotron spectrum (-2/3 and -3/2, respectively).
None of the ten short GRBs analysed shows a break, but the low energy spectral
slope is consistent with -2/3. Within the framework of the GRB standard model,
these results imply a very low magnetic field in the emission region, at odds
with expectations. I also present the spectral evolution of GRB 190114C, the
first GRB detected with high significance by the MAGIC Telescopes, which shows
the compresence (in the keV-MeV energy range) of the prompt and of the
afterglow emission, the latter rising and dominating the high energy part of
the spectral energy range.

particles and interactions accessible at the LHC and all other new particles
are heavy and decoupled. The effective field theory (EFT) method provides a
consistent method to test this assumption. Simplified models can be augmented
with higher order operators involving the new particles accessible at the LHC.
Any UV completion of the simplified model will be able to match onto these
beyond the Standard Model EFTs (BSM-EFT). In this paper we study the simplest
simplified model: the Standard Model extended by a real gauge singlet scalar.
In addition to the usual renormalizable interactions, we include dimension-5
interactions of the singlet scalar with Standard Model particles. As we will
show, even when the cutoff scale is 3 TeV, these new effective interactions can
drastically change the interpretation of Higgs precision measurements and
scalar searches. In addition, we discuss how power counting in a BSM-EFT
depends strongly on the processes and parameter space under consideration.
Finally, we propose a $\chi^2$ method to consistently combine the limits from
new particle searches with measurements of the Standard Model. Unlike imposing
a hard cut off on heavy resonance rates, our method allows fluctuations in
individual channels that are consistent with global fits.

332231, an F8 dwarf star with a V-band magnitude of 8.56, was observed by TESS

follow-up observations of HD 332231 with the Automated Planet Finder, Keck I,

observations leads to the discovery of another transit in Sector 14 that was
masked by PDC due to scattered light contamination. A joint analysis of the
transit and RV data confirms the planetary nature of HD 332231 b, a Saturn-size

likely measurable via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, an exciting prospect
given the 0.14 au orbital separation of HD 332231 b. The spectroscopic

These examples all share the common feature that they are related, through a
certain orbifolding by a discrete gauged R-symmetry element, to a higher

weak lensing cosmology experiments. One of the methods used to estimate and
validate redshift distributions is apply weights to a spectroscopic sample so
that their weighted photometry distribution matches the target sample. In this
work we estimate the \textit{selection bias} in redshift that is introduced in
this procedure. We do so by simulating the process of assembling a
spectroscopic sample (including observer-assigned confidence flags) and
highlight the impacts of spectroscopic target selection and redshift failures.
We use the first year (Y1) weak lensing analysis in DES as an example data set
but the implications generalise to all similar weak lensing surveys. We find
that using colour cuts that are not available to the weak lensing galaxies can
introduce biases of $\Delta~z\sim0.015$ in the weighted mean redshift of
different redshift intervals. To assess the impact of incompleteness in
spectroscopic samples, we select only objects with high observer-defined
confidence flags and compare the weighted mean redshift with the true mean. We
find that the mean redshift of the DES Y1 weak lensing sample is typically
biased at the $\Delta~z=0.005-0.05$ level after the weighting is applied. The
bias we uncover can have either sign, depending on the samples and redshift
interval considered. For the highest redshift bin, the bias is larger than the
uncertainties in the other DES Y1 redshift calibration methods, justifying the
decision of not using this method for the redshift estimations. We discuss
several methods to mitigate this bias.

show that this ""sudden reheating"" by the PBH evaporation enhances the induced

strong nebulous [OIII] emission and act as direct probes into the local stellar

cut-off, PNe are also considered to be a remarkable standard candle for
distance estimation. Through detecting PNe within the galaxies, we aim to
connect the relative abundances of PNe to the properties of their host galaxy
stellar population. By removing the stellar background components from FCC 167

emission within regions that have previously been unexplored. We model the
[OIII] emissions in the spatial and spectral dimensions together, as afforded
to us by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), and we draw on data
gathered as part of the Fornax3D survey. For each source, we inspect the
properties of the nebular emission lines to remove other sources that might
hinder the safe construction of the PNLF, such as supernova remnants and HII
regions. As a further step, we characterise any potential limitations and draw
conclusions about the reliability of our modelling approach through a set of
simulations. By applying this novel detection and modelling approach to
integral field unit observations, we report for the distance estimates and
luminosity-specific PNe frequency values for the two galaxies. Furthermore, we

its nature as a broad-line AGN. Archival XMM-Newton X-ray observations suggest
an intrinsic hard X-ray luminosity of $L_{{\rm

estimate a virial BH mass of $M_{\bullet}\approx10^{6.43}$-$10^{6.72}M_{\odot}$
(with the error denoting 1$\sigma$ statistical uncertainties only), consistent

of gas and the critical density, which itself is dependent on the virial

energy. We find that our modified SF relation fits the data and describes the
physics of this system well with the introduction of a virial parameter of
about 5--10 across the galaxy. This $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ leads to an

hadronic) has been a long-standing matter of debate. Here, we focus on one
variant of hadronic models where proton synchrotron radiation accounts for the
observed steady $\gamma$-ray blazar emission. Using analytical methods, we
derive the minimum jet power ($P_{j,\min}$) for the largest blazar sample
analyzed to date (145 sources), taking into account uncertainties of
observables and jet's physical parameters. We compare $P_{j,\min}$ against
three characteristic energy estimators for accreting systems, i.e., the
Eddington luminosity, the accretion disk luminosity, and the power of the
Blandford-Znajek process, and find that $P_{j,\min}$ is about 2 orders of
magnitude higher than all energetic estimators for the majority of our sample.
The derived magnetic field strengths in the emission region require either
large amplification of the jet's magnetic field (factor of 30) or place the
$\gamma$-ray production site at sub-pc scales. The expected neutrino emission
peaks at $\sim 0.1-10$ EeV, with typical peak neutrino fluxes $\sim 10^{-4}$
times lower than the peak $\gamma$-ray fluxes. We conclude that if relativistic
hadrons are present in blazar jets, they can only produce a radiatively
subdominant component of the overall spectral energy distribution of the
blazar's steady emission.

instead show large-scale clustering determined by the properties of their host
galaxies. Our study is based on an angular cross-correlation analysis applied
to X-ray selected AGN in the COSMOS and UDS fields, spanning redshifts from
$z\sim4.5$ to $z\sim0.5$. Consistent with previous studies, we find that AGN at
all epochs are on average hosted by galaxies in dark matter halos of
$10^{12}-10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$, intermediate between star-forming and passive
galaxies. We find, however, that the same clustering signal can be produced by
inactive (i.e. non-AGN) galaxies closely matched to the AGN in spectral class,
stellar mass and redshift. We therefore argue that the inferred bias for AGN
lies in between the star-forming and passive galaxy populations because AGN
host galaxies are comprised of a mixture of the two populations. Although AGN
hosted by higher mass galaxies are more clustered than lower mass galaxies,
this stellar mass dependence disappears when passive host galaxies are removed.
The strength of clustering is also largely independent of AGN X-ray luminosity.
We conclude that the most important property that determines the clustering in
a given AGN population is the fraction of passive host galaxies. We also infer
that AGN luminosity is likely not driven by environmental triggering, and
further hypothesise that AGN may be a stochastic phenomenon without a strong
dependence on environment.

massive, thermally-relaxed objects, together with recent results for currently

a system to reason about a moving location of an invisible object. We then

datasets with clean annotations. However, gathering a cleanly annotated dataset
is not always feasible due to practical challenges. As a result, label noise is
a common problem in datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural
networks in the presence of noisy labels are proposed in the literature. These
methods commonly use benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise on the
training set. However, there are multiple types of label noise, and each of
them has its own characteristic impact on learning. Since each work generates a
different kind of label noise, it is problematic to test and compare those
algorithms in the literature fairly. In this work, we provide a detailed
analysis of the effects of different kinds of label noise on learning.
Moreover, we propose a generic framework to generate feature-dependent label
noise, which we show to be the most challenging case for learning. Our proposed
method aims to emphasize similarities among data instances by sparsely
distributing them in the feature domain. By this approach, samples that are
more likely to be mislabeled are detected from their softmax probabilities, and
their labels are flipped to the corresponding class. The proposed method can be
applied to any clean dataset to synthesize feature-dependent noisy labels. For
the ease of other researchers to test their algorithms with noisy labels, we
share corrupted labels for the most commonly used benchmark datasets. Our code

average value at risk, and let $X$ be a financial loss, that is, a real random

the numerical computation of $\rho(\mu)$ is not possible. In both cases, either
relying on historical data or using a Monte-Carlo approach, one can resort to
an i.i.d.\ sample of $\mu$ to approximate $\rho(\mu)$ by the finite sample
estimator $\rho(\mu_N)$ (where $\mu_N$ denotes the empirical measure of $\mu$).
In this article we investigate convergence rates of $\rho(\mu_N)$ to
$\rho(\mu)$. We provide non-asymptotic convergence rates for both the deviation
probability and the expectation of the estimation error. The sharpness of these
convergence rates is analyzed. Our framework further allows for hedging, and
the convergence rates we obtain depend neither on the dimension of the
underlying assets, nor on the number of options available for trading.

by a $\sigma$-ball $\Sigma(p,r)$, is not open in $\mathbb{H}$ unless

topology is the so-called slice topology, which is different from the Euclidean
topology and nicely adapts to the slice structure of quaternions. We extend the
function theory of slice regular functions to any domains in the slice
topology.
  Many fundamental results in the classical slice analysis for axially
symmetric domains fail in our general setting.
  We can even construct a counterexample to show that a slice regular function
in a domain cannot be extended to an axially symmetric domain.
  In order to provide positive results we need to consider so-called path-slice

gravitational waves have begun to constrain the equation of state (EoS) for
nuclear matter beyond the nuclear saturation density. To one's surprise, there
exist approximate universal relations connecting certain bulk properties of NSs
that are insensitive to the underlying EoS and having important applications on
probing fundamental physics including nuclear and gravitational physics. To
date, analytic works on universal relations for realistic NSs are lacking,
which may lead to a better understanding of the origin of the universality.
Here, we focus on the universal relations between the compactness(C), moment of
inertia (I), and tidal deformability(related to the Love number), and derive
analytic, approximate I-Love-C relations. To achieve this, we construct
slowly-rotating/ tidally-deformed NS solutions analytically starting from an
extended Tolman VII model that accurately describes non-rotating realistic NSs,
allowing us to extract the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability on top
of the compactness. We solve the field equations analytically by expanding them
about the Newtonian limit and keeping up to 6th order in the stellar
compactness. Based on these analytic solutions, we can mathematically
demonstrate the O(10%) EoS variation in the I-C and Love-C relations and the
O(1%) variation in the I-Love relation that have previously been found
numerically. Our new analytic relations agree more accurately with numerical
results for realistic NSs(especially the I-C and Love-C ones) than the analytic
relations for constant density stars derived in previous work. Based on these
analytic findings, we attribute a possible origin of the universality for the
I-C and Love-C relations to the fact that the energy density of realistic NSs
can be approximated as a quadratic function, as is the case for the Tolman VII
solution.

monoidal Karoubian categories over an algebraically closed field $\bf k$. If
${\rm char}({\bf k})=p>0$, we use this method to construct generalizations
${\rm Ver}_{p^n}$, ${\rm Ver}_{p^n}^+$ of the incompressible abelian symmetric
tensor categories defined in arXiv:1807.05549 for $p=2$ and by Gelfand-Kazhdan
and Georgiev-Mathieu for $n=1$. Namely, ${\rm Ver}_{p^n}$ is the abelian
envelope of the quotient of the category of tilting modules for $SL_2(\bf k)$
by the $n$-th Steinberg module, and ${\rm Ver}_{p^n}^+$ is its subcategory
generated by $PGL_2(\bf k)$-modules. We show that ${\rm Ver}_{p^n}$ are
reductions to characteristic $p$ of Verlinde braided tensor categories in
characteristic zero, which explains the notation. We study the structure of
these categories in detail, and in particular show that they categorify the
real cyclotomic rings $\mathbb{Z}[2\cos(2\pi/p^n)]$, and that ${\rm Ver}_{p^n}$
embeds into ${\rm Ver}_{p^{n+1}}$. We conjecture that every symmetric tensor
category of moderate growth over $\bf k$ admits a fiber functor to the union
${\rm Ver}_{p^\infty}$ of the nested sequence ${\rm Ver}_{p}\subset {\rm
Ver}_{p^2}\subset\cdots$. This would provide an analog of Deligne's theorem in
characteristic zero and a generalization of the result of arXiv:1503.01492,
which shows that this conjecture holds for fusion categories, and then moreover
the fiber functor lands in ${\rm Ver}_p$.

(FBOT) CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t=69-531 days.
CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray ($L_x\sim5\times 10^{39}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) and
radio ($L_{\nu}\sim10^{29}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}Hz^{-1}}$) emission. The radio
emission peaked at ~100 days post transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We
interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an
expanding blastwave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with
velocity $\Gamma\beta c\ge0.55c$ at ~100 days. This is faster than the
non-relativistic AT2018cow ($\Gamma\beta c\sim0.1c$) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla
($\Gamma\beta c\ge0.3c$ at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of
CSS161010 ($E_k\gtrsim10^{51}$ erg) is comparable to that of long Gamma Ray
Bursts (GRBs), but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic
outflow is significantly larger ($\sim0.01-0.1\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$). This is
consistent with the lack of observed gamma-rays. The luminous X-rays were
produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission.
CSS161010 is located at ~150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass
$M_{*}\sim10^{7}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and specific star formation rate $sSFR\sim
0.3\,\rm{Gyr^{-1}}$. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host-galaxies
of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are
consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary
path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal
disruption event on a centrally-located intermediate mass black hole.
Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a
new class of rare (rate $<0.4\%$ of the local core-collapse supernova rate)
H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.

of solar and stellar astrophysics. Observations of high temperature flare
plasma hold many potential clues as to the nature of this energy release. It is
clear, however, that flares are not composed of a few impulsively heated loops,
but are the result of heating on many small-scale threads that are energized
over time, making it difficult to compare observations and numerical
simulations in detail. Several previous studies have shown that it is possible
to reproduce some aspects of the observed emission by considering the flare as
a sequence of independently heated loops, but these studies generally focus on
small-scale features while ignoring the global features of the flare. In this
paper, we develop a multithreaded model that encompasses the time-varying
geometry and heating rate for a series of successively-heated loops comprising
an arcade. To validate, we compare with spectral observations of five flares
made with the MinXSS CubeSat as well as light curves measured with GOES/XRS and
SDO/AIA. We show that this model can successfully reproduce the light curves
and quasi-periodic pulsations in GOES/XRS, the soft X-ray spectra seen with
MinXSS, and the light curves in various AIA passbands. The AIA light curves are
most consistent with long duration heating, but elemental abundances cannot be
constrained with the model. Finally, we show how this model can be used to
extrapolate to spectra of extreme events that can predict irradiance across a
wide wavelength range including unobserved wavelengths.

achieved by determining when different recovery operations produce equivalent
logical noise. These methods could also be used to better approximate soft

careful introduction of targeted faults, an adversary modifies the control-flow

analyzed and used as a source of information leakage, or as a mechanism for
privilege escalation. Due to the increasing complexity of modern embedded
systems, and due to the difficulty of guaranteeing correct hardware execution

the assumption that an adversary has to be close to the physical execution of

understanding brain structure. Measures of cortical morphology such as
thickness and surface area are frequently used to compare groups of subjects or
characterise longitudinal changes. However, such measures are often treated as
independent from each other.
  A recently described scaling law, derived from a statistical physics model of
cortical folding, demonstrates that there is a tight covariance between three
commonly used cortical morphology measures: cortical thickness, total surface
area, and exposed surface area.
  We show that assuming the independence of cortical morphology measures can
hide features and potentially lead to misinterpretations. Using the scaling
law, we account for the covariance between cortical morphology measures and
derive novel independent measures of cortical morphology. By applying these new
measures, we show that new information can be gained; in our example we show
that distinct morphological alterations underlie healthy ageing compared to
temporal lobe epilepsy, even on the coarse level of a whole hemisphere.
  We thus provide a conceptual framework for characterising cortical morphology
in a statistically valid and interpretable manner, based on theoretical
reasoning about the shape of the cortex.

oxide (GO) surfaces in the deeply supercooled region. We have considered three
graphene-based surfaces; a GO surface with equal proportions of oxidized and
pristine graphene regions in a striped topology, a fully oxidized surface and a
pristine graphene surface. The dipole relaxation time of interfacial water
shows a strong-to-strong, strong, and a fragile-to-strong transition on these
surfaces, respectively, in the temperature range of 210-298 K. In contrast,
bulk water shows a fragile-to-strong transition upon supercooling. In all these
cases at high hydration, interfacial water co-exists with a thick water film
with bulk-like properties. To investigate the influence of bulk water on
dynamical transitions, we simulated a low hydration regime where only bound
water (surface water) is present on the GO surfaces and found that the
rotational relaxation of surface water on both the GO and fully oxidized
surfaces show a single Arrhenius behavior. Our results indicate that not only
does the local extent of surface hydrophilicity play a role in determining the
energy landscape explored by the water molecules upon supercooling, but the
presence of bulk water also modulates the dynamic transition.

hard to measure. In analogy to the Heisenberg limit in quantum metrology, we
study the minimum requirements for such a detection in a given strong field

phenomena whereby these models appear to generalize well on the unseen data,
even though the number of parameters significantly exceeds the sample sizes,
and the model perfectly fits the in-training data. A conventional explanation
of this phenomena is based on self-regularization properties of algorithms used
to train the data. In this paper we prove a series of results which provide a
somewhat diverging explanation. Adopting a teacher/student model where the
teacher network is used to generate the predictions and student network is
trained on the observed labeled data, and then tested on out-of-sample data, we
show that any student network interpolating the data generated by a teacher
network generalizes well, provided that the sample size is at least an explicit
quantity controlled by data dimension and approximation guarantee alone,
regardless of the number of internal nodes of either teacher or student
network.
  Our claim is based on approximating both teacher and student networks by
polynomial (tensor) regression models with degree depending on the desired
accuracy and network depth only. Such a parametrization notably does not depend
on the number of internal nodes. Thus a message implied by our results is that
parametrizing wide neural networks by the number of hidden nodes is misleading,
and a more fitting measure of parametrization complexity is the number of
regression coefficients associated with tensorized data. In particular, this
somewhat reconciles the generalization ability of neural networks with more
classical statistical notions of data complexity and generalization bounds. Our
empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets indeed confirm that
tensorized regression achieves a good out-of-sample performance, even when the
degree of the tensor is at most two.

applied to AREDS to assess the efficacy of antioxidants and zinc combination in

efficacy. We further validate our findings in an independent subsequent RCT,

our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data,
which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down
measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts
exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world
health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$
day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect
approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people,
taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number
of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020),
with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures
can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such
growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades
before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population)
have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down
measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak
in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any
interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the
disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth
pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be
carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world
economy.

expressiveness to reason about this representation.
  We introduce ProGraML - Program Graphs for Machine Learning - a novel
graph-based program representation using a low level, language agnostic, and
portable format; and machine learning models capable of performing complex
downstream tasks over these graphs. The ProGraML representation is a directed
attributed multigraph that captures control, data, and call relations, and
summarizes instruction and operand types and ordering. Message Passing Neural

forbidden and is treated as an additional source of nonlinear losses. Each of
these long lifetime behaviors of bright solitary waves was previously
numerically predicted to be observable. The dynamical pattern formation of dark
solitary waves in attractive nonlinearity, however, is entirely novel and is
reported for both the periodic breather and complex recurrence behaviors. All
behaviors are identified in the group velocity co-moving frame.

benchmark method performance for intra-observer annotation variability, false

Pathologists considered 9% of the false positive regions as cribriform, and 11%
as possibly cribriform; 44% of the false negative regions were not annotated as
cribriform. As a final experiment, the network was also applied on a dataset of
60 biopsy regions annotated by 23 pathologists. With the cut-off reaching
highest sensitivity, all images annotated as cribriform by at least 7/23 of the

MVE depletion, we conducted a systematic study of high-precision K isotopic
composition on 16 carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) of types CM1-2, CO3, CV3, CR2,
CK4-5 and CH3 and 28 ordinary chondrites (OCs) covering petrological types 3 to
6 and chemical groups H, L, and LL. We observed significant overall K isotope
(delta41K) variations (-1.54 to 0.70 permil). The K isotope compositions of CCs
are largely higher than the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value, whereas OCs show
typically lower values than BSE. Neither CCs nor OCs show resolvable
correlations between K isotopes and chemical groups, petrological types, shock
levels, exposure ages, fall or find occurrence, or terrestrial weathering. The
lack of a clear trend between K isotopes and K content indicates that the K
isotope fractionations were decoupled from the relative elemental K depletions.
The range of K isotope variations in the CCs is consistent with a
four-component (chondrule, refractory inclusion, matrix and water) mixing model
that is able to explain the bulk elemental and isotopic compositions of the
main CC groups, but requires a fractionation in K isotopic compositions in
chondrules. We propose that the major control of the isotopic compositions of
group averages is condensation or vaporization in nebular environments that is
preserved in the compositional variation of chondrules. Parent-body processes
(aqueous alteration, thermal metamorphism, and metasomatism) can mobilize K and
affect the K isotopes in individual samples. In the case of the OCs, the full
range of K isotopic variations can only be explained by the combined effects of
the size and relative abundances of chondrules, parent-body aqueous and thermal
alteration.

posteriori updates rather than simulated annealing, and has gained prominence
for decision-making under uncertainty. In this work, we cast Bayesian
optimization as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is
sampled from a Gaussian process (GP). Further, we focus on action selections
via upper confidence bound (UCB) or expected improvement (EI) due to their
prevalent use in practice. Prior works using GPs for bandits cannot allow the
iteration horizon $T$ to be large, as the complexity of computing the posterior
parameters scales cubically with the number of past observations. To circumvent
this computational burden, we propose a simple statistical test: only
incorporate an action into the GP posterior when its conditional entropy
exceeds an $\epsilon$ threshold. Doing so permits us to precisely characterize
the trade-off between regret bounds of GP bandit algorithms and complexity of
the posterior distributions depending on the compression parameter $\epsilon$
for both discrete and continuous action sets. To best of our knowledge, this is
the first result which allows us to obtain sublinear regret bounds while still
maintaining sublinear growth rate of the complexity of the posterior which is
linear in the existing literature. Moreover, a provably finite bound on the
complexity could be achieved but the algorithm would result in
$\epsilon$-regret which means $\textbf{Reg}_T/T \rightarrow
\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$. Experimentally, we observe
state of the art accuracy and complexity trade-offs for GP bandit algorithms
applied to global optimization, suggesting the merits of compressed GPs in

principle) guarantee some form of transactional isolation. However, experience
shows [Kleppmann 2019, Kingsbury and Patella 2019a] that many databases do not
provide the isolation guarantees they claim. With the recent proliferation of
new distributed databases, demand has grown for checkers that can, by
generating client workloads and injecting faults, produce anomalies that
witness a violation of a stated guarantee. An ideal checker would be sound (no
false positives), efficient (polynomial in history length and concurrency),
effective (finding violations in real databases), general (analyzing many

alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training
a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train
a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input
was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate
this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is
defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked
out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach
substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size,

measures the amount of information that a quantum state carries about an

defined to be the maximum QFI of the output state assuming an entangled input
state over a single probe and an ancilla. In quantum metrology, people are
interested in calculating the QFI of $N$ identical copies of a quantum channel
when $N \rightarrow \infty$, which is called the asymptotic QFI. Over the
years, researchers found various types of upper bounds of the asymptotic QFI,
but they were proven achievable only in several specific situations. It was
known that the asymptotic QFI of an arbitrary quantum channel grows either
linearly or quadratically with $N$. Here we show that a simple criterion can
determine whether the scaling is linear or quadratic. In both cases, the
asymptotic QFI and a quantum error correction protocol to achieve it are
computable via a semidefinite program. When the scaling is quadratic, the

devices cannot directly participate in the mining process due to the limitation
of power and computational resources. The edge computing service makes it
possible for IIoT applications to build a blockchain network, in which IIoT
devices purchase computational resources from edge servers and thus can offload
their computational tasks. The amount of computational resource purchased by
IIoT devices depends on how many profits they can get in the mining process,
and will directly affect the security of the blockchain network. In this paper,
we investigate the incentive mechanism for the blockchain platform to attract
IIoT devices to purchase more computational power from edge servers to
participate in the mining process, thereby building a more secure blockchain
network. We model the interaction between the blockchain platform and IIoT
devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the blockchain platform act as
the leader, and IIoT devices act as followers. We analyze the existence and
uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, and propose an efficient algorithm
to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium point. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations, and analyze the
strategies of blockchain platform and IIoT devices under different situations.

understanding the fundamental physics of turbulent flows. Because of their
steep increase in computational cost with Reynolds number ($R_{\lambda}$),
well-resolved DNS are realizable only on massively parallel supercomputers,
even at moderate $R_{\lambda}$. However, at extreme scales, the communications
and synchronizations between processing elements (PEs) involved in current
approaches become exceedingly expensive and are expected to be a major
bottleneck to scalability. In order to overcome this challenge, we developed
algorithms using the so-called Asynchrony-Tolerant (AT) schemes that relax
communication and synchronization constraints at a mathematical level, to
perform DNS of decaying and solenoidally forced compressible turbulence.
Asynchrony is introduced using two approaches, one that avoids synchronizations
and the other that avoids communications. These result in periodic and random
delays, respectively, at PE boundaries. We show that both asynchronous
algorithms accurately resolve the large-scale and small-scale motions of
turbulence, including instantaneous and intermittent fields. We also show that
in asynchronous simulations the communication time is a relatively smaller
fraction of the total computation time, especially at large processor count,
compared to standard synchronous simulations. As a consequence, we observe
improved parallel scalability up to $262144$ processors for both asynchronous
algorithms.

the framework of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. In the chiral limit, it has been
shown that the duality between phases with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking
and condensation of charged pions, found in the three color case, remains valid
in the two color case. In addition, it has been shown that there are two more
dualities in the phase diagram in two color case, namely (as in the case with
$\mu_{I5}=0$), at $\mu_{I5}\ne 0$ the general $(\mu,\mu_I,\mu_{I5})$-phase
portrait of the model has dual symmetry between the phase with condensation of
charged pions and the phase with diquark condensation. This duality stays exact
even in the physical point, $m_0\ne 0$. And at $m_0=0$ the
$(\mu,\mu_I,\mu_{I5})$-phase portrait becomes even more symmetrical, since dual
symmetry between phases with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and diquark
condensation appears. It is shown that due to the dualities the phase diagram
is extremely symmetric and has interlacing structure. One can show that the
phase portrait of two-color NJL model can be obtained just by duality
properties from the results of investigations of three-color NJL model (it was
noticed only after the numerical calculations have been performed). Three-color
case shares only one duality of the two color one, and one can only see a facet
of this enormously symmetric picture in the case of three colors. Using
dualities only, it is possible to show that there are no mixed phases (phases
with two non-zero condensates). This prediction of dualities is of great use,
because for sure it can be shown by the direct calculations but it would be
enormously more complicated and time-consuming numerically.

particular, by exploiting the adaptive weights used for diffusing information,
we develop time-dependent attack models that drive normal agents to converge to
states selected by the attacker. We show that an attacker that has complete
knowledge of the system can always drive its targeted agents to its desired
estimates. Moreover, an attacker that does not have complete knowledge of the
system including streaming data of targeted agents or the parameters they use
in diffusion algorithms, can still be successful in deploying an attack by
approximating the needed information. The attack models can be used for both
stationary and non-stationary state estimation.In addition, we present and
analyze a resilient distributed diffusion algorithm that is resilient to any
data falsification attack in which the number of compromised agents in the
local neighborhood of a normal agent is bounded. The proposed algorithm
guarantees that all normal agents converge to their true target states if
appropriate parameters are selected. We also analyze trade-off between the
resilience of distributed diffusion and its performance in terms of
steady-state mean-square-deviation (MSD) from the correct estimates. Finally,
we evaluate the proposed attack models and resilient distributed diffusion

problems Broadcast Domination and Multipacking in digraphs. A dominating
broadcast of a digraph $D$ is a function $f:V(D)\to\mathbb{N}$ such that for
each vertex $v$ of $D$, there exists a vertex $t$ with $f(t)>0$ having a
directed path to $v$ of length at most $f(t)$. The cost of $f$ is the sum of
$f(v)$ over all vertices $v$. A multipacking is a set $S$ of vertices of $D$
such that for each vertex $v$ of $D$ and for every integer $d$, there are at
most $d$ vertices from $S$ within directed distance at most $d$ from $v$. The
maximum size of a multipacking of $D$ is a lower bound to the minimum cost of a
dominating broadcast of $D$. Let Broadcast Domination denote the problem of
deciding whether a given digraph $D$ has a dominating broadcast of cost at most
$k$, and Multipacking the problem of deciding whether $D$ has a multipacking of
size at least $k$. It is known that Broadcast Domination is polynomial-time
solvable for the class of all undirected graphs (that is, symmetric digraphs),
while polynomial-time algorithms for Multipacking are known only for a few
classes of undirected graphs. We prove that Broadcast Domination and
Multipacking are both NP-complete for digraphs, even for planar layered acyclic
digraphs of small maximum degree. Moreover, when parameterized by the solution
cost/solution size, we show that the problems are W-hard. We also show that
Broadcast Domination is FPT on acyclic digraphs, and that it does not admit a
polynomial kernel for such inputs, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to
its third level. In addition, we show that both problems are FPT when
parameterized by the solution cost/solution size together with the maximum
out-degree, and as well, by the vertex cover number. Finally, we give for both
problems polynomial-time algorithms for some subclasses of acyclic digraphs.

""subcritical"" nonlinearities, focusing on demonstrating lifespan estimates for
energy solutions. Our main concern is on equations with scale-invariant damping
and mass. Under different assumptions imposed on the initial data, lifespan
estimates from above are clearly showed. The key fact is that we find
""transition surfaces"", which distinguish lifespan estimates between ""wave-like""
and ""heat-like"" behaviours. Moreover we conjecture that the lifespan estimates
on the ""transition surfaces"" can be logarithmically improved. As direct
consequences, we reorganize the blow-up results and lifespan estimates for the
massless case in which the ""transition surfaces"" degenerate to ""transition
curves"". Furthermore, we obtain improved lifespan estimates in one space
dimension, comparing to the known results. We also study semilinear wave
equations with the scattering damping and negative mass term, and find that if
the decay rate of the mass term equals to 2, the lifespan estimate is the same
as one special case of the equations with the scale-invariant damping and
positive mass. The main strategy of the proof consists of a Kato's type lemma
in integral form, which is established by iteration argument.

implement machine learning in the mechanical domain, using reservoir computing

good accelerometer functionalities, with an inertial mass sensitivity on the

Initially, the root of the flux tube is filled with the downflows and then the
upflow fills the center of the flux tube during the formation of the sunspot.

vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to guess

prior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the
privacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers
to perform attacks and focusing only on the aggregate results over data

propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing
non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack
method based on a modification of prediction entropy. We also propose
benchmarks for defense mechanisms by accounting for adaptive adversaries with
knowledge of the defense and also accounting for the trade-off between model

existing defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported.
  Next, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by
formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our
privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample's likelihood of being a
training member, which allows an adversary to identify samples with high
privacy risks and perform attacks with high confidence. We experimentally
validate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score and demonstrate that the
distribution of privacy risk score across individual samples is heterogeneous.
Finally, we perform an in-depth investigation for understanding why certain
samples have high privacy risks, including correlations with model sensitivity,
generalization error, and feature embeddings. Our work emphasizes the
importance of a systematic and rigorous evaluation of privacy risks of machine

contagion like influenza with the spread of related information such as an
influenza vaccination campaign. Recent work on the spread of interacting
contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can
have counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one
of these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of
awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered,
cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the
awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing
its transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to
be infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the
awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected
individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to
the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network
clustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to
sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This
counter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that
random networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts.
To further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on
a two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary
infections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net
effect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight
once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and
illustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of
interacting contagions.

nonparametric regression model. When applied to a sample of size $n$, the
smoothing spline estimator can be expressed as a linear combination of $n$
basis functions, requiring $O(n^3)$ computational time when the number of
predictors $d\geq 2$. Such a sizable computational cost hinders the broad
applicability of smoothing splines. In practice, the full sample smoothing
spline estimator can be approximated by an estimator based on $q$
randomly-selected basis functions, resulting in a computational cost of
$O(nq^2)$. It is known that these two estimators converge at the identical rate
when $q$ is of the order $O\{n^{2/(pr+1)}\}$, where $p\in [1,2]$ depends on the
true function $\eta$, and $r > 1$ depends on the type of spline. Such $q$ is
called the essential number of basis functions. In this article, we develop a
more efficient basis selection method. By selecting the ones corresponding to
roughly equal-spaced observations, the proposed method chooses a set of basis
functions with a large diversity. The asymptotic analysis shows our proposed
smoothing spline estimator can decrease $q$ to roughly $O\{n^{1/(pr+1)}\}$,
when $d\leq pr+1$. Applications on synthetic and real-world datasets show the

over decentralized networks. Since walk algorithms can reduce communication
load, we first propose incremental ADMM (I-ADMM) based on the walk algorithm,
the updating order of which follows a Hamiltonian cycle instead. However,
I-ADMM cannot guarantee the privacy for agents against external eavesdroppers
even if the randomized initialization is applied. To protect privacy for
agents, we then propose two privacy-preserving incremental ADMM algorithms,
i.e., PI-ADMM1 and PI-ADMM2, where perturbation over step sizes and primal
variables is adopted, respectively. Through theoretical analyses, we prove the
convergence and privacy preservation for PI-ADMM1, which are further supported
by numerical experiments. Besides, simulations demonstrate that the proposed

wireless communication, has been considered one of the most significant
techniques for Smart City. Vehicles platooning is an application of Smart City
that improves traffic capacity and safety by C-V2X. However, different from
vehicles platooning travelling on highways, C-V2X could be more easily
eavesdropped and the spectrum resource could be limited when they converge at
an intersection. Satisfying the secrecy rate of C-V2X, how to increase the
spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the platooning network
is a big challenge. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a
Security-Aware Approach to Enhancing SE and EE Based on Deep Reinforcement
Learning, named SEED. The SEED formulates an objective optimization function
considering both SE and EE, and the secrecy rate of C-V2X is treated as a
critical constraint of this function. The optimization problem is transformed
into the spectrum and transmission power selections of V2V and V2I links using
deep Q network (DQN). The heuristic result of SE and EE is obtained by the DQN
policy based on rewards. Finally, we simulate the traffic and communication
environments using Python. The evaluation results demonstrate that the SEED
outperforms the DQN-wopa algorithm and the baseline algorithm by 31.83 % and
68.40 % in efficiency. Source code for the SEED is available at

the area of supervised learning with user-defined labels where users are not

types of classes in user-defined labels: subjective class and objective class -
showing that the objective classes are as reliable as if they were provided by
domain experts, whereas the subjective classes are subject to bias and
manipulation by the user. We define this as a subjective class issue and
provide a framework for detecting subjective labels in a dataset without

methods using the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials of electric currents.
Subsequently, quantum corrections to the obtained classical formulas were
studied, considering the emission of photons arising from electronic
transitions between spectral levels, described in terms of the Dirac equation.
In this paper, we consider an intermediate approach, in which electric currents
generating the radiation are considered classically, whereas the quantum nature
of the radiation is taken into account exactly. Such an approximate approach
may be helpful in some cases, it allows one to study the one-photon and
multi-photon radiation without complicating calculations using corresponding
solutions of the Dirac equation. We construct exact quantum states of the
electromagnetic field interacting with classical currents and study their
properties. By their help, we calculate a probability of photon emission by
classical currents and obtain relatively simple formulas for the one-photon and
multi-photon radiation. Using the specific circular electric current, we
calculate the corresponding SR. We discuss a relation of obtained results with
known before, for example, with the Schott formula, with the Schwinger
calculations, with one-photon radiation of scalar particles due to transitions

heterogeneous items to a single buyer. We focus on buy-many mechanisms, a
natural class of mechanisms frequently used in practice. The buy-many property
allows the buyer to interact with the mechanism multiple times instead of once
as in the more commonly studied buy-one mechanisms. This imposes additional
incentive constraints and thus restricts the space of mechanisms that the
seller can use.
  In this paper, we explore the qualitative differences between buy-one and
buy-many mechanisms focusing on two important properties: revenue continuity
and menu-size complexity.
  Our first main result is that when the value function of the buyer is
perturbed multiplicatively by a factor of $1\pm\epsilon$, the optimal revenue
obtained by buy-many mechanisms only changes by a factor of $1 \pm
\textrm{poly}(n,\epsilon)$. In contrast, for buy-one mechanisms, the revenue of
the resulting optimal mechanism after such a perturbation can change
arbitrarily.
  Our second main result shows that under any distribution of arbitrary
valuations, finite menu size suffices to achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation
to the optimal buy-many mechanism. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the
number of menu entries as a function of $n$ and $\epsilon$. On the other hand,
such a result fails to hold for buy-one mechanisms as even for two items and a

devices has become an emerging trend. In the federated setting, Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) has been widely used in federated learning for various
machine learning models. To prevent privacy leakages from gradients that are
calculated on users' sensitive data, local differential privacy (LDP) has been
considered as a privacy guarantee in federated SGD recently. However, the
existing solutions have a dimension dependency problem: the injected noise is
substantially proportional to the dimension $d$. In this work, we propose a
two-stage framework FedSel for federated SGD under LDP to relieve this problem.
Our key idea is that not all dimensions are equally important so that we
privately select Top-k dimensions according to their contributions in each
iteration of federated SGD. Specifically, we propose three private dimension
selection mechanisms and adapt the gradient accumulation technique to stabilize
the learning process with noisy updates. We also theoretically analyze privacy,
accuracy and time complexity of FedSel, which outperforms the state-of-the-art
solutions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

reported 81 LDR relations in the $YJ$ band, 0.97-1.32 $\mu\mathrm{m}$, in 2018.
However, with their sample of only 10 giants, it was impossible to account for
the effects of surface gravity and metallicity on the LDRs well. Here we
investigate the gravity effect based on $YJ$-band spectra of 63 stars including
dwarfs, giants, and supergiants observed with the WINERED spectrograph. We
found that some LDR-$T_\mathrm{eff}$ relations show clear offsets between the

of traffic volume is directly related to the severity of the failures, we

predict, since a network element does not explicitly contain any information
about the service impact. Thus, we aim to predict the service impact from
syslog messages and traffic volume by extracting hidden information about
failures. To extract useful features for prediction from syslog messages and

this work, we discuss self-organizing gates, namely Self-Organizing Algebraic

optimization problems in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) format. Unlike
conventional I\O gates, SOAGs are terminal-agnostic, meaning each terminal
handles a superposition of input and output signals. When appropriately
assembled to represent a given ILP problem, the corresponding self-organizing

models can provide a more efficient way to describe the key physical processes
such as dynamical friction, tidal mass loss, and tidal heating, with only a few
free parameters. In this work, we present a fast Monte Carlo Markov Chain
fitting approach to explore the parameter space of such a sub-halo non-linear

calibrate the models to two sets of high-resolution cold dark matter N-body

manual parameter tuning, our approach provides a more robust way to determine
the best-fit parameters and their posterior probabilities. We find that jointly
fitting for the sub-halo mass and maximum velocity functions can break the
degeneracy between tidal stripping and tidal heating parameters, as well as
providing better constraints on the strength of dynamical friction. We show
that our semi-analytic simulation can accurately reproduce N-body simulations
statistics, and that the calibration results for the two sets of N-body
simulations agree at 95% confidence level. Dynamical models calibrated in this

antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity,
which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on

work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a
personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on
the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically,
our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then
predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to

based on deep convolutional neural networks. To render a deep network with the
ability to understand a concept, humans need to collect a large amount of
pixel-level annotated data to train the models, which is time-consuming and
tedious. Recently, few-shot segmentation is proposed to solve this problem.
Few-shot segmentation aims to learn a segmentation model that can be
generalized to novel classes with only a few training images. In this paper, we
propose a cross-reference network (CRNet) for few-shot segmentation. Unlike
previous works which only predict the mask in the query image, our proposed
model concurrently make predictions for both the support image and the query
image. With a cross-reference mechanism, our network can better find the
co-occurrent objects in the two images, thus helping the few-shot segmentation
task. We also develop a mask refinement module to recurrently refine the
prediction of the foreground regions. For the $k$-shot learning, we propose to
finetune parts of networks to take advantage of multiple labeled support
images. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that our network
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

task to collaboratively recognize the interactions between two persons with the

always directly use linear decision function to fuse the features extracted

interaction in paired egocentric videos. The consistency of interactions in
paired videos, and features extracted from them are correlated to each other.
On top of that, we propose to build the relevance between two views using
biliear pooling, which capture the consistency of two views in feature-level.
Specifically, each neuron in the feature maps from one view connects to the
neurons from another view, which guarantee the compact consistency between two

the uncertainty of the channel, it is difficult to calculate the exact sum
secrecy rate of the system. Thus, the maximum of lower bound of sum secrecy
rate is considered. The optimization of the lower bound of sum secrecy rate
still makes the considered beamforming design problem difficult to handle. To

Besides, with the advantage of low complexity, a zero-forcing based beamforming

channel estimation for uncorrelated channels is formulated as a conventional
SVM problem. The objective function of this SVM problem is then modified for
estimating spatially correlated channels. Next, a two-stage detection algorithm
is proposed where SVM is further exploited in the first stage. The performance

Human-collective transparency research has focused on how the design of the

individual entities composing a collective, which may become problematic as
collectives scale in size and heterogeneity, and tasks become more demanding.
Human operators can become overloaded with information, which will negatively
affect their understanding of the collective's current state and overall
behaviors, which can cause poor teaming performance. An analysis of
visualization transparency and the derived visualization design guidance, based
on remote supervision of collectives, are the primary contributions of this
manuscript. The individual agent and abstract visualizations were analyzed for
sequential best-of-n decision-making tasks involving four collectives, composed
of 200 entities each. The abstract visualization provided better transparency
by enabling operators with different individual differences and capabilities to
perform relatively the same and promoted higher human-collective performance.

a dark matter candidate. In this paper we argue that primordial 2-2-hole
remnants provide a more promising and testable option. 2-2-holes arise in
quadratic gravity as a new family of classical solutions for ultracompact
matter distributions and they possess the black hole exterior without an event
horizon. They may serve as the endpoint of gravitational collapse, providing a
resolution for the information loss problem. Intriguing thermodynamic behavior
is found for these objects when sourced by a thermal gas. A large 2-2-hole
radiates with a Hawking-like temperature and exhibits an entropy-area law. At a
late stage, the evaporation slows down and essentially stops as the mass
asymptotically approaches a minimal value. This remnant mass is determined by a
fundamental scale in quadratic gravity. We study the cosmological and
astrophysical implications of having these remnants as dark matter and derive
the corresponding constraints. A distinctive phenomenon associated with remnant
mergers occurs, predicting fluxes of high-energy astrophysical particles due to
the spectacular evaporation of the merger product. Measurements of high-energy
photon and neutrino fluxes could possibly bound the remnant mass to be not far
above the Planck mass. Early-universe physics, on the other hand, requires that
2-2-holes quickly evolve into the remnant state after formation, putting an
upper bound on the formation mass.

important stage in animation production, which is time-consuming and tedious.
In this paper, we propose a deep architecture to automatically color line art
videos with the same color style as the given reference images. Our framework
consists of a color transform network and a temporal constraint network. The
color transform network takes the target line art images as well as the line
art and color images of one or more reference images as input, and generates
corresponding target color images. To cope with larger differences between the
target line art image and reference color images, our architecture utilizes
non-local similarity matching to determine the region correspondences between
the target image and the reference images, which are used to transform the
local color information from the references to the target. To ensure global
color style consistency, we further incorporate Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) with the transformation parameters obtained from a style embedding
vector that describes the global color style of the references, extracted by an
embedder. The temporal constraint network takes the reference images and the
target image together in chronological order, and learns the spatiotemporal
features through 3D convolution to ensure the temporal consistency of the
target image and the reference image. Our model can achieve even better
coloring results by fine-tuning the parameters with only a small amount of
samples when dealing with an animation of a new style. To evaluate our method,
we build a line art coloring dataset. Experiments show that our method achieves
the best performance on line art video coloring compared to the
state-of-the-art methods and other baselines.

expands the known settings in which tight causal bounds are solutions to linear

According to the results, the average persistence decays at late times as an

persistences is shown to be characterized by a universal limit distribution of

exception, for randomly diluted lattices, the algebraic decay holds to be valid
for $d>1$, which is explained by the contribution of dangling ends. Results on

transition density of the initial configuration $\varphi_{\rm J0}$ is
systematically altered by tuning the ``depth'' of mechanical training. We exert
a steady shear on these configurations and observe either shear jamming (gain
of stiffness due to shear) or shear melting (loss of stiffness due to shear),
depending on the depth of training and proximity to the jamming transition
density. We also observe that the characteristic strains, at which shear
jamming or melting occur, diverge at a unique density $\varphi_{\rm JS}$. This
is due to the shift of the jamming transition density from $\varphi_{\rm J0}$
to $\varphi_{\rm JS}$ under shear, associated with loss of memory of the

T^*_{~}( L )$, where the temperature depends on both $L$ and the boundary
conditions. Applying the finite-size scaling to $T^*_{~}( L )$ and assuming
presence of the BKT transitions, the two distinct phase-transition temperatures

agreement with earlier studies. It should be noted that no thermodynamic

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hashing is an effective technique to address the large-scale recommendation
problem, due to its high computation and storage efficiency on calculating the
user preferences on items. However, existing hashing-based recommendation
methods still suffer from two important problems: 1) Their recommendation
process mainly relies on the user-item interactions and single specific content
feature. When the interaction history or the content feature is unavailable
(the cold-start problem), their performance will be seriously deteriorated. 2)
Existing methods learn the hash codes with relaxed optimization or adopt
discrete coordinate descent to directly solve binary hash codes, which results
in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. In
this paper, we propose a fast cold-start recommendation method, called
Multi-Feature Discrete Collaborative Filtering (MFDCF), to solve these
problems. Specifically, a low-rank self-weighted multi-feature fusion module is
designed to adaptively project the multiple content features into binary yet
informative hash codes by fully exploiting their complementarity. Additionally,
we develop a fast discrete optimization algorithm to directly compute the
binary hash codes with simple operations. Experiments on two public
recommendation datasets demonstrate that MFDCF outperforms the
state-of-the-arts on various aspects.

evidence demonstrates that the performances of the model selection criteria
based on the bootstrap sample augmentation strategy will become more

circumstance of the inadequate observation information. Meanwhile, the
numerical simulation experiments further demonstrate that the model
identification risk due to the deficiency of the data information, such as the
high censoring rate and rather limited number of observations, can be
adequately compensated by increasing the scientific computation cost in terms
of the bootstrap sample augmentation strategies. We also apply the recommended
bootstrap-based model selection criterion on the Tobit regression model to fit
the real fidelity dataset.

On the other hand, a close link between Hodge's theory and the Maxwell equation

theoretical approach for analyzing the synchronization of spin-torque

oscillatory decaying regime as well as the initial condition (IC)-dependence
(hysteretic) that exist in the synchronization of many types of STNOs cannot be
explained by this model. In order to more precisely elucidate the physical
mechanisms behind the two phenomena, in this paper we develop a generalized
pendulum-like model based on the two common features of non-linear
auto-oscillators: one is the stability of the amplitude/energy of dynamic
states; the other is the non-linear dynamic state energy of oscillators. In
this new model, we find that the Newtonian-like particle with sufficient
kinetic energy can overcome the barrier of phase-locking potential to evolve
into a stable asynchronization (AS) state, leading to the (IC)-dependent
synchronization. Furthermore, due to the presence of the kinetic energy, this
particle can also oscillate around the minima of the phase-locking potential,
leading to the oscillatory decaying regime. Thereby, in this work, we adopt
this new model to analyze the IC-dependent mutual synchronization of
perpendicularto-plane (PERP)-STNO pairs, and then we suggest that the initial
conditions can be controlled to avoid such a phenomenon by using magnetic
dipolar coupling.

strategy in detail to investigate baryon-baryon interactions by defining
potentials in field theories such as QCD. We introduce the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter
(NBS) wave functions in QCD for two baryons below the inelastic threshold. We
then define the potential from NBS wave functions in terms of the derivative
expansion, which is shown to reproduce the scattering phase shifts correctly
below the inelastic threshold. Using this definition, we formulate a method to
extract the potential in lattice QCD. Secondly, we discuss pros and cons of the
HAL QCD method, by comparing it with the conventional method, where one
directly extracts the scattering phase shifts from the finite volume energies
through the L\""uscher's formula. We give several theoretical and numerical
evidences that the conventional method combined with the naive plateau fitting
for the finite volume energies in the literature so far fails to work on
baryon-baryon interactions due to contaminations of elastic excited states. On
the other hand, we show that such a serious problem can be avoided in the HAL
QCD method by defining the potential in an energy-independent way. We also
discuss systematics of the HAL QCD method, in particular errors associated with
a truncation of the derivative expansion. Thirdly, we present several results
obtained from the HAL QCD method, which include (central) nuclear force, tensor
force, spin-orbital force, and three nucleon force. We finally show the latest

vision tasks, performing DNN inferences on videos that originate from mobile
devices has gained practical significance. As such, previous approaches
developed methods to offload DNN inference computations for images to cloud
servers to manage the resource constraints of mobile devices. However, when it
comes to video data, communicating information of every frame consumes
excessive network bandwidth and renders the entire system susceptible to
adverse network conditions such as congestion. Thus, in this work, we seek to
exploit the temporal coherence between nearby frames of a video stream to
mitigate network pressure. That is, we propose ShadowTutor, a distributed video
DNN inference framework that reduces the number of network transmissions
through intermittent knowledge distillation to a student model. Moreover, we
update only a subset of the student's parameters, which we call partial
distillation, to reduce the data size of each network transmission.
Specifically, the server runs a large and general teacher model, and the mobile
device only runs an extremely small but specialized student model. On sparsely
selected key frames, the server partially trains the student model by targeting
the teacher's response and sends the updated part to the mobile device. We
investigate the effectiveness of ShadowTutor with HD video semantic
segmentation. Evaluations show that network data transfer is reduced by 95% on
average. Moreover, the throughput of the system is improved by over three times
and shows robustness to changes in network bandwidth.

growth of crustal wedges building above megathrusts in the mantle lithosphere.
We show that the locus of shortening in the western margin of South America has
largely been controlled by the geometry of the slab. Numerical models confirm
that horizontal subduction favors compression far from the trench, above the
asthenospheric wedge and steeply dipping segment of the subducting slab. As a
result, a second crustal wedge grows in the hinterland of the continent, and
widens the Andes. In the Bolivian orocline, this wedge corresponds to the
Eastern Cordillera, whose growth was triggered by a major episode of horizontal
subduction. When the slab returned to a steeper dip angle, shortening and
uplift pursued, facilitated by the structural and thermo-chemical alteration of
the continental lithosphere. We review the successive episodes of horizontal
subduction that have occurred beneath South America at different latitudes and
show that they explain the diachronic widening of the Andes. We infer that the
present-day segmented physiography of the Andes results from the latitudinally
variable, transient interplay between slab dynamics and upper plate tectonics
over the Cenozoic. We emphasize that slab flattening, or absence thereof, is a
major driving mechanism that sets the width of the Andes, at any latitude.

  Marchenko method","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-lapse seismic monitoring aims at resolving changes in a producing
reservoir from changes in the reflection response. When the changes in the
reservoir are very small, the changes in the seismic response can become too
small to be reliably detected. In theory, multiple reflections can be used to
improve the detectability of traveltime changes: a wave that propagates several
times down and up through a reservoir layer will undergo a larger time shift
due to reservoir changes than a primary reflection. Since we are interested in
monitoring very local changes (usually in a thin reservoir layer), it would be
advantageous if we could identify the reservoir-related internal multiples in
the complex reflection response of the entire subsurface. We introduce a
Marchenko-based method to isolate these multiples from the complete reflection
response and illustrate the potential of this method with numerical examples.

  Objectives","idea overlapped with existing work",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the depth of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) surpasses that
of the pioneering networks with a significant margin, the traditional way of
appending supervision only over the final classifier and progressively
propagating gradient flow upstream remains the training mainstay. Seminal
Deeply-Supervised Networks (DSN) were proposed to alleviate the difficulty of
optimization arising from gradient flow through a long chain. However, it is
still vulnerable to issues including interference to the hierarchical
representation generation process and inconsistent optimization objectives, as
illustrated theoretically and empirically in this paper. Complementary to
previous training strategies, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Mimicking, a
generic feature learning mechanism, to advance CNN training with enhanced
generalization ability. Partially inspired by DSN, we fork delicately designed
side branches from the intermediate layers of a given neural network. Each
branch can emerge from certain locations of the main branch dynamically, which
not only retains representation rooted in the backbone network but also
generates more diverse representations along its own pathway. We go one step
further to promote multi-level interactions among different branches through an
optimization formula with probabilistic prediction matching losses, thus
guaranteeing a more robust optimization process and better representation
ability. Experiments on both category and instance recognition tasks
demonstrate the substantial improvements of our proposed method over its
corresponding counterparts using diverse state-of-the-art CNN architectures.

uncertainty relations that have been derived using ""stochastic thermodynamics"",
a theory based on a hypothesis known as local detailed balance. The authors
examined the foundations of this theory in their ""Box 1: A brief primer on
local detailed balance and stochastic thermodynamics"", where a kinetic scheme
for transport of particles between two reservoirs is presented. Horowitz and
Gingrich arrive at a relationship between the probability to cycle through the
states in one order vs. the probability to cycle in the reverse order. This
relation bears on the extremely important question of what governs
directionality when a system is driven away from equilibrium by contact with
multiple reservoirs that are not in equilibrium with one another. In the
original version of their paper the relation given for this ratio was obviously
wrong and contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. Based on our private
communications and on the recent paper authored by my colleagues and myself,
Horowitz and Gingrich accepted the necessity of correcting the error in their
Box 1. Unfortunately, in making the correction, the authors introduced an
equally serious, if less transparent, mistake, and continue to base their
theory on the thermodynamically impossible idea that transitions are mediated
by only one of the two reservoirs. In this comment we illustrate how the
principle of microscopic reversibility reveals that the true origin of
directional cycling amongst a network of states is kinetic asymmetry. This
understanding is important in guiding synthesis of molecular machines and other
devices designed to exploit transport or catalysis to drive non-equilibrium
processes.

structural integrity of the structure. This paper proposes a two-step surface
damage detection scheme using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). The CNN classifies given input images into two
categories: positive and negative. The positive category is where the surface
damage is present within the image, otherwise the image is classified as
negative. This is an image-based classification. The ANN accepts image inputs
that have been classified as positive by the ANN. This reduces the number of
images that are further processed by the ANN. The ANN performs feature-based
classification, in which the features are extracted from the detected edges
within the image. The edges are detected using Canny edge detection. A total of
19 features are extracted from the detected edges. These features are inputs
into the ANN. The purpose of the ANN is to highlight only the positive damaged
edges within the image. The CNN achieves an accuracy of 80.7% for image
classification and the ANN achieves an accuracy of 98.1% for surface detection.
The decreased accuracy in the CNN is due to the false positive detection,
however false positives are tolerated whereas false negatives are not. The
false negative detection for both CNN and ANN in the two-step scheme are 0%.

to better reveal the distribution of galaxies on a large scale and to link
galaxy properties with their environments. Photometric redshifts can be
efficiently combined with the cosmic web (CW) extracted from overlapping
spectroscopic surveys to improve their accuracy. We apply a similar method
using a new generation of photometric redshifts based on a convolution neural
network (CNN). The CNN is trained on the SDSS images with the main galaxy
sample (SDSS-MGS, $r \leq 17.8$) and the GAMA spectroscopic redshifts up tor
$\sim 19.8$. The mapping of the CW is obtained with 680,000 spectroscopic
redshifts from the MGS and BOSS surveys. The redshift probability distribution
functions (PDF), which are well calibrated (unbiased and narrow, $\leq 120$
Mpc), intercept a few CW structure along the line of sight. Combining these
PDFs with the density field distribution provides new photometric redshifts,
$z_{web}$, whose accuracy is improved by a factor of two (i.e.,${\sigma} \sim
0.004(1+z)$) for galaxies with $r \leq 17.8$. For half of them, the distance
accuracy is better than 10 cMpc. The narrower the original PDF, the larger the
boost in accuracy. No gain is observed for original PDFs wider than 0.03. The
final $z_{web}$ PDFs also appear well calibrated. The method performs slightly
better for passive galaxies than star-forming ones, and for galaxies in massive
groups since these populations better trace the underlying large-scale
structure. Reducing the spectroscopic sampling by a factor of 8 still improves
the photometric redshift accuracy by 25%. Extending the method to galaxies
fainter than the MGS limit still improves the redshift estimates for 70% of the
galaxies, with a gain in accuracy of 20% at low $z$ where the resolution of the
CW is the highest.

fundamental frequency, despite the signals not actually being periodic. Herein,
we provide three different definitions of a concept of fundamental frequency
for such inharmonic signals and study the implications of the different choices

a misspecified modeling scenario, and provides a theoretical benchmark for
analyzing the behavior of estimators derived under a perfectly harmonic
assumption. The second definition stems from optimal mass transport theory and
yields a robust and easily interpretable concept of fundamental frequency based
on the signals' spectral properties. The third definition interprets the
inharmonic signal as an observation of a randomly perturbed harmonic signal.
This allows for computing a hybrid information theoretical bound on estimation
performance, as well as for finding an estimator attaining the bound. The
theoretical findings are illustrated using numerical examples.

gaining a notable research momentum. Unlike traditional optimization paradigm
that focuses on solving a single task at a time, multitasking addresses how
multiple optimization problems can be tackled simultaneously by performing a
single search process. The main objective to achieve this goal efficiently is
to exploit synergies between the problems (tasks) to be optimized, helping each
other via knowledge transfer (thereby being referred to as Transfer
Optimization). Furthermore, the equally recent concept of Evolutionary
Multitasking (EM) refers to multitasking environments adopting concepts from
Evolutionary Computation as their inspiration for the simultaneous solving of
the problems under consideration. As such, EM approaches such as the
Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has shown a remarkable success
when dealing with multiple discrete, continuous, single-, and/or
multi-objective optimization problems. In this work we propose a novel
algorithmic scheme for Multifactorial Optimization scenarios - the
Multifactorial Cellular Genetic Algorithm (MFCGA) - that hinges on concepts
from Cellular Automata to implement mechanisms for exchanging knowledge among
problems. We conduct an extensive performance analysis of the proposed MFCGA
and compare it to the canonical MFEA under the same algorithmic conditions and
over 15 different multitasking setups (encompassing different reference
instances of the discrete Traveling Salesman Problem). A further contribution
of this analysis beyond performance benchmarking is a quantitative examination
of the genetic transferability among the problem instances, eliciting an
empirical demonstration of the synergies emerged between the different
optimization tasks along the MFCGA search process.

set into branchings such that the sizes of any two branchings differ at most by
one. For a digraph whose arc set can be partitioned into $k$ branchings, there
always exists an equitable partition into $k$ branchings. In this paper, we
present two extensions of equitable partitions into branchings in digraphs:
those into matching forests in mixed graphs; and into $b$-branchings in
digraphs. For matching forests, Kir\'{a}ly and Yokoi (2022) considered a
tricriteria equitability based on the sizes of the matching forest, and the
matching and branching therein. In contrast to this, we introduce a
single-criterion equitability based on the number of covered vertices, which is
plausible in the light of the delta-matroid structure of matching forests.
While the existence of this equitable partition can be derived from a lemma in
Kir\'{a}ly and Yokoi, we present its direct and simpler proof. For
$b$-branchings, we define an equitability notion based on the size of the
$b$-branching and the indegrees of all vertices, and prove that an equitable

ordinary differential equations (ODE), often stemming from underlying physical
and biological processes. A motivating example is intensive care unit patients:
the dynamics of vital physiological functions, such as the cardiovascular
system with its associated variables (heart rate, cardiac contractility and
output and vascular resistance) can be approximately described by a known
system of ODEs. Typically, some of the ODE variables are directly observed
(heart rate and blood pressure for example) while some are unobserved (cardiac
contractility, output and vascular resistance), and in addition many other
variables are observed but not modeled by the ODE, for example body
temperature. Importantly, the unobserved ODE variables are known-unknowns: We
know they exist and their functional dynamics, but cannot measure them
directly, nor do we know the function tying them to all observed measurements.
As is often the case in medicine, and specifically the cardiovascular system,
estimating these known-unknowns is highly valuable and they serve as targets
for therapeutic manipulations. Under this scenario we wish to learn the
parameters of the ODE generating each observed time-series, and extrapolate the
future of the ODE variables and the observations. We address this task with a
variational autoencoder incorporating the known ODE function, called GOKU-net
for Generative ODE modeling with Known Unknowns. We first validate our method
on videos of single and double pendulums with unknown length or mass; we then
apply it to a model of the cardiovascular system. We show that modeling the
known-unknowns allows us to successfully discover clinically meaningful
unobserved system parameters, leads to much better extrapolation, and enables
learning using much smaller training sets.

datasets consisted of only up to 9 different tissues and up to 21,000 unlabeled
nuclei and just over 24,000 labeled nuclei with segmentation masks. PanNuke
consists of 19 different tissue types that have been semi-automatically
annotated and quality controlled by clinical pathologists, leading to a dataset
with statistics similar to the clinical wild and with minimal selection bias.
We study the performance of segmentation and classification models when applied
to the proposed dataset and demonstrate the application of models trained on
PanNuke to whole-slide images. We provide comprehensive statistics about the
dataset and outline recommendations and research directions to address the
limitations of existing DL tools when applied to real-world CPath applications.

mismatch between datasets with long-tailed class distributions seen by a

of all, we connect existing class-balanced methods for long-tailed
classification to target shift, a well-studied scenario in domain adaptation.
The connection reveals that these methods implicitly assume that the training
data and test data share the same class-conditioned distribution, which does
not hold in general and especially for the tail classes. While a head class
could contain abundant and diverse training examples that well represent the
expected data at inference time, the tail classes are often short of
representative training data. To this end, we propose to augment the classic
class-balanced learning by explicitly estimating the differences between the
class-conditioned distributions with a meta-learning approach. We validate our
approach with six benchmark datasets and three loss functions.

on neutron star properties, such as their dense matter equation of state. This

phase of neutron-star binaries. Although current gravitational wave detectors
are not sensitive enough for a precise determination of the individual tidal
deformations of the components, a large number of combined observations with
future detectors will decrease uncertainties in this quantity. Here we provide
a first study of the tidal deformability effects due to the elasticity/solidity
of the crust (hadronic phase) in a hybrid neutron star, as well as the
influence of a quark-hadronic phase density jump on tidal deformations. We
employ the framework of nonradial perturbations with zero frequency and study
hadronic phases presenting elastic aspects when perturbed (with the shear
modulus approximately $1\%$ of the pressure). We find that the relative tidal
deformation change in a hybrid star with a perfect-fluid quark phase and a
hadronic phase presenting an elastic part is never larger than about $2-4\%$
(with respect to a perfect-fluid counterpart). These maximum changes occur when
the elastic region of a hybrid star is larger than approximately $60\%$ of the
star's radius, which may happen when its quark phase is small and the density
jump is large enough, or even when a hybrid star has an elastic mixed phase.
For other cases, the relative tidal deformation changes due to an elastic crust
are negligible ($10^{-5}-10^{-1}\%$), therefore unlikely to be measured even
with third generation detectors. Thus, only when the size of the elastic
hadronic region of a hybrid star is over half of its radius, the effects of
elasticity could have a noticeable impact on tidal deformations.

We systematically study the nature of the collective excitations in the ordered

(pure EI phase), its collective response exhibits a massless phase mode in
addition to the amplitude mode. We show that in the BEC regime, the signal of
the amplitude mode becomes less prominent and that the anisotropy in the phase
mode velocities is relaxed compared to the model bandstructure. Through
coupling to the lattice, the phase mode acquires a mass and the signal of the
amplitude mode becomes less prominent. Importantly, character of the softening
mode at the boundary between the normal semiconductor phase and the ordered
phase depends on the parameter condition. In particular, we point out that even
for el-ph coupling smaller than the Coulomb interaction the mode that softens
to zero at the boundary can have a phonon character. We also discuss how the
collective modes can be observed in the optical conductivity. Furthermore, we
study the effects of nonlocal interactions on the collective modes and show the

distribution undergoing number-conserving (such as sputtering) and/or
mass-conserving (such as shattering) processes. As typically observed
interstellar dust distributions follow a power-law, our method adopts a
power-law discretisation and uses both the grain mass and number densities in
each bin to determine the power-law parameters. This power-law method is
complementary to piecewise-constant and linear methods in the literature. We
find that the power-law method surpasses the other two approaches, especially
for small bin numbers. In the sputtering tests the relative error in the total
grain mass remains below 0.01% independent of the number of bins N, while the
other methods only achieve this for N > 50 or higher. Likewise, the shattering
test shows that the method also produces small relative errors in the total
grain numbers while conserving mass. Not only does the power-law method
conserve the global distribution properties, it also preserves the inter-bin
characteristics so that the shape of the distribution is recovered to a high
degree. This does not always happen for the constant and linear methods,
especially not for small bin numbers. Implementing the power-law method in a
hydrodynamical code thus minimises the numerical cost whilst maintaining high
accuracy. The method is not limited to dust grain distributions, but can also
be applied to the evolution of any distribution function, such as a cosmic-ray
distribution affected by synchrotron radiation or inverse-Compton scattering.

that CeCu$_{1+x}$As$_2$ crystallizes in a tetragonal centrosymmetric structure,
although the inversion symmetry could still be broken locally due to partially

of the suspension diverges. We use a specific concentration protocol together
with an accurate determination of $\phi$ for each drop and we measure the

particle sizes. At low volume fractions, $\beta$ is found to follow closely an
effective Newtonian behavior, which we determine by documenting the low
deformation limit for a highly viscous Newtonian drop and characterizing the
effective shear viscosity of our suspensions. By contrast, whereas the
effective Newtonian approach predicts that $\beta$ vanishes at $\phi_c$, a
finite deformation is observed for $\phi>\phi_c$. This finite deformation

related to telemetry cables that are used as a means of data transmission.
Transforming the traditional seismic acquisition system to a wireless system
has been considered as a potential solution to most of these difficulties. The
wireless seismic acquisition system has to serve a huge aggregate data rate
requirement as is usually the case in a large wireless sensor network. This
paper considers the wireless acquisition system, and studies the maximum
achievable transmission data rates from the geophones to the wireless gateways.
Successive interference cancellation decoding is assumed to be used at the
gateway nodes. We consider the problem of sum-rate maximization by optimizing
the decoding process at each gateway node. The optimization searches for
optimal decoding set at each gateway, i.e. which group of geophones will be
decoded at each gateway. Various integer programming algorithms are proposed
for solving the maximization problem. These optimization algorithms are
simulated and compared among each other, where it is shown that the ant system
algorithm achieves the highest sum-rate with lower computational complexity
compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, the data delivery from the gateways
to the data center is also considered. In this stage, two gateways with
different buffer sizes are studied. For small-size buffers, two optimization
problems are identified and solved. The first problem considers the
minimization of the total power of the gateways, and the second problem
considers power fairness between the gateways. For large-size buffers, the
problem of maximizing the weighted sum rate of the gateways is solved.

communication are two promising approaches to support massive content delivery
over wireless networks. The analysis of cache-enabled wireless networks is
usually carried out by assuming that devices are uniformly distributed,
however, in social networks, mobile devices are intrinsically grouped into
disjoint clusters. In this regards, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal
mathematical model that tracks the service requests arrivals and account for
the clustered devices geometry. Two kinds of devices are assumed, particularly,
content clients and content providers. Content providers are assumed to have a
surplus memory which is exploited to proactively cache contents from a known
library, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. Content clients can
retrieve a requested content from the nearest content provider in their
proximity (cluster), or, as a last resort, the base station (BS). The developed
spatiotemporal model is leveraged to formulate a joint optimization problem of
the content caching and spectrum partitioning in order to minimize the average
service delay. Due to the high complexity of the optimization problem, the
caching and spectrum partitioning problems are decoupled and solved iteratively
using the block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization technique. To this end,
an optimal and suboptimal solutions are obtained for the bandwidth partitioning
and probabilistic caching subproblems, respectively. Numerical results
highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional caching
schemes under equal and optimized bandwidth allocations. Particularly, it is
shown that the average service delay is reduced by nearly 100% and 350%,
compared to the Zipf and uniform caching schemes under equal bandwidth
allocations, respectively.

CH4 decomposition on the Cu(111) surface as an example, we systematically
compare MEP results with those obtained by explicitly sampling all relevant

temperatures. Interestingly, we find that, for reactions protected by a strong
steric hindrance effect, the MEP is still effectively followed even at a
temperature close to the Cu melting point. In contrast, without such a
protection, the flexibility of surface Cu atoms can lead to a significant free
energy barrier reduction at a high temperature. Accordingly, some conclusions

given by Nepomnyashchii and Nepomnyashchii, in terms of the matrix formalism
representation. This formalism is an extension of the Nambu representation for
the single-particle Green's function of BECs to discuss the density and current
response functions efficiently. We describe the exact low-energy properties of
the correlation functions and the vertex functions, and discuss the
correspondence of the spectra between the single-particle and density

the exact low-energy structures of the one-body and two-body Green's functions,
we develop a many-body approximation theory of BECs using the matrix formalism
for describing the single-particle Green's function and the density response
function at nonzero temperatures. We show how the peaks of the single-particle
spectral function and the density response function behave with an increasing
temperature. Many-body effect on the single-particle spectral function and the
density response function is included within a random phase approximation,
where satellite structures emerge because of beyond-mean-field effects.
Criticisms are also made on recent theories casting doubt upon the conventional
wisdom of the BEC: the equivalence of the dispersion relations between the

of frictionless spheres can be significantly extended, from the well-known
jamming-point at a fixed density, to a jamming-plane that spans the density and
shear strain axes. We explore the jamming-plane, via athermal and thermal
simulations of compression and shear jamming, with a help of an efficient swap
algorithm to prepare initial equilibrium configurations. The jamming-plane can
be divided into reversible-jamming and irreversible-jamming regimes, based on
the reversibility of the route from the initial configuration to jamming. Our
results suggest that the irreversible-jamming behavior reflects an escape from
the meta-stable glass basin to which the initial configuration belongs to, or
the absence of such basins. All jammed states, either compression or shear
jammed, are isostatic, and exhibit jamming criticality of the same universality
class. However, the anisotropy of contact networks non-trivially depends on the
jamming density and strain. Among all state points on the jamming-plane, the
jamming-point is a unique one with the minimum jamming density and the maximum
randomness. For lattice packings, the jamming-plane shrinks into a single shear
jamming-line that is independent of initial configurations. Our study paves the
way for solving the long-standing random close packing problem, and provides a
more complete framework to understand jamming.

website provided by Facebook and showing the locations of online streams and
locations of viewers, we extracted video IDs and different coordinates along
with general metadata. Then, having these IDs and using the API, we can collect
the fine grained metadata of public videos that might be useful for the

and identify the patterns of the streams and viewers. Such fine grained details
will enable the multimedia community to recreate real-world scenarios
particularly for resource allocation, caching, computation, and transcoding in
edge networks. Existing datasets do not provide the locations of the viewers,
which limits the efforts made to allocate the multimedia resources as close as
possible to viewers and to offer better QoE.

which excitons, bound pairs of electrons and holes, undergo Bose--Einstein
condensation, forming a macroscopic coherent state. While its existence was
first hypothesized half a century ago, the EI has eluded experimental
observation in bulk materials for decades. In the last few years, a resurgence
of interest in the subject has been driven by the identification of several
candidate materials suspected to support an excitonic condensate. However, one
obstacle in verifying the nature of these systems has been to find signatures
of the EI that distinguish it from a normal insulator. To address this, we
focus on a clear qualitative difference between the two phases: the existence
of Goldstone modes born by the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry in the
EI. Even if this mode is gapped, as occurs in the case of an approximate
symmetry, this branch of collective modes remains a fundamental feature of the
low-energy dynamics of the EI provided the symmetry-breaking is small. We study
a simple model that realizes an excitonic condensate, and use mean field theory
within the random-phase approximation to determine its collective modes. We
subsequently develop a diagrammatic method to incorporate the effects of
disorder perturbatively, and use it to determine the scattering rate of the
collective modes. We interpret our results within an an effective field theory.
The collective modes are found to be robust against symmetry-preserving
disorder, implying an experimental fingerprint unique to the EI: the ballistic
propagation of low-lying modes over mesoscopic distances, at electronic-scale
velocities. We suggest this could affect thermal transport at low temperatures,
and could be observed via spatially-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy through
the coherent response of phonons that hybridize with the collective modes.

algorithm aims at describing the structural information of the clustering
rather than the quantitative format of cluster-quality indexes (where the
representation power of clustering is some cumulative error similar to vector
quantization). Our Tree Index is finding margins amongst clusters for easy
learning without the complications of Minimum Description Length. Our Tree
Index produces a decision tree from the clustered data set, using the cluster
identifiers as labels. It combines the entropy of each leaf with their depth.
Intuitively, a shorter tree with pure leaves generalizes the data well (the
clusters are easy to learn because they are well separated). So, the labels are
meaningful clusters. If the clustering algorithm does not separate well, trees
learned from their results will be large and too detailed. We show that, on the
clustering results (obtained by various techniques) on a brain dataset, Tree
Index discriminates between reasonable and non-sensible clusters. We confirm
the effectiveness of Tree Index through graphical visualizations. Tree Index
evaluates the sensible solutions higher than the non-sensible solutions while
existing cluster-quality indexes fail to do so.

by transport effects. Independently of the solar wind type, the solar wind
measured in situ is always affected by both. We consider the proton-proton
collisional age as an ordering parameter for the solar wind at 1AU and explore
its relation to the solar wind classification scheme developed by Xu & Borovsky
(2015). We use this to show that explicit magnetic field information is not
required for this solar wind classification. Based on the observation that the
three basic solar wind types from this categorization cover different regimes
in terms of proton-proton collisional age $a_{col,p-p}$ , we propose a
simplified solar wind classification scheme that is only based on the
proton-proton collisional age. The resulting so-called PAC solar wind
classifier is an alternative to the full Xu & Borovsky (2015) solar wind
classification scheme and leads to a classification that is very similar to the
full Xu & Borovsky (2015) scheme. The solar wind is well ordered by the
proton-proton collisional age. This implies underlying intrinsic relationships
between the plasma properties, in particular, proton temperature and magnetic
field strength in each plasma regime. We argue that sector-reversal plasma is a
combination of particularly slow and dense solar wind and most stream
interaction boundaries. Most solar wind parameters (e.g., the magnetic field
strength, B, and the oxygen charge state ratio $n_{O^{7+}}$ /$n_{O^{6+}}$)
change with the solar activity cycle. Thus, all solar wind categorization
schemes based on threshold values need to be adapted to the solar activity
cycle as well.

magnitude K-dwarf in the Gaia G band. It has two transiting planets: a
Neptune-sized planet ($3.65\pm 0.10$ $R_E$) with a 4.1-day period, and a hot
Jupiter ($1.50^{+0.27}_{-0.22}$ $R_J$) with an 8.4-day period. Precise

$0.974^{+0.043}_{-0.044}$ $M_J$. For the inner Neptune, the data provide only
an upper limit on the mass of 0.17 $M_J$ (3$\sigma$). Nevertheless, we are
confident the inner planet is real, based on follow-up ground-based photometry

spacetimes along their inner boundaries. The junction conditions imposed on the
spacetimes specify the equation of state of the matter called thin shell
distributed along the joined boundaries. Barcelo and Visser (2000) reported
that spherically symmetric thin shell wormholes have their shells, namely the
wormhole throats, on the photon spheres if the wormholes are $Z_2$-symmetric
across the throats and the shells are of pure tension. In this paper, first, we
consider general joined spacetimes (JSTs) and show that any $Z_2$-symmetric
pure-tensional JST (Z2PTJST) of $\Lambda$-vacuum has its shell on a photon
surface, a generalized object of photon spheres, without assuming any other
symmetries. The class of Z2PTJSTs also includes, for example, brane world
models with the shells being the branes we live in. Second, we investigate the
shell stability of Z2PTJSTs by analyzing the stability of the corresponding
photon surfaces. Finally, applying the uniqueness theorem of photon spheres by
Cederbaum (2015), we establish the uniqueness theorem of static wormholes of
Z2PTJST.

cluttered and confined space while rearranging objects to retrieve a target
object. Although methods that decide what to remove have been proposed,
planning for the placement of removed objects inside a workspace has not
received much attention. Rather, removed objects are often placed outside the
workspace, which incurs additional laborious work (e.g., motion planning and
execution of the manipulator and the mobile base, perception of other areas).
Some other methods manipulate objects only inside the workspace but without a
principle so the rearrangement becomes inefficient.
  In this work, we consider both monotone (each object is moved only once) and
non-monotone arrangement problems which have shown to be NP-hard. Once the
sequence of objects to be relocated is given by any existing algorithm, our
method aims to minimize the number of pick-and-place actions to place the
objects until the target becomes accessible. From extensive experiments, we
show that our method reduces the number of pick-and-place actions and the total
execution time (the reduction is up to 23.1% and 28.1% respectively) compared

for reduction. This paper proposes a novel short-term CO2 emissions forecast to
enable intelligent scheduling of flexible electricity consumption to minimize

developed for short-term forecasting of the CO2 emissions of electricity. These
are in turn bench-marked against a set of state-of-the-art models. The result
is a new forecasting method with a 48-hour horizon targeted the day-ahead

has a mean absolute percentage error that is 25% lower than the best performing
state-of-the-art model. Further, application of the forecast for scheduling
flexible electricity consumption is studied for five European countries.
Scheduling a flexible block of 4 hours of electricity consumption in a 24 hour

with diverse packet processing features at line rate. A significant challenge
in developing such functions is to build flexible software that can be adapted

refactoring NF software for specific scenarios can take months. Furthermore,
network operators are increasingly adopting fast-paced development practices
for continuous software delivery to gain market advantage, which imposes even
shorter development cycles. A key aspect in NF design is state management,
which can be optimized across deployments by carefully selecting the underlying
data store. However, migrating to a data store that suits a different use-case
is time consuming because it requires code refactoring while revisiting its
application programming interfaces, APIs.
  In this paper we introduce FlexState, a state management system that
decouples the NF packet processing logic from the data store that maintains its
state. The objective is to reduce code refactoring significantly by
incorporating an abstraction layer that exposes various data stores as
configuration alternatives. Experiments show that FlexState achieves
significant flexibility in optimizing the NF state management across several
scenarios with negligible overhead.

nonlinear rescaling (NLR), which is a primal-dual-type algorithm by Griva and
Polyak {[{Math. Program., 106(2):237-259, 2006}]}. NLR introduces an equivalent
problem through a transformation of the constraint functions, minimizes the
corresponding augmented Lagrangian for given dual variables, and then uses this
minimizer to update the dual variables for the next iteration. The primal
update at each iteration is the solution of an unconstrained finite sum
minimization problem where the terms are weighted by the current dual
variables. We use randomized first-order algorithms to do these primal updates,
for which they are especially well suited. In particular, we use the scaled
dual variables as the sampling distribution for each primal update, and we show

bursts (FRBs) has yet been obtained, in spite of several multi-wavelength
searches carried out so far. Specifically, X/gamma-ray counterparts are
predicted by some models. We planned on searching for prompt gamma-ray
counterparts in the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT)
data, taking advantage of the unique combination of large effective area in the
keV-MeV energy range and of sub-ms time resolution. We selected 39 FRBs that
were promptly visible from the High-Energy (HE) instrument aboard Insight-HXMT.
After calculating the expected arrival times at the location of the spacecraft,
we searched for a significant excess in both individual and cumulative time
profiles over a wide range of time resolutions, from several seconds down to
sub-ms scales. Using the dispersion measures in excess of the Galactic terms,
we estimated the upper limits on the redshifts. No convincing signal was found
and for each FRB we constrained the gamma-ray isotropic-equivalent luminosity
and the released energy as a function of emission timescale. For the nearest
FRB source, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, we find
$L_{\gamma,iso}<5.5\times 10^{47}$ erg/s over 1 s, whereas
$L_{\gamma,iso}<10^{49}-10^{51}$ erg/s for the bulk of FRBs. The same values
scale up by a factor of ~100 for a ms-long emission. Even on a timescale
comparable with that of the radio pulse itself no keV-MeV emission is observed.
A systematic association with either long or short GRBs is ruled out with high
confidence, except for subluminous events, as is the case for core-collapse of
massive stars (long) or binary neutron star mergers (short) viewed off axis.
Only giant flares from extra-galactic magnetars at least ten times more
energetic than Galactic siblings are ruled out for the nearest FRB.

  People are now wondering whether these measures are helpful to stop or hamper

  A quantitative statement on this question depends on many parameters that are
difficult to grasp mathematically and cannot therefore be made conclusively
(they include consistent adherence to the measures decided, the estimated
number of unreported cases, the possible limitation by test capacities,
possible mutations of the virus, etc ...). However, it turns out that a
reduction in the actual daily new infection rate (actual daily growth rate of
reported cases, in short: infection rate) from the current value of 30-35% in
the US to 10% would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of the virus.
The severe restrictions in Germany which closed any public events, schools and

FE basis functions, e.g., C0 or Raviart Thomas functions. We employ the concept
of optimal test functions of the discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) method by
Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, leading to unconditionally stable FE

optimal discontinuous test functions can be computed in a completely decoupled

Various numerical verifications for 2D convection-dominated diffusion BVPs show
that the estimates of the approximation error by the new alternative method are
highly accurate, while the classical approach leads to error estimates of poor
quality. Lastly, we present an algorithm for h adaptive processes based on
control of the numerical approximation error via the new alternative approach.
Numerical verifications show that the estimator maintains high accuracy as the

We find that {\lambda}, as one of our new dimensionless variables which is
defined in terms of the quintessence potential, has a crucial role in the
history of the universe. We divide our discussion into two parts: a constant
{\lambda} and a varying {\lambda}. In the case of a constant {\lambda}, we
calculate all the critical points of the model even those at infinity and then
assume all of them as instantaneous critical points in the varying {\lambda}
situation which is the main part of this paper. We find that the effect of the
extra dimension in such a model is independent of the value of {\lambda}. Then,
we consider a Gaussian potential for which {\lambda} is not constant but varies
from zero to infinity. We discuss the evolution of the dynamical variables of
the model and conclude that their asymptotic behaviors follow the trajectories
of the moving critical points. Also, we find two different possible fates for
the universe. In one of them, it could experience an accelerated expansion, but
then enters a decelerating phase and finally reaches a stable matter-dominated
solution. In the other scenario, the universe could approach the
matter-dominated critical point without experiencing any accelerated expansion.
We argue that the first scenario is more compatible with observations.

Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A metric measuring status freshness is
the age-of-information (AoI), which captures the time elapsed from the status
being generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor) to the latest status
update.However, in intelligent IoT applications such as video surveillance, the
status information is revealed after some computation intensive and
time-consuming data processing operations, which would affect the status
freshness. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, age-of-processing (AoP),
to quantify such status freshness, which captures the time elapsed of the
newest received processed status data since it is generated. Compared with AoI,
AoP further takes the data processing time into account. Since an IoT device
has limited computation and energy resource, the device can choose to offload
the data processing to the nearby edge server under constrained status sampling
frequency.We aim to minimize the average AoP in a long-term process by jointly
optimizing the status sampling frequency and processing offloading policy. We
formulate this online problem as an infinite-horizon constrained Markov
decision process (CMDP) with average reward criterion. We then transform the
CMDP problem into an unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) by leveraging
a Lagrangian method, and propose a Lagrangian transformation framework for the
original CMDP problem. Furthermore, we integrate the framework with
perturbation based refinement for achieving the optimal policy of the CMDP
problem. Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the benchmarks, with an average AoP reduction up to 30%.

a function of shear rate and nanoparticle volume fraction. We observe shear
thinning behavior at low volume fractions, as the shear rate increases, the
shear forces overcome the brownian forces, resulting in more frequent and more
violent collisions between the nanoparticles. This in turn results in more
dissipation. We show that in order to be in the shear thinning regime the
nanoparticle have to order themselves into layers longitudinal to the flow to
minimize the collisions. As the nanoparticle volume fraction increases there is
less room to form the ordered layers, consequently as the shear rate increases
the nanoparticles collide more which results in turn in shear thickening. Most
interestingly, we show that at intermediate volume fractions the system
exhibits metastability, with successions of ordered and disordered states along
the same trajectory. Our results suggest that for nanoparticles in a simple
fluid the hydro-clustering phenomenon is not present, instead the
order-disorder transition is the leading mechanism for the transition from

the most accurate is considered to be the Monte Carlo method. However, a Monte
Carlo approximation is cumbersome to use inside a time-critical application

typically very expensive to solve, especially if they involve many
measurements. These problems pose huge computational challenges as evaluating
the objective function or misfit requires the solution of a large number of
parameterized partial differential equations, typically one per source term.
Newton-type algorithms, which may be required for fast convergence, typically
require the additional solution of a large number of adjoint problems.
  The use of parametric model reduction may substantially alleviate this
problem. In [de Sturler, E., Gugercin, S., Kilmer, M. E., Chaturantabut, S.,
Beattie, C., and O'Connell, M. (2015). Nonlinear Parametric Inversion Using
Interpolatory Model Reduction. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 37(3)],
interpolatory model reduction was successfully used to drastically speed up
inversion for Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT). However, when using model
reduction in high dimensional parameter spaces, obtaining error bounds in
parameter space is typically intractable. In this paper, we propose to use
stochastic estimates to remedy this problem. At the cost of one (randomized)
full-scale linear solve per optimization step we obtain a robust algorithm.
Moreover, since we can now update the model when needed, this robustness allows
us to further reduce the order of the reduced order model and hence the cost of
computing and using it, further decreasing the cost of inversion. We also
propose a method to update the model reduction basis that reduces the number of
large linear solves required by 46%-98% compared with the fixed reduced-order
model. We demonstrate that this leads to a highly efficient and robust

to generate models of the interosseous membrane in the forearm. For the

proposed in prior work. For evaluation we compared the generated sites, as well
as the ligament shapes, to data obtained from a cadaveric study, involving five
forearms with a total of 15 ligaments. Our framework permitted the creation of
3D models approximating ligaments' shapes with good fidelity. However, we found
that the statistical model trained with the state-of-the-art prediction of the
insertion sites was not always reliable. Using that model, average mean square
errors as well as Hausdorff distances of the meshes increased by more than one
order of magnitude, as compared to employing the known insertion locations of
the cadaveric study. Using the latter an average mean square error of 0.59 mm

the first step, we also investigate the non-asymptotic properties of the
relevant estimated terms under a FPCA framework. To illustrate with an
important application, we consider vector functional autoregressive models and
develop a regularization approach to estimate autoregressive coefficient
functions under the sparsity constraint. Using our derived non-asymptotic
results, we investigate convergence properties of the regularized estimate
under high-dimensional scaling. Finally, the finite-sample performance of the
proposed method is examined through both simulations and a public financial
dataset.

around 2.75 K and 2.84 K respectively at y = 0.075, followed by a decrease of
Tc before the chemical phase boundary is reached at y = 0.2. Nevertheless, Tc
decreases monotonously with Rh-doping content y increases and disappears above
0.3 with measuring temperature down to 2 K. Surprisingly, in the Zn1-xCuxIr2Te4

0.9 despite Tc changes slightly with higher doping content, which differs from
the observation of zinc doping suppressing the superconductivity quickly in the

on the details of inflation and is usually assumed to be larger than our

with the cosmological constant. As a consequence, the measured cosmic

vacuum energy. We need some additional odd properties such as the existence of
evolving dark energy (DE) with energy-density fine tuned to be twice that of

without DE (or modified gravity) assuming that the causal scale is smaller than
the observable Universe today. Such scale corresponds to half the sky at z=1

manifold learning to be used for cost-efficient predictions of high-dimensional
stochastic systems. The method exploits subspace-structured features of each
solution by projecting it onto a Grassmann manifold. The method utilizes a
solution clustering approach in order to identify regions of the parameter
space over which solutions are sufficiently similarly such that they can be
interpolated on the Grassmannian. In this clustering, the reduced-order
solutions are partitioned into disjoint clusters on the Grassmann manifold
using the eigen-structure of properly defined Grassmannian kernels and, the
Karcher mean of each cluster is estimated. Then, the points in each cluster are
projected onto the tangent space with origin at the corresponding Karcher mean
using the exponential mapping. For each cluster, a Gaussian process regression
model is trained that maps the input parameters of the system to the reduced
solution points of the corresponding cluster projected onto the tangent space.
Using this Gaussian process model, the full-field solution can be efficiently
predicted at any new point in the parameter space. In certain cases, the
solution clusters will span disjoint regions of the parameter space. In such
cases, for each of the solution clusters we utilize a second, density-based
spatial clustering to group their corresponding input parameter points in the
Euclidean space. The proposed method is applied to two numerical examples. The
first is a nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equation with uncertain
initial conditions. The second involves modeling of plastic deformation in a
model amorphous solid using the Shear Transformation Zone theory of plasticity.

of these models aggregate time-series data without considering the temporal

recurrent neural network (RNN) based models, which are nonetheless difficult to
interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework TRACER to facilitate
accurate and interpretable predictions, with a novel model TITV devised for
healthcare analytics and other high stakes applications such as financial
investment and risk management. Different from LR and other existing RNN-based
models, TITV is designed to capture both the time-invariant and the
time-variant feature importance using a feature-wise transformation subnetwork
and a self-attention subnetwork, for the feature influence shared over the
entire time series and the time-related importance respectively. Healthcare
analytics is adopted as a driving use case, and we note that the proposed
TRACER is also applicable to other domains, e.g., fintech. We evaluate the
accuracy of TRACER extensively in two real-world hospital datasets, and our
doctors/clinicians further validate the interpretability of TRACER in both the
patient level and the feature level. Besides, TRACER is also validated in a
high stakes financial application and a critical temperature forecasting
application. The experimental results confirm that TRACER facilitates both

numbers of AI time-series models in IoT applications, is described. Modelling
code templates, in Python and R, following a typical machine-learning workflow
are supported. A knowledge-based approach to managing model and time-series
data allows the use of general semantic concepts for expressing feature
engineering tasks. Model templates can be programmatically deployed against
specific instances of semantic concepts, thus supporting model reuse and
automated replication as the IoT application grows. Deployed models are
automatically executed in parallel leveraging a serverless cloud computing
framework. The complete history of trained model versions and rolling-horizon
predictions is persisted, thus enabling full model lineage and traceability.
Results from deployments in real-world smart-grid live forecasting applications
are reported. Scalability of executing up to tens of thousands of AI modelling
tasks is also evaluated.

of this game under an infinite-horizon discounted reward function.
Regularization is introduced by adding a strongly concave regularization
function to the one-stage reward function in the classical mean-field game
model. We establish a value iteration based learning algorithm to this
regularized mean-field game using fitted Q-learning. The regularization term in
general makes reinforcement learning algorithm more robust to the system
components. Moreover, it enables us to establish error analysis of the learning
algorithm without imposing restrictive convexity assumptions on the system
components, which are needed in the absence of a regularization term.

implemented in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have demonstrated
increased energy efficiency and lower latency compared to CNN execution on CPUs
or GPUs. However, the complex shapes of CNN parameter memories do not typically
map well to FPGA on-chip memories (OCM), which results in poor OCM utilization
and ultimately limits the size and types of CNNs which can be effectively
accelerated on FPGAs. In this work, we present a design methodology that
improves the mapping efficiency of CNN parameters to FPGA OCM. We frame the
mapping as a bin packing problem and determine that traditional bin packing
algorithms are not well suited to solve the problem within FPGA- and
CNN-specific constraints. We hybridize genetic algorithms and simulated
annealing with traditional bin packing heuristics to create flexible mappers
capable of grouping parameter memories such that each group optimally fits FPGA
on-chip memories. We evaluate these algorithms on a variety of FPGA inference
accelerators. Our hybrid mappers converge to optimal solutions in a matter of
seconds for all CNN use-cases, achieve an increase of up to 65% in OCM
utilization efficiency for deep CNNs, and are up to 200$\times$ faster than
current state-of-the-art simulated annealing approaches.

source formulation of full waveform inversion can produce an optimization
problem without spurious local minima (""cycle skipping""). The data consist of a
single trace recorded at a given distance from a point source. The velocity or
slowness is presumed homogeneous, and the target source wavelet is presumed
quasi-impulsive or focused at zero time lag. The source is extended by
permitting energy to spread in time, and the spread is controlled by adding a
weighted mean square of the extended source wavelet to the data misfit, to
produce the extended inversion objective. The objective function and its
gradient can be computed explicitly, and it is easily seen that all local
minimizers must be within a wavelength of the correct slowness. The derivation
shows several important features of all similar extended source algorithms. For
example, nested optimization, with the source estimation in the inner
optimization (variable projection method), is essential. The choice of the
weight operator, controlling the extended source degrees of freedom, is
critical: the choice presented here is a differential operator, and that
property is crucial for production of an objective immune from cycle-skipping.

time-varying phase distributions. But single shot techniques could resolve the
problem. Many efforts have been made on the phase retrieval methods from a
single shot interferogram. In the paper, a simple and effective method is
presented without complex computation. The interference fringe is transferred
to a phase distribution with a look-up-table. And then it is divided into
different regions according to the parity of every pixel. The pixels in the
same region have the same parity, which determines the wrapped phase.
Additionally, the light spot displacement of a local wavefront is obtained to
solve the global sign ambiguity. The theoretical simulation results indicate
that the PV of wavefront error is 0.00054(lambda) and the rms is
0.000125(lambda), which is much better than the results from the Fast Fourier
Transformation method. We also use it in the experimentally measured
interferogram. Our algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, high precision
and effective for both open and closed interferometer fringes, which will be
valuable for real time monitoring the optical elements shape during their
