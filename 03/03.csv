LOFAR and future telescopes like the SKA, many data processing steps are
overwhelmed by the amount of data that needs to be handled using limited
compute resources. Calibration is one such operation that dominates the overall
data processing computational cost, nonetheless, it is an essential operation
to reach many science goals. Calibration algorithms do exist that scale well
with the number of stations of an array and the number of directions being
calibrated. However, the remaining bottleneck is the raw data volume, which
scales with the number of baselines, and which is proportional to the square of
the number of stations. We propose a 'stochastic' calibration strategy where we
only read in a mini-batch of data for obtaining calibration solutions, as
opposed to reading the full batch of data being calibrated. Nonetheless, we
obtain solutions that are valid for the full batch of data. Normally, data need
to be averaged before calibration is performed to accommodate the data in
size-limited compute memory. Stochastic calibration overcomes the need for data
averaging before any calibration can be performed, and offers many advantages
including: enabling the mitigation of faint radio frequency interference;
better removal of strong celestial sources from the data; and better detection
and spatial localization of fast radio transients.

evaluation of theories in computational chemistry. The standard ranking of
methods by their Mean Unsigned Error is unsatisfactory for several reasons
linked to the non-normality of the error distributions and the presence of
underlying trends. Complementary statistics have recently been proposed to
palliate such deficiencies, such as quantiles of the absolute errors
distribution or the mean prediction uncertainty. We introduce here a new score,
the systematic improvement probability (SIP), based on the direct system-wise
comparison of absolute errors. Independently of the chosen scoring rule, the
uncertainty of the statistics due to the incompleteness of the benchmark data
sets is also generally overlooked. However, this uncertainty is essential to
appreciate the robustness of rankings. In the present article, we develop two
indicators based on robust statistics to address this problem: P_{inv}, the
inversion probability between two values of a statistic, and \mathbf{P}_{r},
the ranking probability matrix. We demonstrate also the essential contribution
of the correlations between error sets in these scores comparisons.

determination of materials' topology often poses significant technical
challenges. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely-used materials
characterization technique sensitive to atoms' local symmetry and chemical
bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of
topological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS
is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and
calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can
effectively inform experiments. In this work, we leverage computed X-ray
absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10,000 inorganic
materials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological
class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F$_1$ scores of 89% and 93% for
topological and trivial classes, respectively. Additionally, we obtain
consistent classifications using corresponding experimental and computational
XANES spectra for a small number of measured compounds. Given the simplicity of
the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the
proposed machine learning-augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential
to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non-cleavable
compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field-driven
phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field-driven topological phase transitions.

This work deals with the probability of erasure computation for orthogonal
frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals used by multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) systems. The theoretical results are validated by computer
simulations. OFDM is widely used in present day wireless communication systems

the goal is to embed each vertex into a low-dimensional vector space. We
consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem
as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric
exponential family distribution. The bipartite graph is assumed to be generated
by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component
is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks, while
nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. Neural networks take
high-dimensional features as inputs and output embedding vectors. In this
setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the
weight matrices. The main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity
of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the
distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood
objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and focus on its
local geometry. We show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a
neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method
achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity
of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is
consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to
any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in
extensive experiments.

based on real-time coordination of connected vehicles in the presence of
non-connected human-driven vehicles. We develop a novel Markov decision process
formulation for the DQJL coordination strategies, which explicitly accounts for
the uncertainty of drivers' yielding pattern to approaching EMVs. Based on
pairs of neural networks representing actors and critics for agent vehicles, we
develop a multi-agent actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm that
handles a varying number of vehicles and a random proportion of connected
vehicles in the traffic. Approaching the optimal coordination strategies via
indirect and direct reinforcement learning, we present two schemata to address
multi-agent reinforcement learning on this connected vehicle application. Both
approaches are validated, on a micro-simulation testbed SUMO, to establish a
DQJL fast and safely. Validation results reveal that, with DQJL coordination
strategies, it saves up to 30% time for EMVs to pass a link-level intelligent

to the exchange striction as a result of the long range spin order, and the
second one at 70 K emanating from the structural phase transition primarily
driven by the O atomic displacements. Magneticfield induced magnetoelectric

control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar
network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven
control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing
for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor
commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial
signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input
signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing
univocally a specific system state at every point of time.
Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for
building adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously
adapts the torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is
deployed. Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar
controller to cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators

systems increases exponentially with respect to the agent number. This
scalability issue prevents MARL from being applied in large-scale multiagent

the interactions between agents are quite sparse. Without exploiting this
sparsity structure, existing works aggregate information from all of the agents
and thus have a high sample complexity. To address this issue, we propose an
adaptive sparse attention mechanism by generalizing a sparsity-inducing
activation function. Then a sparse communication graph in MARL is learned by
graph neural networks based on this new attention mechanism. Through this
sparsity structure, the agents can communicate in an effective as well as
efficient way via only selectively attending to agents that matter the most and
thus the scale of the MARL problem is reduced with little optimality
compromised. Comparative results show that our algorithm can learn an
interpretable sparse structure and outperforms previous works by a significant

  Unmixing incorporating Endmember Independence","18 pages, 16 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) has become an important technique in exploiting
hyperspectral data since it decomposes a mixed pixel into a collection of
endmembers weighted by fractional abundances. The endmembers of a hyperspectral
image (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed
in a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging
spectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have
focused on imposing auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed
spectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum constraint to extract
endmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as
Kurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which
incorporates a novel constraint based on the statistical independence of the
probability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this constraint on
the conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent
endmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data.
Experiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers
of endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard
real HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm
compared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines. The proposed
algorithm exhibits superior performance especially in terms of extracting
endmember spectra from hyperspectral data; therefore, it could uplift the
performance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilize the endmember
spectra as supervisory input data for abundance extraction.

However, in contrast to in non-living materials the T1 transitions in
biological tissues are rate-limited and cannot occur instantaneously due to the
finite time required to remodel complex structures at cell-cell junctions. Here
we study how this rate-limiting process affects the mechanics and collective
behavior of cells in a tissue by introducing this important biological
constraint in a theoretical vertex-based model as an intrinsic single-cell
property. We report in the absence of this time constraint, the tissue
undergoes a motility-driven glass transition characterized by a sharp increase
in the intermittency of cell-cell rearrangements. Remarkably, this glass
transition disappears as T1 transitions are temporally limited. As a unique
consequence of limited rearrangements, we also find that the tissue develops
spatially correlated streams of fast and slow cells, in which the fast cells
organize into stream-like patterns with leader-follower interactions, and
maintain optimally stable cell-cell contacts. The predictions of this work is
compared with existing in-vivo experiments in Drosophila pupal development.

This method combines MDG-ICE, which uses a weak formulation that separately
enforces a conservation law and the corresponding interface condition and
treats the discrete geometry as a variable, with the Discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methodology of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan to
systematically generate optimal test functions from the trial spaces of both
the discrete flow field and discrete geometry. For inviscid flows, LS-MDG-ICE
detects and fits a priori unknown interfaces, including shocks. For
convection-dominated diffusion, LS-MDG-ICE resolves internal layers, e.g.,
viscous shocks, and boundary layers using anisotropic curvilinear
$r$-adaptivity in which high-order shape representations are anisotropically
adapted to accurately resolve the flow field. As such, LS-MDG-ICE solutions are
oscillation-free, regardless of the grid resolution and polynomial degree.
Finally, for both linear and nonlinear problems in one dimension, LS-MDG-ICE is
shown to achieve optimal convergence of the $L^2$ solution error with respect
to the exact solution when the discrete geometry is fixed and super-optimal
convergence when the discrete geometry is treated as a variable.

without blended objects. We find that blending effects start to be important
($\sim$ 0.04~mag obscuration) at angular scales smaller than 0.1 arcmin.
Extinction and other systematic obscuration effects can be as large as 0.10~mag
(U-band) but are typically smaller than 0.02~mag depending on the band. After
applying these corrections, we measure a $3.9\sigma$ magnification signal that
is consistent for both counts and magnitudes. The corresponding projected mass
profiles of galaxies at redshift $z \simeq 0.6$ ($M_I \simeq -21$) is $\Sigma=
25\pm 6 M_{sun}h^3/pc^2$ at 0.1 Mpc/h, consistent with NFW type profile with
$M_{200} \simeq 2 \times 10^{12} M_{sun} h/pc^2$. Tangential shear and
flux-size magnification over the same lenses show similar mass profiles. We
conclude that magnification from counts and fluxes using photometric redshifts
has the potential to provide complementary weak lensing information in future
wide field surveys once we carefully take into account systematic effects, such
as obscuration and blending.

structured datasets, which can be fed into machine learning algorithms for the
detection of active eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. More
specifically, a wireless communication system, which consists of K legal users,
one access point (AP) and one active eavesdropper, is considered. To cope with
the eavesdropper who breaks into the system during the uplink phase, we first
build structured datasets based on several different features. We then apply
support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and one-class SVM classifiers to those
structured datasets for detecting the presence of eavesdropper. Regarding the
data, we first process received signals at the AP and then define three
different features (i.e., MEAN, RATIO and SUM) based on the post-processing
signals. Noticeably, our three defined features are formulated such that they
have relevant statistical properties. Enabling the AP to simulate the entire
process of transmission, we form the so-called artificial training data (ATD)
that is used for training SVM (or one-class SVM) models. While SVM is preferred
in the case of having perfect channel state information (CSI) of all channels,
one-class SVM is preferred in the case of having only the CSI of legal users.
We also evaluate the accuracy of the trained models in relation to the choice
of kernel functions, the choice of features, and the change of eavesdropper's
power. Numerical results show that the accuracy is relatively sensitive to
adjusting parameters. Under some settings, SVM classifiers (or even one-class
SVM) can bring about the accuracy of over 90%.

interpolating the training data perfectly. Rather than the U-curve emblematic
of the bias-variance trade-off, their test error often follows a ""double
descent"" - a mark of the beneficial role of overparametrization. In this work,
we develop a quantitative theory for this phenomenon in the so-called lazy
learning regime of neural networks, by considering the problem of learning a
high-dimensional function with random features regression. We obtain a precise
asymptotic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the test error,
and show that the bias displays a phase transition at the interpolation
threshold, beyond which it remains constant. We disentangle the variances
stemming from the sampling of the dataset, from the additive noise corrupting
the labels, and from the initialization of the weights. Following up on Geiger
et al. 2019, we first show that the latter two contributions are the crux of
the double descent: they lead to the overfitting peak at the interpolation
threshold and to the decay of the test error upon overparametrization. We then
quantify how they are suppressed by ensemble averaging the outputs of K
independently initialized estimators. When K is sent to infinity, the test
error remains constant beyond the interpolation threshold. We further compare
the effects of overparametrizing, ensembling and regularizing. Finally, we
present numerical experiments on classic deep learning setups to show that our
results hold qualitatively in realistic lazy learning scenarios.

different epsilon-near-zero crossing points with a discrepancy that increases
with increasing intensity. We predict that hot carriers induce a dynamic
redshift of the plasma frequency and a corresponding translation of the
effective nonlinear dispersion curves that can be used to predict and quantify
nonlinear refractive index changes as a function of incident laser peak power
density. Our results suggest that large, nonlinear refractive index changes can
occur without the need for epsilon-near-zero modes to couple with plasmonic
resonators. At sufficiently large laser pulse intensities, we predict the onset
of optical bistability, while the presence of additional pump absorption
resonances that arise from longitudinal oscillations of the free electron gas
give way to corresponding resonances in the second and third harmonic spectra.

the Selected Completely At Random (SCAR) assumption. Yet the annotation process
is an important part of the data collection, and in many cases it naturally
depends on certain features of the data (e.g., the intensity of an image and
the size of the object to be detected in the image). Without any constraints on
the model for the annotation process, classification results in the LePU
problem will be highly non-unique. So proper, flexible constraints are needed.

been less embraced and it was only within the last century that a program of
applications for physics started. Regarding quantum physics, it has been only
in the previous decade or so that the corresponding literature resulted in a
set of defying papers. In such a context, this manuscript constitutes a cordial
invitation, whose purpose is simply to suggest, mostly through a heuristic and
unpretentious presentation, the extension of fractional quantum mechanics to
cosmological settings. Being more specific, we start by outlining a historical
summary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation, a (very) brief
appraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details
(namely those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing.
Subsequently, the application of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is
introduced, advocating it as worthy to consider: if the progress of fractional
calculus serves as an argument, indeed useful consequences will also be drawn
(to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that
may affect the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of
minisuperspace covariance and fractional derivatives, for instance. An example
of investigation is provided by means of a very simple model. Concretely, we
restrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements,
we may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard
cosmology. In summary, the subject of fractional quantum cosmology is herewith
proposed, merely realized in terms of an open program constituted by several
challenges.

magnetic fields are in the focus of research since more than 30 years. In order
to minimize the limit of detection (LOD) of such sensor systems, it is of high
importance to understand and to be able to quantify the relevant noise sources.
In this contribution, cantilever-type electromechanic and magnetoelastic
resonators, respectively, are comprehensively investigated and mathematically
described not only with regard to their phase sensitivity but especially to the
extent of the sensor-intrinsic phase noise. Both measurements and calculations
reveal that the fundamental LOD is limited by additive phase noise due to
thermal-mechanical noise of the resonator, i.e. by thermally induced random
vibrations of the cantilever, and by thermal-electrical noise of the
piezoelectric material. However, due to losses in the magnetic material
parametric flicker phase noise arises, limiting the overall performance. In
particular it is shown that the LOD is virtually independent of the magnetic
sensitivity but is solely determined by the magnetic losses. Instead of the
sensitivity, the magnetic losses, represented by the material's effective
complex permeability, should be considered as the most important parameter for
the further improvement of such sensors in the future. This implication is not
only valid for magnetoelastic cantilevers but also applies to any type of
magnetoelastic resonator.

applying optimal control to many real-world decision making tasks. The Learning
Controllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding
the observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent
dynamics, and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure
the learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing
LCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform
next-observation prediction---a challenging high-dimensional task that
furthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the
decoder) which are discarded during control. In this paper, we propose a novel
information-theoretic LCE approach and show theoretically that explicit
next-observation prediction can be replaced with predictive coding. We then use
predictive coding to develop a decoder-free LCE model whose latent dynamics are
amenable to locally-linear control. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks
show that our model reliably learns a controllable latent space that leads to
superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art LCE baselines.

connectivity between nodes is achieved by emitting and receiving overlapping
light signals inside a shared quasi 2D waveguide. This decreases the circuit
footprint by at least an order of magnitude compared to existing optical
solutions. The reception, evaluation and emission of the optical signals are
performed by a neuron-like node constructed from known, highly efficient III-V

demonstrate the concept, we build a computational model based on an
anatomically correct, functioning model of the central-complex navigation
circuit of the insect brain. We simulate in detail the optical and electronic
parts required to reproduce the connectivity of the central part of this
network, using experimentally derived parameters. The results are used as input

Alongside other adversarial defense approaches being investigated, there has
been a very recent interest in improving adversarial robustness in deep neural
networks through the introduction of perturbations during the training process.
However, such methods leverage fixed, pre-defined perturbations and require
significant hyper-parameter tuning that makes them very difficult to leverage
in a general fashion. In this study, we introduce Learn2Perturb, an end-to-end
feature perturbation learning approach for improving the adversarial robustness
of deep neural networks. More specifically, we introduce novel
perturbation-injection modules that are incorporated at each layer to perturb
the feature space and increase uncertainty in the network. This feature
perturbation is performed at both the training and the inference stages.
Furthermore, inspired by the Expectation-Maximization, an alternating
back-propagation training algorithm is introduced to train the network and
noise parameters consecutively. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets show that the proposed Learn2Perturb method can result in deep neural
networks which are $4-7\%$ more robust on $l_{\infty}$ FGSM and PDG adversarial

particular, we investigate an effective relational cosmological dynamics for
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, extracted from a class of free group
field theory models, and subsequently investigate aspects of its late and early

scales has been known to improve the fit to the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data when compared to the more standard, nearly scale invariant power
spectrum that arises in slow roll inflation. In an earlier work, we had
numerically investigated the characteristics of the scalar bispectrum generated
in models with kinetically dominated initial conditions. In this work, we
compare the scenario with two other competing scenarios (viz. punctuated
inflation and a model due to Starobinsky) which also suppress the scalar power
in a roughly similar fashion on large scales. We further consider two other
scenarios involving inflation of a finite duration, one wherein the scalar
field begins on the inflationary attractor and another wherein the field starts
with a smaller velocity and evolves towards the attractor. These scenarios too
exhibit a sharp drop in power on large scales if the initial conditions on the
perturbations for a range of modes are imposed on super-Hubble scales as in the
kinetically dominated model. We compare the performance of all the models
against the Planck CMB data at the level of power spectra. We also compare the
amplitudes and shapes of the scalar non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$
in all these cases which lead to scalar power spectra of similar form.
Interestingly, we find that, in the models wherein the initial conditions on
the perturbations are imposed on super-Hubble scales, the consistency relation
governing the scalar bispectrum is violated for the large scale modes, whereas
the relation is satisfied for all the modes in the other scenarios. These
differences in the behavior of the scalar bispectra can conceivably help us
observationally discriminate between the various models which lead to scalar
power spectra of roughly similar shape.

trap is adapted from a previously implemented Stokes trap by incorporating a
drop-on-demand system to generate droplets at a T-junction geometry on the same
microfluidic chip. We then study confined droplet dynamics in response to
perturbation by applying a millisecond-pressure pulse to deform trapped
droplets. Droplet shape relaxation after cessation of the pressure pulse
follows an exponential decay. The characteristic droplet shape relaxation time
is obtained from the shape decay curves for aqueous glycerol droplets of
varying viscosities in the dispersed phase with light and heavy mineral oils in
the continuous phase. Systems were chosen to provide similar equilibrium
interfacial tensions (5-10 mN/m) with wide variations of viscosity ratios. It
is found that the droplet shape relaxation shows a strong dependence on droplet
radius, and a weak dependence on the ratio of dispersed to continuous phase
viscosity. The relaxation time is smaller for the highest viscosity ratios,
potentially indicating that the dominant viscosity controls the droplet shape
relaxation time in addition to the interfacial tension and droplet size.
Droplet shape relaxation time can be used inform the response of droplets in an
emulsion when subjected to transient flows in various processing conditions.
Finally, an application of this platform for directly visualizing individual
droplet coalescence in a planar extensional flow is presented. The microfluidic
four-channel hydrodynamic trap can thus be applied for studying fundamental
physics of droplet deformation and droplet-droplet interactions on the
micro-scale to provide an enhanced understanding of emulsion behavior on an

systems, solid-state spin sensors still lack a universal, high-fidelity readout

allows the spin ensemble's microwave transition to be probed directly, thereby
overcoming the optical photon shot noise limitations of conventional
fluorescence readout. Applying this technique to magnetometry, we show magnetic
sensitivity approaching the Johnson-Nyquist noise limit of the system. This

predict the stellar masses and accretion redshifts of these progenitors. We
apply the network to Galactic GCs associated with five progenitors: {\it
Gaia}-Enceladus, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and the recently
discovered, `low-energy' GCs, which provide an excellent match to the predicted
properties of the enigmatic galaxy `Kraken'. The five galaxies cover a narrow
stellar mass range [$M_\star=(0.6{-}4.6)\times10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$], but have
widely different accretion redshifts ($z_{\rm acc}=0.57{-}2.65$). All accretion
events represent minor mergers, but Kraken likely represents the most major
merger ever experienced by the Milky Way, with stellar and virial mass ratios
of $r_{M_\star}=1$:$31^{+34}_{-16}$ and $r_{M_{\rm h}}=1$:$7^{+4}_{-2}$,
respectively. The progenitors match the $z=0$ relation between GC number and
halo virial mass, but have elevated specific frequencies, suggesting an
evolution with redshift. Even though these progenitors likely were the Milky
Way's most massive accretion events, they contributed a total mass of only
$\log{(M_{\rm \star,tot}/{\rm M}_\odot)}=9.0\pm0.1$, similar to the stellar
halo. This implies that the Milky Way grew its stellar mass mostly by in-situ
star formation. We conclude by organising these accretion events into the most

gravitational-wave sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more
phases of mass transfer, during which one of the stars loses part or all of its
outer envelope and becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size
of these stripped stars is crucial in determining whether they experience
further interactions and their final fate. We present new calculations of
stripped-envelope stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We
use these to investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and
metallicity. We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics
and potential consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae
from stripped stars. At high metallicity we find that practically all of the
hydrogen-rich envelope is removed, in agreement with earlier findings. Only
progenitors with initial masses below 10\Msun expand to large radii (up to
100\Rsun), while more massive progenitors stay compact. At low metallicity, a
substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors can, in principle,
expand to giant sizes (> 400\Rsun), for all masses we consider. This implies
that they can fill their Roche lobe anew. We show that the prescriptions
commonly used in population synthesis models underestimate the stellar radii by
up to two orders of magnitude. We expect that this has consequences for the
predictions for gravitational-wave sources from double neutron star mergers, in
particular for their metallicity dependence.

paper, we use a suite of hydrodynamic models of coalescing binaries involving
an extended donor and a more compact accretor. We focus on the period of
unstable Roche Lobe overflow that ends as the accretor plunges within the
envelope of the donor at the onset of a common envelope phase. During this
stage, mass is removed from the donor and flung into the circumbinary

kinematics of this ejecta and its dependencies on binary properties and find
that it assembles into a toroidal circumbinary distribution. These circumbinary
tori have approximately constant specific angular momentum due to momentum
transport by spiral shocks launched from the orbiting binary. We show that an
analytic model with these torus properties captures many of the main features
of the azimuthally-averaged profiles of our hydrodynamic simulations. Our
results, in particular the simple relationship between accretor mass and

by computing limits on the recoil mass that escapes the gravitational pull of
the target object following a single impact onto an atmosphere-less surface. By
considering vertical impacts only with the full-chain analytical prescription
from Kurosawa & Takada (2019), we provide lower bounds for the ejected mass for
basalt, granite, iron and water-rich target objects across the radii range

solar neighborhood stars and (iii) the isotope abundance ratios of different
radioactive $r$-process elements ($^{244}$Pu/$^{238}$U and
$^{247}$Cm/$^{238}$U) at the early solar system as compared to their formation.
Our results indicate that the Galactic $r$-process rate and the diffusion
coefficient are respectively $r<4\times 10^{-5}\mbox{ yr}^{-1}, D>0.1 \mbox{

sources) with allowed values satisfying an approximate anti-correlation such
that $D\approx r^{-2/3}$, implying that the time between two $r$-process events
that enrich the same location in the Galaxy, is $\tau_{\rm mix}\approx
100-200\mbox{ Myr}$. This suggests that a fraction of $\sim 0.8$ ($\sim 0.5$)
of the observed $^{247}$Cm ($^{244}$Pu) abundance is dominated by one
$r$-process event in the early solar system. Radioactively stable element
abundances are dominated by contributions from $\sim 10$ different events in
the early solar system. For metal poor stars (with [Fe/H]$\lesssim -2$), their
$r$-process abundances are dominated by either a single or several events,
depending on the star formation history.

energy and momentum can be transferred toward small scales. Additionally, in
the interstellar medium, random and noncircular motions arise from stellar
feedback, cloud-cloud interactions, and instabilities, among other processes.
Our aim is to comprehend to which extent small-scale gas dynamics is decoupled
from galactic rotation. We study the relative contributions of galactic
rotation and local noncircular motions to the circulation of gas, $\Gamma$, a
macroscopic measure of local rotation, defined as the line integral of the
velocity field around a closed path. We measure the circulation distribution as
a function of spatial scale in a set of simulated disk galaxies and we model
the velocity field as the sum of galactic rotation and a Gaussian random field.
The random field is parameterized by a broken power law in Fourier space, with
a break at the scale $\lambda_c$. We define the spatial scale $\lambda_{\rm
eq}$ at which galactic rotation and non-circular motions contribute equally to
$\Gamma$. For our simulated galaxies, the gas dynamics at the scale of
molecular clouds is usually dominated by noncircular motions, but in the center
of galactic disks galactic rotation is still relevant. Our model shows that the
transfer of rotation from large scales breaks at the scale $\lambda_c$ and this
transition is necessary to reproduce the circulation distribution. We find that
$\lambda_{\rm eq}$, and therefore the structure of the gas velocity field, is
set by the local conditions of gravitational stability and stellar feedback.

5.5\,\rm M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}$ at the solar radius when choosing a fixed pattern

with blueshifted and highly ionised Fe-K absorption features. AGN typically
have a UV bright accretion flow, so UV line driving is an obvious candidate for
launching these winds. However this mechanism requires material with UV
opacity, in apparent conflict with the observed high ionisation state of the
wind. In this paper we synthesise the X-ray energy spectra resulting from
different lines of sight through a state of the art radiation hydrodynamics UV
line driven disc wind simulation. We demonstrate that there are some lines of
sight which only intercept highly ionised and fast outflowing material. The
cooler material required for the UV line driving acceleration is out of the
line of sight, close to the disc, shielded from the X-rays by a failed wind. We
fit these simulated wind spectra to data from the archetypal UFO source PG
1211+143 and show that they broadly reproduce the depth and velocity of the
iron absorption lines seen. This directly demonstrates that UV line driving is
a viable mechanism to launch even the fastest UFOs. We simulate
microcalorimeter observations of this wind and show that their high energy
resolution can resolve the detailed structure in the wind and recover the wind
energetics when combined with models which correctly estimate the line
formation radius of the wind. New data from microcalorimeters will pave the way
for physical predictions of AGN wind feedback in cosmological simulations.

GaPAsN, and then calculate the optical response functions considering direct
transitions within the electric dipole approximation. Good agreement is
obtained for the dielectric function in comparison to available optical data
for dilute nitrides. To achieve this, the sp^3d^5s^* parameters for GaP and
GaAs are optimized for their optical properties in comparison to published
data, which are then used as the basis for the sp^3d^5s^*s_N parameters for
dilute-N GaPN and GaAsN. The calculated absorption between the valence band and
the newly formed lowest conduction band of the dilute nitrides increases as the
N fraction increases, in agreement with experiments, mainly due to the net
increase in their coupling in the entire Brillouin zone, supported by the
calculated momentum matrix element in the present work.

a network, an eigenvector is said to be localized when most of its components
take value near to zero, with a few components taking very high values. In this
article, we devise a methodology to construct a principal eigenvector (PEV)
localized network from a given input network. The methodology relies on adding
a small component having a wheel graph to the given input network. By extensive
numerical simulation and an analytical formulation based on the largest
eigenvalue of the input network, we compute the size of the wheel graph
required to localize the PEV of the combined network. Using the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model, we demonstrate the success of this
method for various models and real-world networks consider as input networks.
We show that on such PEV localized networks, the disease gets localized within
a small region of the network structure before the outbreaks. The study is

engineering topological phases in dissipative systems. Here, we propose a

exhibiting topologically protected edge states. Using exact diagonalization of
the linearized dynamics and numerical solutions of the non-linear equations of
motion, we find that a topological magnonic phase can be accessed by tuning the
spin current injected into the array. In the topologically nontrivial regime, a
single spin-torque oscillator on the edge of the array is driven into
auto-oscillation and emits a microwave signal, while the bulk oscillators
remain inactive. Our findings have practical utility for memory devices and
spintronics neural networks relying on spin-torque oscillators as constituent

acceptance. Aim: We modeled the probability that a PR will be accepted within a
month after creation using a Random Forest model utilizing 50 predictors
representing properties of the author, PR, and the project to which PR is
submitted. Method: 483,988 PRs from 4218 popular NPM packages were analysed and
we selected a subset of 14 predictors sufficient for a tuned Random Forest
model to reach high accuracy. Result: An AUC-ROC value of 0.95 was achieved
predicting PR acceptance. The model excluding PR properties that change after

there is a strong motivation to use ML technology in software-intensive
systems, including safety-critical systems. This raises the issue of safety
verification of MLbased systems, which is currently thought to be infeasible
or, at least, very hard. We think that it requires taking into account specific
properties of ML technology such as: (i) Most ML approaches are inductive,
which is both their power and their source of error. (ii) Neural networks (NN)
resulting from deep learning are at the current state of the art not
transparent. Consequently, there will always be errors remaining and, at least
for deep NNs (DNNs), verification of their internal structure is extremely
hard. In general, safety engineering cannot provide full guarantees that no
harm will ever occur. That is why probabilities are used, e.g., for specifying
a risk or a Tolerable Hazard Rate (THR). In this vision paper, we propose
verification based on probabilities of errors both estimated by controlled
experiments and output by the inductively learned classifier itself.
Generalization error bounds may propagate to the probabilities of a hazard,
which must not exceed a THR. As a result, the quantitatively determined bound
on the probability of a classification error of an ML component in a
safety-critical system contributes in a well-defined way to the latter's
overall safety verification.

excessive computational costs induced by many wave-equation solves. The fact
that the source function is unknown complicates this situation even further.
Motivated by recent results in stochastic optimization and transform-domain
sparsity-promotion, we demonstrate that the computational costs of inversion
can be reduced significantly while avoiding imaging artifacts and restoring
amplitudes. While powerful, these new approaches do require accurate
information on the source-time function, which is often lacking. Without this
information, the imaging quality deteriorates rapidly. We address this issue by
presenting an approach where the source-time function is estimated on the fly

negligible computational overhead, the proposed method is shown to perform well
on imaging problems with noisy data and problems that involve complex settings
such as salt. In either case, the presented method produces high resolution
high-amplitude fidelity images including an estimates for the source-time

these images at roughly one to two times the cost of conventional reverse time
migration involving all data.

from Gamow's liquid drop model for the atomic nucleus, involving the
competition of a perimeter term and repulsive nonlocal potentials. We consider
a large class of potentials, given by general radial nonnegative kernels which
are integrable on $\mathbb{R}^n$, such as Bessel potentials, and study the
behavior of the problem for large masses (i.e., volumes). Contrarily to the
small mass case, where the nonlocal term becomes negligible compared to the
perimeter, here the nonlocal term explodes compared to it. However, using the
integrability of those kernels, we rewrite the problem as the minimization of
the difference between the classical perimeter and a nonlocal perimeter, which
converges to a multiple of the classical perimeter as the mass goes to
infinity. Renormalizing to a fixed volume, we show that, if the first moment of
the kernels is smaller than an explicit threshold, the problem admits
minimizers of arbitrarily large mass, which contrasts with the usual case of
Riesz potentials. In addition, we prove that, any sequence of minimizers
converges to the ball as the mass goes to infinity. Finally, we study the
stability of the ball, and show that our threshold on the first moment of the
kernels is sharp in the sense that large balls go from stable to unstable. A
direct consequence of the instability of large balls above this threshold is
that there exist nontrivial compactly supported kernels for which the problems
admit minimizers which are not balls, that is, symmetry breaking occurs.

below the diffraction limit dictated by classical optics has recently been
shown possible using techniques that decompose the incoming radiation into
orthogonal transverse modes. Such a demultiplexing procedure, however, must be
perfectly calibrated to the transverse profile of the incoming light as any
misalignment of the modes effectively restores the diffraction limit for small
source separations. We study by how much can one mitigate such an effect at the
level of measurement which, after being imperfectly demultiplexed due to
inevitable misalignment, may still be partially corrected by linearly
transforming the relevant dominating transverse modes. We consider two
complementary tasks: the estimation of the separation between the two sources
and the discrimination between one and two incoherent point sources. We show
that, although one cannot fully restore super-resolving powers even when the
value of the misalignment is perfectly known its negative impact on the
ultimate sensitivity can be significantly reduced. In the case of estimation we
analytically determine the exact relation between the minimal resolvable
separation as a function of misalignment whereas for discrimination we
analytically determine the relation between misalignment and the probability of
error, as well as numerically determine how the latter scales in the limit of

protoplanetary discs. Apart from facilitating gas accretion on to the central
protostar, it must also impact on the process of planet formation: directly
through fragmentation, and indirectly through the turbulent concentration of
small solids. To understand the latter process, it is essential to determine
the dust dynamics in such a turbulent flow. For that purpose, we conduct a
series of 3D shearing box simulations of coupled gas and dust, including the
gas's self-gravity and scanning a range of Stokes numbers, from 0.001 to ~0.2.
First, we show that the vertical settling of dust in the midplane is
significantly impeded by gravitoturbulence, with the dust scale-height roughly
0.6 times the gas scale height for centimetre grains. This is a result of the
strong vertical diffusion issuing from (a) small-scale inertial-wave turbulence
feeding off the GI spiral waves and (b) the larger-scale vertical circulations
that naturally accompany the spirals. Second, we show that at R=50 AU
concentration events involving sub-metre particles and yielding order 1 dust to
gas ratios are rare and last for less than an orbit. Moreover, dust
concentration is less efficient in 3D than in 2D simulations. We conclude that
GI is not especially prone to the turbulent accumulation of dust grains.
Finally, the large dust scale-height measured in simulations could be, in the
future, compared with that of edge-on discs seen by ALMA, thus aiding detection
and characterisation of GI in real systems.

intermediate optical channel modes, we engineer a transmission path for the
quantum state transfer that is decoupled from the decaying fiber modes. Using

its sensitivity to the mechanical damping and noise as well as the strength of

A set

injects energy into inertial waves only. For moderate forcing amplitude, part
of the energy of the forced inertial waves is transferred to subharmonic waves,
through a standard triadic resonance instability. This first step is broadly in
line with the theory of weak turbulence. Surprisingly however, stronger forcing
does not lead to an inertial-wave turbulence regime. Instead, most of the
kinetic energy condenses into a vertically invariant geostrophic flow, even
though the latter is unforced. We show that resonant quartets of inertial waves
can trigger an instability -- the ``quartetic instability'' -- that leads to
such spontaneous emergence of geostrophy. In the present experiment, this

the general notion that database operators are memory-bandwidth bound, one
would expect the maximum gain to be roughly equal to the ratio of the memory

to understand when and why the performance gains of running queries on GPUs vs
on CPUs vary from the bandwidth ratio (which is roughly 16x on modern
hardware). We propose Crystal, a library of parallel routines that can be
combined together to run full SQL queries on a GPU with minimal materialization
overhead. We implement individual query operators to show that while the
speedups for selection, projection, and sorts are near the bandwidth ratio,
joins
  achieve less speedup due to differences in hardware capabilities.
Interestingly, we show on a popular analytical workload that full query
performance gain from running on GPU exceeds the bandwidth ratio despite
individual operators having speedup less than bandwidth ratio, as a result of
limitations of vectorizing chained operators on CPUs, resulting in a 25x
speedup for GPUs over CPUs on the benchmark.

the effects of the unknown parameters from a time series dataset. We assume
that the time series data set consists of an ensemble of trajectories for a
range of the parameters. The learning task is formulated as a statistical
inference problem by considering the unknown parameters as random variables. A
latent variable is introduced to model the effects of the unknown parameters,
and a variational inference method is employed to simultaneously train
probabilistic models for the time marching operator and an approximate
posterior distribution for the latent variable. Unlike the classical
variational inference, where a factorized distribution is used to approximate
the posterior, we employ a feedforward neural network supplemented by an
encoder recurrent neural network to develop a more flexible probabilistic

trajectory to identify the effects of the unknown parameters. The time marching
operator is approximated by a recurrent neural network, which takes a latent

various types of uncertainties in hybrid dynamical systems. In this paper, we
propose computational techniques for Bayesian estimation of GSHS. In
particular, the Fokker-Planck equation that describes the evolution of
uncertainty distributions along GSHS is solved by spectral techniques, where an
arbitrary form of probability density of the hybrid state is represented by a
mixture of Fourier series. The method is based on splitting the Fokker-Planck
equation represented by an integro-partial differential equation into the
partial differentiation part for continuous diffusion and the integral part for
discrete transition, and integrating the solution of each part. The propagated
density function is used with a likelihood function in the Bayes' formula to
estimate the hybrid state for given sensor measurements. The unique feature of
the proposed technique is that the probability density describing complete
stochastic properties of the hybrid state is constructed without relying on the
common Gaussian assumption, in contrast to other methods that compute certain
expected values such as mean or variance. We apply the proposed method to the
estimation of two examples: the bouncing ball model and the Dubins vehicle
model. We show that the proposed technique yields propagated densities
consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, more accurate estimates over the
Gaussian based approach and some computational benefits over a particle filter.

transformations that transfers knowledge from each previous small network to
the next larger network, thereby, reducing the overall training complexity. Our
experiments demonstrate that compared with training from scratch, cumulative
training yields ~2x reduction in computational complexity for training
TinyImageNet using VGG19 at iso-accuracy. Besides training efficiency, a key
advantage of our cumulative training strategy is that we can perform pruning
during Net2Net expansion to obtain a final network with optimal configuration
(~0.4x lower inference compute complexity) compared to conventional training
from scratch. We also demonstrate that the final network obtained from
cumulative training yields better generalization performance and noise
robustness. Further, we show that mutual inference from all the networks
created with cumulative Net2Net expansion enables improved adversarial input
detection.

generation of viscous boundary layers near walls, of typical thickness

twice the channel width $w$ to ensure a resonance condition, which implies the
use of MHz transducers. Recently though, intense acoustic streaming was
generated by acoustic waves of a few kHz (hence with $\lambda \gg w$), owing to
the presence of sharp-tipped structures of curvature radius at the tip $r_c$

to proactively understand the real-world cybersecurity threats posed to them.
This paper describes our initial efforts towards building a honeypot ecosystem
as a means to gathering and analyzing real attack data against IoT devices. A
primary condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers
believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. IoT devices
pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device
types and the physical-connectedness nature. We thus create a multiphased
approach in building a honeypot ecosystem, where researchers can gradually
increase a low-interaction honeypot's sophistication in emulating an IoT device
by observing real-world attackers' behaviors. We deployed honeypots both
on-premise and in the cloud, with associated analysis and vetting
infrastructures to ensure these honeypots cannot be easily identified as such
and appear to be real systems. In doing so we were able to attract increasingly
sophisticated attack data. We present the design of this honeypot ecosystem and
our observation on the attack data so far. Our data shows that real-world
attackers are explicitly going after IoT devices, and some captured activities
seem to involve direct human interaction (as opposed to scripted automatic
activities). We also build a low interaction honeypot for IoT cameras, called
Honeycamera, that present to attackers seemingly real videos. This is our first
step towards building a more comprehensive honeypot ecosystem that will allow
researchers to gain concrete understanding of what attackers are going after on
IoT devices, so as to more proactively protect them.

discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey.
ZTF18abvkwla has a number of features in common with the groundbreaking
transient AT2018cow: blue colors at peak ($g-r\approx-0.5$ mag), a short rise
time from half-max of under two days, a decay time to half-max of only three
days, a high optical luminosity ($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx-20.6$mag), a hot
($\gtrsim 40,000$K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio
counterpart. At late times ($\Delta t>80$d) the radio luminosity of
ZTF18abvkwla ($\nu L_\nu \gtrsim 10^{40}$erg/s at 10 GHz, observer-frame) is
most similar to that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy
is a dwarf starburst galaxy ($M\approx5\times10^{8}M_\odot$,
$\mathrm{SFR}\approx7 M_\odot$/yr) that is moderately metal-enriched
($\log\mathrm{[O/H]} \approx 8.5$), similar to the hosts of GRBs and
superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in
ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from
fast-moving ejecta ($\Gamma \beta c >0.38c$) and the optical from
shock-interaction with confined dense material ($<0.07M_\odot$ in $\sim
10^{15}$cm). Compiling transients in the literature with $t_\mathrm{rise} <5$d
and $M_\mathrm{peak}<-20$mag, we find that a significant number are
engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly
related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we
find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two to
three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss
strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope, and prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and
radio emission.

However, contrast agents are associated with complications at the injection
site as well as renal toxicity leading to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)
and renal failure. We hypothesised that the raw data acquired from a
non-contrast CT contains sufficient information to differentiate blood and
other soft tissue components. We utilised deep learning methods to define the
subtleties between soft tissue components in order to simulate contrast
enhanced CTAs without contrast agents. Twenty-six patients with paired
non-contrast and CTA images were randomly selected from an approved clinical
study. Non-contrast axial slices within the AAA from 10 patients (n = 100) were
sampled for the underlying Hounsfield unit (HU) distribution at the lumen,
intra-luminal thrombus and interface locations. Sampling of HUs in these
regions revealed significant differences between all regions (p<0.001 for all
comparisons), confirming the intrinsic differences in the radiomic signatures
between these regions. To generate a large training dataset, paired axial
slices from the training set (n=13) were augmented to produce a total of 23,551
2-D images. We trained a 2-D Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN)
for this non-contrast to contrast (NC2C) transformation task. The accuracy of
the cycleGAN output was assessed by comparison to the contrast image. This
pipeline is able to differentiate between visually incoherent soft tissue
regions in non-contrast CT images. The CTAs generated from the non-contrast
images bear strong resemblance to the ground truth. Here we describe a novel
application of Generative Adversarial Network for CT image processing. This is

belt object (486958) Arrokoth (provisionally designated 2014 MU69), possibly
the most primitive object ever explored by a spacecraft. The I/F of Arrokoth is
analyzed and fit with a photometric function that is a linear combination of
the Lommel-Seeliger (lunar) and Lambert photometric functions. Arrokoth has a
geometric albedo of p_V = 0.21_(-0.04)^(+0.05) at a wavelength of 550 nm and
~0.24 at 610 nm. Arrokoth's geometric albedo is greater than the median but
consistent with a distribution of cold classical Kuiper belt objects whose
geometric albedos were determined by fitting a thermal model to radiometric
observations. Thus, Arrokoth's geometric albedo adds to the orbital and
spectral evidence that it is a cold classical Kuiper belt object. Maps of the
normal reflectance and hemispherical albedo of Arrokoth are presented. The
normal reflectance of Arrokoth's surface varies with location, ranging from
~0.10-0.40 at 610 nm with an approximately Gaussian distribution. Both
Arrokoth's extrema dark and extrema bright surfaces are correlated to
topographic depressions. Arrokoth has a bilobate shape and the two lobes have
similar normal reflectance distributions: both are approximately Gaussian, peak
at ~0.25 at 610 nm, and range from ~0.10-0.40, which is consistent with
co-formation and co-evolution of the two lobes. The hemispherical albedo of
Arrokoth varies substantially with both incidence angle and location, the
average hemispherical albedo at 610 nm is 0.063 +/- 0.015. The Bond albedo of
Arrokoth at 610 nm is 0.062 +/- 0.015.

object by correlating measurements between received beams and reference beams,

Recently, by taking into account space-time duality in optics, computational
temporal ghost imaging has attracted attentions. Here, we propose a novel
Fourier temporal ghost imaging (FTGI) scheme to achieve single-shot
non-reproducible temporal signals. By sinusoidal coded modulation, ghost images
are obtained and recovered by applying Fourier transformation. For
demonstration, non-repeating events are detected with single-shot exposure
architecture. It's shown in results that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
of FTGI is significantly better (13dB increase) than traditional temporal ghost
imaging in the same condition. In addition, by using the obvious physical
meaning of Fourier spectrum, we show some potential applications of FTGI, such
as frequency division multiplexing demodulation in the visible light
communications.

personalisation algorithm have same pre-defined objective function. This was
previously ensured by providing the human with explicit feedback on what the
objective function is. However, constantly displaying this information to the
prosthesis user is impractical. Moreover, the method utilised task information
in the objective function which may not be available from the wearable sensors
typically used in prosthetic applications. In this work, the previous approach
is extended to use a prosthesis objective function based on implicit human
motor behaviour, which represents able-bodied human motor control and is
measureable using wearable sensors. The approach is tested in a hardware
implementation of the personalisation algorithm on a prosthetic elbow, where
the prosthetic objective function is a function of upper-body compensation, and
is measured using wearable IMUs. Experimental results on able-bodied subjects
using a supernumerary prosthetic elbow mounted on an elbow orthosis suggest
that it is possible to use a prosthesis objective function which is implicit in
human behaviour to achieve collaboration without providing explicit feedback to
the human, motivating further studies.

the factors that determine automatic decisions even more opaque than they
already are. And current strategies to eliminate opacity do not enhance
mind-readability. The last part of the paper discusses different ways to

adopt tolerable degrees of opacity that depend on pragmatic factors connected

that this method can be used for both homo- and hetero-phase interfaces and

inferring underlying brain pathology based on a patient's BAI.
  Methods 86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were
selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as being
within normal limits. BAI was calculated for each 12-hour segment of patient
data using a previously described algorithm, and night-to-night variability in
BAI was measured.
  Results The within-patient night-to-night standard deviation in BAI was 7.5
years. Estimates of BAI derived by averaging over 2, 3, and 4 nights had
standard deviations of 4.7, 3.7, and 3.0 years, respectively.
  Conclusions Averaging BAI over n nights reduces night-to-night variability of
BAI by a factor of the square root of n, rendering BAI more suitable as a
biomarker of brain health at the individual level.
  Significance With increasing ease of EEG acquisition including wearable
technology, BAI has the potential to track brain health and detect deviations
from normal physiologic function. In a clinical setting, BAI could be used to
identify patients who should undergo further investigation or monitoring.

efficiency resulting from sparse, event-driven computations. Many recent works
have demonstrated effective backpropagation for deep Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) by approximating gradients over discontinuous neuron spikes or firing
events. A beneficial side-effect of these surrogate gradient spiking
backpropagation algorithms is that the spikes, which trigger additional
computations, may now themselves be directly considered in the gradient
calculations. We propose an explicit inclusion of spike counts in the loss
function, along with a traditional error loss, causing the backpropagation
learning algorithms to optimize weight parameters for both accuracy and spiking
sparsity. As supported by existing theory of over-parameterized neural
networks, there are many solution states with effectively equivalent accuracy.
As such, appropriate weighting of the two loss goals during training in this
multi-objective optimization process can yield an improvement in spiking
sparsity without a significant loss of accuracy. We additionally explore a
simulated annealing-inspired loss weighting technique to increase the weighting
for sparsity as training time increases. Our preliminary results on the
Cifar-10 dataset show up to 70.1% reduction in spiking activity with
iso-accuracy compared to an equivalent SNN trained only for accuracy and up to
73.3% reduction in spiking activity if allowed a trade-off of 1% reduction in

confine ourselves to the case of a quadrupole distortion which can be caused
for example by the accreting matter flow in the vicinity of the compact object.
For the purpose we examine the linear stability of the circular geodesic orbits
in the equatorial plane and derive analytical expressions for the radial and
vertical epicyclic frequencies. We investigate their properties in comparison
with the isolated Schwarzschild black hole. Due to the influence of the
external matter the vertical epicyclic frequency is not always positive
anymore, and the stability of the circular orbits is determined by the
interplay between both of the frequencies. As a result, the stable circular
orbits do not extend to infinity, but are confined to a finite annular region
between an inner and an outer marginally stable orbit. In addition, the
degeneracy between the vertical epicyclic and the orbital frequency, which is
characteristic for the Schwarzschild solution, is broken, and there are regions
in the parametric space where the radial epicyclic frequency is larger than the
vertical one. All these properties allow for much more diverse types of
non-linear resonances to be excited than for the isolated Schwarzschild black
hole, which can provide an explanation for the observed 3:2 ratio between the
twin-peak frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations from the accretion
disk.

when a sharp density jump exists in the stellar interior and are a potential
fingerprint to infer the existence of quark matter cores in compact objects.
When a hybrid star is perturbed, conversion reactions may occur at the
quark-hadron interface and may have a key role in global stellar properties
such as the dynamic stability and the quasi-normal mode spectrum. In this work
we study the role of the conversion rate at the interface. To this end, we
first derive the junction conditions that hold at the sharp interface of a
non-radially perturbed hybrid star in the case of slow and rapid conversions.
Then, we analyse the discontinuity $g$-mode in both cases. For rapid
conversions, the discontinuity $g$-mode has zero frequency because a displaced
fluid element near the phase splitting surface adjusts almost immediately its
composition to its surroundings and gravity cannot provide a buoyancy force.
For slow conversions, a $g$-mode exists and its properties are analysed here
using modern hadronic and quark equations of state. Moreover, it has been shown
recently that in the case of slow conversions an extended branch of stable
hybrid configurations arises for which $\partial M/ \partial \epsilon_c <0$. We
show that $g$-modes of the standard branch (that is, the one with $\partial M/
\partial \epsilon_c > 0$) have frequencies and damping times in agreement with
previous results in the literature. However, $g$-modes of the extended branch
have significantly larger frequencies (in the range $1-2 \, \mathrm{kHz}$) and
much shorter damping times (few seconds in some cases). We discuss the
detectability of $g$-mode GWs with present and planned GW observatories.

them dynamically change their port numbers, Machine Learning (ML) and
especially Deep Learning (DL)-based classifiers have shown impressive
performance in network traffic classification. In this paper, we evaluate the
robustness of DL-based network traffic classifiers against Adversarial Network
Traffic (ANT). ANT causes DL-based network traffic classifiers to predict
incorrectly using Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) generating methods.
Since there is no need to buffer network traffic before sending ANT, it is
generated live. We partition the input space of the DL-based network traffic
classification into three categories: packet classification, flow content
classification, and flow time series classification. To generate ANT, we
propose three new attacks injecting UAP into network traffic. AdvPad attack
injects a UAP into the content of packets to evaluate the robustness of packet
classifiers. AdvPay attack injects a UAP into the payload of a dummy packet to
evaluate the robustness of flow content classifiers. AdvBurst attack injects a
specific number of dummy packets with crafted statistical features based on a
UAP into a selected burst of a flow to evaluate the robustness of flow time

understand the biological and artificial neural networks in which they're
embedded. Class selectivity-typically defined as how different a neuron's
responses are across different classes of stimuli or data samples-is commonly
used for this purpose. However, it remains an open question whether it is
necessary and/or sufficient for deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn class
selectivity in individual units. We investigated the causal impact of class
selectivity on network function by directly regularizing for or against class
selectivity. Using this regularizer to reduce class selectivity across units in
convolutional neural networks increased test accuracy by over 2% for ResNet18
trained on Tiny ImageNet. For ResNet20 trained on CIFAR10 we could reduce class
selectivity by a factor of 2.5 with no impact on test accuracy, and reduce it
nearly to zero with only a small ($\sim$2%) drop in test accuracy. In contrast,
regularizing to increase class selectivity significantly decreased test
accuracy across all models and datasets. These results indicate that class

thermodynamics within a quantum linear oscillator externally driven over the
period of time t = tau. To go beyond the standard approach (the two-point
projective measurement one) to this subject and also render it discussed in
both quantum and classical domains on the single footing, we recast this
standard approach in terms of the Wigner function and its propagator in the
phase space (x,p). With the help of the canonical transformation from (x,p) to
the angle-action coordinates (\phi,I), we can then derive a measurement-free
(classical-like) form of the Crooks fluctuation relation in the Wigner
representation. This enables us to introduce the work W_{I_0,I_{tau}}
associated with a single run from (I_0) to (I_{tau}) over the period tau, which
is a quantum generalization of the thermodynamic work with its roots in the
classical thermodynamics. This quantum work differs from the energy difference
e_{I_0,I_{tau}} = e(I_{tau}) - e(I_0) unless beta, hbar --> 0. Consequently, we
will obtain the quantum second-law inequality Delta F_{beta} \leq <W>_{P} \leq
<e>_{P} = Delta U, where P, Delta F_{beta}, and <W>_P denote the work
(quasi)-probability distribution, the free energy difference, and the average
work distinguished from the internal energy difference Delta U, respectively,
while <W>_P --> Delta U in the limit of beta, hbar --> 0 only. Therefore, we
can also introduce the quantum heat Q_q = Delta U - W even for a thermally
isolated system, resulting from the quantum fluctuation therein. This is a more
fine-grained result than <W>_P = Delta U obtained from the standard approach.
Owing to the measurement-free nature of the thermodynamic work W_{I_0,I_{tau}},
our result can also apply to the (non-thermal) initial states rho_0 = (1-gamma)
rho_{beta} + gamma sigma with sigma \ne rho_{beta}.

suitably defined infinite dimensional symplectic space. This has the advantage
that methods from the field of spectral analysis can be used to characterize
globally optimal control laws. A numerical method for constructing optimal
feedback laws for nonlinear systems is then obtained by computing the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the
Pontryagin-Koopman operator onto a finite dimensional space. We illustrate the
effectiveness of this approach by computing accurate approximations of the

that, on the one hand, in the coinfection process, randomization of the

the other hand, these correlations don't have a consistent effect on the
independent infection dynamics, and can either decrease or increase this mean.
While randomization of the daily pattern correlations has no significant effect
on the size of outbreak in either of the coinfection or independent spreading
cases. We also observer that an increase in the mean outbreak size doesn't
always coincide with an increase in the outbreak probability; therefore we
argue that merely considering the mean outbreak size of all realizations may
lead us into misestimating the outbreak risks. Our results suggest that some

annotated data. Electronic health record systems are ubiquitous and the

particular in the form of free text. Identification of medical concepts and
information extraction is a challenging task, yet important ingredient for
parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated format for downstream
analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity recognition model
for clinical natural language processing. The model is trained to recognise
seven categories: drug names, route, frequency, dosage, strength, form,
duration. The model was first self-supervisedly pre-trained by predicting the
next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text patients' records from
MIMIC-III corpora and then fine-tuned on the named-entity recognition task. The
model achieved a lenient (strict) micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 (0.893)
across all seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of
the developed model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to
secondary care mental health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of
the trained NER model to CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1=0.762,
however after fine-tuning on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a
reasonable performance of F1=0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close
similarity between the data sets and the NER tasks, it is essential to
fine-tune on the target domain data in order to achieve more accurate results.

(a) with photons in the same average (temporal) profile on a spatial
interferometer and photodetection incapable of (or with strongly imprecise)
time resolution and (b) with photons in generally different average temporal
profiles on the same spatial interferometer and photodetection with precise

single photons with Gaussian distribution of photon arrival time.
Distinguishability of photons in the two setups is found to be strikingly

upshot of our results is that distinguishability due to mixed states is an

Determining the molecular features of proteins that encode LLPS will provide
critical insights into a plethora of biological processes. Problematically,
probing biomolecular dense phases directly is often technologically difficult
or impossible. By capitalizing on the symmetry between the conformational
behavior of biomolecules in dilute solution and dense phases, it is possible to
infer details critical to phase separation by precise measurements of the
dilute phase thus circumventing complicated characterization of dense phases.
The symmetry between dilute and dense phases is found in the size and shape of
the conformational ensemble of a biomolecule - parameters that small-angle
x-ray scattering (SAXS) is ideally suited to probe. Recent technological
advances have made it possible to accurately characterize samples of
intrinsically disordered protein regions at low enough concentration to avoid
interference from intermolecular attraction, oligomerization or aggregation,

This type of manipulated images and video have been coined Deepfakes. In order
to prevent a malicious user from generating modified images of a person without

architectures are generative models conditioned on an attribute (e.g. put a

(1) class transferable adversarial attacks that generalize to different

with such planar arrays can benefit from NOMA in scenarios where the UEs are
spatially close to each other. A two-step UE grouping scheme is proposed for
NOMA-aided mMIMO systems that is applicable to the spatial correlation matrices
of the UEs that are currently active in each cell. Numerical results are used
to investigate the performance of the algorithm under different operating
conditions and types of spreading signatures (orthogonal, sparse and random
sets). The analysis reveals that orthogonal signatures provide the highest
average spectral efficiency.

data's continued conformance to the applications' initial design. When data

profiling techniques such as functional dependencies and denial constraints
encode patterns in the data that can be used to detect deviations. But
traditional methods typically focus on exact constraints and categorical
attributes, and are ill-suited for tasks such as determining whether the
prediction of a machine learning system can be trusted or for quantifying data
drift. In this paper, we introduce data invariants, a new data-profiling
primitive that models arithmetic relationships involving multiple numerical
attributes within a (noisy) dataset and which complements the existing
data-profiling techniques. We propose a quantitative semantics to measure the
degree of violation of a data invariant, and establish that strong data
invariants can be constructed from observations with low variance on the given
dataset. A concrete instance of this principle gives the surprising result that
low-variance components of a principal component analysis (PCA), which are
usually discarded, generate better invariants than the high-variance
components. We demonstrate the value of data invariants on two applications:
trusted machine learning and data drift. We empirically show that data
invariants can (1) reliably detect tuples on which the prediction of a
machine-learned model should not be trusted, and (2) quantify data drift more
accurately than the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show four case

Since it is difficult for non-expert clinicians to find stenosed parts, the
intestine and its stenosed parts should be visualized intuitively. Furthermore,
the intestine regions of ileus cases are quite hard to be segmented. The
proposed method segments intestine regions by 3D FCN (3D U-Net). Intestine
regions are quite difficult to be segmented in ileus cases since the inside the
intestine is filled with fluids. These fluids have similar intensities with
intestinal wall on 3D CT volumes. We segment the intestine regions by using 3D
U-Net trained by a weak annotation approach. Weak-annotation makes possible to
train the 3D U-Net with small manually-traced label images of the intestine.
This avoids us to prepare many annotation labels of the intestine that has long

on the distance from its endpoint in volume rendering. Stenosed parts (disjoint
points of an intestine segment) can be easily identified on such visualization.
In the experiments, we showed that stenosed parts were intuitively visualized

in trapped-ion experiments. By proposing to communicate quantum information by
moving the ions through space to interact with other distant ions, the

mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are NP-hard and can
be widely found in the area of wireless resource allocation. The main idea of
GBD is decomposing an MINLP problem into a primal problem and a master problem,
which are iteratively solved until their solutions converge. However, a direct
implementation of GBD is time- and memory-consuming. The main bottleneck is the
high complexity of the master problem, which increases over the iterations.
Therefore, we propose to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to
accelerate GBD aiming at decreasing the complexity of the master problem.
Specifically, we utilize two different ML techniques, classification and
regression, to deal with this acceleration task. In this way, a cut classifier
and a cut regressor are learned, respectively, to distinguish between useful
and useless cuts. Only useful cuts are added to the master problem and thus the
complexity of the master problem is reduced. By using a resource allocation
problem in device-to-device communication networks as an example, we validate
that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity of GBD without
loss of optimality and has strong generalization ability. The proposed method
is applicable for solving various MINLP problems in wireless networks since the
designs are invariant for different problems.

signal-to-noise ratio, extracting robust features and improving accuracy is
still challenging. In this context, we propose a novel two-way few shot network
that is able to efficiently learn how to learn representative features of
unseen subject categories and how to classify them with limited MI EEG data.
The pipeline includes an embedding module that learns feature representations
from a set of samples, an attention mechanism for key signal feature discovery,
and a relation module for final classification based on relation scores between
a support set and a query signal. In addition to the unified learning of
feature similarity and a few shot classifier, our method leads to emphasize
informative features in support data relevant to the query data, which
generalizes better on unseen subjects. For evaluation, we used the BCI
competition IV 2b dataset and achieved an 9.3% accuracy improvement in the
20-shot classification task with state-of-the-art performance. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing attention and the overall
generality of our method.

higher order potentials, including pixel-level and patch-level potentials, and
graph-based post-processing is applied to further improve its segmentation
performance. Especially, a CNN is trained to build up the pixel-level
potentials and another three CNNs are fine-tuned to build up the patch-level
potentials for sufficient spatial segmentation information. In the experiment,
a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained gastric histopathological dataset with
560 abnormal images are divided into training, validation and test sets with a
ratio of 1 : 1 : 2. Finally, segmentation accuracy, recall and specificity of

guarantee safety under new scenarios. This paper presents a safe RL algorithm,
called Parallel Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO), for two autonomous
driving tasks. PCPO extends today's common actor-critic architecture to a
three-component learning framework, in which three neural networks are used to
approximate the policy function, value function and a newly added risk
function, respectively. Meanwhile, a trust region constraint is added to allow
large update steps without breaking the monotonic improvement condition. To
ensure the feasibility of safety constrained problems, synchronized parallel
learners are employed to explore different state spaces, which accelerates
learning and policy-update. The simulations of two scenarios for autonomous
vehicles confirm we can ensure safety while achieving fast learning.

latency massive access in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In grant-free
NOMA, pilot signals are often used for user activity detection (UAD) and
channel estimation (CE) prior to multiuser detection (MUD) of active users.
However, the pilot overhead makes the communications inefficient for IoT
devices with sporadic transmissions and short data packets, or when the channel
coherence time is short. Hence, it is desirable to improve the efficiency by
avoiding the use of pilot signals, which can also further achieve lower
latency. This work focuses on Bayesian receiver design for grant-free low
density signature orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (LDS-OFDM), where
each user is allocated a unique low density spreading sequence. We propose to
use the low density spreading sequences for active user detection, thereby
avoiding the use of pilot signals. Firstly, the task of joint UAD, CE and MUD
is formulated as a structured signal estimation problem. Then message passing
based Bayesian approach is developed to solve the structured signal estimation
problem. In particular, belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP)
and mean field (MF) message passing are used to develop efficient hybrid
message passing algorithms to achieve trade-off between performance and
complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

for emerging photonic and optoelectronic applications, this class of materials
is also a rich platform to highlight the interplay between kinetics and
thermodynamic driving forces during growth of strained, nonequilibrium alloys.
Indeed, these alloys are inherently strained and supersaturated in Sn and thus
can suffer instabilities that are still to be fully elucidated. In this vein,
in this work the atomic-scale microstructure of Ge0.82Sn0.18 is investigated at
the onset of phase separation as the epitaxial growth aborts. In addition to
the expected accumulation of Sn on the surface leading to Sn-rich droplets and
sub-surface regions with the anticipated equilibrium Sn composition of 1.0at.%,
the diffusion of Sn atoms also yields conspicuous Sn-decorated filaments with
nonuniform Sn content in the range of ~1 to 11at.% . The latter are attributed
to the formation and propagation of dislocations, facilitating the Sn transport
toward the surface through pipe diffusion. Furthermore, the interface between
the Sn droplet and GeSn shows a distinct, defective layer with Sn content of
~22at.%. This layer is likely formed by the expelled excess equilibrium Ge as
the Sn solidifies, and its content seems to be a consequence of strain
minimization between tetragonal Sn-rich and cubic Ge-rich equilibrium phases.
The elucidation of these phenomena is crucial to understand the stability of
GeSn semiconductors and control their epitaxial growth at a uniform
composition.

We identify Higgs signal strength measurements and the decay $B_s \to \mu\mu$

suitable to study the evolutionary relationship between novel coronavirus
mutants transmitted among humans. The emergences of 14 kinds of main mutants
are studied and these strains can be classified as eight bifurcations of the

namely, the mutation among sub-branches of the same branch, the off-root
mutation and the root-oriented mutation between large branches of the tree.
From the point of the relation between viral mutation and host selection we
found that individuals with low immunity provide a special environment for the
positive natural selection of virus evolution. It gives a mechanism to explain
why large mutations between two distant branches generally occur in the nCov-19

superradiant quantum phase transition (QPT) even in the presence of strong
$\mathbf{A}^2$ terms, preventing single-site superradiance. In the two-site
model the effect of $\mathbf{A}^2$ terms can be surmounted by the photon
delocalization from hopping, and a reversed superradiant QPT occurs as a
consequence of the competition between $\mathbf{A}^2$ terms and the hopping
interaction. We characterize the phase diagram and scaling functions, and
extract the critical exponents in the vicinity of the critical point, thus
establishing the universal behavior of the second-order phase transition.
Remarkably the effective hopping strength will be enhanced if more cavities are
cascaded. We also prove that the multi-qubit counterpart of the quantum Rabi

the classic result for Markov Decision Processes stating that, for a given

policy, which can be defined in a natural way, such that at each time instance
the marginal distributions of state-action pairs for these two policies
coincide. It is shown in this paper that this equality takes place for a CTJMDP

If this Markov process is explosive, then at each time instance the marginal

same probability for the original policy. These results are used in this paper

Approaches based on resources from Wikipedia have proven successful in the

transfer learning methods have been shown to reduce the demand for resources in
the LRL by utilizing resources in closely-related languages, but the
performance still lags far behind their high-resource counterparts. In this
paper, we first assess the problems faced by current entity candidate

(1) reduce the disconnect between entity mentions and KB entries, and (2)
improve the robustness of the model to low-resource scenarios. The methods are
simple, but effective: we experiment with our approach on seven XEL datasets

low-energy subspace, which require complicated downfolded interactions which
are often approximated, we describe a full cell $GW$+DMFT approach, where the
impurities comprise all atoms in a unit cell or supercell of the crystal. Our
formulation results in large impurity problems, which we treat here with
efficient quantum chemistry impurity solvers that work on the real-frequency
axis, combined with a one-shot $G_0W_0$ treatment of long-range interactions.
We apply our full cell approach to bulk Si, two antiferromagnetic correlated
insulators NiO and $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, and the paramagnetic correlated metal
SrMoO$_3$, with impurities containing up to 10 atoms and 124 orbitals. We find
that spectral properties, magnetic moments, and two-particle spin correlation

metal oxide insulators, the balanced treatment of correlations involving all
orbitals in the cell leads to new insights into the orbital character around
the insulating gap.

and social interest to various applications including urban planning, marketing
and intelligence. Existing work on trajectory clustering often relies on
similarity measurements that utilize raw spatial and/or temporal information of
trajectories. These measures are incapable of identifying similar moving
behaviors that exhibit varying spatio-temporal scales of movement. In addition,
the expense of labeling massive trajectory data is a barrier to supervised
learning models. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised neural
approach for mobility behavior clustering, called the Deep Embedded TrajEctory
ClusTering network (DETECT). DETECT operates in three parts: first it
transforms the trajectories by summarizing their critical parts and augmenting
them with context derived from their geographical locality (e.g., using POIs
from gazetteers). In the second part, it learns a powerful representation of
trajectories in the latent space of behaviors, thus enabling a clustering
function (such as $k$-means) to be applied. Finally, a clustering oriented loss
is directly built on the embedded features to jointly perform feature
refinement and cluster assignment, thus improving separability between mobility
behaviors. Exhaustive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for mobility
behavior analyses.

then to compare the model coefficients. We study the behaviour of both distance
measures and the RST parametric model. The theoretical behaviour of the
distance measures is difficult to be developed, and therefore we study their
behaviour numerically. We conclude that the RST model has an advantage over the
Bottleneck and the Wasserstein distances in sense that it can give a definite
conclusion regarding the similarity between two persistence diagrams. More of
that, a great advantage of the RST is its ability to distinguish between two
data sets that are geometrically different but topologically are the same,

noticeably small for all the model output variables, and thus the uncertainty

errors between the target view and the synthesized views from its adjacent
source views as the loss. Despite significant progress, the learning still
suffers from occlusion and scene dynamics. This paper shows that carefully
manipulating photometric errors can tackle these difficulties better. The
primary improvement is achieved by a statistical technique that can mask out
the invisible or nonstationary pixels in the photometric error map and thus
prevents misleading the networks. With this outlier masking approach, the depth
of objects moving in the opposite direction to the camera can be estimated more
accurately. To the best of our knowledge, such scenarios have not been
seriously considered in the previous works, even though they pose a higher risk
in applications like autonomous driving. We also propose an efficient weighted
multi-scale scheme to reduce the artifacts in the predicted depth maps.
Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches. The overall system achieves state-of-theart performance on
both depth and ego-motion estimation.

critical gravity force increases with the increase of the transfer speed (i.e.,
moving solitons are more robust than quiescent ones). Nonstationary regimes are
addressed too, by considering abrupt application of gravity to solitons created
in the weightless setting. In that case, solitons feature damped shuttle
motion, provided that the gravity force does not exceed a dynamical critical
value, which is smaller than its static counterpart. The results may help to
design gravimeters based on ultracold atoms.

computer vision tasks such as image classification, detection, and

has highlighted the importance of learning by progressively increasing the
difficulty of a learning task [26]. When learning a network from scratch, the
information propagated within the network during the earlier stages of training
can contain distortion artifacts due to noise which can be detrimental to
training. In this paper, we propose an elegant curriculum based scheme that
smoothes the feature embedding of a CNN using anti-aliasing or low-pass

of high frequency information propagated within the CNNs as training
progresses, by convolving the output of a CNN feature map of each layer with a
Gaussian kernel. By decreasing the variance of the Gaussian kernel, we
gradually increase the amount of high-frequency information available within
the network for inference. As the amount of information in the feature maps
increases during training, the network is able to progressively learn better
representations of the data. Our proposed augmented training scheme
significantly improves the performance of CNNs on various vision tasks without
either adding additional trainable parameters or an auxiliary regularization

performance gains in CNN architectures across four different tasks: transfer

application in electrochemical energy storage: (1) rigid hollow cavities of the
CNT provide upper limits for nanoparticles in their inner cavities which are
both separated from the fillings of other CNT and protected against
degradation. In particular, the CNT shells resist strong volume changes of
encapsulates in response to electrochemical cycling, which in conventional
conversion and alloying materials hinders application in energy storage
devices. (2) Carbon mantles ensure electrical contact to the active material as
they are unaffected by potential cracks of the encapsulate and form a stable
conductive network in the electrode compound. Our studies confirm that
encapsulates are electrochemically active and can achieve full theoretical
reversible capacity. The results imply that encapsulating nanostructures inside

(VLBA) observations of 124 compact radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
that were conducted between 2014 November and 2016 May. The typical dimensions
of the restoring beam in each image are about 0.5 mas $\times$ 0.2 mas. The
highest resolution of 0.2 mas corresponds to a physical size of 0.02 pc for the
lowest redshift source in the sample. The 43-GHz very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) images of 97 AGNs are presented for the first time. We
study the source compactness on milli-arcsec (mas) and sub-mas scales, and
suggest that 95 sources in our sample are suitable for future space VLBI
observations. By analyzing our data supplemented with other VLBA AGN surveys
from literature, we find that the core brightness temperature increases with
increasing frequency below a break frequency ~ 7 GHz, and decreases between
~7--240~GHz but increases again above~240 GHz in the rest frame of the sources.
This indicates that the synchrotron opacity changes from optically thick to
thin. We also find a strong statistical correlation between radio and
$\gamma$-ray flux densities. Our correlation is tighter than those in
literature derived from lower-frequency VLBI data, suggesting that the
$\gamma$-ray emission is produced more co-spatially with the 43-GHz VLBA core
emission. This correlation can also be extrapolated to the un-beamed AGN
population, implying that a universal $\gamma$-ray production mechanism might
be at work for all types of AGNs.

coherent coupling of an optically excited two particle pump state to a signal

optical amplification as well as for the generation of correlated photons. OPOs
require states with well-defined symmetries and energies: the fine-tuning of
material properties and structural dimensions to create these states remains a
challenge for the realization of scalable OPO-based functionalities in
semiconductor nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate a pathway towards this goal
based on the control of confined microcavity exciton-polaritons modulated by
the spatially and time varying dynamical potentials produced by a surface
acoustic waves (SAW). The exciton-polariton are confined in um-sized
intra-cavity traps fabricated by structuring a planar semiconductor microcavity
during the epitaxial growth process. OPOs in these structures benefit from the
enhanced non-linearities of confined systems. We show that SAW fields induce
state-dependent and time-varying energy shifts, which enable the energy
alignment of the confined levels with the appropriate symmetry for OPO
triggering. Furthermore, the dynamic acoustic tuning, which is fully described
by a theoretical model for the modulation of the confined polaritons by the
acoustic field, compensates for fluctuations in symmetry and dimensions of the
confinement potential thus enabling a variety of dynamic OPO regimes. The
robustness of the acoustic tuning is demonstrated by the synchronous excitation
of an array of confined OPOs using a single acoustic beam, thus opening the way
for the realization of scalable non-linear on-chip systems.

copies to all its compatible servers, and departs as soon as one of its copies
completes service. As a benchmark comparison, we take the non-redundant system
in which a job arrival is routed to only one randomly selected compatible
server. Service times are generally distributed and all copies of a job are
identical, i.e., have the same service requirement. In our first main result,
we characterize the sufficient and necessary stability conditions of the
redundancy system. This condition coincides with that of a system where each
job type only dispatches copies into its least-loaded servers, and those copies
need to be fully served. In our second result, we compare the stability regions
of the system under redundancy to that of no redundancy. We show that if the
server's capacities are sufficiently heterogeneous, the stability region under
redundancy can be much larger than that without redundancy. We apply the
general solution to particular classes of systems, including redundancy-d and
nested models, to derive simple conditions on the degree of heterogeneity
required for redundancy to improve the stability. As such, our result is the
first in showing that redundancy can improve the stability and hence
performance of a system when copies are non-i.i.d..

computer vision. Sperm-cell detection in a densely populated bull semen
microscopic observation video presents challenges such as partial occlusion,
vast number of objects in a single video frame, tiny size of the object,
artifacts, low contrast, and blurry objects because of the rapid movement of
the sperm cells. This study proposes an architecture, called DeepSperm, that
solves the aforementioned challenges and is more accurate and faster than
state-of-the-art architectures. Methods: In the proposed architecture, we use
only one detection layer, which is specific for small object detection. For
handling overfitting and increasing accuracy, we set a higher network
resolution, use a dropout layer, and perform data augmentation on hue,
saturation, and exposure. Several hyper-parameters are tuned to achieve better
performance. We compare our proposed method with those of a conventional image
processing-based object-detection method, you only look once (YOLOv3), and mask
region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN). Results: In our
experiment, we achieve 86.91 mAP on the test dataset and a processing speed of
50.3 fps. In comparison with YOLOv3, we achieve an increase of 16.66 mAP point,
3.26 x faster on testing, and 1.4 x faster on training with a small training
dataset, which contains 40 video frames. The weights file size was also reduced
significantly, with 16.94 x smaller than that of YOLOv3. Moreover, it requires
1.3 x less graphical processing unit (GPU) memory than YOLOv3. Conclusions:
This study proposes DeepSperm, which is a simple, effective, and efficient
architecture with its hyper-parameters and configuration to detect bull sperm
cells robustly in real time. In our experiment, we surpass the state of the art
in terms of accuracy, speed, and resource needs.

of the accretion disc, the high-ionization emission lines present large
broadening as well as noticeable blueshifts, which increase with the ionizing

ionized outflows. Line broadening and blueshift appear correlated. We applied
scaling relationships to estimate the mass of the supermassive black hole from

applications of future wireless communication networks. However, the Doppler
effect caused by the vehicle mobility may seriously deteriorate the performance
of the vehicular communication links, especially when the channels exhibit a
large number of Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs). Orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS) is a new waveform designed in the delay-Doppler domain, and can
effectively convert a doubly dispersive channel into an almost non-fading
channel, which makes it very attractive for V2X communications. In this paper,
we design a novel OTFS based receiver with multi-antennas to deal with the
high-mobility challenges in V2X systems. We show that the multiple DFOs
associated with multipaths can be separated with the high-spatial resolution
provided by multi-antennas, which leads to an enhanced sparsity of the OTFS
channel in the delay-Doppler domain and bears a potential to reduce the
complexity of the message passing (MP) detection algorithm. Based on this
observation, we further propose a joint MP-maximum ration combining (MRC)
iterative detection for OTFS, where the integration of MRC significantly
improves the convergence performance of the iteration and gains an excellent
system error performance. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results to
corroborate the superiorities of the proposed scheme.

$\mathcal{D}$ with coproducts is AB5 or a Grothendieck category. If
$\mathcal{D}$ satisfies Brown representability, a t-structure has an AB5 heart
with an injective cogenerator and coproduct-preserving associated homological
functor if, and only if, the coaisle has a pure-injective t-cogenerating
object. If $\mathcal{D}$ is standard well generated, such a heart is
automatically a Grothendieck category. For compactly generated t-structures (in
any ambient triangulated category with coproducts), we prove that the heart is
a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category.
  We use functor categories and the proofs rely on two main ingredients.
Firstly, we express the heart of any t-structure in any triangulated category
as a Serre quotient of the category of finitely presented additive functors for
suitable choices of subcategories of the aisle or the co-aisle that we,
respectively, call t-generating or t-cogenerating subcategories. Secondly, we
study coproduct-preserving homological functors from $\mathcal{D}$ to complete
AB5 abelian categories with injective cogenerators and classify them, up to a
so-called computational equivalence, in terms of pure-injective objects in
$\mathcal{D}$. This allows us to show that any standard well generated
triangulated category $\mathcal{D}$ possesses a universal such
coproduct-preserving homological functor, to develop a purity theory and to
prove that pure-injective objects always cogenerate t-structures in such
triangulated categories.

$\partial_t f=\mathrm{div}_{x}{(D \nabla_x f+Cxf)}$. With a coordinate
transformation these equations can be normalized such that the diffusion and
drift matrices are linked as $D=C_S$, the symmetric part of $C$. The main
result of this paper (Theorem 3.4) is the connection between normalized
Fokker-Planck equations and their drift-ODE $\dot x=-Cx$: Their
$L^2$-propagator norms actually coincide. This implies that optimal decay
estimates on the drift-ODE (w.r.t. both the maximum exponential decay rate and
the minimum multiplicative constant) carry over to sharp exponential decay
estimates of the Fokker-Planck solution towards the steady state. A second
application of the theorem regards the short time behaviour of the solution:
The short time regularization (in some weighted Sobolev space) is determined by
its hypocoercivity index, which has recently been introduced for Fokker-Planck
equations and ODEs (see [5, 1, 2]). In the proof we realize that the evolution
in each invariant spectral subspace can be represented as an explicitly given,
tensored version of the corresponding drift-ODE. In fact, the Fokker-Planck

computation, including event- and time-driven neural dynamics, neural activity,

nondeterministic computation time caused by the neural activity volleys
encountered during cerebellar simulation. This nondeterministic computation
time motivates the integration of an RT supervisor module that is able to
ensure a well-orchestrated neural computation time and robot operation.
Actually, our neurorobotic experimental setup (VOR) benefits from the
biological sensory motor delay between the cerebellum and the body to buffer
the computational overloads as well as providing flexibility in adjusting the
neural computation time and RT operation. The RT supervisor module provides for
incremental countermeasures that dynamically slow down or speed up the

neural computation features (i.e., STDP mechanisms, spike propagation, and
neural updates) to cope with the RT constraints imposed by the real robot

elucidate the manner in which the combination of the cerebellar neural

(discrepancy) between two data fields or ''divergence functions'' with the aim
of applications to linear inverse problems. Most of the divergences found in
the litterature are used in the field of information theory to quantify the
difference between two probability density functions, that is between positive
data whose sum is equal to one. In such context, they take a simplified form
that is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields
are non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic
way, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to
inverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build
such divergences, and propose some generalizations. The resolution of inverse
problems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between
physical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the
context image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints
that must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if
necessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account
in a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant
or affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the
model parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the
general properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting
characteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to
obtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the
divergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness
regularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of
Tikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the
divergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution
components. These methods are founded on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions that
must be fulfilled at the optimum. The Tikhonov regularization is considered in
these methods.Chapter 11 associated with Appendix 9 deal with the application
to the NMF, while Chapter 12 is dedicated to the Blind Deconvolution problem.In

  Evaluation","16 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most widely used internal measure for clustering evaluation is the
silhouette coefficient, whose naive computation requires a quadratic number of
distance calculations, which is clearly unfeasible for massive datasets.
Surprisingly, there are no known general methods to efficiently approximate the
silhouette coefficient of a clustering with rigorously provable high accuracy.
In this paper, we present the first scalable algorithm to compute such a
rigorous approximation for the evaluation of clusterings based on any metric
distances. Our algorithm hinges on a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS)
sampling scheme, and, for any fixed $\varepsilon, \delta \in (0,1)$, it
approximates the silhouette coefficient within a mere additive error
$O(\varepsilon)$ with probability $1-\delta$, using a very small number of
distance calculations. We also prove that the algorithm can be adapted to
obtain rigorous approximations of other internal measures of clustering
quality, such as cohesion and separation. Importantly, we provide a distributed
implementation of the algorithm using the MapReduce model, which runs in
constant rounds and requires only sublinear local space at each worker, which
makes our estimation approach applicable to big data scenarios. We perform an
extensive experimental evaluation of our silhouette approximation algorithm,
comparing its performance to a number of baseline heuristics on real and
synthetic datasets. The experiments provide evidence that, unlike other
heuristics, our estimation strategy not only provides tight theoretical
guarantees but is also able to return highly accurate estimations while running
in a fraction of the time required by the exact computation, and that its
distributed implementation is highly scalable, thus enabling the computation of
internal measures for very large datasets for which the exact computation is
prohibitive.

(PL), a novel dictionary-based approach that learns to predict a function that
is expanded on a dictionary while minimizing an empirical risk based on a
functional loss. PL makes it possible to use non orthogonal dictionaries and
can then be combined with dictionary learning; it is thus much more flexible
than expansion-based approaches relying on vectorial losses. This general
method is instantiated with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector-valued
functions as kernel-based projection learning (KPL). For the functional square
loss, two closed-form estimators are proposed, one for fully observed output
functions and the other for partially observed ones. Both are backed
theoretically by an excess risk analysis. Then, in the more general setting of
integral losses based on differentiable ground losses, KPL is implemented using
first-order optimization for both fully and partially observed output
functions. Eventually, several robustness aspects of the proposed algorithms
are highlighted on a toy dataset; and a study on two real datasets shows that
they are competitive compared to other nonlinear approaches. Notably, using the
square loss and a learnt dictionary, KPL enjoys a particularily attractive
trade-off between computational cost and performances.

a single module of the stack is here also described for an experiment where a
fast diamond detector is employed in an highly EMP-polluted environment.
Accurate calibrated spectra of accelerated protons are presented from an

recognition that global warming in Earth System Models (ESMs) is roughly
proportional to cumulative CO2 emissions, regardless of emissions pathway.
However, cumulative emissions accounting only requires the graph between global
warming and cumulative emissions to be approximately independent of emissions
pathway (""path-independence""), regardless of functional relationship between
these variables. The concept and mathematics of path-independence are
considered for an energy-balance climate model (EBM), giving rise to a
closed-form expression of global warming, together with analysis of the
atmospheric cycle following emissions. Path-independence depends on the ratio
between the period of the emissions cycle and the atmospheric lifetime, being a
valid approximation if the emissions cycle has period comparable to or shorter
than the atmospheric lifetime. This makes cumulative emissions accounting
potentially relevant beyond CO2, to other greenhouse gases (GHGs) with
lifetimes of several decades whose emissions have recently begun.

found that the effect of $q$ is here a determining factor for understanding the
delicate mechanisms that control the spin-down of stars as a function of the
mass of stars. We note that our models predict that the calculated ages are
distinct from gyrochronology ages. Indeed, the gyro-ages are measured
considering only the canonical value of the Skumanich relation ($q$=3). As a
result, we find that the age of stars can be well-determined when $q$ is free

(i.e., fast rotators) there is a strong discrepancy among the different indexes
$q$. In addition, the ages measured by gyrochronology model can be
underestimated according to mass range selected. In conclusion, we suggest that
the generalized gyro-ages by magnetic braking index can be an interesting way
to better understand the idea of rotation as a clock.

blending into its generator and employs a new loss called Dual Restriction loss

features during training to generate more realistic images. By utilizing
Poisson GAN, objects of minority class like seacucumber or scallop could be
added into an image naturally and annotated automatically, which could increase
the loss of minority classes during training detectors to eliminate the

CIV, HeII and H_beta, in the spectrum of NGC5548. The emission-line responses
inhabit the interior of a virial envelope. The velocity-delay maps reveal
stratified ionization structure. The HeII response inside 5-10 light-days has a
broad single-peaked velocity profile. The Ly_alpha, CIV, and H_beta responses
peak inside 10 light-days, extend outside 20 light-days, and exhibit a velocity
profile with two peaks separated by 5000 km/s in the 10 to 20 light-day delay
range. The velocity-delay maps show that the M-shaped lag vs velocity structure
found in previous cross-correlation analysis is the signature of a Keplerian
disk with a well-defined outer edge at R=20 light-days. The outer wings of the
M arise from the virial envelope, and the U-shaped interior of the M is the
lower half of an ellipse in the velocity-delay plane. The far-side response is
weaker than that from the near side, so that we see clearly the lower half, but
only faintly the upper half, of the velocity--delay ellipse. The delay
tau=(R/c)(1-sin(i))=5 light-days at line center is from the near edge of the
inclined ring, giving the inclination i=45 deg. A black hole mass of M=7x10^7
Msun is consistent with the velocity-delay structure. A barber-pole pattern
with stripes moving from red to blue across the CIV and possibly Ly_alpha line
profiles suggests the presence of azimuthal structure rotating around the far
side of the broad-line region and may be the signature of precession or orbital
motion of structures in the inner disk. Further HST observations of NGC 5548
over a multi-year timespan but with a cadence of perhaps 10 days rather than 1
day could help to clarify the nature of this new AGN phenomenon.

structures in channel maps are shaped by turbulent motions. It is taken for
granted by a few theoreticians that observed H i structures do not represent
real density enhancement but velocity caustics, caused by velocity crowding.
This interpretation was questioned and objections by Clark et al. led to
violent debates. Aims. To settle the discussion we verify theoretical key
parameters by using Effelsberg Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS) observations. Methods.
We apply unsharp masking to determine filamentary H i structures at high
spatial frequencies. In addition we use Gaussian parameters to distinguish the
cold neutral medium (CNM) from observed H i column densities. We compare power
spectra and spatial distributions of dust and H i column densities,
distinguishing CNM and multiphase column densities at various velocity widths.
Results. Observations contradict the Velocity Channel Analysis (VCA) postulate
that the spectral index should steepen with the width of the velocity window.
We rather find that the thin slice spectral index depends strongly on the H i
phase composition. Multiphase power spectra are steeper for regions with cold
gas. VCA denies such H i phase dependencies on the power distribution.
Separating the CNM we find that the power spectra are significantly flatter
than those for the multiphase H i composite. We observe excess CNM power for
small scale structures originating from cold dust bearing filaments that are
embedded in the CNM. Spectral indices for narrow channel widths depend on the
Doppler temperature of the H i gas. In presence of enhanced small scale H i
structure the far infrared emission from dust is also enhanced. Conclusions.
Small scale cold filamentary H i structures are predominantly caused by density
enhancements due to phase transitions rather than by velocity caustics.

pretrained feature extractors. We also extend the current benchmarking
paradigm: Previous techniques aim to make the test task unknown at training
time but fall short of this goal. We encourage domain shift across training and

  (CVPR) 2020",,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While many works focus on 3D reconstruction from images, in this paper, we
focus on 3D shape reconstruction and completion from a variety of 3D inputs,
which are deficient in some respect: low and high resolution voxels, sparse and
dense point clouds, complete or incomplete. Processing of such 3D inputs is an
increasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are
becoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision
algorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as
they produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations
in reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not
retained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we
propose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs,
can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input
data retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but
critically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data,
and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two
crucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape,
we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which
is aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second,
instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep
features extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that
this forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape

robots. Especially important to the interaction performances is the online
adaptation of body dynamics, which can be modeled as an impedance behaviour.
However, the variable impedance controller still possesses a challenge in the
current control frameworks due to the difficulties of retaining stability when
adapting the controller gains. The fractal impedance controller has been
recently proposed to solve this issue. However, it still has limitations such
as sudden jumps in force when it starts to converge to the desired position and
the lack of a force feedback loop. In this manuscript, two improvements are
made to the control framework to solve these limitations. The force
discontinuity has been addressed introducing a modulation of the impedance via
a virtual antagonist that modulates the output force. The force tracking has
been modeled after the parallel force/position controller architecture. In
contrast to traditional methods, the fractal impedance controller enables the
implementation of a search algorithm on the force feedback to adapt its
behaviour on the external environment instead of on relying on \textit{a
priori} knowledge of the external dynamics. Preliminary simulation results
presented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and it
allows to evaluate the trade-off that needs to be made when relying on the
proposed controller for interaction. In conclusion, the proposed method mimics
the behaviour of an agonist/antagonist system adapting to unknown external
dynamics, and it may find application in computational neuroscience, haptics,
and interaction control.

spaces for the passive states, an operational approach has been introduced to
distinguish them on their charging capabilities of a quantum battery. Unlike
the thermal states, the structural instability of passive states assures the
existence of a natural number $n$, for which $n+1$-copies of the state can
charge a quantum battery while $n$-copies cannot. This phenomenon can be
presented in a $n$-copy resource-theoretic approach, for which the free states
are unable to charge the battery in $n$-copies. Here we have exhibited the
single copy scenario explicitly. We also show that general ordering of the
passive states on the basis of their charging capabilities is not possible and
even the macroscopic entities (viz. energy and entropy) are unable to order
them precisely. Interestingly, for some of the passive states, the majorization
criterion gives sufficient order to the charging and discharging capabilities.
However, the charging capacity for the set of thermal states (for which
charging is possible), is directly proportional to their temperature.

wide range of applications. These are the two-level system (TLS) and the
harmonic oscillator. The former is often an ideal model for confined charge or
spin systems and the latter for lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons. Here, we
couple these two systems, which leads to numerous fascinating physical
phenomena. Practically, we consider different optical excitations and decay
scenarios of a TLS, focusing on the generated dynamics of a single phonon mode
that couples to the TLS. Special emphasis is placed on the entropy of the
different parts of the system, predominantly the phonons. While, without any
decay, the entire system is always in a pure state, resulting in a vanishing
entropy, the complex interplay between the single parts results in
non-vanishing respective entanglement entropies and non-trivial dynamics of
them. Taking a decay of the TLS into account leads to a non-vanishing entropy
of the full system and additional aspects in its dynamics. We demonstrate that
all aspects of the entropy's behavior can be traced back to the purity of the
states and are illustrated by phonon Wigner functions in phase space.

According to radiative models, radio galaxies may produce gamma-ray
emission from the first stages of their evolution. However, very few such
galaxies have been detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) so far.
  Aims. NGC 3894 is a nearby (z = 0.0108) object that belongs to the class of
compact symmetric objects (CSOs, i.e., the most compact and youngest radio
galaxies), which is associated with a gamma-ray counterpart in the Fourth
Fermi-LAT source catalog. Here we present a study of the source in the
gamma-ray and radio bands aimed at investigating its high-energy emission and
assess its young nature.
  Methods. We analyzed 10.8 years of Fermi-LAT data between 100 MeV and 300 GeV
and determined the spectral and variability characteristics of the source.
Multi-epoch very long baseline array (VLBA) observations between 5 and 15 GHz
over a period of 35 years were used to study the radio morphology of NGC 3894
and its evolution.
  Results. NGC 3894 is detected in gamma-rays with a significance >9 sigma over
the full period, and no significant variability has been observed in the
gamma-ray flux on a yearly time-scale. The spectrum is modeled with a flat
power law ($\Gamma$ = 2.0$\pm$0.1) and a flux on the order of 2.2 $\times$
10$^{-9}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. For the first time, the VLBA data allow us to
constrain with high precision the apparent velocity of the jet and counter-jet
side to be $\beta_{\mathrm{app,NW}}$ = 0.132$\pm$0.004 and
$\beta_{\mathrm{app,SE}}$ = 0.065$\pm$0.003, respectively.
  Conclusions. Fermi-LAT and VLBA results favor the youth scenario for the
inner structure of this object, with an estimated dynamical age of 59$\pm$5
years. The estimated range of viewing angle (10{\deg} < $\theta$ < 21{\deg})
does not exclude a possible jet-like origin of the gamma-ray emission.

training should be generally carried out from scratch for each new channel. To
cope with this problem, prior works considered joint training over multiple
channels with the aim of finding a single pair of encoder and decoder that
works well on a class of channels. In this paper, we propose to obviate the
limitations of joint training via meta-learning. The proposed approach is based
on a meta-training phase in which the online gradient-based meta-learning of
the decoder is coupled with the joint training of the encoder via the
transmission of pilots and the use of a feedback link. Accounting for channel
variations during the meta-training phase, this work demonstrates the
advantages of meta-learning in terms of number of pilots as compared to
conventional methods when the feedback link is only available for meta-training

constrained through their geographic distance and the surrounding population
density. Specifically, we consider a power-law distributed popularity, and
random node positions governed by a Poisson point process. We evaluate the
characteristics of the emerging networks, considering the degree distribution,
the average degree of neighbors and the local clustering coefficient. These
local metrics reflect the robustness of the network, the information
dissemination speed and the communication locality. We show that unless the
communication range is strictly limited, the emerging networks are scale-free,
with a rank exponent affected by the spatial factors. Even the average neighbor
degree and the local clustering coefficient show tendencies known in
non-geographic scale-free networks, at least when considering individuals with
low popularity. At high-popularity values, however, the spatial constraints
lead to popularity-independent average neighbor degrees and clustering
coefficients.

complex environments. Visual-inertia SLAM, which combines a camera with IMU,
can significantly improve the robustness and enable scale weak-visibility,
whereas monocular visual SLAM is scale-invisible. For ground mobile robots, the
introduction of a wheel speed sensor can solve the scale weak-visible problem
and improve the robustness under abnormal conditions. In this thesis, a
multi-sensor fusion SLAM algorithm using monocular vision, inertia, and wheel
speed measurements is proposed. The sensor measurements are combined in a
tightly coupled manner, and a nonlinear optimization method is used to maximize
the posterior probability to solve the optimal state estimation. Loop detection
and back-end optimization are added to help reduce or even eliminate the
cumulative error of the estimated poses, thus ensuring global consistency of
the trajectory and map. The wheel odometer pre-integration algorithm, which
combines the chassis speed and IMU angular speed, can avoid repeated
integration caused by linearization point changes during iterative
optimization; state initialization based on the wheel odometer and IMU enables
a quick and reliable calculation of the initial state values required by the
state estimator in both stationary and moving states. Comparative experiments
were carried out in room-scale scenes, building scale scenes, and visual loss
scenarios. The results showed that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy,
2.2 m of cumulative error after moving 812 m (0.28%, loopback optimization
disabled), strong robustness, and effective localization capability even in the
event of sensor loss such as visual loss. The accuracy and robustness of the
proposed method are superior to those of monocular visual inertia SLAM and
traditional wheel odometers.

applied directly to the raw field configurations using a convolutional network,
demonstrating the ability to reconstruct all order parameters from the learned
filter weights. Based on our results, we argue that due to its broad
applicability, attribution methods such as LRP could prove a useful and
versatile tool in our search for new physical insights. In the case of the

to potentially quite singular hypersurfaces, generalizing the classical moving

varifolds shows that smoothness and symmetry at infinity (respectively at the
boundary) can be promoted to smoothness and symmetry in the interior. The key
feature, in contrast with the classical formulation of the moving plane
principle, is that smoothness is a conclusion rather than an assumption.
  We implement our moving plane method in the setting of compact varifolds with
smooth boundary and in the setting of complete varifolds. A key ingredient is a
Hopf lemma for stationary and CMC-varifolds. Our Hopf lemma provides a new tool
to establish smoothness of varifolds, and works in arbitrary dimensions and
without any stability assumptions. As applications of our new moving plane
method, we prove varifold uniqueness results for the catenoid, spherical caps,

such design, so as to improve their eavesdropping performance in downlink. The
aim of this paper is to study the effects of pilot spoofing attacks on uplink
channel estimation, by assuming that the BS knows the angle of arrivals (AoAs)

the simple least squares estimator (LSE), we consider more sophisticated
estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and different
versions of the minimum mean square error estimator (MMSEE), involving
different degrees of a priori information about the pilot spoofing attacks.
Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are used to compare the
performance of such estimators. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that
the spoofing effects in the high signal-to-noise regime can be completely
suppressed, under certain conditions involving the AoAs of the legitimate and
spoofing channels. Moreover, we show that even an imperfect knowledge of the
AoAs and of the average transmission power of the spoofing signals allows the
MLE and MMSEE to achieve significant performance gains over the LSE.

Things (IoT) applications, it is expected to still play an important role in
5th Generation (5G) networks. However, the expected benefits of these
technologies cannot be achieved without a proper system design. In this paper,
we consider the problem of jointly optimizing terminal precoders/decoders and
relay forwarding matrices on the basis of the sum mean square error (MSE)
criterion in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay systems, where
two multi-antenna nodes mutually exchange information via multi-antenna
amplify-and-forward relays. This problem is nonconvex and a local optimal
solution is typically found by using iterative algorithms based on alternating
optimization. We show how the constrained minimization of the sum-MSE can be
relaxed to obtain two separated subproblems which, under mild conditions, admit
a closed-form solution. Compared to iterative approaches, the proposed design
is more suited to be integrated in 5G networks, since it is computationally
more convenient and its performance exhibits a better scaling in the number of
relays.

based purely on behavioral descriptions of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10), and
requires informants to observe children with disorder across different settings
(e.g. home, school). Numerous limitations (e.g., informant discrepancies, lack
of adherence to assessment guidelines, informant biases) to current diagnostic
practices have the potential to result in over-, under-, or misdiagnosis of the
disorder. Advances in neuroimaging technologies are providing a critical step
towards a more objective assessment of the disorder. Prior research provides
strong evidence that structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data collected from individuals with ASD exhibit distinguishing characteristics
that differ in local and global spatial, and temporal neural-patterns of the
brain. Our proposed deep-learning model ASD-DiagNet exhibits consistently high
accuracy for classification of ASD brain scans from neurotypical scans. We have
for the first time integrated traditional machine-learning and deep-learning
techniques that allows us to isolate ASD biomarkers from MRI data sets. Our
method, called Auto-ASD-Network, uses a combination of deep-learning and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify ASD scans from neurotypical scans.
Such interpretable models would help explain the decisions made by
deep-learning techniques leading to knowledge discovery for neuroscientists,
and transparent analysis for clinicians.

the asymptotics of the probability p(T,n) that the leader time will exceed T

described by independent, either stationary or self-similar, Gaussian
processes, not necessarily identically distributed. Roughly, the result for
particles with stationary dynamics of unit variance is as follows: L= -log
p(T,n) /(Tlog n)=1/d+o(1), where d/(2pi) is the power of the zero frequency in
the spectrum of the leading particle, and this value is the largest in the
spectrum. Previously, in some particular models, the asymptotics of L was
understood as a sequential limit first over T and then over n. For processes
that do not necessarily have non-negative correlations, the limit over T may
not exist. To overcome this difficulty, the growing parameters T and n are
considered in the domain clog T<log n<CT, where c>1 . The Lamperti transform
allows us to transfer the described result to self-similar processes with the
normalizer of log p(T,n) becoming log T log n.

Importantly, for the first time, our model predicts that the negative

enabling both low power operation and more efficient transistor size scaling,
while the effect on reducing subthreshold slope shows systematic improvement,
with subthermionic subthreshold slope values at high current levels (0.1

extensive comparisons with numerical TCAD simulations in all regions of

in place, both the description of the normal form and the computational

effect and second-order harmonic generation (SHG), play crucial roles in
probing and controlling light-matter interactions for energy and device
applications. To date, most studies of second-order NLO processes focus on
materials with broken spatial inversion symmetry, such as proper ferroelectrics
and noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals. Nevertheless, inversion symmetry of
Shubnikov groups can be broken via spin-ordering in centrosymmetric crystals.
Unfortunately, these materials are less common, and their NLO responses are
usually weak. Combining quantum perturbation theory and first-principles
simulations, we predict a giant injection-current photogalvanic effect and SHG
in a family of emerging axion insulators, the even septuple layers of MnBi2Te4
(MBT) materials that exhibit the zero-plateau quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
effect. Their amplitudes of injection current and SHG are about two orders of
magnitude larger than those of widely used ferroelectrics, such as BiFeO3 and
LiNbO3. Moreover, unlike the usual injection current observed under
circularly-polarized light, the injection photocurrent of MBTs only emerges
under linearly polarized light, making it convenient for device applications.
These unique characters are from a combination effect of parity-time symmetry,
three-fold rotation symmetry, and significant spin-orbit coupling. These
enhanced NLO effects are valuable for characterizing subtle topological orders
in QAH systems and also shed light on novel infrared photo-detector and
photovoltaic applications based on magnetic topological materials.

thermal model calculations. It was found that there is a competitive
relationship between the kinetic freeze-out parameter $T_{kin}$ and the radial
expansion velocity $\beta_{T}$, which also agrees with the STAR or ALICE
results. We found that the chemical freeze-out strangeness potential $\mu_{s}$
remains constant in all collision systems and that the fireball radius $R$ is
dominated by $\left\langle \mathrm{N_{Part}}\right\rangle$, which can be well
fitted by a function of $a \left\langle \mathrm{N_{Part}}\right\rangle^{b}$
with $b \approx 1/3$. In addition, we calculated the nuclear modification
factors for different collision systems with respect to the $ \mathrm{{}^{10}B}

circuits within the brain, with attention being paid to the cerebellar granular
layer. The focus of this study is to evaluate the input activity representation
of these feed-forward neural networks. The activity of cerebellar granule cells
is conveyed by parallel fibers and translated into Purkinje cell activity; the
sole output of the cerebellar cortex. The learning process at this
parallel-fiber-to-Purkinje-cell connection makes each Purkinje cell sensitive
to a set of specific cerebellar states, determined by the granule-cell activity
during a certain time window. A Purkinje cell becomes sensitive to each neural
input state and, consequently, the network operates as a function able to
generate a desired output for each provided input by means of supervised
learning. However, not all sets of Purkinje cell responses can be assigned to
any set of input states due to the network's own limitations (inherent to the
network neurobiological substrate), that is, not all input-output mapping can
be learned. A limiting factor is the representation of the input states through
granule-cell activity. The quality of this representation will determine the
capacity of the network to learn a varied set of outputs. In this study we
present an algorithm for evaluating quantitatively the level of
compatibility/interference amongst a set of given cerebellar states according
to their representation (granule-cell activation patterns) without the need for
actually conducting simulations and network training. The algorithm input
consists of a real-number matrix that codifies the activity level of every
considered granule-cell in each state. The capability of this representation to
generate a varied set of outputs is evaluated geometrically, thus resulting in
a real number that assesses the goodness of the representation

human-level performance) on several tasks, including face and speech
recognition. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to \emph{adversarial
attacks}, such test-time, training-time, and backdoor attacks. In test-time
attacks an adversary crafts adversarial examples, which are specially crafted
perturbations imperceptible to humans which, when added to an input example,
force a machine learning model to misclassify the given input example.
Adversarial examples are a concern when deploying ML algorithms in critical
contexts, such as information security and autonomous driving. Researchers have
responded with a plethora of defenses. One promising defense is
\emph{randomized smoothing} in which a classifier's prediction is smoothed by
adding random noise to the input example we wish to classify. In this paper, we
theoretically and empirically explore randomized smoothing. We investigate the
effect of randomized smoothing on the feasible hypotheses space, and show that
for some noise levels the set of hypotheses which are feasible shrinks due to
smoothing, giving one reason why the natural accuracy drops after smoothing. To
perform our analysis, we introduce a model for randomized smoothing which
abstracts away specifics, such as the exact distribution of the noise. We
complement our theoretical results with extensive experiments.

time-delay is varied continuously to minimize the power of control force.
Minimization is realized via gradient-descent method. However, the derivation
of the gradient with respect to time-delay is not accurate. In particular, a
scalar factor is omitted. The absolute value of the scalar factor is not
crucial, as it only changes the speed of the gradient method. On the other
hand, the factor's sign changes the gradient direction, therefore for negative
value of the multiplier the gradient-decent becomes gradient-ascent method and
fail power minimization. Here the accurate derivation of the gradient is
presented. We obtain an analytical expression for the missing factor and show
an example of the Lorenz system where the negative factor occurs. We also

for Si II compared with the LTE case and leads to consistent mean abundances
from lines of different ionisation stages. In the hottest star of our sample,
$\iota$ Her, Si II is subject to overionisation that drives emission in the
lines arising from the high-excitation (above 12.5 eV) doublet levels. Our NLTE
calculations reproduced 10 emission lines of Si II observed in $\iota$ Her. The
same overionisation effect leads to greatly weakened Si II lines, which are
observed in absorption in $\iota$ Her. Large positive NLTE abundance
corrections (up to 0.98 dex for 5055 A) were useful for achieving consistent
mean abundances from lines of the two ionisation stages, Si II and Si III. It
was found that the NLTE effects are overestimated for the Si II 6347, 6371 A

introduces a novel self-supervised strategy for graph representation learning
by exploiting natural supervision provided by the data itself. Inspired by
human social behavior, we assume that the global context of each node is
composed of all nodes in the graph since two arbitrary entities in a connected
network could interact with each other via paths of varying length. Based on
this, we investigate whether the global context can be a source of free and
effective supervisory signals for learning useful node representations.
Specifically, we randomly select pairs of nodes in a graph and train a
well-designed neural net to predict the contextual position of one node
relative to the other. Our underlying hypothesis is that the representations
learned from such within-graph context would capture the global topology of the
graph and finely characterize the similarity and differentiation between nodes,
which is conducive to various downstream learning tasks. Extensive benchmark
experiments including node classification, clustering, and link prediction
demonstrate that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised
methods and sometimes even exceeds the performance of supervised counterparts.

has several limitations, such as an unnatural enforcement that all features be

propose Deep Multi-Modal Sets: a technique that represents a collection of

defects. We demonstrate that an exceptional point (EP) is formed in this
PT-symmetric system when SiC operates as a practical epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)

even more importantly, strong self-induced nonreciprocal transmission is
excited due to the nonlinear Kerr effect at a frequency slightly shifted off
the EP but without breaking the PT-symmetric phase. The transmittance from one
direction is exactly unity while the transmittance from the other direction is
decreased to very low values, achieving very high optical isolation. The
proposed active nonlinear metamaterial overcomes the fundamental physical
bounds on nonreciprocity compared with a passive nonlinear nonreciprocal
resonator. The strong self-induced nonreciprocal transmission arises from the
extreme asymmetric field distribution achieved upon excitation from opposite
incident directions. The significant enhancement of the electric field in the
defects effectively decreases the required optical power to trigger the

two factors contribute to it: one is the density gradient of the clump gas, the

this paper provides a new yet convenient way to extract the interactive

accident videos that were captured by both the surveillance cameras and driving

lies in the fact that the recording cameras are un-calibrated and the angles of
surveillance are unknown. The approach proposed in this paper employs image
processing to obtain a new perspective which is different from the original
video's perspective. Meanwhile, we manually detect and mark object feature
points in each image frame. In order to acquire a gradient of reference ratios,
a geometric model is implemented in the analysis of reference pixel value, and
the feature points are then scaled to the object trajectory based on the
gradient of ratios. The generated trajectories not only restore the object
movements completely but also reflect changes in vehicle velocity and rotation
based on the feature points distributions.

synthetic polymers as the recording media and read the content via tandem mass

string reconstruction and correction of multiple mass errors. We consider two
approaches: The first approach pertains to asymmetric errors and it is based on
introducing redundancy that scales linearly with the number of errors and
logarithmically with the length of the string. The construction allows for the
string to be uniquely reconstructed based only on its erroneous substring
composition multiset. The key idea behind our unique reconstruction approach is
to interleave (shifted) Catalan-Bertrand paths with arbitrary binary strings
and ""reflect"" them so as to force prefixes and suffixes of the same length to
have different weights. The asymptotic code rate of the scheme is one, and
decoding is accomplished via a simplified version of the backtracking algorithm
used for the Turnpike problem. For symmetric errors, we use a polynomial
characterization of the mass information and adapt polynomial evaluation code
constructions for this setting. In the process, we develop new efficient
decoding algorithms for a constant number of composition errors and show that
the redundancy of the scheme scales quadratically with the number of errors and
logarithmically with the codelength.

standard deviation, particularly for skewed data. For these studies, when
included in a meta-analysis, it is often desired to convert the five-number
summary back to the sample mean and standard deviation. For this purpose,
several methods have been proposed in the recent literature and they are
increasingly used nowadays. In this paper, we propose to further advance the
literature by developing a smoothly weighted estimator for the sample standard
deviation that fully utilizes the sample size information. For ease of
implementation, we also derive an approximation formula for the optimal weight,
as well as a shortcut formula for the sample standard deviation. Numerical
results show that our new estimator provides a more accurate estimate for
normal data and also performs favorably for non-normal data. Together with the
optimal sample mean estimator in Luo et al., our new methods have dramatically
improved the existing methods for data transformation, and they are capable to
serve as ""rules of thumb"" in meta-analysis for studies reported with the
five-number summary. Finally for practical use, an Excel spreadsheet and an

inequality for $g$ is provided when the network's graph is switching according
to a switching signal with a dwell time or an average dwell time, respectively.
It has also been shown the existence of $g$ when the stochastic matrix of the
network's graph is chosen to be doubly stochastic under arbitrarily switching
signals. This is accomplished by exploiting several well-known properties of
invariant subspaces and properties of perturbed systems.

opens new opportunities for the development of non-planar non-insulated HTS
magnets. This type of HTS magnet offers attractive features via its simplicity,
robustness, and is well-suited for modest size steady-state applications such
as a mid-scale stellarator. In non-planar coil applications the HTS tape may be
subject to severe minor-axis bending strain ($\epsilon_{bend}$), torsional
strains ($\epsilon_{tor}$) and transverse magnetic field components
($B_\perp$), all of which can limit the magnet operating space. A novel method
of winding angle optimization is here presented to overcome these limitations.
Essentially, this method: 1) calculates the peak {\epsilon}bend and B\perp for
arbitary winding angle along an input coil filamentary trajectory, 2) defines a
cost function including both, and then 3) uses tensioned splines to define a
winding angle that reduces $\epsilon$tor and optimizes the {\epsilon}bend and
$B_\perp$ cost function. As strain limits are present even without $B_\perp$,
this optimization is able to provide an assessment of the minimimum buildable
size of an arbitrary non-planar non-insulating HTS coil. This optimization
finds that for standard 4 mm wide HTS tapes the minimum size coils of the
existing HSX, NCSX, and W7-X stellarator geometries are around 0.3 - 0.5 m in
radius. For coils larger than this size, permitting a finite (yet tolerable)
strain allows reduction of $B_\perp$. This enables a reduction of the HTS tape
length required to achieve a given design magnetic field or equivalently an
increase in the achievable magnetic field for fixed HTS tape length. The
distinct considerations for optimizing a stellarator coilset to further ease
compatibility with non-insulated HTS magnets are also discussed.

Euclidean Einstein field equations with the stress-energy tensor of the
'observed' field as the source. In the case of a slowly varying metric the
maximum likelihood estimate is very close to its actual value. Then by virtue
of the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimate the fluctuations
of the metric are Gaussian and governed by the Fisher information bi-tensor.
Cramer-Rao bound can be interpreted as uncertainty relations between metric and
stress-energy tensor. A plausible prior distribution for the metric
fluctuations in a Bayesian framework is introduced. Using this distribution, we
calculate the decoherence functional acting on the field by integrating out the
metric fluctuations around flat space. Our approach can be interpreted as a

The cubic Galileon gravity scalar field model (CGG), which derives from the DGP
braneworld model, describes modified gravity incorporating a Vainshtein
screening mechanism. The nonlinear derivative interactions in the CGG equation
suppress the field near regions of high density, thereby restoring general
relativity (GR) while far from such regions, field enhancement is comparable to
GR and the equation is dominated by a linear term. This feature of the
governing PDE poses some numerical challenges for computation of the scalar
potential, force and Laplacian fields even under stationary conditions. Here we
present a numerical method based on finite differences for solution of the
static CGG scalar field for a 2D axisymmetric Sun-Earth system and a 3D

into several types of workplaces, such as warehouses, which usually involve

UAVs: potential failure of UAVs may cause risk and danger to surrounding human.
Effective and efficient detection of such failure may provide early warning to
the surrounding human workers and reduce such risk to human beings as much as
possible. One of the commonest reasons that cause the failure of the UAV's
flight is the physical damage to the propellers. This paper presents a method
to detect the propellers' damage only based on the audio noise caused by the
UAV's flight. The diagnostic model is developed based on convolutional neural
network (CNN) and transfer learning techniques. The audio data is collected
from the UAVs in real time, transformed into the time-frequency spectrogram,
and used to train the CNN-based diagnostic model. The developed model is able
to detect the abnormal features of the spectrogram and thus the physical damage
of the propellers. To reduce the data dependence on the UAV's dynamic models
and enable the utilization of the training data from UAVs with different
dynamic models, the CNN-based diagnostic model is further augmented by transfer
learning. As such, the refinement of the well-trained diagnostic model ground
on other UAVs only requires a small amount of UAV's training data. Experimental
tests are conducted to validate the diagnostic model with an accuracy of higher
than 90%.

the recent trend towards the increase in distributed self-generation
capabilities by prosumers. Starting from the existing tension between the
intrinsically hierarchical current structure of the electricity distribution
network and the substantially distributed and self-organising nature of the
self-generation, we explore the limitations imposed by the current conditions.
Initially, we introduce a potential multi-layered architecture for a
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy market, discussing the fundamental aspects of local
production and local consumption as part of a microgrid. Secondly, we analyse
the consequent changes for the different users' roles, also in connection with
some incentive models connected with the decentralisation of the power
production. To give a full picture to the reader, we also scrutinise relevant
elements of energy trading, such as Smart Contract and grid stability. Thirdly,
we present an example of a typical P2P settlement, showcasing the role of all
the previously analysed aspects. To conclude, we performed a review of relevant
activities in this domain, to showcase where existing projects are going and
what are the most important themes covered. Being this a work in progress, many
open questions are still on the table and will be addressed in the next stages
of the research. Eventually, by providing a reference model as base for further
discussions and improvements, we would like to engage ourselves in a dialog
with the different users and the broad community, oriented towards a more fair
and ecological-friendly solution for the electricity market of the future.

recognition systems. Despite the recent advances in both fields, annotated
facial expression datasets in the context of sign language are still scarce
resources. In this manuscript, we introduce an annotated sequenced facial
expression dataset in the context of sign language, comprising over $3000$
facial images extracted from the daily news and weather forecast of the public
tv-station PHOENIX. Unlike the majority of currently existing facial expression
datasets, FePh provides sequenced semi-blurry facial images with different head
poses, orientations, and movements. In addition, in the majority of images,
identities are mouthing the words, which makes the data more challenging. To
annotate this dataset we consider primary, secondary, and tertiary dyads of
seven basic emotions of ""sad"", ""surprise"", ""fear"", ""angry"", ""neutral"",
""disgust"", and ""happy"". We also considered the ""None"" class if the image's
facial expression could not be described by any of the aforementioned emotions.
Although we provide FePh as a facial expression dataset of signers in sign
language, it has a wider application in gesture recognition and Human Computer
Interaction (HCI) systems.

on day-to-day driver route choice behavior. A real-world experimental study is
designed to have participants repeatedly choose between two alternative routes
for five origin-destination pairs over multiple days after providing them with
dynamically updated travel time information (average travel time and travel
time variability). The results demonstrate that historical travel time
information enhances behavioral rationality by 10\% on average and reduces
inertial tendencies to increase risk seeking in the gain domain. Furthermore,
expected travel time information is demonstrated to be more effective than
travel time variability information in enhancing rational behavior when drivers
have limited experiences. After drivers gain sufficient knowledge of routes,
however, the difference in behavior associated with the two information types
becomes insignificant. The results also demonstrate that, when drivers lack
experience, the faster less reliable route is more attractive than the slower
more reliable route. However, with cumulative experiences, drivers become more
willing to take the more reliable route given that they are reluctant to become
risk seekers once experience is gained. Furthermore, the effect of information
on driver behavior differs significantly by participant and trip, which is, to
a large extent, dependent on personal traits and trip characteristics.

However, there exists a vast domain gap between medical images and natural

domain-specific challenges, such as high lesion/background similarity, dominant
tiny lesions, and severe class imbalance. Is a hand-crafted detection network
tailored for natural image undoubtedly good enough over a discrepant medical
lesion domain? Is there more powerful operations, filters, and sub-networks
that better fit the medical lesion detection problem to be discovered? In this
paper, we introduce a novel ElixirNet that includes three components: 1)
TruncatedRPN balances positive and negative data for false positive reduction;
2) Auto-lesion Block is automatically customized for medical images to
incorporate relation-aware operations among region proposals, and leads to more
suitable and efficient classification and localization. 3) Relation transfer
module incorporates the semantic relationship and transfers the relevant
contextual information with an interpretable the graph thus alleviates the
problem of lack of annotations for all types of lesions. Experiments on
DeepLesion and Kits19 prove the effectiveness of ElixirNet, achieving
improvement of both sensitivity and precision over FPN with fewer parameters.

  multi-utility representations","15 pages",,,,"math.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Utility representations of preference relations in symmetric topological
spaces have the advantage of fully characterising these relations. But, this is
not true in the case of representations of preference relations that are mostly
incomplete and use asymmetric topologies. In order to avoid this unfortunate
circumstance, due to lack of symmetry, the notion of semicontinuous
Richter-Peleg multi-utility representation was first introduced and studied by
Minguzzi [24]. Generally, the study of semicontinuous functions reveals that
topology and order are two aspects of the same mathematical object and,
therefore, should be studied jointly. This mathematical object is the notion of
bitopological preordered space, which also constitutes the mathematical tool to
model and analyse the notions of asymmetry and duality. In this paper, we
characterize the existence of semicontinuous Richter-Peleg multi-utility
representations in bitopological spaces. Based on this characterization, we
prove that a preorder $\precsim$ has the set of all Scott and
$\omega$-continuous functions as Richter-Peleg multi-utility representation if
and only if $\precsim$ is precontinuous in the sense of Erne [17].

papers but the approach presented here is a considerable improvement in terms
of efficiency and accuracy.
  One innovation is that initial stresses instead of body forces are used. This
then allows a one step solution without iteration. In addition, a novel
approach is used for the computation of strains, that avoids the use of highly
singular fundamental solutions. Finally, a new type of inclusion is presented
that can be used to model reinforcement bars or rock bolts and where analytical
integration can be used. Test examples, where results are compared with Finite

structure that have attracted interest due to the potential for unique physics
arising from their non-trivial toroidal shape. However, the exciton properties
and dynamics of these materials with complex topology are not yet well
understood. Here, we use a combination of femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy,
temperature-resolved photoluminescence (PL), and single particle measurements
to study these materials. We find that on transformation of CdSe nanoplatelets
to nanorings, by perforating the center of platelets, the emission lifetime
decreases and the emission spectrum broadens due to ensemble variations in the
ring size and thickness. The reduced PL quantum yield of nanorings (~10%)
compared to platelets (~30%) is attributed to an enhanced coupling between: (i)
excitons and CdSe LO-phonons at 200 cm-1 and (ii) negatively charged
selenium-rich traps which give nanorings a high surface charge (~-50 mV).
Population of these weakly emissive trap sites dominates the emission
properties with an increased trap emission at low temperatures relative to
excitonic emission. Our results provide a detailed picture of the nature of
excitons in nanorings and the influence of phonons and surface charge in
explaining the broad shape of the PL spectrum and the origin of PL quantum
yield losses. Furthermore, they suggest that the excitonic properties of
nanorings are not solely a consequence of the toroidal shape but are also a
result of traps introduced by puncturing the platelet center.

environmental perception tasks, and (ii) Connected and Automated Vehicles

intention and sensor information sharing. Our investigation considers and
quantifies the impact of each vehicle group in large urban road networks in

average speed and average trip time. Specifically, the numerical studies show
that the traffic congestion can be reduced by up to a factor of four, while the
average flow speeds of CAV group remains closer to the speed limits and can be
up to 300% greater than the human-driven vehicles. Finally, traffic situations
are also studied, indicating that even a small market penetration of CAVs will
have a substantial net positive effect on the traffic flows.
