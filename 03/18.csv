  Images","14 pages, 14 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Sea-land segmentation is an important process for many key applications in
remote sensing. Proper operative sea-land segmentation for remote sensing
images remains a challenging issue due to complex and diverse transition
between sea and lands. Although several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
have been developed for sea-land segmentation, the performance of these CNNs is
far from the expected target. This paper presents a novel deep neural network
structure for pixel-wise sea-land segmentation, a Residual Dense U-Net
(RDU-Net), in complex and high-density remote sensing images. RDU-Net is a
combination of both down-sampling and up-sampling paths to achieve satisfactory
results. In each down- and up-sampling path, in addition to the convolution
layers, several densely connected residual network blocks are proposed to
systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information. Each dense network
block contains multilevel convolution layers, short-range connections and an
identity mapping connection which facilitates features re-use in the network
and makes full use of the hierarchical features from the original images. These
proposed blocks have a certain number of connections that are designed with
shorter distance backpropagation between the layers and can significantly
improve segmentation results whilst minimizing computational costs. We have
performed extensive experiments on two real datasets Google Earth and ISPRS and
compare the proposed RDUNet against several variations of Dense Networks. The
experimental results show that RDUNet outperforms the other state-of-the-art
approaches on the sea-land segmentation tasks.

quiescent air has been investigated through both simulation and experiment. The
focus is on the short term behavior and the time range considered covers about
eight dominant second-mode oscillations of the drop after it is formed. Due to
the small fluid inertia the growth of the drop is quasi-static and is well
captured by the static pendant drop theory. Nevertheless, the pinching dynamics
and the resulting post-formation state of the drop trigger a nonlinear
oscillation when the drop falls. The initial shape of the drop when it is just
formed is decomposed into spherical harmonic modes. The pinching dynamics such
as interface overturning introduces small-scale variation on the drop contour,
which in turn contributes to the finite amplitudes of the higher-order modes.
Furthermore, the initial kinetic energy when the droplet is just formed is as
important as the initial surface energy contained in the drop shape, and is
found to amplify the initial oscillation amplitude and to induce a phase shift
in the oscillation of all the modes. By incorporating both the initial surface
and kinetic energy, the linear model for a free drop oscillation yields very
good predictions for the second and third modes. The mode amplitude spectra
show both the primary frequencies that are consistent with the Lamb's theory
and the secondary frequencies arising from different modes due to nonlinear
inter-mode coupling. The complex transient flow inside and outside the drop is
induced by the interaction between the falling motion and the nonlinear
oscillation. The streamlines indicate that the internal flow is substantially
different from the Hill vortex for a falling drop without oscillation. The
temporal evolutions of both the internal flow and the wake morphology follow
the dominant second oscillation mode.

of multinucleon transfer reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier both
experimentally and theoretically, aiming at the production of unknown
neutron-rich heavy nuclei. It is crucial to provide reliable theoretical
predictions based on microscopic theories with sufficient predictive power.
  Purpose: This paper aims to clarify the applicability of the quantal
diffusion approach based on the stochastic mean-field (SMF) theory for
multinucleon transfer processes. Isotope production cross sections are
evaluated for the reactions of $^{64}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb at $E_{c.m.}$=268 MeV and
$^{58}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb at $E_{c.m.}$=270 MeV and are compared with available
experimental data.
  Methods: Three-dimensional time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations
are carried out for a range of initial orbital angular momenta with Skyrme
SLy4d functional. Quantal diffusion equations, derived based on the SMF theory,
for variances and covariance of neutron and proton numbers of reaction products
are solved, with microscopic drift and diffusion coefficients obtained from the
time evolution of occupied single-particle orbitals in TDHF. Secondary
deexcitation processes, both particle evaporation and fission, are simulated by
a statistical model, GEMINI++.
  Results: We find that the quantal diffusion approach reproduces the measured
cross sections for abundant reaction products, including both projectile-like
and target-like fragments, as well as fragments of transfer-induced fission.
The results underline the importance of beyond mean-field effects in describing
multinucleon transfer processes. We emphasize that the quantal diffusion
description does not involve any adjustable parameters, once an energy density
functional is given. Possible future directions are discussed.

The input consists of a simple polygon P, (possibly infinite) sets G and C of
points within P, and an integer k; the task is to decide if at most k guards
can be placed on points in G so that every point in C is visible to at least
one guard. In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G and C consist of all
the points within P. Other well-known variants restrict G and C to consist
either of all the points on the boundary of P or of all the vertices of P.
Recently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned
variants of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k [Bonnet and
Miltzow, ESA'16], the classic variant has an O(log k)-approximation algorithm
[Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG'17], and it may require irrational guards [Abrahamsen
et al., SoCG'17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the
case where G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P were both
shown to be \exists R-complete~[Abrahamsen et al., STOC'18]. Even when both G
and C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P, the problem is not
known to be in NP.
  Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos
[Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r, the
number of reflex vertices? We focus on the variant where G and C are all the
vertices of P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. We show that Vertex-Vertex Art
Gallery is solvable in time r^{O(r^2)}n^{O(1)}. Our approach also extends to
assert that Vertex-Boundary Art Gallery and Boundary-Vertex Art Gallery are
both FPT. We utilize structural properties of ""almost convex polygons"" to
present a two-stage reduction from Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery to a new
constraint satisfaction problem (whose solution is also provided in this paper)
where constraints have arity 2 and involve monotone functions.

We give a bound on the excess risk of stochastic gradient flow at time $t$,

are effective approaches for retrieving the 3-D information of urban areas. In
order to obtain a plausible reconstruction, it is necessary to use more than
twenty interferograms. Hence, these methods are commonly not appropriate for
large-scale 3-D urban mapping using TanDEM-X data where only a few acquisitions
are available in average for each city. This work proposes a new SAR
tomographic processing framework to work with those extremely small stacks,
which integrates the non-local filtering into SAR tomography inversion. The
applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated using a TanDEM-X multi-baseline
stack with 5 bistatic interferograms over the whole city of Munich, Germany.
Systematic comparison of our result with TanDEM-X raw digital elevation models
(DEM) and airborne LiDAR data shows that the relative height accuracy of two
third buildings is within two meters, which outperforms the TanDEM-X raw DEM.
The promising performance of the proposed algorithm paved the first step
towards high quality large-scale 3-D urban mapping.

zenith and nadir during normal operations. Their brightness is determined by
the product of the solar illumination on the downward facing side of the panel
multiplied by the area of that side projected toward the observer on Earth.
This geometry leads to a unique brightness function that is not shared by other
satellites. For example, the observed brightness is very sensitive to the solar
elevation angle. There are circumstances where sunlight only illuminates the
upward facing side of the satellite rendering it invisible to Earth-based
observers. A brightness model depending on the solar aspect and the observer
aspect of the flat panel, in addition to the satellite distance, is described.
Absolute brightness is the only free parameter of the model, and it is taken to
be that at a distance of 1,000 km when the solar and observer factors are
unity. This model has been successfully fitted to a set of observed magnitudes.
The absolute visual magnitude of a Starlink satellite as determined from this
fitting is 4.1 +/- 0.1. The model could be used to determine the absolute
magnitude of the Starlink satellite known as Dark Sat which has a special
low-albedo coating.

gamma-ray band during its 2016-2017 outburst. This paper focuses on the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) obtained in 2017 February-March, when GRS
1716-249 was in a bright hard spectral state. The soft gamma-ray data collected
with the INTEGRAL/SPI telescope show the presence of a spectral component which
is in excess of the thermal Comptonisation emission. This component is usually
interpreted as inverse Compton emission from a tiny fraction of non-thermal
electrons in the X-ray corona. We find that hybrid thermal/non-thermal
Comptonisation models provide a good fit to the X/gamma-ray spectrum of GRS
1716-249. The best-fit parameters are typical of the bright hard state spectra
observed in other black hole X-ray binaries. Moreover, the magnetised hybrid
Comptonisation model BELM provides an upper limit on the intensity of the
coronal magnetic field of about 1E+06 G. Alternatively, this soft gamma-ray
emission could originate from synchrotron emission in the radio jet. In order
to test this hypothesis, we fit the SED with the irradiated disc plus
Comptonisation model combined with the jet internal shock emission model ISHEM.
We found that a jet with an electron distribution of p~2.1 can reproduce the
soft gamma-ray emission of GRS 1716-249. However, if we introduce the expected
cooling break around 10 keV, the jet model can no longer explain the observed
soft gamma-ray emission, unless the index of the electron energy distribution
is significantly harder (p<2).

challenges for the standard camera pipeline. Images become too dark and too
noisy, which makes traditional image enhancement techniques almost impossible
to apply. Very recently, researchers have shown promising results using
learning based approaches. Motivated by these ideas, in this paper, we propose
a deep learning framework for obtaining clean and colorful RGB images from
extremely dark raw images. The backbone of our framework is a novel
coarse-to-fine network architecture that generates high-quality outputs in a
progressive manner. The coarse network predicts a low-resolution, denoised raw
image, which is then fed to the fine network to recover fine-scale details and
realistic textures. To further reduce noise and improve color accuracy, we
extend this network to a permutation invariant structure so that it takes a
burst of low-light images as input and merges information from multiple images
at the feature-level. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
leads to perceptually more pleasing results than state-of-the-art methods by
producing much sharper and higher quality images.

tentative evidence that the flux of the $\gamma$-ray emission from Arp~299 is

originate from the obscured AGN in this interacting galaxy system. In addition,

decoder, that iteratively refines the generated features during both the
training and feature synthesis stages. The synthesized features together with
their corresponding latent embeddings from the decoder are then transformed
into discriminative features and utilized during classification to reduce
ambiguities among categories. Experiments on (generalized) zero-shot object and
action classification reveal the benefit of semantic consistency and iterative
feedback, outperforming existing methods on six zero-shot learning benchmarks.

genetically related to Lie algebra crossed modules. Gauging procedures in
supergravity rely on a pairing - the embedding tensor - between a Leibniz
algebra and a Lie algebra. Two such algebras, together with their embedding
tensor, form a triple called a Lie-Leibniz triple, of which Lie algebra crossed
modules are particular cases. This paper is devoted to showing that any
Lie-Leibniz triple induces a differential graded Lie algebra - its associated
tensor hierarchy - whose restriction to the category of Lie algebra crossed
modules is the canonical assignment associating to any Lie algebra crossed
module its corresponding unique 2-term differential graded Lie algebra. This
shows that Lie-Leibniz triples form natural generalizations of Lie algebra
crossed modules and that their associated tensor hierarchies can be considered
as some kind of 'lie-ization' of the former. We deem the present construction
of such tensor hierarchies clearer and more straightforward than previous
derivations. We stress that such a construction suggests the existence of
further well-defined Leibniz gauge theories.

experience the aerodynamic phenomenon of dynamic stall consisting of a
temporary overshoot of lift and detrimental fatigue loads. Particularly the
formation of dynamic stall under three-dimensional inflow conditions raises
open questions. Aerodynamic behavior of a DU 91-W2-250 wind profile undergoing
light dynamic stall is thus analyzed in a wind tunnel. Effects of a gust with
streamwise and spanwise periodic variation are investigated by comparing total
and local lift generation with flow formation above the airfoil. The observed
stall cycle is divided into five stages of which one reveals lift overshoot of
up to $16~\%$. The aerodynamic response of the airfoil shows a delay of about
$1/8$ period between evolution of local angle of attack and lift giving a
counterclockwise dynamic polar. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
analysis of the flow field contributes to understand aerodynamic consequences
of the three-dimensional gust. Local inflow, total lift as well as certain lift
events are captured by one POD eigenmode, respectively. Obtained results lead
to the conclusion that the flow and particularly the stalled wake of an airfoil
facing a three-dimensional gust are strongly coupled in the spanwise direction.
This yields to flow stabilization, inhibition of stall, and in turn,
counterclockwise dynamic polar along with augmented total lift.

observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance
degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying
reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic
study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as
compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch
dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in
instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power
Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by
(i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running
quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and
(iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running
statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions,
that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN.
Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to
bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP

owing to their ability to reproduce images. However, they can recreate training
images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and
compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the
recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by
demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy
images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators.
However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to
decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its
application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur,
compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these
problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that
can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without
knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or
quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator
model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators.
However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we
introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a
data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to
suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression,
we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between
irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative
studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ. In addition, we
demonstrate the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration.

majority on the south pole, and is consistent with the Cassini-derived age of
the south pole for a lunar-like bombardment history, our estimates of fracture
lifetimes, and with the needed parameters for parallel fracture propagation.
The model favors a bombardment history similar to that of Triton over one more
similar to that of the Galilean satellites.

Model scalar sector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and a possible future
100 TeV $pp$ collider. We focus on the scenario in which the neutral triplet
scalar is stable and contributes to the dark matter relic density. When
produced in $pp$ collisions, the charged triplet scalar decays to the neutral
component plus a soft pion or soft lepton pair, yielding a disappearing charged
track in the detector. We recast current 13TeV LHC searches for disappearing
tracks, and find that the LHC presently excludes a real triplet scalar lighter
than 248 (275) GeV, for a mass splitting of 172 (160) MeV with
$\mathcal{L}=\rm36\,$fb$^{-1}$. The reach can extend to 497 (520) GeV with the
collection of $3000\,$fb$^{-1}$. We extrapolate the 13 TeV analysis to a
prospective 100 TeV $pp$ collider, and find that a $\sim3$ TeV triplet scalar
could be discoverable with $\mathcal{L}=30$ ab$^{-1}$, depending on the degree
to which pile up effects are under control. We also investigate the dark matter
candidate in our model and corresponding present and prospective constraints
from dark matter direct detection. We find that currently XENON1T can exclude a
real triplet dark matter lighter than $\sim3$ TeV for a Higgs portal coupling
of order one or larger, and the future XENON20T will cover almost the entire
dark matter viable parameter space except for vanishingly small portal
coupling.

measurements of the diffuse synchrotron emission using the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey

before and after subtracting the modelled point sources. The amplitude of the
measured $C_{\ell}$ falls significantly after subtracting the point sources,
and it is also slightly higher in the Galactic plane for the residual data. The
residual $C_{\ell}$ is most likely to be dominated by the Galactic synchrotron
emission. The amplitude of the residual $C_{\ell}$ falls significantly away
from the Galactic plane. We find the measurements are quite symmetric in the
Northern and Southern hemispheres except in the latitude range $15-30^{\circ}$
which is the transition region from the disk dominated to diffuse halo

the scaled version of the Haslam rms map at 150 {\rm MHz} shows that the

combinations of TM and TE waves) mixed PT-symmetric phases can be realized and
the extent of these phases can be highly controlled by either or both the
chirality and the angle of incidence. Additionally, while the transmission of
both TM and TE waves in non-chiral PT-symmetric systems is the same for forward

rotation and ellipticity in the polarization state of the transmitted wave. Our
results constitute a simple example of a chiral PT-symmetric optical system in

evolutionary trajectories of the statefinder hierarchy $S_3^1$, $S_3^2$

the Universe evolution. One of the favourable appliance for exploring the dark

from the source domain is abundant, labelled data from the target domain is

detect the presence of medical conditions based on data from consumer-grade
portable biosensors. It addresses some of the key problems in this area,
namely, the difficulty of acquiring large quantities of clinically labelled
data from the biosensor, and the noise and ambiguity that can affect the
clinical labels. The idea is to pre-train an expressive model on a large
dataset of labelled recordings from a sensor modality for which data is
abundant, and then to adapt the model's lower layers so that its predictions on
the target modality are similar to the original model's on paired examples from
the source modality. We show that the pre-trained model's predictions provide a
substantially better learning signal than the clinician-provided labels, and
that this teacher-student technique significantly outperforms both a naive
application of supervised deep learning and a label-supervised version of
domain adaptation on a synthetic dataset and in a real-world case study on

statistical learning. In particular, the sparse singular value decomposition
and its variants have been utilized in multivariate regression, factor
analysis, biclustering, vector time series modeling, among others. The appeal
of this factorization is owing to its power in discovering a
highly-interpretable latent association network, either between samples and
variables or between responses and predictors. However, many existing methods
are either ad hoc without a general performance guarantee, or are
computationally intensive, rendering them unsuitable for large-scale studies.
We formulate the statistical problem as a sparse factor regression and tackle
it with a divide-and-conquer approach. In the first stage of division, we
consider both sequential and parallel approaches for simplifying the task into
a set of co-sparse unit-rank estimation (CURE) problems, and establish the
statistical underpinnings of these commonly-adopted and yet poorly understood
deflation methods. In the second stage of division, we innovate a contended
stagewise learning technique, consisting of a sequence of simple incremental
updates, to efficiently trace out the whole solution paths of CURE. Our
algorithm has a much lower computational complexity than alternating convex
search, and the choice of the step size enables a flexible and principled
tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Our work is
among the first to enable stagewise learning for non-convex problems, and the
idea can be applicable in many multi-convex problems. Extensive simulation
studies and an application in genetics demonstrate the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach.

the hypothesis test as well as for identifying the regions of difference. This
identification of difference regions is a distinct feature, as existing methods
tend to conduct an overall hypothesis test stating whether two functions are
different. Understanding the difference regions can lead to further practical
insights and help devise better control and maintenance strategies for wind
turbines. The merit of funGP is demonstrated by using three simulation studies

the past three decades: mainly because of this, Bayesian inference is now a
workhorse of applied scientists. Under general conditions, MCMC sampling
converges asymptotically to the posterior distribution, but this provides no
guarantees about its performance in finite time. The predominant method for
monitoring convergence is to run multiple chains and monitor individual chains'
characteristics and compare these to the population as a whole: if within-chain
and between-chain summaries are comparable, then this is taken to indicate that
the chains have converged to a common stationary distribution. Here, we
introduce a new method for diagnosing convergence based on how well a machine
learning classifier model can successfully discriminate the individual chains.
We call this convergence measure $R^*$. In contrast to the predominant
$\widehat{R}$, $R^*$ is a single statistic across all parameters that indicates
lack of mixing, although individual variables' importance for this metric can
also be determined. Additionally, $R^*$ is not based on any single
characteristic of the sampling distribution; instead it uses all the
information in the chain, including that given by the joint sampling
distribution, which is currently largely overlooked by existing approaches. We
recommend calculating $R^*$ using two different machine learning classifiers -
gradient-boosted regression trees and random forests - which each work well in
models of different dimensions. Because each of these methods outputs a
classification probability, as a byproduct, we obtain uncertainty in $R^*$. The
method is straightforward to implement and could be a complementary additional
check on MCMC convergence for applied analyses.

(CSM) based on the Nilsson potential with pairing correlations treated by the
PNC method. A detailed comparison between these three models in the description
of the ground state rotational bands of even-even Er and Yb isotopes is
performed. The similarities and differences between these models in the
description of the moments of inertia, the features of band crossings,
equilibrium deformations and pairing energies of even-even nuclei under study
are discussed. These quantities are considered as a function of rotational
frequency and proton and neutron numbers. The changes in the properties of the
first band crossings with increasing neutron number in this mass region are
investigated. On average, a comparable accuracy of the description of available

model predictions become larger above the first band crossings. Because of
time-consuming nature of numerical calculations in the CDFT-based models, a
systematic study of the rotational properties of both ground state and excited

  $Bounded Distance Decoding $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ is the problem of decoding a
lattice when the target point is promised to be within an $\alpha$ factor of
the minimum distance of the lattice, in the $\ell_{p}$ norm. We prove that
$\BDD_{p, \alpha}$ is $\NP$-hard under randomized reductions where $\alpha \to
1/2$ as $p \to \infty$ (and for $\alpha=1/2$ when $p=\infty$), thereby showing
the hardness of decoding for distances approaching the unique-decoding radius
for large $p$. We also show fine-grained hardness for $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$. For
example, we prove that for all $p \in [1,\infty) \setminus 2\Z$ and constants
$C > 1, \eps > 0$, there is no $2^{(1-\eps)n/C}$-time algorithm for
$\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ for some constant $\alpha$ (which approaches $1/2$ as $p \to
\infty$), assuming the randomized Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).
Moreover, essentially all of our results also hold (under analogous non-uniform
assumptions) for $\BDD$ with preprocessing, in which unbounded precomputation
can be applied to the lattice before the target is available.
  Compared to prior work on the hardness of $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ by Liu,
Lyubashevsky, and Micciancio (APPROX-RANDOM 2008), our results improve the
values of $\alpha$ for which the problem is known to be $\NP$-hard for all $p >
p_1 \approx 4.2773$, and give the very first fine-grained hardness for $\BDD$
(in any norm). Our reductions rely on a special family of ""locally dense""
lattices in $\ell_{p}$ norms, which we construct by modifying the
integer-lattice sparsification technique of Aggarwal and Stephens-Davidowitz
(STOC 2018).

intrusions. Recent research has shown that risks may be mitigated by simulating
EHRs through generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks. Yet the methods
developed to date are limited because they 1) focus on generating data of a
single type (e.g., diagnosis codes), neglecting other data types (e.g.,
demographics, procedures or vital signs) and 2) do not represent constraints
between features. In this paper, we introduce a method to simulate EHRs
composed of multiple data types by 1) refining the GAN model, 2) accounting for
feature constraints, and 3) incorporating key utility measures for such
generation tasks. Our analysis with over $770,000$ EHRs from Vanderbilt

performance in terms of retaining basic statistics, cross-feature correlations,
latent structural properties, feature constraints and associated patterns from
real data, without sacrificing privacy.

systems. They collect runtime events and allow tracking of code execution,
which enables a variety of critical tasks such as troubleshooting and fault
detection. However, large-scale software systems generate massive volumes of
semi-structured log records, posing a major challenge for automated analysis.
Parsing semi-structured records with free-form text log messages into
structured templates is the first and crucial step that enables further
analysis. Existing approaches rely on log-specific heuristics or manual rule
extraction. These are often specialized in parsing certain log types, and thus,
limit performance scores and generalization. We propose a novel parsing
technique called NuLog that utilizes a self-supervised learning model and
formulates the parsing task as masked language modeling (MLM). In the process
of parsing, the model extracts summarizations from the logs in the form of a
vector embedding. This allows the coupling of the MLM as pre-training with a
downstream anomaly detection task. We evaluate the parsing performance of NuLog
on 10 real-world log datasets and compare the results with 12 parsing
techniques. The results show that NuLog outperforms existing methods in parsing
accuracy with an average of 99% and achieves the lowest edit distance to the
ground truth templates. Additionally, two case studies are conducted to
demonstrate the ability of the approach for log-based anomaly detection in both
supervised and unsupervised scenario. The results show that NuLog can be
successfully used to support troubleshooting tasks. The implementation is
available at https://github.com/nulog/nulog.

preferences of a risk-averse agent in the extreme loss scenarios. To study the
effectiveness of randomization in interdiction games with an interdictor that
is both risk and ambiguity averse, we introduce a distributionally robust
network interdiction game where the interdictor randomizes over the feasible
interdiction plans in order to minimize the worst-case CVaR of the flow with
respect to both the unknown distribution of the capacity of the arcs and his
mixed strategy over interdicted arcs. The flow player, on the contrary,
maximizes the total flow in the network. By using the budgeted uncertainty set,
we control the degree of conservatism in the model and reformulate the
interdictor's non-linear problem as a bi-convex optimization problem. For
solving this problem to any given optimality level, we devise a spatial branch
and bound algorithm that uses the McCormick inequalities and reduced
reformulation linearization technique (RRLT) to obtain convex relaxation of the
problem. We also develop a column generation algorithm to identify the optimal
support of the convex relaxation which is then used in the coordinate descent
algorithm to determine the upper bounds. The efficiency and convergence of the
spatial branch and bound algorithm is established in the numerical experiments.
Further, our numerical experiments show that randomized strategies can have
significantly better in-sample and out-of-sample performance than optimal
deterministic ones.

With decreasing dimensions, light-matter interaction becomes stronger,
potentially leading to efficient and ultrafast radiative emission, both in the
spontaneous and stimulated regime. These features have created wide
expectations for the practical prospects of such nanoscale light sources, in
particular for optical interconnects. In this article we examine the limits to
the downscaling of LEDs and lasers, and ask ourselves which type of source is
most suited to ultralow-power optical communications. Based on simple physical
considerations on the scaling of spontaneous and stimulated emission rates for

of spontaneous emission enhancement (Purcell effect) in practical nanophotonic

nanolasers with active dimensions in the range of few 100s nm may enable direct
modulation rates larger than 40 Gb/s at power levels adequate for

partial label information can be inferred from otherwise unlabeled examples and

exists when subsets of training examples are known to have the same label, even

a linear model. In this paper, we investigate the benefit of using partial

2.3~$\times$~10$^{-16}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. The flux ratio $F_{\rm
H\beta}$/$F_{\rm H\alpha}$ for PDS~70b is $<$~0.28. Numerical investigations by
Aoyama et al. (2018) suggest that $F_{\rm H\beta}$/$F_{\rm H\alpha}$ should be
close to unity if the extinction is negligible. We attribute the reduction of
the flux ratio to the extinction, and estimate the extinction of H$\alpha$
($A_{\rm H\alpha}$) for PDS~70b to be $>$~2.0~mag using the interstellar
extinction value. %The expected $A_{\rm H\alpha}$ value in the gap of the
protoplanetary disk at the PDS~70b location is 2.4~mag, which is consistent
with the estimated extinction. By combining with the H$\alpha$ linewidth and
the dereddening line luminosity of H$\alpha$, %we derive the PDS~70b dynamical
mass and mass accretion rate to be \hashimotor{12~$\pm$~3~$M_{\rm Jup}$} and
$\gtrsim$~5~$\times$~10$^{-7}$~$M_{\rm Jup}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. we derive
the PDS~70b mass accretion rate to be $\gtrsim$~5~$\times$~10$^{-7}$~$M_{\rm
Jup}$~yr$^{-1}$. The PDS~70b mass accretion rate is an order of magnitude
larger than that of PDS~70. We found that the filling factor $f_{\rm f}$ (the
fractional area of the planetary surface emitting H$\alpha$) is $\gtrsim$0.01,
which is similar to the typical stellar value. The small value of $f_{\rm f}$
indicates that the H$\alpha$ emitting areas are localized at the surface of
PDS~70b.

  autoencoders at the example of liver segmentation in CT images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) constitutes a large portion of research in medical image
analysis. The majority of CNN-based methods rely on an abundance of labeled
data for proper training. Labeled medical data is often scarce, but unlabeled
data is more widely available. This necessitates approaches that go beyond
traditional supervised learning and leverage unlabeled data for segmentation
tasks. This work investigates the potential of autoencoder-extracted features
to improve segmentation with a CNN. Two strategies were considered. First,
transfer learning where pretrained autoencoder features were used as
initialization for the convolutional layers in the segmentation network.
Second, multi-task learning where the tasks of segmentation and feature
extraction, by means of input reconstruction, were learned and optimized
simultaneously. A convolutional autoencoder was used to extract features from
unlabeled data and a multi-scale, fully convolutional CNN was used to perform
the target task of 3D liver segmentation in CT images. For both strategies,
experiments were conducted with varying amounts of labeled and unlabeled
training data. The proposed learning strategies improved results in $75\%$ of
the experiments compared to training from scratch and increased the dice score
by up to $0.040$ and $0.024$ for a ratio of unlabeled to labeled training data
of about $32 : 1$ and $12.5 : 1$, respectively. The results indicate that both
training strategies are more effective with a large ratio of unlabeled to
labeled training data.

considering different bases, we are able to account for the dynamics of the
particular system, yielding sensor arrays that are nearly Pareto optimal in
sensor cost and performance in the chosen basis. This flexibility extends our
framework to include actuation and dynamic estimation, and to select sensors
without training data. We provide three examples from the physical and
engineering sciences and evaluate sensor selection in three dynamically
relevant bases: truncated balanced modes for control systems, dynamic mode

sciences, nonlinear regression (NLR) models often perform only slightly better
and occasionally worse than linear regression (LR). The proposed reason for
this conundrum is that NLR models can give predictions much worse than LR when
given input data which lie outside the domain used in model training.
Continuous unbounded variables are widely used in environmental sciences,
whence not uncommon for new input data to lie far outside the training domain.
For six environmental datasets, inputs in the test data were classified as
""outliers"" and ""non-outliers"" based on the Mahalanobis distance from the
training input data. The prediction scores (mean absolute error, Spearman
correlation) showed NLR to outperform LR for the non-outliers, but often
underperform LR for the outliers. An approach based on Occam's Razor (OR) was
proposed, where linear extrapolation was used instead of nonlinear
extrapolation for the outliers. The linear extrapolation to the outlier domain
was based on the NLR model within the non-outlier domain. This
NLR$_{\mathrm{OR}}$ approach reduced occurrences of very poor extrapolation by
NLR, and it tended to outperform NLR and LR for the outliers. In conclusion,
input test data should be screened for outliers. For outliers, the unreliable
NLR predictions can be replaced by NLR$_{\mathrm{OR}}$ or LR predictions, or by
issuing a ""no reliable prediction"" warning.

stable periodic pulse trains via repeated self-excitation after passage through
the delayed feedback loop, as well as their bifurcations. We show that onset
and termination of such pulse trains correspond to the simultaneous bifurcation
of countably many fold periodic orbits with infinite period in this delay
differential equation. We employ numerical continuation and the concept of
reappearance of periodic solutions to show that these bifurcations coincide
with codimension-two points along families of connecting orbits and fold
periodic orbits in a related advanced differential equation. These points
include heteroclinic connections between steady states, as well as homoclinic
bifurcations with non-hyperbolic equilibria. Tracking these codimension-two
points in parameter space reveals the critical parameter values for the
existence of periodic pulse trains. We use the recently developed theory of
temporal dissipative solitons to infer necessary conditions for the stability
of such pulse trains.

unmanned drone software, are reliant on integrated CPU/GPU platforms for their
DNNs-driven workload, such as perception and other highly parallel components.
In this work, we set out to explore the hidden performance implication of GPU
memory management methods of integrated CPU/GPU architecture. Through a series
of experiments on micro-benchmarks and real-world workloads, we find that the
performance under different memory management methods may vary according to
application characteristics. Based on this observation, we develop a
performance model that can predict system overhead for each memory management
method based on application characteristics. Guided by the performance model,
we further propose a runtime scheduler. By conducting per-task memory
management policy switching and kernel overlapping, the scheduler can
significantly relieve the system memory pressure and reduce the multitasking
co-run response time. We have implemented and extensively evaluated our system
prototype on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Drive PX2, and Xavier AGX platforms, using
both Rodinia benchmark suite and two real-world case studies of drone software

important tool in the understanding superconducting fluctuations and, in
particular, vortex motion near critical points. However, in most materials, the
Nernst signal in a typical experimental setup rarely exceeds a few $\mu$V, in
some cases being as low as a few nV. DC measurements of such small signals
require extensive signal processing and protection against stray pickups and
offsets, limiting the sensitivity of such measurements to $>$5nV. Here we
describe a method utilizing a one-heater-two-thermometer setup with the heating
element and thermometers fabricated on-chip with the sample, which helped to
reduce thermal load and temperature lag between the substrate and thermometer.
Using AC heating power and 2$\omega$ measurement, we are able to achieve
sub-nanovolt sensitivity in 20-30nm MoGe thin films on glass substrate,
compared to a sensitivity of $\sim$9nV using DC techniques on the same setup.

scale symmetries in scalar-tensor gravity with two scalar fields, one of which
couples nonminimally to scalar curvature while the other is a normal scalar
field. In case of a global scale symmetry, by moving from the Jordan frame to
the Einstein frame, a normal scalar field becomes massive while the dilaton
remains massless after the SSB. In case of a local scale symmetry, we take a
gauge fixing condition for the local scale invariance, $a R + b \phi^2 = k$,
which was found in our previous study of a Weyl's quadratic gravity. Together
with locally scale invariant potential terms in a classical action, this gauge
condition generates a Higgs potential whose vacuum expectation value (VEV)
produces the Einstein-Hilbert action with an $R^2$ term in the lowest level of
approximation. One interesting aspect in this model is that a massless
Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with a scale invariance is absorbed into the
metric tensor field and consequently an $R^2$ term is induced in the action.

nonlinear constraints. This is especially true in programs that perform many
numerical operations, such as control systems for avionics or industrial
plants. Recently, data-driven methods for loop invariant inference have shown
promise, especially on linear invariants. However, applying data-driven
inference to nonlinear loop invariants is challenging due to the large numbers
of and magnitudes of high-order terms, the potential for overfitting on a small
number of samples, and the large space of possible inequality bounds.
  In this paper, we introduce a new neural architecture for general SMT
learning, the Gated Continuous Logic Network (G-CLN), and apply it to nonlinear
loop invariant learning. G-CLNs extend the Continuous Logic Network (CLN)
architecture with gating units and dropout, which allow the model to robustly
learn general invariants over large numbers of terms. To address overfitting
that arises from finite program sampling, we introduce fractional sampling---a
sound relaxation of loop semantics to continuous functions that facilitates
unbounded sampling on real domain. We additionally design a new CLN activation
function, the Piecewise Biased Quadratic Unit (PBQU), for naturally learning
tight inequality bounds.
  We incorporate these methods into a nonlinear loop invariant inference system
that can learn general nonlinear loop invariants. We evaluate our system on a
benchmark of nonlinear loop invariants and show it solves 26 out of 27
problems, 3 more than prior work, with an average runtime of 53.3 seconds. We
further demonstrate the generic learning ability of G-CLNs by solving all 124
problems in the linear Code2Inv benchmark. We also perform a quantitative
stability evaluation and show G-CLNs have a convergence rate of $97.5\%$ on
quadratic problems, a $39.2\%$ improvement over CLN models.

areas which might benefit from bot adoption. Aim: We aim to categorize the Bot
Commits by the type of change (files added, deleted, or modified), find the
more commonly changed file types, and identify the groups of file types that
tend to get updated together. Method: 12,326,137 commits made by 461 popular
bots (that made at least 1000 commits) were examined to identify the frequency
and the type of files added/ deleted/ modified by the commits, and association
rule mining was used to identify the types of files modified together. Result:
Majority of the bot commits modify an existing file, a few of them add new
files, while deletion of a file is very rare. Commits involving more than one
type of operation are even rarer. Files containing data, configuration, and
documentation are most frequently updated, while HTML is the most common type
in terms of the number of files added, deleted, and modified. Files of the type
""Markdown"", ""Ignore List"", ""YAML"", ""JSON"" were the types that are updated
together with other types of files most frequently. Conclusion: We observe that
majority of bot commits involve single file modifications, and bots primarily
work with data, configuration, and documentation files. A better understanding
if this is a limitation of the bots and, if overcome, would lead to different
kinds of bots remains an open question.

  Information Disclosure","36 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a dynamic information design problem in a finite-horizon setting
consisting of two strategic and long-term optimizing agents, namely a principal
(he) and a detector (she). The principal observes the evolution of a Markov
chain that has two states, one ""good"" and one ""bad"" absorbing state, and has to
decide how to sequentially disclose information to the detector. The detector's
only information consists of the messages she receives from the principal. The
detector's objective is to detect as accurately as possible the time of the
jump from the good to the bad state. The principal's objective is to delay the
detector as much as possible from detective the jump to the bad state. For this
setting, we determine the optimal strategies of the principal and the detector.
The detector's optimal strategy is described by time-varying thresholds on her
posterior belief of the good state. We prove that it is optimal for the
principal to give no information to the detector before a time threshold, run a
mixed strategy to confuse the detector at the threshold time, and reveal the
true state afterwards. We present an algorithm that determines both the optimal
time threshold and the optimal mixed strategy that could be employed by the
principal. We show, through numerical experiments, that this optimal sequential
mechanism significantly outperforms any other information disclosure strategy
presented in literature.

problem, which consists in finding a set $S$ of at most $k$ seed users, in a

studies a related but slightly different problem: We want to find a set $S$ of
at most $k$ seed users that maximizes the spread of information, when $S$ is
added to an already pre-existing - but unknown - set of seed users $T$. We
consider such scenario to be very realistic. Assume a central entity wants to
spread a piece of news, while having a budget to influence $k$ users. This
central authority may know that some users are already aware of the information
and are going to spread it anyhow. The identity of these users being however
completely unknown. We model this optimization problem using the Group Shapley
value, a well-founded concept from cooperative game theory. While the standard
influence maximization problem is easy to approximate within a factor
$1-1/e-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$, assuming common computational complexity
conjectures, we obtain strong hardness of approximation results for the problem
at hand in this paper. Maybe most prominently, we show that it cannot be
approximated within $1/n^{o(1)}$ under the Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Hence, it is unlikely to achieve anything better than a polynomial factor
approximation. Nevertheless, we show that a greedy algorithm can achieve a
factor of $\frac{1-1/e}{k}-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$, showing that not all

conditional expectation of $H_T$ with respect to $\mathcal F_t$, where the
expectation is under the risk neutral measure and the interest rate is
constant. Then $S_{T^-} = H_T$, and $S_t = 0$ for $t\geq T$. In the general

lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for phase change and multiphase flow simulation.
One attractive feature of the original proposed method consists on its
simplicity of adding a force dependent on a nearest-neighbor potential
function, which became known as the Shan-Chen interaction force. Some of the
well known drawbacks implied by this method involves lack of thermodynamic
consistency and impossibility to control the surface tension independently. In
order to correct these deficiencies, different approaches were developed in the
literature, such as multirange interactions potential, which involves larger
stencils than nearest-neighbor approach, and modified forcing schemes. In this
work, a strategy is developed to control the liquid-gas density ratio and the
surface tension by means of an appropriate interaction force field using only
nearest-neighbor interactions. The proposed procedure is devised starting from
the desired pressure tensor, which allow for the control of the equilibrium
multiphase properties such as liquid-gas coexistence curve and surface tension.
Then, it is shown how to derive an external force field able to replicate the
effects of this pressure tensor in the macroscopic conservation equations. The
final step of our procedure is implementing this external force in the LBE by
using the classical Guo forcing scheme. Numerical tests regarding static and
dynamic flow conditions were performed. Results obtained from simulations
showed good agreement with expected analytical values. Most divergent solution
observed was the droplet oscillation period under certain flow conditions,
which deviated 9% from expected analytical result. The observed results
corroborate that the proposed method is able to replicate the desired
macroscopic multiphase behaviour.

for each point in the state-space; however, we demonstrate through example how
tight decomposition functions can sometimes be calculated in closed form. As a
second contribution, we show how under-approximations of reachable sets can be
efficiently computed via the mixed-monotonicity property by considering the

What is more interesting is that adversarial examples generated for one machine

stride in studying adversarial transferability in wearable sensor systems from
the following perspectives: 1) transferability between machine learning

untargeted transferability in most cases. Targeted attacks were less successful
with success scores from $0\%$ to $80\%$. The transferability of adversarial
examples depends on many factors such as the inclusion of data from all

The transferability of adversarial examples decreases sharply when the data

can detect the polarization resulting from the rotational distortion of a
rapidly rotating B-type star. Here we investigate the extension of this
approach to an A-type star. Linear-polarization observations of $\alpha$ Oph
(A5IV) have been obtained over wavelengths from 400 to 750 nm. They show the
wavelength dependence expected for a rapidly-rotating star combined with a
contribution from interstellar polarization. We model the observations by
fitting rotating-star polarization models and adding additional constraints
including a measured $v_e \sin{i}$. However, we cannot fully separate the
effects of rotation rate and inclination, leaving a range of possible
solutions. We determine a rotation rate $\omega = \Omega/\Omega_ c$ between
0.83 and 0.98 and an axial inclination i > 60 deg. The rotation-axis position
angle is found to be 142 $\pm$ 4 deg, differing by 16 deg from a value obtained
by interferometry. This might be due to precession of the rotation axis due to
interaction with the binary companion. Other parameters resulting from the
analysis include a polar temperature Tp = 8725 $\pm$ 175 K, polar gravity
$\log{g_p} = 3.93 \pm 0.08$ (dex cgs), and polar radius $R_{\rm p} = 2.52 \pm
0.06$ Rsun. Comparison with rotating-star evolutionary models indicates that
$\alpha$ Oph is in the later half of its main-sequence evolution and must have
had an initial $\omega$ of 0.8 or greater. The interstellar polarization has a
maximum value at a wavelength ($\lambda_{\rm max}$) of $440 \pm 110$ nm,
consistent with values found for other nearby stars.

$A(x)=1+\sum_{n\geq 1} a_n x^n$ and $B(x)=1+\sum_{n\geq 1} b_n x^n$ determines
the number $b_n$ of rooted planar trees with $n$ vertices such that each vertex
having $i$ children can have one of $a_i$ distinct colors. Kuperberg proved in
\cite{Kuperberg} that this identity holds in the case that $b_n=\dim
\text{Inv}_{G_2} (V(\lambda_1)^{\otimes n})$, where $V(\lambda_1)$ is the
7-dimensional fundamental representation of $G_2$, and $a_n$ is the number of
triangulations of a regular $n$-gon such that each internal vertex has degree
at least $6$. He also observed that $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{a_n}\leq
7/B(1/7)$ and conjectured that this estimate is sharp, or in terms of power

prove this conjecture by introducing a new criterion for sharpness in the
analogous estimate for general power series $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ satisfying
$B(x)=A(xB(x))$. Moreover, by way of singularity analysis performed on a
recently-discovered generating function for $B(x)$, we significantly refine the

to flyby missions for Ice Giants. Presently, a mission to Neptune using
electrodynamic tethers is under consideration due to the ability of tethers to
provide free propulsion and power for orbital insertion as well as additional
exploratory maneuvering --- providing more mission capability than a standard
orbiter mission. Tether operation depends on plasma density and magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}$, though tethers can deal with ill-defined density profiles, with
the anodic segment self-adjusting to accommodate densities. Planetary magnetic
fields are due to currents in some small volume inside the planet,
magnetic-moment vector, and typically a dipole law approximation --- which
describes the field outside. When compared with Saturn and Jupiter, the
Neptunian magnetic structure is significantly more complex: the dipole is
located below the equatorial plane, is highly offset from the planet center,
and at large tilt with its rotation axis. Lorentz-drag work decreases quickly
with distance, thus requiring spacecraft periapsis at capture close to the
planet and allowing the large offset to make capture efficiency
(spacecraft-to-tether mass ratio) well above a no-offset case. The S/C might
optimally reach periapsis when crossing the meridian plane of the dipole, with
the S/C facing it; this convenient synchronism is eased by Neptune rotating
little during capture. Calculations yield maximum efficiency of approximately
12, whereas a $10^{\circ}$ meridian error would reduce efficiency by about 6%.
Efficiency results suggest new calculations should be made to fully include
Neptunian rotation and consider detailed dipole and quadrupole corrections.

numerical simulations to explore the nonlinear, statistically steady state of
the fluctuation dynamo in driven turbulence. We demonstrate that as the
magnetic field growth saturates, its amplification and diffusion are both
affected by the back-reaction of the Lorentz force upon the flow. The
amplification of the magnetic field is reduced due to stronger alignment
between the velocity field, magnetic field, and electric current density.
Furthermore, we confirm that the amplification decreases due to a weaker
stretching of the magnetic field lines. The enhancement in diffusion relative
to the field line stretching is quantified by a decrease in the computed local
value of the magnetic Reynolds number. Using the Minkowski functionals, we
quantify the shape of the magnetic structures produced by the dynamo as
magnetic filaments and ribbons in both kinematic and saturated dynamos and
derive the scalings of the typical length, width, and thickness of the magnetic
structures with the magnetic Reynolds number. We show that all three of these

from human-computer interface to surveillance and content-based video
retrieval. For human pose estimation, joint obstructions and overlapping upon
human bodies result in departed pose estimation. To address these problems, by
integrating priors of the structure of human bodies, we present a novel
structure-aware network to discreetly consider such priors during the training
of the network. Typically, learning such constraints is a challenging task.
Instead, we propose generative adversarial networks as our learning model in
which we design two residual multiple instance learning (MIL) models with the
identical architecture, one is used as the generator and the other one is used
as the discriminator. The discriminator task is to distinguish the actual poses
from the fake ones. If the pose generator generates the results that the
discriminator is not able to distinguish from the real ones, the model has
successfully learnt the priors. In the proposed model, the discriminator
differentiates the ground-truth heatmaps from the generated ones, and later the
adversarial loss back-propagates to the generator. Such procedure assists the
generator to learn reasonable body configurations and is proved to be
advantageous to improve the pose estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, we propose a

used to extract salient information in semantic and structural aspect and

sheet densities ranging from 2 to 6$\times10^{12}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$ and typical
mobilities measured from 60 to 100 cm$^{2}$/(V$\cdot$s) at room temperature.
Existing data from literature was also used, which spans sheet densities above
1$\times10^{13}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$. Our analysis indicates that for low sheet
densities, surface impurity scattering by charged acceptors and surface
roughness are not sufficient to account for the low mobility. Moreover, the
experimental data suggests that long-range potential fluctuations exist at the
diamond surface, and are particularly enhanced at lower sheet densities. Thus,
we propose a second type of surface impurity scattering which is caused by

modeled using the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model and its
parameters determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The lack of data
at TeV energies means many of the parameters cannot be uniquely determined and
are correlated. These are studied in detail. We found that the optimal solution
can be uniquely determined only when we apply a constraint to one of four
parameters: the magnetic field (B), Doppler factor, size of the emitting
region, and normalization factor of the electron energy distribution. We used
31 sets of SED from 2009 to 2014 with optical-UV data observed with UVOT/Swift
and the Kanata telescope, X-ray data with XRT/Swift, and gamma-ray data with
the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The result of our SED analysis suggests
that, in the X-ray faint state, the emission occurs in a relatively small area
(~ 10^16 cm) with relatively strong magnetic field (B~10^-1 G). The X-ray
bright state shows a tendency opposite to that of the faint state, that is, a
large emitting area (~10^18 cm), probably in the downstream of the jet and weak
magnetic field (B~10^-3 G). The high X-ray flux was due to an increase in the
maximum energy of electrons. On the other hand, the presence of two kinds of
emitting areas implies that the one-zone model is unsuitable to reproduce, at
least a part of the observed SEDs.

effective Hamiltonian for efficient simulation. Control pulse sequences are
designed by maintaining a fixed adiabaticity, so that different shuttling
conditions can be systematically compared. We first use these tools to optimize
the device geometry for maximum transport velocity, considering only orbital
states and neglecting valley and spin degrees of freedom. Taking realistic
geometrical constraints into account, charge shuttling speeds up to $\sim$300
m/s preserve adiabaticity. Coherent spin transport is simulated by including
spin-orbit and valley terms in an effective Hamiltonian, shuttling one member
of a singlet pair and tracking the entanglement fidelity. With realistic device
and material parameters, shuttle speeds in the range 10-100 m/s with high spin
entanglement fidelities are obtained when the tunneling energy exceeds the
Zeeman energy. High fidelity also requires the inter-dot valley phase
difference to be below a threshold determined by the ratio of tunneling and
Zeeman energies, so that spin-valley-orbit mixing is weak. In this regime, we
find that the primary source of infidelity is a coherent spin rotation that is
correctable, in principle. The results pertain to proposals for large-scale

potential for free fields. Previous studies have explained this phenomena by
relating de Sitter free field equations of motion to the time-independent
Schrodinger equation with known transparent potentials. In this work we show
that de Sitter's transparency is a consequence of an infinite set of ""hidden""
symmetries. These symmetries arise from an accidental symmetry for the
zero-mode of matter fields, as well as the boost isometry of de Sitter space.
For simplicity, we consider the case of massive Klein-Gordon theory. We show
that the Noether charges associated with these hidden symmetries distinguish
the two linearly-independent solutions of the free field wave equation in the
asymptotic past and future of de Sitter. Conservation of these charges requires
that the asymptotic behavior of any solution be identical, up to a constant
phase, in the future and the past, which is the property of transparency. In
the quantized theory, these charges act trivially on particle states belonging
to the in/out vacuum Fock space. For particle states constructed from other
vacua, the action of the charges generates particles. We comment on how these
hidden symmetries may be present in interacting theories.

the design of intelligent vehicles and customized interaction interface. In
this study, a unified driver behavior reasoning system toward multi-scale and
multi-tasks behavior recognition is proposed. Specifically, a multi-scale
driver behavior recognition system is designed to recognize both the driver's
physical and mental states based on a deep encoder-decoder framework. This
system can jointly recognize three driver behaviors with different time scales
based on the shared encoder network. Driver body postures and mental behaviors
include intention and emotion are studied and identified. The encoder network
is designed based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and several
decoders for different driver states estimation are proposed with fully
connected (FC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural
networks (RNN). The joint feature learning with the CNN encoder increases the
computational efficiency and feature diversity, while the customized decoders
enable an efficient multi-tasks inference. The proposed framework can be used
as a solution to exploit the relationship between different driver states, and
it is found that when drivers generate lane change intentions, their emotions
usually keep neutral state and more focus on the task. Two naturalistic
datasets are used to investigate the model performance, which is a local
highway dataset, namely, CranData and one public dataset from Brain4Cars. The
testing results on these two datasets show accurate performance and outperform
existing methods on driver postures, intention, and emotion recognition.

strategies. One strategy is to generate vision-guided language embedding for

segmentation by easing the domain shift between the source domain (synthetic
data) and the target domain (real data) in this work. State-of-the-art
approaches prove that performing semantic-level alignment is helpful in
tackling the domain shift issue. Based on the observation that stuff categories
usually share similar appearances across images of different domains while
things (i.e. object instances) have much larger differences, we propose to
improve the semantic-level alignment with different strategies for stuff
regions and for things: 1) for the stuff categories, we generate feature
representation for each class and conduct the alignment operation from the
target domain to the source domain; 2) for the thing categories, we generate
feature representation for each individual instance and encourage the instance
in the target domain to align with the most similar one in the source domain.
In this way, the individual differences within thing categories will also be
considered to alleviate over-alignment. In addition to our proposed method, we
further reveal the reason why the current adversarial loss is often unstable in
minimizing the distribution discrepancy and show that our method can help ease
this issue by minimizing the most similar stuff and instance features between
the source and the target domains. We conduct extensive experiments in two
unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, i.e. GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to
Cityscapes, and achieve the new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.

Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Convolution Network (denoted as ""STH"") which

parameter cost. Different from existing works that sequentially or parallelly
extract spatial and temporal information with different convolutional layers,
we divide the input channels into multiple groups and interleave the spatial

spatial and temporal clues. Such a design enables efficient spatio-temporal
modeling and maintains a small model scale. STH-Conv is a general building
block, which can be plugged into existing 2D CNN architectures such as ResNet
and MobileNet by replacing the conventional 2D-Conv blocks (2D convolutions).
STH network achieves competitive or even better performance than its

the existence of moduli spaces and tautological classes whose intersection
theory produces an analogue of the celebrated ELSV formula for single Hurwitz

  In this paper, we present three formulas that express one-part double Hurwitz

Hodge classes on moduli spaces of stable maps to classifying spaces; the second
involves Chiodo classes on moduli spaces of spin curves; and the third involves
tautological classes on moduli spaces of stable curves. We proceed to discuss
the merits of these formulas against a list of desired properties enunciated by

at further structure underlying Chiodo classes. The paper concludes with

opportunity to study the two-neutron ($2n$) correlation at the east shore of
the island of inversion where the $N = 28$ shell closure is lost.
  Purpose: We aim to present the first three-body theoretical results for the
radius and total reaction cross sections of $^{31}$F. This will further help to
investigate how the pairing and breakdown of the $N = 28$ shell closure
influence the formation of the $2n$-halo structure and the anti-halo effect in
this mass region.
  Methods: A $^{29}$F$+n+n$ three-body system is described by the cluster
orbital shell model, and its total reaction cross section is calculated by the
Glauber theory.
  Results: Our three-body calculations predict 3.48-3.70 fm for the
root-mean-square radius of $^{31}$F, which corresponds to the total reaction
cross section of 1530 (1410)-1640 (1500) mb for a carbon target at 240 (900)
MeV/nucleon. The binding mechanism and halo formation in $^{31}$F are
discussed.
  Conclusions: The present study suggests a novel anti-halo effect in this mass
region: When the pairing overcome the energy gap between the $p_{3/2}$ and
$f_{7/2}$ orbits, the inversion of the occupation number of these orbits takes
place, and it diminishes the $2n$-halo structure.

ultrastable MeV electron beam. In this scheme, the electron beam produced in a
photocathode radio-frequency (rf) gun first expands under its own Coulomb force
with which a positive energy chirp is imprinted in the beam longitudinal phase
space. The beam is then sent through a double bend achromat with positive
longitudinal dispersion where electrons at the bunch tail with lower energies
follow shorter paths and thus catch up with the bunch head, leading to
longitudinal bunch compression. We show that with optimized parameter sets, the
whole beam path from the electron source to the compression point can be made
isochronous such that the time of flight for the electron beam is immune to the
fluctuations of rf amplitude. With a laser-driven THz deflector, the bunch
length and arrival time jitter for a 20 fC beam after bunch compression are
measured to be about 29 fs (FWHM) and 22 fs (FWHM), respectively. Such an
ultrashort and ultrastable electron beam allows us to achieve 50 femtosecond
(FWHM) resolution in MeV ultrafast electron diffraction where lattice
oscillation at 2.6 THz corresponding to Bismuth A1g mode is clearly observed
without correcting both the short-term timing jitter and long-term timing
drift. Furthermore, oscillating weak diffuse scattering signal related to
phonon coupling and decay is also clearly resolved thanks to the improved
temporal resolution and increased electron flux. We expect that this technique
will have a strong impact in emerging ultrashort electron beam based facilities

Capsule Network not only in the discriminator but also in the generator.
Recently, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been intensively studied.
However, generating images by GANs is difficult. Therefore, GANs sometimes
generate poor quality images. These GANs use convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). However, CNNs have the defect that the relational information between
features of the image may be lost. Capsule Network, proposed by Hinton in 2017,
overcomes the defect of CNNs. Capsule GAN reported previously uses Capsule
Network in the discriminator. However, instead of using Capsule Network,
Capsule GAN reported in previous studies uses CNNs in generator architecture
like DCGAN. This paper introduces two approaches to use Capsule Network in the
generator. One is to use DigitCaps layer from the discriminator as the input to
the generator. DigitCaps layer is the output layer of Capsule Network. It has
the features of the input images of the discriminator. The other is to use the
reverse operation of recognition process in Capsule Network in the generator.
We compare Capsule GAN proposed in this paper with conventional GAN using CNN
and Capsule GAN which uses Capsule Network in the discriminator only. The
datasets are MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and color images. We show that Capsule GAN
outperforms the GAN using CNN and the GAN using Capsule Network in the
discriminator only. The architecture of Capsule GAN proposed in this paper is a
basic architecture using Capsule Network. Therefore, we can apply the existing
improvement techniques for GANs to Capsule GAN.

However, depth cameras are not commonly available, might be expensive, and

healthy controls and PD patients based on features extracted from orofacial
kinematics. Results indicate that 2D features, extracted from color cameras

system design is to reconstruct local gradient vectors accurately at the
central server, which are computed-and-sent from the wireless devices. To
overcome this challenge, we first establish a transmission strategy to
construct sparse transmitted signals from the local gradient vectors at the
devices. We then propose a compressive sensing algorithm enabling the server to
iteratively find the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimate of the
transmitted signal by exploiting its sparsity. We also derive an analytical
threshold for the residual error at each iteration, to design the stopping
criterion of the proposed algorithm. We show that for a sparse transmitted
signal, the proposed algorithm requires less computationally complexity than
LMMSE. Simulation results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms
conventional linear beamforming approaches and reduces the performance gap
between federated learning and centralized learning with perfect
reconstruction.

occur in weakly-coupled, thermal plasmas as encountered in normal stars. We
investigate how Coulomb screening affects the structure of a system of three
alpha particles in such a plasma environment by precise three-body calculations
within the Debye-H\""uckel approximation. A three-alpha model that has the
Coulomb interaction modified in the Yukawa form is employed. Precise three-body
wave functions are obtained by a superposition of correlated Gaussian bases
with the aid of the stochastic variational method. The energy shifts of the
Hoyle state due to the Coulomb screening are obtained as a function of the
Debye screening length. The results, which automatically incorporate the finite
size effect of the Hoyle state, are consistent with the conventional result
based on the Coulomb correction to the chemical potentials of ions that are
regarded as point charges in a weakly-coupled, thermal plasma. We have given a
theoretical basis to the conventional point-charge approach to the Coulomb
screening problem relevant for nuclear reactions in normal stars by providing
the first evaluation of the Coulomb corrections to the $Q$ value of the triple
alpha process that produces a finite size Hoyle state.

Depth supervised learning has been proven as one of the most effective methods
for face anti-spoofing. Despite the great success, most previous works still
formulate the problem as a single-frame multi-task one by simply augmenting the
loss with depth, while neglecting the detailed fine-grained information and the
interplay between facial depths and moving patterns. In contrast, we design a
new approach to detect presentation attacks from multiple frames based on two
insights: 1) detailed discriminative clues (e.g., spatial gradient magnitude)
between living and spoofing face may be discarded through stacked vanilla
convolutions, and 2) the dynamics of 3D moving faces provide important clues in
detecting the spoofing faces. The proposed method is able to capture
discriminative details via Residual Spatial Gradient Block (RSGB) and encode
spatio-temporal information from Spatio-Temporal Propagation Module (STPM)
efficiently. Moreover, a novel Contrastive Depth Loss is presented for more
accurate depth supervision. To assess the efficacy of our method, we also
collect a Double-modal Anti-spoofing Dataset (DMAD) which provides actual depth
for each sample. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets including
OULU-NPU, SiW, CASIA-MFSD, Replay-Attack, and the new DMAD. Codes will be

ethnic heterogeneity, ethnic-based political inequality and discrimination are

This single-peaked relationship is robust to many alternative specifications,

access to power. Through a very simple model, I propose an explanation based on
an initial high level of political inequality, and on the incentives that more
powerful groups have to continue limiting other groups' access to power. This
explanation incorporates essential elements of several existing theories on the
relationship between group size and discrimination, and suggests a new
empirical prediction: the single-peaked pattern should be weaker in countries
where political institutions have historically been less open. This additional

designed to extract semantically aligned part-level features from pedestrian

(MTL) in the training stage. More specifically, it builds one main task (MT)
and one auxiliary task (AT) for each body part on the top of the same backbone
model. The ATs are equipped with a coarse prior of the body part locations for
training images. ATs then transfer the concept of the body parts to the MTs via
optimizing the MT parameters to identify part-relevant channels from the
backbone model. Concept transfer is accomplished by means of two novel
alignment strategies: namely, parameter space alignment via hard parameter
sharing and feature space alignment in a class-wise manner. With the aid of the
learned high-quality parameters, MTs can independently extract semantically
aligned part-level features from relevant channels in the testing stage. MPN
has three key advantages: 1) it does not need to conduct body part detection in
the inference stage; 2) its model is very compact and efficient for both
training and testing; 3) in the training stage, it requires only coarse priors
of body part locations, which are easy to obtain. Systematic experiments on
four large-scale ReID databases demonstrate that MPN consistently outperforms

fluid placed on top of a light fluid so that the density gradient is in the
direction opposite to acceleration due to gravity. We consider flows of low to

the mix-width evolution as the primary metric. The original model specified
physically reasonable but largely \emph{ad hoc} terms to account for the
inhomogeneous mechanisms involved in growing the mixing layer. We
systematically assess the role of each of the terms in the LWN model equations

introduced to maintain a finite covariance between density and specific volume,
and a spectral distortion term, introduced as spectral modifications of the
density-specific-volume covariance, both result in severely over-predicting the
mix layer growth. A simplified model eliminating those two terms is shown to
improve the capture of both mix-width evolution as well as the turbulent mass
flux velocity profiles across the mix layer at different times. However, this
simplification reveals that fidelity to other metrics such as the

Solar Telescope (NVST) in H-alpha wavelength. Knots that rose within the
prominence appear to have been preferentially located at higher altitude,
whereas those that fell were found throughout the entire prominence structure.
The descending speed of the knots near the solar surface was higher than that
far away from the solar surface. We noted that the knots near the solar surface
may run along a set of coronal loops observed from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly. Elsewhere, the majority of knots are interpreted to have descended
across more horizontal magnetic field with a nearly constant speed. This lack
of acceleration indicates that the liberated gravitational potential energy may
not manifest as an increase in kinetic energy. Assuming instead that the
descending knots were capable of exciting Alfven waves that could then
dissipate within the local corona, the gravitational potential energy of the
knots may have been converted into thermal energy. Assuming a perfectly elastic
system, we therefore estimate that the gravitational energy loss rate of these
observed knots amounts to 1/2000 of that required to heat the entire quiet-Sun,
increasing to 1/320 when considering possibly further downward motions of the
knots having disappeared in the H-alpha observations. This result suggests such

  Testing for Code Completion by Hierarchical Language Model","7 pages",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of software engineering, applying language models to the token
sequence of source code is the state-of-art approach to build a code
recommendation system. The syntax tree of source code has hierarchical
structures. Ignoring the characteristics of tree structures decreases the model
performance. Current LSTM model handles sequential data. The performance of
LSTM model will decrease sharply if the noise unseen data is distributed
everywhere in the test suite. As code has free naming conventions, it is common
for a model trained on one project to encounter many unknown words on another
project. If we set many unseen words as UNK just like the solution in natural
language processing, the number of UNK will be much greater than the sum of the
most frequently appeared words. In an extreme case, just predicting UNK at
everywhere may achieve very high prediction accuracy. Thus, such solution
cannot reflect the true performance of a model when encountering noise unseen
data. In this paper, we only mark a small number of rare words as UNK and show
the prediction performance of models under in-project and cross-project
evaluation. We propose a novel Hierarchical Language Model (HLM) to improve the
robustness of LSTM model to gain the capacity about dealing with the
inconsistency of data distribution between training and testing. The newly
proposed HLM takes the hierarchical structure of code tree into consideration
to predict code. HLM uses BiLSTM to generate embedding for sub-trees according
to hierarchies and collects the embedding of sub-trees in context to predict
next code. The experiments on inner-project and cross-project data sets
indicate that the newly proposed Hierarchical Language Model (HLM) performs
better than the state-of-art LSTM model in dealing with the data inconsistency
between training and testing and achieves averagely 11.2\% improvement in
prediction accuracy.

minimise an expected bias in these signals caused by public interest -- as
opposed to infections -- using the proportion of news media coverage devoted to
COVID-19 as a proxy indicator. Our analysis indicates that models based on
online searches precede the reported confirmed cases and deaths by 16.7 (10.2 -

learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the
spread of disease has progressed extensively to countries that are in earlier
phases of their respective epidemic curves. Furthermore, we compare time series
of online search activity against confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths jointly
across multiple countries, uncovering interesting querying patterns, including
the finding that rarer symptoms are better predictors than common ones.
Finally, we show that web searches improve the short-term forecasting accuracy

clay content, and temperature in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. We

years of data acquired at different depths in the vadose zone within the HOBE
hydrological observatory in Denmark. Using state-of-the-art SP theory combined
with flow and transport simulations, we attempt to replicate the observed data
and suggest reasons for observed discrepancies. The predictions are overall
satisfactory during the first six months of monitoring after which both the
patterns and magnitudes of the observed data change drastically. Our main
observations are (1) that predicted SP magnitudes are strongly sensitive to how
the effective excess charge scales with water saturation implying that
continued research is needed to build more accurate models of electrokinetic
phenomena in unsaturated conditions, (2) that significant changes in electrode
polarization occur in the shallowest electrodes at time scales of a year,
suggesting that electrode effects cannot be ignored and that explicit electrode
modeling should be considered in future monitoring studies, and (3) that
multi-rate mass transfer and reactive transport modeling are needed to better
predict salinity and pore water conductivity. We hope to stimulate other

low variability. In a first step, simple simulation models of the system are
built and run under various conditions. In a second step, a neural network
architecture is extensively trained on the simulation outputs to learn the
system physics, and retrained with historical data from the real system with
stopping rules. These constraints avoid overfitting that arise by fitting
closed-loop controlled systems. By doing so, we obtain one (or many) system
model(s), represented by this architecture, and whose behaviour can be chosen
to match more or less the real system. Finally, state-of-the-art reinforcement
learning with a variant of domain randomization and distributed learning is
used for optimal control of the system. We first illustrate the model
identification strategy with a simple example, the pendulum with external
torque. We then apply our method to model and optimize the control of a large
building facility located in Switzerland. Simulation results demonstrate that
this approach generates stable functional controllers which outperform on
comfort and energy benchmark rule-based controllers.

when considering such coalgebras as finite coproduct preserving functors from
$\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{V}^\mathsf{op}$, the dual of the Lawvere theory of
$\mathcal{V}$, into $\mathcal{C}$: coalgebras are restrictions of left adjoints
and any such left adjoint is the left Kan extension of a coalgebra along the

$\mathsf{Alg}\mathcal{T}$. Since ${_S\mathit{Mod}}$-coalgebras in the variety
${_R\mathit{Mod}}$ for rings $R$ and $S$ are nothing but left $S$-, right
$R$-bimodules, the equivalence above generalizes the Eilenberg-Watts Theorem

time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of the microscopic laws of nature. Within quantum
theory, TRS underpins many interesting phenomena, most notably topological
insulators and the Haldane phase of quantum magnets. Here, we demonstrate that
such TRS-protected effects are fundamentally unstable against coupling to an
environment. Irrespective of the microscopic symmetries, interactions between a
quantum system and its surroundings facilitate processes which would be
forbidden by TRS in an isolated system. This leads not only to entanglement
entropy production and the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility, but also
to the demise of TRS-protected phenomena, including those associated with
certain symmetry-protected topological phases. Our results highlight the
enigmatic nature of TRS in quantum mechanics, and elucidate potential
challenges in utilising topological systems for quantum technologies.

photoemission electron microscopy (TR-XMCD-PEEM) is used to perform real space
magnetic imaging with 100 ps time resolution in order to show local
transformations of the domains structures. Using the time resolution of the
synchrotron radiation facility of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, we are able to
image the transient magnetic domains in a repetitive pump and probe experiment.
In this work, we study the reversible and irreversible transformations of the
excited magnetic stripe domains as function of the laser fluence. Our results
can be explained by thermal contributions, reducing the XMCD amplitude in each
stripe domain below a threshold fluence of 12 mJ/cm2. Above this threshold
fluence, irreversible transformations of the magnetic domains are observed.
Static XMCD-PEEM images reveal the new partially ordered stripe domain
structures characterized by a new local magnetic domain distribution showing an
organized pattern at the micrometer scale. This new arrangement is attributed
to the recovery of the magnetic anisotropy during heat dissipation under an
Oersted field.

unsupervised framework that can synthesize photo-realistic rotated faces using
only single-view image collections in the wild. Our key insight is that
rotating faces in the 3D space back and forth, and re-rendering them to the 2D
plane can serve as a strong self-supervision. We leverage the recent advances
in 3D face modeling and high-resolution GAN to constitute our building blocks.
Since the 3D rotation-and-render on faces can be applied to arbitrary angles
without losing details, our approach is extremely suitable for in-the-wild
scenarios (i.e. no paired data are available), where existing methods fall
short. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach has superior
synthesis quality as well as identity preservation over the state-of-the-art
methods, across a wide range of poses and domains. Furthermore, we validate
that our rotate-and-render framework naturally can act as an effective data

major challenge for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC)
experiments. The expected increase in the number of simultaneous collisions at
the HL-LHC and the resulting high detector occupancy will make track
reconstruction algorithms extremely demanding in terms of time and computing
resources. The increase in number of hits will increase the complexity of track
reconstruction algorithms. In addition, the ambiguity in assigning hits to
particle tracks will be increased due to the finite resolution of the detector
and the physical closeness of the hits. Thus, the reconstruction of charged
particle tracks will be a major challenge to the correct interpretation of the
HL-LHC data. Most methods currently in use are based on Kalman filters which
are shown to be robust and to provide good physics performance. However, they
are expected to scale worse than quadratically. Designing an algorithm capable
of reducing the combinatorial background at the hit level, would provide a much
cleaner initial seed to the Kalman filter, strongly reducing the total
processing time. One of the salient features of Quantum Computers is the
ability to evaluate a very large number of states simultaneously, making them
an ideal instrument for searches in a large parameter space. In fact, different
R\&D initiatives are exploring how Quantum Tracking Algorithms could leverage
such capabilities. In this paper, we present our work on the implementation of
a quantum-based track finding algorithm aimed at reducing combinatorial
background during the initial seeding stage. We use the publicly available

the lowest magnetic ordering temperature in the family of magnetically

order under pressure has been recently suggested. By combining the results of
several experimental methods, electronic ab initio calculations, and modeling,
we develop insights into the mechanisms of electric transport, magnetic
ordering, and their interaction in this compound. The elastic neutron
scattering is used to directly follow the evolution of the antiferromagnetic
order parameter with pressure and temperature. Our results unambiguously
disclose the complete suppression of the observed magnetic order around 1.7
GPa. We delve into possible mechanisms of magnetic order suppression under
pressure, highlighting the role of magnetic frustrations indicated by magnetic
susceptibility measurements and ab-initio calculations. Electronic conduction
anisotropy is measured in the wide temperature and pressure range. Here we show
that the transport in directions along and perpendicular to layers respond
differently to the appearance of magnetic ordering or the application of the
hydrostatic pressure. We propose the 'spin-valve' mechanism where the

host layers. The mechanism applies to various magnetic states and can be
extended to other magnetically intercalated TMDs.

purpose of this article is to apply effective methods to extract semi-classical

be equivalent. We find a nontrivial behavior of the fluctuations around the
recollapse of the universe, which is distinct from what is found after
quantization with the standard flat phase space. The behavior is reflected at
the level of the modified Friedmann equation with quantum back-reaction
effects, which is derived. Finally, an unexpected relation between the quantum

abundant topological phases emerge [1-6]. The bulk-edge correspondence,
widely-adopted in experiments to determine the band topology from edge
properties, however, becomes inadequate in discerning various topological
crystalline phases [7-17], leading to great challenges in the experimental
classification of the large family of topological crystalline materials [4-6].
Theories predict that disclinations, ubiquitous crystallographic defects,
provide an effective probe of crystalline topology beyond edges [18-21], which,
however, has not yet been confirmed in experiments. Here, we report the
experimental discovery of the bulk-disclination correspondence which is
manifested as the fractional spectral charge and robust bound states at the
disclinations. The fractional disclination charge originates from the
symmetry-protected bulk charge patterns---a fundamental property of many
topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Meanwhile, the robust bound states
at disclinations emerge as a secondary, but directly observable property of
TCIs. Using reconfigurable photonic crystals as photonic TCIs with higher-order
topology, we observe those hallmark features via pump-probe and near-field
detection measurements. Both the fractional charge and the localized states are
demonstrated to emerge at the disclination in the TCI phase but vanish in the
trivial phase. The experimental discovery of bulk-disclination correspondence
unveils a novel fundamental phenomenon and a new paradigm for exploring
topological materials.

interactions in living systems. Ligands are small molecules that interact with
protein molecules at specific regions on their surfaces called binding sites.
Tasks such as assessment of protein functional similarity and detection of side
effects of drugs need identification of similar binding sites of disparate
proteins across diverse pathways. Machine learning methods for similarity
assessment require feature descriptors of binding sites. Traditional methods
based on hand engineered motifs and atomic configurations are not scalable
across several thousands of sites. In this regard, deep neural network
algorithms are now deployed which can capture very complex input feature space.
However, one fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to structures of
binding sites is the input representation and the reference frame. We report
here a novel algorithm Site2Vec that derives reference frame invariant vector
embedding of a protein-ligand binding site. The method is based on pairwise
distances between representative points and chemical compositions in terms of
constituent amino acids of a site. The vector embedding serves as a locality
sensitive hash function for proximity queries and determining similar sites.
The method has been the top performer with more than 95% quality scores in
extensive benchmarking studies carried over 10 datasets and against 23 other
site comparison methods. The algorithm serves for high throughput processing

coordinate perturbations and residue mutations. We provide Site2Vec as a stand

quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated
individuals to reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are
available, then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful
in terms of reduction of cases.

proper coupling between object perception and manipulation. This coupling is
necessary for service robots not only to perform various tasks in a reasonable
amount of time but also to continually adapt to new environments and safely
interact with non-expert human users. Nowadays, robots are able to recognize
various objects, and quickly plan a collision-free trajectory to grasp a target
object in predefined settings. Besides, in most of the cases, there is a
reliance on large amounts of training data. Therefore, the knowledge of such
robots is fixed after the training phase, and any changes in the environment
require complicated, time-consuming, and expensive robot re-programming by
human experts. Therefore, these approaches are still too rigid for real-life
applications in unstructured environments, where a significant portion of the
environment is unknown and cannot be directly sensed or controlled. In such
environments, no matter how extensive the training data used for batch
learning, a robot will always face new objects. Therefore, apart from batch
learning, the robot should be able to continually learn about new object
categories and grasp affordances from very few training examples on-site.
Moreover, apart from robot self-learning, non-expert users could interactively
guide the process of experience acquisition by teaching new concepts, or by
correcting insufficient or erroneous concepts. In this way, the robot will
constantly learn how to help humans in everyday tasks by gaining more and more
experiences without the need for re-programming.

work showed that, when the number of environmental fragments grows, the quantum
channels modelling the information flow from system to observers become
arbitrarily close - in terms of diamond norm distance - to
""measure-and-prepare"" channels, ensuring objectivity of observables; the
convergence is formalised by an upper bound on the diamond norm distance, which
decreases with increasing number of fragments. Here, we derive tighter diamond

predicts that the transition is of first order for Nf > 2. For Nf = 2 the

good performance, especially the DNNs-based density map estimation methods.
Most existing crowd counting works focus on single-view counting, while few
works have studied multi-view counting for large and wide scenes, where
multiple cameras are used. Recently, an end-to-end multi-view crowd counting
method called multi-view multi-scale (MVMS) has been proposed, which fuses
multiple camera views using a CNN to predict a 2D scene-level density map on
the ground-plane. Unlike MVMS, we propose to solve the multi-view crowd
counting task through 3D feature fusion with 3D scene-level density maps,
instead of the 2D ground-plane ones. Compared to 2D fusion, the 3D fusion
extracts more information of the people along z-dimension (height), which helps
to solve the scale variations across multiple views. The 3D density maps still
preserve the 2D density maps property that the sum is the count, while also
providing 3D information about the crowd density. We also explore the
projection consistency among the 3D prediction and the ground-truth in the 2D
views to further enhance the counting performance. The proposed method is
tested on 3 multi-view counting datasets and achieves better or comparable
counting performance to the state-of-the-art.

more refocusing pulses in the dynamical decoupling technique, we manage to

class of time-delay systems. It is well known that in the finite dimensional
case the H-infinity norm of a transfer function can be computed using the
connections between the corresponding singular value curves and the imaginary
axis eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix, leading to the established level set
methods. We show a similar connection between the transfer function of a
time-delay system and the imaginary axis eigenvalues of an infinite dimensional
linear operator $\mathcal{L}_{\xi}^N$. Based on this result, we propose a
predictor-corrector algorithm for the computation of the H-infinity norm. In
the prediction step, a finite-dimensional approximation of the problem, induced
by a spectral discretization of the operator $\mathcal{L}_{\xi}$, and an
adaptation of the algorithms for finite-dimensional systems, allow to obtain an
approximation of the H-infinity norm of the transfer function of the time-delay
system. In the next step the approximate results are corrected to the desired
accuracy by solving a set of nonlinear equations which are obtained from the
reformulation of the eigenvalue problem for the linear infinite-dimensional
operator $\mathcal{L}_{\xi}^N$ as a finite dimensional nonlinear eigenvalue
problem. These equations can be interpreted as characterizations of peak values
in the singular value plot. The effects of the discretization in the predictor
step are fully characterized and the choice of the number of discretization
points is discussed. The paper concludes with a numerical example and the
presentation of the results of extensive benchmarking.

may be responsible for a number of the sub-structures frequently observed in
disks in both scattered light and dust thermal emission. Despite the ubiquity
of these features, direct evidence of planets embedded in disks and of the
specific interaction features like spiral arms within planetary gaps still
remain rare. In this study we discuss recent observational results in the
context of hydrodynamical simulations in order to infer the properties of a
putative embedded planet in the cavity of a transition disk. We imaged the
transition disk SR 21 in H-band in scattered light with SPHERE/IRDIS and in
thermal dust emission with ALMA band 3 (3mm) observations at a spatial
resolution of 0.1"". We combine these datasets with existing band 9 (430um) and
band 7 (870um) ALMA continuum data. The Band 3 continuum data reveals a large
cavity and a bright ring peaking at 53 au strongly suggestive of dust
trapping.The ring shows a pronounced azimuthal asymmetry, with a bright region
in the north-west that we interpret as a dust over-density. A
similarly-asymmetric ring is revealed at the same location in polarized
scattered light, in addition to a set of bright spirals inside the mm cavity
and a fainter spiral bridging the gap to the outer ring. These features are
consistent with a number of previous hydrodynamical models of planet-disk
interactions, and suggest the presence of a ~1 MJup planet at 44 au and
PA=11{\deg}. This makes SR21 the first disk showing spiral arms inside the mm
cavity, as well as one for which the location of a putative planet can be
precisely inferred. With the location of a possible planet being
well-constrained by observations, it is an ideal candidate for follow-up
observations to search for direct evidence of a planetary companion still
embedded in its disk.

we design a simple and efficient embedding algorithm that learns a small set of
anchor embeddings and a sparse transformation matrix. We call our method Anchor

combination of the anchors, weighted according to the transformation matrix.
ANT is scalable, flexible, and end-to-end trainable. We further provide a
statistical interpretation of our algorithm as a Bayesian nonparametric prior
for embeddings that encourages sparsity and leverages natural groupings among

Asymptotics, we obtain a natural extension that automatically learns the
optimal number of anchors instead of having to tune it as a hyperparameter. On

gluon-gluon fusion and color evaporation model. The $\gamma^* \gamma^* \to

width. The $g^* g^* \to f_0(980)$ form factors are obtained by a replacement of
$\alpha_{\rm{em}}$ electromagnetic coupling constant by $\alpha_{\rm{s}}$
strong coupling constant and appropriate color factors. The form factors for
the two couplings are parametrized with a function motivated by recent results
for scalar quarkonia. The differential cross sections are calculated in the
$k_t$-factorization approach with modern unintegrated gluon distributions.
Unlike for quarkonia it seems rather difficult to describe a preliminary ALICE
data for inclusive production of $f_0(980)$ exclusively by the color singlet
gluon-gluon fusion mechanism. Two different scenarios for flavor structure of
$f_0(980)$ are considered in this context. We consider also mechanism of fusion
of quark-antiquark associated with soft gluon emission in a phenomenological
color evaporation model (CEM) used sometimes for quarkonium production. Here we
use $k_t$-factorization version of CEM to include higher-order contributions.
In addition, for comparison we consider also NLO collinear approach with $q
\bar{q} q$ and $q \bar{q} g$ color octet partonic final states. Both approaches
lead to a similar result. However, very large probabilities are required to
describe the preliminary ALICE data. The pomeron-pomeron fusion mechanism is

were given podcast recommendations, with the sole aim of increasing podcast
consumption. Treatment users' recommendations were personalized based on their
music listening history, whereas control users were recommended popular
podcasts among users in their demographic group. We find that, on average, the
treatment increased podcast streams by 28.90%. However, the treatment also
decreased the average individual-level diversity of podcast streams by 11.51%,
and increased the aggregate diversity of podcast streams by 5.96%, indicating
that personalized recommendations have the potential to create patterns of
consumption that are homogenous within and diverse across users, a pattern
reflecting Balkanization. Our results provide evidence of an
""engagement-diversity trade-off"" when recommendations are optimized solely to
drive consumption: while personalized recommendations increase user engagement,
they also affect the diversity of consumed content. This shift in consumption
diversity can affect user retention and lifetime value, and impact the optimal

affected streams from sections of Spotify's app not directly affected by the

and optical orientation of electrons contributing to the H-band are studied by
means of continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and
time-resolved Kerr rotation. It is shown that the H-band is due to
recombination of the heavy holes localized at the heterointerface with
photoexcited electrons attracted to the heterointerface from the GaAs layer.
Two lines with significantly different decay times constitute the H-band: a
short-lived high-energy one and a long-lived low-energy one. The high-energy
line originates from recombination of electrons freely moving along the
structure plane, while the low-energy one is due to recombination of
donor-bound electrons near the interface. Application of the lateral electric
field of ~ 100-200 V/cm results in a quenching of both lines. This quenching is
due to a decrease of electron concentration near the heterointerface as a
result of a photocurrent-induced heating of electrons in the GaAs layer. On the
contrary, electrons near the heterointerface are effectively cooled, so the
donors near the interface are not completely empty up to ~ 100 V/cm, which is
in stark contrast with the case of bulk materials. The optical spin
polarization of the donor-bound electrons near the heterointerface weakly
depends on the electric field. Their polarization kinetics is determined by the
spin dephasing in the hyperfine fields of the lattice nuclei. The long spin
memory time (> 40 ns) can be associated with suppression of the
Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism of spin relaxation for electrons.

solving fluid-structure interaction problems. It relies on solving fluid
equations on an Eulerian fluid grid and interpolating the resulting velocity
back onto immersed structures. To resolve slender fibers, the grid spacing must
be on the order of the fiber radius, and thus the number of required grid
points along the filament must be of the same order as the aspect ratio.
Simulations of slender bodies using the IB method can therefore be intractable.
A technique is presented to address this problem in the context of Stokes flow.
The velocity of the structure is split into a component coming from the
underlying fluid grid, which is coarser than normally required, and a component
proportional to the force (a drag term). The drag coefficient is set so that a
single sphere is represented exactly on a grid of arbitrary meshwidth. Implicit
treatment of the drag term removes some of the stability restrictions normally
associated with the IB method. This comes at a loss of accuracy, although tests
are conducted that show 1-2 digits of relative accuracy can be obtained on
coarser grids. After its accuracy and stability are tested, the method is
applied to two real world examples: fibers in shear flow and a suspension of
fibers. These examples show that the method can reproduce existing results and
make reasonable predictions about the viscosity of an aligned fiber suspension.

the Hamiltonian picture of anomalies. The relation to the path integral and the

explicit task-conditioning in which unlabeled sample clustering for the current
task takes place in a new projection space different from the embedding feature
space. The conditioned clustering space is linearly constructed so as to
quickly close the gap between the class centroids for the current task and the
independent per-class reference vectors meta-trained across tasks. In a more
general setting, our method introduces a concept of controlling the degree of
task-conditioning for meta-learning: the amount of task-conditioning varies
with the number of repetitive updates for the clustering space. Extensive
simulation results based on the miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets show
state-of-the-art semi-supervised few-shot classification performance of the
proposed method. Simulation results also indicate that the proposed
task-adaptive clustering shows graceful degradation with a growing number of

this work, we focus on two of these remarkable features and provide theoretical
analysis allowing their interpretation. The first one is the appearance of
two-terminal conductance plateaus at rational fractions of $e^2/h$. We explain
how this phenomenon, previously believed to be possible only in systems with
strong repulsive interactions, can be stabilized in a system with attraction in
the presence of the modulation. Using our theoretical framework we find the
plateau amplitude and shape, and characterize the correlated phase which
develops in the system due to the partial gap, namely a Luttinger liquid of
electronic trions. The second observation is a sharp conductance dip below a
conductance of $1\times e^2/h$, which changes its value over a wide range when
tuning the system. We theorize that it is due to resonant backscattering caused
by a periodic spin-orbit field. The behavior of this dip can be reliably
accounted for by considering the finite length of the electronic waveguides, as
well as the interactions therein. The phenomena discussed in this work
exemplify the intricate interplay of strong interactions and spatial
modulations, and reveal the potential for novel strongly correlated phases of
matter in systems which prominently feature both.

relative to this initial estimate are used to determine the landmarks. A set of
carefully selected geometric features, for example, relative width of the

Furthermore, our experiments show that progerin expression leads to enhanced

the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio
resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine
learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naive Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic
regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to
analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings
from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood
of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor
functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)

PRBs according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs
to send their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimized delay.
To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted sum rate
maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The
proposed approaches increased the OPs average signal to interference plus noise
(SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system
total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, nevertheless, the PF

in the understanding of 3D shapes. Recent methods usually partition point
clouds into local region sets, and then extract the local region features with
fixed-size CNN or MLP, and finally aggregate all individual local features into
a global feature using simple max pooling. However, due to the irregularity and
sparsity in sampled point clouds, it is hard to encode the fine-grained
geometry of local regions and their spatial relationships when only using the
fixed-size filters and individual local feature integration, which limit the
ability to learn discriminative features. To address this issue, we present a
novel Local-Region-Context Network (LRC-Net), to learn discriminative features
on point clouds by encoding the fine-grained contexts inside and among local
regions simultaneously. LRC-Net consists of two main modules. The first module,
named intra-region context encoding, is designed for capturing the geometric
correlation inside each local region by novel variable-size convolution filter.
The second module, named inter-region context encoding, is proposed for
integrating the spatial relationships among local regions based on spatial
similarity measures. Experimental results show that LRC-Net is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods in shape classification and shape segmentation

overlook the scarcity of labeled graph data in many applications. For example,
in bioinformatics, obtaining protein graph labels usually needs laborious
experiments. Recently, few-shot learning has been explored to alleviate this
problem with only given a few labeled graph samples of test classes. The shared
sub-structures between training classes and test classes are essential in
few-shot graph classification. Exiting methods assume that the test classes
belong to the same set of super-classes clustered from training classes.
However, according to our observations, the label spaces of training classes

the existing methods don't well capture the local structures of unseen test

models, are all well-studied members of the exponential family of discrete

where they are used to model correlation phenomena on networks. Conventionally
these models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture
correlations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study
extensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling
behavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model
binary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior
of an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates
and some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group
effects. Using a {\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal
is to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength
of the peer-group effects. The heart of our result is a novel approach for
showing strong concavity of the log pseudo-likelihood of the model, implying
statistical error rate of $\sqrt{d/n}$ for the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood
Estimator (MPLE), where $d$ is the dimensionality of the covariate vectors and

driven out of equilibrium. To fill the current gap in understanding, we
investigate the electrostatics and electronic transport of 2D lateral pn
junctions. To do so we implement a physics-based simulator that
selfconsistently solves the 2D Poisson's equation coupled to the
drift-diffusion and continuity equations. Notably, the simulator takes into
account the strong influence of the out of plane electric field through the
surrounding dielectric, capturing the weak screening of charge carriers.
Supported by simulations, we propose a Shockley-like equation for the ideal

defining an effective depletion layer (EDL). We also discuss the impact of
recombination generation processes inside the EDL, which actually produce a
significant deviation with respect to the ideal behavior, consistently with

looking for the best reconstruction of a given object. In this first

learning method captures apparent visual similarity with in-domain
self-supervision in a domain adaptive manner and performs cross-domain feature
matching with across-domain self-supervision. In extensive experiments with
three standard benchmark datasets, our method significantly boosts performance
of target accuracy in the new target domain with few source labels and is even
helpful on classical domain adaptation scenarios.

restricts its real life applications in photonic integration and high speed

states, achieves the same asymptotic secret key rate compared with standard
BB84 under coherent attacks. In this work, by skillfully exploiting uncertainty
relation for smooth entropies, we provide the finite-key security bounds for
decoy-state simplified BB84 QKD against coherent attacks in the universally
composable framework. Simulation results show that it can also achieve almost
the same performance compared with standard BB84 even the total number of

critical role in reducing the risk of disease-related malnutrition. Although
several methods to estimate nutrient intake have been developed, there is still
a clear demand for a more reliable and fully automated technique, as this could
improve data accuracy and reduce both the burden on participants and health
costs. In this paper, we propose a novel system based on artificial
intelligence (AI) to accurately estimate nutrient intake, by simply processing
RGB Depth (RGB-D) image pairs captured before and after meal consumption. The
system includes a novel multi-task contextual network for food segmentation, a
few-shot learning-based classifier built by limited training samples for food
recognition, and an algorithm for 3D surface construction. This allows
sequential food segmentation, recognition, and estimation of the consumed food
volume, permitting fully automatic estimation of the nutrient intake for each
meal. For the development and evaluation of the system, a dedicated new
database containing images and nutrient recipes of 322 meals is assembled,
coupled to data annotation using innovative strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that the estimated nutrient intake is highly correlated (> 0.91) to
the ground truth and shows very small mean relative errors (< 20%),
outperforming existing techniques proposed for nutrient intake assessment.

Unlike standard convolution, PIC is invariant to the temporal permutations of

connectivity, enabling it to learn long-range temporal abstractions using
cascaded layers. iii. In contrast to self-attention, PIC uses shared weights,

understanding brain function and dynamics. By operationalizing notions of
control theory for brain networks, it offers a fundamental explanation for how
brain dynamics may be regulated by structural connectivity. While powerful, the
approach does not currently consider other non-structural explanations of brain
dynamics. Here we extend the analysis of network controllability by formalizing
the evolution of neural signals as a function of effective inter-regional
coupling and pairwise signal covariance. We find that functional
controllability characterizes a region's impact on the capacity for the whole
system to shift between states, and significantly predicts individual
difference in performance on cognitively demanding tasks including those task
working memory, language, and emotional intelligence. When comparing
measurements from functional and structural controllability, we observed
consistent relations between average and modal controllability, supporting
prior work. In the same comparison, we also observed distinct relations between
controllability and synchronizability, reflecting the additional information
obtained from functional signals. Our work suggests that network control theory
can serve as a systematic analysis tool to understand the energetics of brain
state transitions, associated cognitive processes, and subsequent behaviors.

charge, which can be non-zero even in the absence of a bias. However, as the
driving speed is increased, non-adiabatic excitations gradually reduce the
pumped charge, thereby limiting the maximal applicable driving frequencies. To
circumvent this problem, we here extend the concept of shortcuts to
adiabaticity to construct a control protocol which enables geometric pumping
well beyond the adiabatic regime. Our protocol allows for an increase, by more
than an order of magnitude, in the driving frequencies, and the method is also
robust against moderate fluctuations of the control field. We provide a
geometric interpretation of the control protocol and analyze the thermodynamic
cost of implementing it. Our findings can be realized using current technology
and potentially enable fast pumping of charge or heat in quantum dots, as well
as in other stochastic systems from physics, chemistry, and biology.

primarily due to the dissolution and migration of higher order polyselenides
(Li2Sen) into the electrolyte (known as shuttle effect) and inactive deposition
of lower order polyselenides. The high electrical conductivity and mechanical
strengths of MXenes make them a suitable candidate to provide adequate
anchoring to prevent polyselenides dissolution and improved electrochemical
performance. Herein, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
understand the binding mechanism of Li2Sen on graphene and surface
functionalized Ti3C2 MXenes. We used graphene as reference material to assess
Li2Sen binding strengths on functionalized Ti3C2X2 (where X = S, O, F, and Cl).
We observed that Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 exhibit superior anchoring behavior
compared to graphene, Ti3C2F2, and Ti3C2Cl2. The calculated Li2Sen adsorption
strength provided by S and O terminated Ti3C2 are stronger than the commonly
used ether-based electrolyte, which is a requisite for effective suppression of
the Li2Sen shuttling. The adsorbed Li2Sen on Ti3C2X2 and graphene retains their
structural integrity without a chemical decomposition. The density of states
(DOS) analysis exhibits that the conductive behavior of the Ti3C2X2 is
preserved even after Li2Sen adsorption, which can stimulate the electrochemical
activity of involved Li2Sen chemistry. Based on our unprecedented results,
Ti3C2S2 and Ti3C2O2 are found to exhibit superior anchoring behavior for Li2Sen
adsorption, which can be leveraged for designing effective selenium-based
cathode materials to boost the electrochemical performance of the Li-Se battery

a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme where one neural network

of the energy density was in free-streaming neutrinos. In many beyond Standard

self-interactions or an additional dark sector with interacting light
particles. We consider several extensions of the standard cosmology that
include a non-free-streaming radiation component as motivated by such particle
physics models and use the final Planck data release to constrain them. This
release contains significant improvements in the polarization likelihood which
plays an important role in distinguishing free-streaming from interacting
radiation species. Fixing the total amount of energy in radiation to match the
expectation from standard neutrino decoupling we find that the fraction of
free-streaming radiation must be $f_\mathrm{fs} > 0.8$ at 95% CL (combining
temperature, polarization and baryon acoustic oscillation data). Allowing for
arbitrary contributions of free-streaming and interacting radiation, the
effective number of new non-free-streaming degrees of freedom is constrained to

also known to ease the discrepancy between the local measurement and CMB

during current sheet formation on a slower Alfvenic time scale. We compare our

correlated tasks, since facial landmarks can provide precise AU locations to
facilitate the extraction of meaningful local features for AU detection.
However, most existing AU detection works handle the two tasks independently by
treating face alignment as a preprocessing, and often use landmarks to
predefine a fixed region or attention for each AU. In this paper, we propose a
novel end-to-end deep learning framework for joint AU detection and face
alignment, which has not been explored before. In particular, multi-scale
shared feature is learned firstly, and high-level feature of face alignment is
fed into AU detection. Moreover, to extract precise local features, we propose
an adaptive attention learning module to refine the attention map of each AU
adaptively. Finally, the assembled local features are integrated with face
alignment feature and global feature for AU detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework (i) significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art AU detection methods on the challenging BP4D, DISFA, GFT and
BP4D+ benchmarks, (ii) can adaptively capture the irregular region of each AU,
(iii) achieves competitive performance for face alignment, and (iv) also works
well under partial occlusions and non-frontal poses. The code for our method is

a map unfolded here by investigating language and its cognitive reflection in
the human mind, i.e. the mental lexicon. Textual forma mentis networks (TFMN)
are glass boxes introduced for extracting, representing and understanding
mindsets' structure, in Latin ""forma mentis"", from textual data. Combining
network science, psycholinguistics and Big Data, TFMNs successfully identified
relevant concepts, without supervision, in benchmark texts. Once validated,
TFMNs were applied to the case study of the gender gap in science, which was
strongly linked to distorted mindsets by recent studies. Focusing over social
media perception and online discourse, this work analysed 10,000 relevant
tweets. ""Gender"" and ""gap"" elicited a mostly positive perception, with a
trustful/joyous emotional profile and semantic associates that: celebrated
successful female scientists, related gender gap to wage differences, and hoped
for a future resolution. The perception of ""woman"" highlighted discussion about
sexual harassment and stereotype threat (a form of implicit cognitive bias)
relative to women in science ""sacrificing personal skills for success"". The
reconstructed perception of ""man"" highlighted social users' awareness of the
myth of male superiority in science. No anger was detected around ""person"",
suggesting that gap-focused discourse got less tense around genderless terms.
No stereotypical perception of ""scientist"" was identified online, differently
from real-world surveys. The overall analysis identified the online discourse
as promoting a mostly stereotype-free, positive/trustful perception of gender
disparity, aware of implicit/explicit biases and projected to closing the gap.
TFMNs opened new ways for investigating perceptions in different groups,
offering detailed data-informed grounding for policy making.

circumvent any single published AI-specific defence to date, the article
concludes that single protective measures are not sufficient but rather

this paper, we propose a novel design philosophy called democratized learning
(Dem-AI) whose goal is to build large-scale distributed learning systems that
rely on the self-organization of distributed learning agents that are
well-connected, but limited in learning capabilities. Correspondingly, inspired
by the societal groups of humans, the specialized groups of learning agents in

of two processes which we call specialized and generalized processes. In this

introduce four underlying mechanisms in the design such as plasticity-stability

their dynamic characteristics, in cases where convergence to the stationary

challenging. The kinematic ray tracing solution corresponds to the vanishing
first traveltime variation, leading to a stationary path, and is governed by
the nonlinear second-order Euler-Lagrange equation (Part I). In Part II we
elaborate on theoretical aspects of the proposed method and validate its
correctness for general anisotropy. In Part III we use a finite-element
approach, applying the weak formulation. In Part IV we propose an efficient
method to compute the geometric spreading of the entire stationary ray path
using the global traveltime Hessian. In Part V we formulate the dynamic ray
tracing, considering the second traveltime variation, which leads to the linear
second-order Jacobi equation, and in Part VI we relate the proposed Lagrangian
approach to the commonly used Hamiltonian approach. The solution is provided in
Part VII, where we implement a similar finite element approach applied for the

I, we apply the weak formulation and the Galerkin method to reduce this
second-order, ordinary differential equation into a nonlinear, local,
first-order, weighted residual algebraic equation set. The solution is based on
a finite element approach with the Hermite polynomial interpolation, for
computing the ray characteristics between the nodes. The Hermite interpolation
is a natural choice, since, in addition to the nodal locations, also the ray
directions at the nodes are independent degrees of freedom of the finite
element method. This is in particular important in anisotropic media. We then
construct the target function to be minimized, where we distinguish between two
functions triggered by the two possible types of stationary rays: minimum
traveltime and saddle-point solutions, mainly in cases where the stationary
paths include caustics. The target functions include two penalty terms related
to two essential constraints. The first is related to the distribution of the
nodes along the ray and the second enforces the normalization of the ray
direction to a unit length. The minimization process involves the computation
of the traveltime gradient vector and the Hessian matrix. The latter is used
also to analyze the type of the stationary ray. Finally, we demonstrate the

of an efficient algorithm for reducing the already computed global traveltime
Hessian into a endpoint spatial traveltime Hessian. The second stage involves
application of a known workflow for computing the geometrical spreading using
the endpoint traveltime Hessian. Note that the method proposed in this part
(Part IV) does not deliver information about caustics, nor the geometric
spreading at intermediate points of the stationary ray path. Throughout the
examples presented in Part VII we demonstrate the accuracy of the method
proposed in this part over a set of isotropic and anisotropic examples by
comparing the geometric spreading computed from this method based on the
traveltime Hessian reduction with the one computed from the dynamic ray
tracing.

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches to the dynamic ray tracing in
heterogeneous isotropic and anisotropic media; we demonstrate that the two

finite-element solver, as used for the kinematic ray tracing, to compute the
dynamic characteristics between the source and any point along the ray. The
dynamic characteristics in our study include the relative geometric spreading
and the phase correction factor due to caustics (i.e., the amplitude and the
phase of the Green's function of waves propagating in 3D heterogeneous
anisotropic media). The basic solution of the Jacobi equation is a shift vector
of a paraxial ray in the plane normal to the ray direction at each point along
the central ray. A general paraxial ray is defined by a linear combination of
up to four basic vector solutions, each corresponds to specific initial
conditions related to the ray coordinates at the source. We define the four
basic solutions with two pairs of initial condition sets: point-source and
plane-wave. For the proposed point-source ray coordinates and initial
conditions, we derive the ray Jacobian and relate it to the relative geometric
spreading for general anisotropy. Finally, we introduce a new dynamic
parameter, referred as the normalized geometrical spreading, considered a
measure of complexity of the propagated wave/ray phenomena, and hence, we
propose using a criterion based on this parameter as a qualifying factor
associated with the given ray solution.

computing the dynamic characteristics along stationary rays, by solving the
linear, second-order Jacobi differential equation, considering four sets of
initial conditions as the basic solutions. We then focused on the computation
of the geometric spreading and identification of caustics, where only the two
point-source basic solutions with their corresponding initial conditions are
required. Solutions of the Jacobi equation represent the normal shift vectors
of the paraxial rays and define the geometry of the ray tube with respect to
the stationary central ray. Rather than the Lagrangian approach, the dynamic
characteristics are traditionally computed with the Hamiltonian approach,
formulated normally in terms of two first-order differential equations, where
the solution variables are the paraxial shifts and paraxial slowness changes
along the ray. In this part (Part VI), we compare and relate the two
approaches. We first combine the two first-order Hamiltonian dynamic equations,
eliminating the paraxial variations of the slowness vector. This leads to a
second-order differential equation in terms of the Hamiltonian shift alone,
whose ray-normal counterpart coincides with the normal shift of the
corresponding Lagrangian solution, while the ray-tangent component does not
affect the Jacobian and the geometric spreading. Comparing the proposed
Lagrangian approach to the dynamic ray tracing with the ""classical"" Hamiltonian
approach, we demonstrate that they are fully compatible for general anisotropy.
We then derive the two-way relationships between the Hamiltonian's and
Lagrangian's Hessians, which are the core computational elements of dynamic ray
theory. Finally, we demonstrate the relationships between these two types of
the Hessians numerically, for a general triclinic medium.

execution. Such a monitor needs to be based on a specification language capable
of expressing complex, high-level properties using only the accessible
low-level signals. Moreover, tight constraints on computational resources
exacerbate the requirements on the monitor. Thus, several existing approaches
to monitoring are not applicable due to their dependence on an operating

specification into synthesizable VHDL code. RTLola is a stream-based
specification language capable of expressing complex real-time properties while
providing an upper bound on the execution time and memory requirements. The
statically determined memory bound allows for a compilation to an FPGA with a
fixed size. An advantage of FPGAs is a simple integration process in existing
systems and superb executing time. The compilation results in a highly parallel
implementation thanks to the modular nature of RTLola specifications. This
further increases the maximal event rate the monitor can handle.

(so-called octapods), able to host on their pods Pt particles, and thus
catalyzing water splitting reactions. Thanks to the octapod shape, the
resulting Pt-hosting network is mechanically trapped onto carbon nanotube
buckypaper, providing mechanically flexible and binder-free electrodes. We
found that such hierarchical configuration maximizes the mass activity and the
utilization efficiency of Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a
potential of -0.15 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the Pt/octapod
network-based electrodes display a Pt mass activity on the HER of 166 A mg-1
and 42 A mg-1 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. These values
correspond to turnover frequencies of 168 s-1 and 42 s-1, respectively, which
are in that order 14 and 21 times higher compared to commercially available
Pt/C benchmarks. The strong chemical and mechanical interactions between the Pt
and the octapod surface, along with pod-aided adhesion of the Pt/octapod
network to the buckypaper, result in a long-term durability (>20 h) of the
HER-activity in both media. These results experimentally prove that the
exploitation of our network of branched nanocrystals hosting Pt particles can
circumvent the durability issues of the catalysts while adopting either
ultralow Pt loadings or benchmarking carbon-supported Pt nanocrystals. Our work
opens up prospects for using porous networks made by branched nanocrystals as

(LTE-U) specification developed by the LTE-U Forum, which uses the duty-cycle
approach for fair coexistence. The specification suggests reducing the duty
cycle at the LTE-U base-station (BS) when the number of co-channel Wi-Fi basic
service sets (BSSs) increases from one to two or more. However, without
decoding the Wi-Fi packets, detecting the number of Wi-Fi BSSs operating on the
channel in real-time is a challenging problem. In this work, we demonstrate a
novel ML-based approach which solves this problem by using energy values
observed during the LTE-U OFF duration. It is relatively straightforward to
observe only the energy values during the LTE-U BS OFF time compared to
decoding the entire Wi-Fi packet, which would require a full Wi-Fi receiver at
the LTE-U base-station. We implement and validate the proposed ML-based
approach by real-time experiments and demonstrate that there exist distinct
patterns between the energy distributions between one and many Wi-Fi AP
transmissions. The proposed ML-based approach results in a higher accuracy
(close to 99\% in all cases) as compared to the existing auto-correlation (AC)

the help of these feature metrics, both the current and the sequence-dependent
