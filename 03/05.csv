whose frequency is then determined by analyses performed in Fourier space. This
allows for a linear inference of the parameters that characterize external
signals. In practice, however, quantum sensors are able to detect fields only
in a narrow range of amplitudes and frequencies. A departure from this range,
as well as the presence of significant noise sources and short detection times,
lead to a loss of the linear relationship between the response of the sensor
and the target field, thus limiting the working regime of the sensor. Here we
address these challenges by means of a Bayesian inference approach that is
tolerant to strong deviations from desired periodic responses of the sensor and
is able to provide reliable estimates even with a very limited number of
measurements. We demonstrate our method for an $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ trapped-ion
quantum sensor but stress the general applicability of this approach to
different systems.

generalization of the classical list update problem. In Online MSSC, the
algorithm maintains a permutation on $n$ elements based on subsets $S_1, S_2,

using its current permutation $\pi_{t}$, incurring an access cost equal to the
position of the first element of $S_t$ in $\pi_{t}$. Then, the algorithm may
update its permutation to $\pi_{t+1}$, incurring a moving cost equal to the
Kendall tau distance of $\pi_{t}$ to $\pi_{t+1}$. The objective is to minimize
the total access and moving cost for serving the entire sequence. We consider
the $r$-uniform version, where each $S_t$ has cardinality $r$. List update is
the special case where $r = 1$.
  We obtain tight bounds on the competitive ratio of deterministic online
algorithms for MSSC against a static adversary, that serves the entire sequence

$(r+1)(1-\frac{r}{n+1})$ on the competitive ratio. Then, we consider several
natural generalizations of successful list update algorithms and show that they

$\Omega(r^2)$ and $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n \cdot \log r})}$, and conjecture that it

transport, four-phonon scattering is found to considerably reduce the thermal

phonon renormalization and thermal expansion on phononic thermal conductivity
are negligible. Bipolar contribution to the electronic thermal conductivity

Specifically, we find that if the measurement-basis in the protocol of

representing the local noisy channel do not commute, the information regarding
the noise is retained in the system even after the qubit is traced out after
measurement. Using this result and the basic properties of entanglement under
noise, we present a set of hierarchies that localizable entanglement over a

subparts or on all the qubits of the whole system. In particular, we propose
two types of hierarchies -- one tailored according to the number of noisy

cardinality of the set of noisy measured qubits, leading to the classification

is established using density dependent point coupling interaction DD-PC1,
supplemented with the isovector-pseudovector interaction channel in order to
study unnatural parity transitions. The introduced framework has been validated
using the M1 sum rule for core-plus-two-nucleon systems, and employed in
studies of the spin, orbital, isoscalar and isovector M1 transition strengths,
that relate to the electromagnetic probe, in magic nuclei $^{48}$Ca and
$^{208}$Pb, and open shell nuclei $^{42}$Ca and $^{50}$Ti. In these systems,
the isovector spin-flip M1 transition is dominant, mainly between one or two
spin-orbit partner states. It is shown that pairing correlations have a
significant impact on the centroid energy and major peak position of the M1
mode. The M1 excitations could provide an additional constraint to improve
nuclear energy density functionals in the future studies.

Fisher-Gaussian (MFG) distribution, is proposed on the nonlinear manifold

(9+n)-variate Gaussian distribution from the ambient Euclidean space into
$\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^n$, while imposing a certain geometric
interpretation of the correlation terms to avoid over-parameterization. The
unique feature is that it may represent large uncertainties in attitudes,
linear variables of an arbitrary dimension, and angular-linear correlations
between them in a global fashion without singularities associated with local
parameterizations. Various stochastic properties and an approximate maximum
likelihood estimator of MFG are developed. Furthermore, two methods are
developed to propagate uncertainties though a stochastic differential equation
representing attitude kinematics. Based on these, a Bayesian estimator is
proposed to estimate the attitude and time-varying gyro bias concurrently.
Numerical studies indicate that the proposed estimator exhibits a better
accuracy against the well-established multiplicative extended Kalman filter for
two challenging cases.

arguably the most natural and studied scheduling problem. A common approach in
practical algorithm design is to reduce the size of a given instance by a fast
preprocessing step while being able to recover key information even after this
reduction. This notion is formally studied as kernelization (or simply, kernel)
-- a polynomial time procedure which yields an equivalent instance whose size
is bounded in terms of some given parameter. It follows from known results that
makespan minimization parameterized by the longest job processing time
$p_{\max}$ has a kernelization yielding a reduced instance whose size is
exponential in $p_{\max}$. Can this be reduced to polynomial in $p_{\max}$?
  We answer this affirmatively not only for makespan minimization, but also for
the (more complicated) objective of minimizing the weighted sum of completion
times, also in the setting of unrelated machines when the number of machine
kinds is a parameter. Our algorithm first solves the Configuration LP and based
on its solution constructs a solution of an intermediate problem, called huge
$N$-fold integer programming. This solution is further reduced in size by a
series of steps, until its encoding length is polynomial in the parameters.
Then, we show that huge $N$-fold IP is in NP, which implies that there is a
polynomial reduction back to our scheduling problem, yielding a kernel.
  Our technique is highly novel in the context of kernelization, and our
structural theorem about the Configuration LP is of independent interest.
Moreover, we show a polynomial kernel for huge $N$-fold IP conditional on
whether the so-called separation subproblem can be solved in polynomial time.
Considering that integer programming does not admit polynomial kernels except
for quite restricted cases, our ""conditional kernel"" provides new insight.

utility function while satisfying a set of constraints on different utilities.
This learning problem is formalized through Constrained Markov Decision
Processes (CMDPs). In this paper, we investigate the exploration-exploitation
dilemma in CMDPs. While learning in an unknown CMDP, an agent should trade-off
exploration to discover new information about the MDP, and exploitation of the
current knowledge to maximize the reward while satisfying the constraints.
While the agent will eventually learn a good or optimal policy, we do not want
the agent to violate the constraints too often during the learning process. In
this work, we analyze two approaches for learning in CMDPs. The first approach
leverages the linear formulation of CMDP to perform optimistic planning at each
episode. The second approach leverages the dual formulation (or saddle-point
formulation) of CMDP to perform incremental, optimistic updates of the primal
and dual variables. We show that both achieves sublinear regret w.r.t.\ the
main utility while having a sublinear regret on the constraint violations. That
being said, we highlight a crucial difference between the two approaches; the
linear programming approach results in stronger guarantees than in the dual
formulation based approach.

Some revisions",,,,"cs.CG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study incidences between points and algebraic curves in three dimensions,
taken from a family $C$ of curves that have almost two degrees of freedom,
meaning that every pair of curves intersect in $O(1)$ points, for any pair of
points $p$, $q$, there are only $O(1)$ curves of $C$ that pass through both
points, and a pair $p$, $q$ of points admit a curve of $C$ that passes through
both of them iff $F(p,q)=0$ for some polynomial $F$.
  We study two specific instances, one involving unit circles in $R^3$ that
pass through some fixed point (so called anchored unit circles), and the other
involving tangencies between directed points (points and directions) and
circles in the plane; a directed point is tangent to a circle if the point lies
on the circle and the direction is the tangent direction. A lifting
transformation of Ellenberg et al. maps these tangencies to incidences between
points and curves in three dimensions. In both instances the curves in $R^3$
have almost two degrees of freedom.
  We show that the number of incidences between $m$ points and $n$ anchored
unit circles in $R^3$, as well as the number of tangencies between $m$ directed
points and $n$ arbitrary circles in the plane, is $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5}+m+n)$.
  We derive a similar incidence bound, with a few additional terms, for more
general families of curves in $R^3$ with almost two degrees of freedom.
  The proofs follow standard techniques, based on polynomial partitioning, but
face a novel issue involving surfaces that are infinitely ruled by the
respective family of curves, as well as surfaces in a dual 3D space that are
infinitely ruled by the respective family of suitably defined dual curves.
  The general bound that we obtain is $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5}+m+n)$ plus additional
terms that depend on how many curves or dual curves can lie on an
infinitely-ruled surface.

obtained from the inclusive differential production cross section, measured
using the LHCf Arm2 detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The
measurements are performed in six pseudorapidity regions: three of them ($\eta

acceptance and larger uncertainties, were already published in a previous work,
whereas the remaining three ($10.06 < \eta < 10.75$, $9.65 < \eta < 10.06$ and
$8.65 < \eta < 8.80$) are presented here for the first time. The analysis was
carried out using a data set acquired in June 2015 with a corresponding
integrated luminosity of $\mathrm{0.194~nb^{-1}}$. Comparing the experimental
measurements with the expectations of several hadronic interaction models used
to simulate cosmic ray air showers, none of these generators resulted to have a
satisfactory agreement in all the phase space selected for the analysis. The
inclusive differential production cross section for $\eta > 10.75$ is not
reproduced by any model, whereas the results still indicate a significant but
less serious deviation at lower pseudorapidities. Depending on the
pseudorapidity region, the generators showing the best overall agreement with
data are either SIBYLL 2.3 or EPOS-LHC. Furthermore, apart from the most
forward region, the derived energy flow and cross section distributions are
best reproduced by EPOS-LHC. Finally, even if none of the models describe the
elasticity distribution in a satisfactory way, the extracted average
inelasticity is consistent with the QGSJET II-04 value, while most of the other
generators give values that lie just outside the experimental uncertainties.

autocorrelation functions of these quantities we show importantly that there is
a crossover between two time regimes, in which these functions change behavior
from power-law at the small times, to exponential decay at long times. In the
vicinity of this crossover time, these functions are estimated by log-normal
functions. We also show that the increments of the considered statistical

time is divided into several time-slots, through which multiple users are
served by exploiting power-domain NOMA. To fully exploit underlying benefits of
this hybrid TDMA-NOMA system, we utilize the available resources efficiently by
jointly allocating transmit power and time-slots to several groups of users in
the system. Furthermore, these resources are allocated to maximize minimum rate
of the users in the system. However, this max-min resource allocation problem
is non-convex due to coupled design parameters of time and power allocations.
Hence, we exploit a novel second-order cone formulation to overcome this
non-convexity issue and develop an iterative algorithm to realize a solution to
the original max-min problem. Simulation results show that this joint resource
allocation technique has a considerable performance enhancement in terms of
both minimum achieved rate and overall system throughput compared to that of
the conventional resource allocation technique where equal time-slots are
assigned to the groups of users.

The surface cavity modes for the laser emission are obtained by adding couples
of specifically designed diffraction gratings on top of the planar waveguide,
forming an in-plane Fabry-Perot cavity. It is thanks to the waveguide geometry,
that we can apply a transverse electric field in order to finely tune the laser
energy and quality factor of the cavity modes. Remarkably, we exploit the

different colours in its Visible representation. This makes a direct mapping
from thermal to Visible images impossible and necessitates a solution that

possible colour for certain objects. In this work, a deep learning method to
map the thermal signature from the thermal image's spectrum to a Visible

method is then used to merge the predicted low-frequency representation with
the high-frequency representation extracted from the thermal image. The
proposed model generates colour values consistent with the Visible ground truth

developing quantitative solutions to stochastic mechanical systems. In general,
the problem is perceived as solved when a complete or partial probabilistic
description on the quantity of interest (QoI) is determined. However, in the
presence of complex system behavior, there is a critical need to go beyond mere
probabilistic descriptions. In fact, to gain a full understanding of the
system, it is crucial to extract physical characterizations from the
probabilistic structure of the QoI, especially when the QoI solution is
obtained in a data-driven fashion. Motivated by this perspective, the paper
proposes a framework to obtain structuralized characterizations on behaviors of
stochastic systems. The framework is named Probabilistic Performance-Pattern
Decomposition (PPPD). PPPD analysis aims to decompose complex response
behaviors, conditional to a prescribed performance state, into meaningful
patterns in the space of system responses, and to investigate how the patterns
are triggered in the space of basic random variables. To illustrate the
application of PPPD, the paper studies three numerical examples: 1) an
illustrative example with hypothetical stochastic processes input and output;
2) a stochastic Lorenz system with periodic as well as chaotic behaviors; and
3) a simplified shear-building model subjected to a stochastic ground motion
excitation.

Problem, i.e. the puzzle why the strong interactions conserve parity P and the
product CP of charge conjugation and parity in spite of the fact that the
Standard Model of elementary particles as a whole violates those symmetries.
The original axion was soon ruled out by laboratory experiments and
astrophysical considerations, but a new version was invented which is much more
weakly coupled and which evades the laboratory and astrophysical constraints.
It was dubbed the invisible"" axion. However, the axion cannot be arbitrarily
weakly coupled because it is overproduced in the early universe by vacuum
realignment in the limit of vanishing coupling. The axions produced by vacuum
realignment are a form of cold dark matter today. The axion provides a solution
then not only to the Strong CP Problem but also to the dark matter problem.
Various methods have been proposed to search for dark matter axions and for
axions emitted by the Sun. Their implementation and improvement has led to
significant constraints on the notion of an invisible axion. Even purely
laboratory methods may place significant constraints on invisible axions or
axion-like particles. This review discusses the various methods that have been
proposed and provides theoretical derivations of their signals.

as bacteria or micro-algae, whose properties differ fundamentally from the
passive fluids. Such particles often exhibit an intermittent motion, with
high-motility (run) periods broken by low-motility (tumble) periods. The
average motion can be modified with external stresses, such as nutrient or
light gradients, leading to a directed movement called chemotaxis and
phototaxis, respectively. Using cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.PCC 6803, a

to light stimuli, under isotropic and non-isotropic (directed) conditions. In
particular, we investigate how the intermittent motility is influenced by
illumination. We find that just after a rise in light intensity, the
probability to be in the run state increases. This feature vanishes after a
typical characteristic time of about 1 hour, when initial probability is
recovered. Our results are well described by a mathematical model based on the
linear response theory. When the perturbation is anisotropic, we observe a

have to describe the structure of interactions within the population. Given the
intractability of extensive network collecting, they rely on random network
generators that are supposed to explore the space of plausible networks. We
first identify the needs of modelers, including placing heterogeneous agents on
the network given their attributes and differentiating the various types of
social links that lead to different interactions. We point out the existence of
data in the form of scattered statistics and qualitative observations, that
should be used to parameter the generator. We propose a new approach peculiar
to agent-based modeling, in which we will generate social links from
individuals' observed attributes, and return them as a multiplex network.
Interdependencies between socioeconomic attributes, and generative rules, are
encoded as Bayesian networks. A methodology guides modelers through the
formalization of these parameters. This approach is illustrated by describing
the structure of interactions that supports diffusion of contraceptive

functions of a set of latent variables. Examples are factor analysis or
probabilistic sparse coding which assume weighted linear summations to
determine the mean of Gaussian distribution for the observables. However, in
many cases observables do not follow a normal distribution, and a linear
summation of latents is often at odds with non-Gaussian observables (e.g.,
means of the Bernoulli distribution have to lie in the unit interval).
Furthermore, the assumption of a linear summation model may (for many types of
data) not be closely aligned with the true data generation process even for
Gaussian observables. Alternative superposition models (i.e., alternative links
between latents and observables) have therefore been investigated repeatedly.
Here we show that using the maximization instead of summation to link latents
to observables allows for the derivation of a very general and concise set of
parameter update equations. Concretely, we derive a set of update equations
that has the same functional form for all distributions of the exponential
family. Our results consequently provide directly applicable learning equations
for commonly as well as for unusually distributed data. We numerically verify
our analytical results assuming standard Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson, Bernoulli
and Exponential distributions. We point to some potential applications by
providing different experiments on the learning of variance structure, noise
type estimation, and denoising.

description of second-order 2-to-2 scattering processes in a plane-wave
background field, indicating the necessity of considering the localization of
the colliding particles and achieving that by means of wave packets. We define
a local cross section in the background field, which generalizes the vacuum
cross section and which, though not being directly an observable, allows for a
comparison between the results in the plane wave and in vacuum without relying
on the shape of the incoming wave packets. Two possible cascade or two-step
channels have been identified in the annihilation process and an alternative
way of representing the two-step and one-step contributions via a ""virtuality""
integral has been found. Finally, we compute the total local cross section to
leading order in the coupling between the electron-positron field and the
quantized photon field, excluding the interference between the two
leading-order diagrams arising from the exchange of the two final photons, and
express it in a relatively compact form. In contrast to processes in a
background field initiated by a single particle, the pair annihilation into two

multicast transmission modalities. As antenna elements are becoming smaller and
cheaper in the mmW range compared to radio frequency (RF) chains, it is crucial
to perform antenna selection at the transmitter, such that the available RF
chains are switched to an appropriate subset of antennas. This paper considers
the joint problem of multicast beamforming and antenna selection for a single
multicast group in massive MIMO systems. The prior state-of-art for this
problem relies on semi-definite relaxation (SDR), which cannot scale up to the
massive MIMO regime. A successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach is
proposed to tackle max-min fair joint multicast beamforming and antenna
selection. The key idea of SCA is to successively approximate the non-convex
problem by a class of non-smooth, convex optimization problems. Two fast and
memory efficient first-order methods are proposed to solve each SCA subproblem.
Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing
state-of-art approach in terms of solution quality and run time, in both
traditional and especially in massive MIMO settings.

with the ESPRESSO and X-shooter instruments of the ESO's VLT. We compute
radiative transfer models using CMFGEN that fit the observed spectrum of the
LBV and are consistent with ground-based and archival Hubble Space Telescope
photometry. Our models show that during 2001--2011 the LBV had a luminosity
$L_* = 2.5-3.5 \times 10^6 ~L_{\odot}$, a mass-loss rate $\dot{M} = 0.005-0.020

stellar temperatures of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 6000-6800$~K and
$T_\mathrm{*}=9500-15000$~K. These stellar properties indicate an eruptive
state. We consider two main hypotheses for the absence of the broad emission
components from the spectra obtained since 2011. One possibility is that we are
seeing the end of an LBV eruption of a surviving star, with a mild drop in
luminosity, a shift to hotter effective temperatures, and some dust
obscuration. Alternatively, the LBV could have collapsed to a massive black
hole without the production of a bright supernova.

geometric reasoning and poor scalability. We propose a voxel-map representation

the map points in a regular voxel grid. Visible points from a camera pose are
queried by sampling the camera frustum in a raycasting manner, which can be
done in constant time using an efficient voxel hashing method. Compared with
keyframes, the retrieved points using our method are geometrically guaranteed
to fall in the camera field-of-view, and occluded points can be identified and
removed to a certain extend. This method also naturally scales up to large
scenes and complicated multicamera configurations. Experimental results show
that our voxel map representation is as efficient as a keyframe map with 5
keyframes and provides significantly higher localization accuracy (average 46%
improvement in RMSE) on the EuRoC dataset. The proposed voxel-map
representation is a general approach to a fundamental functionality in visual
SLAM and widely applicable.

soluble-agonist-dependent platelet activation, and the flow of blood through
the injury. The formation of platelet aggregates increases resistance to flow
through the injury, which is modeled using the Stokes-Brinkman equations. Data
from analogous experimental (microfluidic flow) and partial differential
equation models informed parameter values used in the ODE model description of
platelet adhesion, cohesion, and activation. This model predicts injury
occlusion under a range of flow and platelet activation conditions. Simulations
testing the effects of shear and activation rates resulted in delayed occlusion
and aggregate heterogeneity. These results validate our hypothesis that
flow-mediated dilution of activating chemical ADP hinders aggregate

challenge in cellular systems, even as 5G deployment is around the corner.
These users are subject to significant signal attenuation, which also degrades
their uplink channel estimates. Even joint detection using base station (BS)
cooperation often fails to reliably detect such users, due to near-far power
imbalance, and channel estimation errors. Is it possible to bypass the channel
estimation stage and design a detector that can reliably detect cell-edge user
signals under significant near-far imbalance? This paper shows, perhaps
surprisingly, that the answer is affirmative -- albeit not via traditional
multiuser detection. Exploiting that cell-edge user signals are weak but {\em
common} to different base stations, while cell-center users are unique to their
serving BS, this paper establishes an elegant connection between cell-edge user
detection and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of the associated space-time
baseband-equivalent matrices. It proves that CCA identifies the common subspace
of these matrices, even under significant intra- and inter-cell interference.
The resulting mixture of cell-edge user signals can subsequently be unraveled
using a well-known algebraic signal processing technique. Interestingly, the
proposed approach does not even require that the signals from the different
base stations are synchronized -- the right synchronization can be
automatically determined as well. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves order of magnitude BER improvements compared to
`oracle' multiuser detection that assumes perfect knowledge of the cell-center
user channels.

operating rooms in the last decade; however, in image-guided interventions, it
has often only been considered as a visualization device improving traditional
workflows. As a consequence, the technology is gaining minimum maturity that it
requires to redefine new procedures, user interfaces, and interactions. The
main contribution of this paper is to reveal how exemplary workflows are
redefined by taking full advantage of head-mounted displays when entirely
co-registered with the imaging system at all times. The proposed AR landscape
is enabled by co-localizing the users and the imaging devices via the operating
room environment and exploiting all involved frustums to move spatial
information between different bodies. The awareness of the system from the
geometric and physical characteristics of X-ray imaging allows the redefinition
of different human-machine interfaces. We demonstrate that this AR paradigm is
generic, and can benefit a wide variety of procedures. Our system achieved an
error of $4.76\pm2.91$ mm for placing K-wire in a fracture management
procedure, and yielded errors of $1.57\pm1.16^\circ$ and $1.46\pm1.00^\circ$ in

loss has recently attracted considerable attention and has been demonstrated in
various photonic, electrical and mechanical systems in the classical regime.
Here we generalize the definition of PT symmetry to finite-dimensional open
quantum systems, which are described by a Markovian master equation.
Specifically, we show that the invariance of this master equation under a
certain symmetry transformation implies the existence of stationary states with
preserved and broken parity symmetry. As the dimension of the Hilbert space
grows, the transition between these two limiting phases becomes increasingly
sharp and the classically expected PT-symmetry breaking transition is
recovered. This quantum-to-classical correspondence allows us to establish a
common theoretical framework to identify and accurately describe PT-symmetry
breaking effects in a large variety of physical systems, operated both in the
classical and quantum regimes.

via the so-called levitation and pair annihilation process. As disorder is
increased, extended bulk states carrying opposite topological invariants move
towards each other in energy, reducing the size of the topological gap,
eventually meeting and localizing. This results in a topologically trivial
Anderson insulator. Here, we introduce the anomalous levitation and pair
annihilation, a process unique to periodically-driven, or Floquet systems. Due
to the periodicity of the quasienergy spectrum, we find it is possible for the
topological gap to increase as a function of disorder strength. Thus, after all
bulk states have localized, the system remains topologically nontrivial,
forming an anomalous Floquet Anderson insulator (AFAI) phase. We show a
concrete example for this process, adding disorder via onsite potential ""kicks""
to a Chern insulator model. By changing the period between kicks, we can tune
which type of (conventional or anomalous) levitation-and-annihilation occurs in
the system. We expect our results to be applicable to generic Floquet
topological systems and to provide an accessible way to realize AFAIs
experimentally, without the need for multi-step driving schemes.

neutralino is higgsino-like lead to dark matter relic density below the
observed value. In several works this problem is overcome by assuming dark
matter to be constituted of more than one component and the neutralino relic
density deficit is made up from contributions from other components. In this
work we propose that the dark matter consists of just one component, i.e., the
lightest neutralino and the relic density of the higgsino-like neutralino
receives contributions from the usual freeze-out mechanism along with
contributions arising from the decay of hidden sector neutralinos. The model we
propose is an extended MSSM model where the hidden sector is constituted of a
$U(1)_X$ gauge sector along with matter charged under $U(1)_X$ which produce
two neutralinos in the hidden sector. The $U(1)_X$ and the hypercharge $U(1)_Y$
of the MSSM have kinetic and Stueckelberg mass mixing where the mixings are
ultraweak. In this case the hidden sector neutralinos have ultraweak
interactions with the visible sector. Because of their ultraweak interactions
the hidden sector neutralinos are not thermally produced and we assume their
initial relic density to be negligible. However, they can be produced via
interactions of MSSM particles in the early universe, and once produced they
decay to the neutralino. For a range of mixings the decays occur before the BBN
producing additional relic density for the neutralino. Models of this type are
testable in dark matter direct and indirect detection experiments and at the
high luminosity and high energy LHC.

but their SF declined on different timescales. In most of them the outskirts
reached undetectable SFRs before the inner regions (outside-in quenching). Our
sample includes three post-starforming galaxies, two passive galaxies and three
galaxies with intermediate properties. The first population shows blue colors,
deep Hb in absorption (EW>>2.8A), young ages (8.8<log(LW [yr])<9.2). Two of
these galaxies show signs of a central SF enhancement before quenching. Passive
galaxies have instead red colors, EW(Hb)<2.8A, ages in the range

between a post starforming and passive phase, as they quenched in an
intermediate epoch and have not lost all the star forming features yet. The

the standard resummation of the parton distribution function's anomalous

using $k_T$-factorization and BFKL theory, to the case of the fragmentation
function by exploiting the mapping between the dynamics of eikonal lines on

conformal theory. The second approach adapts an angular-ordered evolution
equation, but working in 4-2$\epsilon$ dimensions at all angles. The two

angular momentum do not precess. However, the up-down configuration, in which
the spin of the heavier (lighter) black hole is aligned (anti-aligned) with the
orbital angular momentum, is unstable to spin precession at small orbital
separations. We first cast the spin precession problem in terms of a simple
harmonic oscillator and provide a cleaner derivation of the instability onset.
Surprisingly, we find that following the instability, up-down binaries do not
disperse in the available parameter space but evolve toward precise endpoints.
We then present an analytic scheme to locate these final configurations and
confirm them with numerical integrations. Namely, unstable up-down binaries
approach mergers with the two spins coaligned with each other and equally
misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. Merging up-down binaries relevant
to LIGO/Virgo and LISA may be detected in these endpoint configurations if the
instability onset occurs prior to the sensitivity threshold of the detector. As
a by-product, we obtain new generic results on binary black hole spin-orbit
resonances at 2nd~post-Newtonian order. We finally apply these findings to a
simple astrophysical population of binary black holes where a formation
mechanism aligns the spins without preference for co- or counteralignment, as

polarimetric analysis of the prompt emission of the burst using AstroSat, Fermi
and Niel Gehrels Swift observations. The prompt emission consists of two
distinct emission episodes separated by a few seconds of quiescent/ mild
activity period. The first emission episode shows a thermal component as well
as a low polarisation fraction of $PF < 37\, \%$ at $1.5\, \sigma$ confidence
level. On the other hand, the second emission episode shows a non-thermal
spectrum and is found to be highly polarised with $PF > 43\, \%$ at $1.5
\sigma$ confidence level. We also study the afterglow properties of the jet
using {\it Swift}/XRT data. The observed jet break suggests that the jet is
pointed towards the observer and has an opening angle of $1.2^{\circ}$ for an
assumed redshift, $z = 2$. With composite modelling of polarisation, spectrum
of the prompt emission and the afterglow, we infer that the first episode of
emission originates from the photosphere with localised dissipation happening
below it, and the second from the optically thin region above the photosphere.
The photospheric emission is generated mainly by inverse Compton scattering,
whereas the emission in the optically thin region is produced by the
synchrotron process. The low radiation efficiency of the burst suggests that
the outflow remains baryonic dominated throughout the burst duration with only
a subdominant Poynting flux component, and the kinetic energy of the jet is
likely dissipated via internal shocks which evolves from an optically thick to
optically thin environment within the jet.

experiments. We directly constrain the full $3+1$ active-sterile mixing matrix
elements $|U_{\alpha4}|^2$, with $\alpha \in ( e,\mu ,\tau )$, and the
mass-squared splitting $\Delta m^2_{41} \equiv m_4^2-m_1^2$. We find that

the sterile is only coupled to one of the neutrinos, which is largely explained
by parameter space volume effects. Limits on the mass splitting and the mixing
matrix elements are currently dominated by the cosmological data sets. The
exact results are slightly prior dependent, but we reliably find all matrix
elements to be constrained below $|U_{\alpha4}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-3}$.
  Short-baseline neutrino oscillation hints in favor of eV-scale sterile
neutrinos are in serious tension with these bounds, irrespective of prior
assumptions. We also translate the bounds from the cosmological analysis into
constraints on the parameters probed by laboratory searches, such as $m_\beta$
or $m_{\beta \beta}$, the effective mass parameters probed by $\beta$-decay and
$0\nu\beta\beta$ searches, respectively. When allowing for mixing with a light
sterile neutrino, cosmology leads to upper bounds of $m_\beta < 0.09$ eV and
$m_{\beta \beta} < 0.07$ eV at 95\% C.L, more stringent than the limits from

large eddy simulations (LES). The kinetic energy or entropy are elevated in

aliasing. It is known that the kinetic energy is not a conserved quantity for
compressible flows, but for small Mach numbers minor deviations from a
conserved evolution can be expected. While it is formally possible to construct

young class-II objects. In an attempt to produce the rings and gaps in some of
these systems, they have been modeled numerically with a single embedded planet
assuming a locally isothermal equation of state. This is often justified by
observations targeting the irradiation-dominated outer regions of disks
(approximately 100 au). We test this assumption by conducting hydrodynamics
simulations of embedded planets in thin locally isothermal and radiative disks
that mimic the systems HD 163296 and AS 209 in order to examine the effect of
including the energy equation in a seemingly locally isothermal environment as
far as planet-disk interaction is concerned. We find that modeling such disks
with an ideal equation of state makes a difference in terms of the number of
produced rings and the spiral arm contrast in the disk. Locally isothermal
disks produce sharper annular or azimuthal features and overestimate a single
planet's gap-opening capabilities by producing multiple gaps. In contrast,
planets in radiative disks carve a single gap for typical disk parameters.
Consequently, for accurate modeling of planets with semimajor axes up to about
100 au, radiative effects should be taken into account even in seemingly
locally isothermal disks. In addition, for the case of AS 209, we find that the
primary gap is significantly different between locally isothermal and radiative
models. Our results suggest that multiple planets are required to explain the
ring-rich structures in such systems.

Finsler spaces of indefinite signature. For smooth, positive definite Finsler
metrics, this important theorem states that, if the metric is of Berwald type
(i.e., its Chern-Rund connection defines an affine connection on the underlying
manifold), then it is affinely equivalent to a Riemann space, meaning that its
affine connection is the Levi-Civita connection of some Riemannian metric. We
show for the first time that this result does not extend to Finsler spacetimes.
More precisely, we find a large class of Berwald spacetimes for which the Ricci
tensor of the affine connection is not symmetric. The fundamental difference
from positive definite Finsler spaces that makes such an asymmetry possible, is
the fact that generally, Finsler spacetimes satisfy certain smoothness
properties only on a proper conic subset of the slit tangent bundle. Indeed, we
prove that when the Finsler Lagrangian is smooth on the entire slit tangent
bundle, the Ricci tensor must necessarily be symmetric. For large classes of
Finsler spacetimes, however, the Berwald property does not imply that the
affine structure is equivalent to the affine structure of a pseudo-Riemannian
metric. Instead, the affine structure is that of metric-affine geometry with
vanishing torsion.

speaker recognition system has emerged as an important medium of identifying a

propose the first real-time, universal, and robust adversarial attack against
the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) based speaker recognition
system. Through adding an audio-agnostic universal perturbation on arbitrary
enrolled speaker's voice input, the DNN-based speaker recognition system would
identify the speaker as any target (i.e., adversary-desired) speaker label. In
addition, we improve the robustness of our attack by modeling the sound
distortions caused by the physical over-the-air propagation through estimating
room impulse response (RIR). Experiment using a public dataset of 109 English
speakers demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed attack
with a high attack success rate of over 90%. The attack launching time also
achieves a 100X speedup over contemporary non-universal attacks.

the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. This hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm aims at finding ground state solutions of molecular
systems based on the variational principle. VQE calculations can be
systematically implemented for perturbations to each molecular degree of
freedom, generating a Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) for the
molecule. The PES can then be used to derive thermodynamic properties, which
are often desirable for applications in chemical engineering and materials
design. It is clear from this process that quantum chemistry applications
contain a substantial classical computing component in addition to steps that
can be performed using a quantum computer. In order to design efficient
work-flows that take full advantage of each hardware-type, it is critical to
consider the entire process so that the high-accuracy electronic energies
possible from quantum computing are not squandered in the process of
calculating thermodynamic properties. We present a summary of the hybrid
quantum-classical work-flow to compute thermodynamic properties. This work-flow
contains many options that can significantly affect the efficiency and the
accuracy of the results, including classical optimizer attributes, number of
ansatz repetitions, and how the vibrational Schroedinger equation is solved to
determine vibrational modes. We also analyze the effects of these options by
employing robust statistics along with simulations and experiments on actual
quantum hardware. We show that through careful selection of work-flow options,
nearly order-of-magnitude increases in accuracy are possible at equivalent

morphological neural network obtained by a convex combination of a dilation and
an erosion followed by the application of a hard-limiter function for binary

procedure along with the minimization of the hinge loss function. As a lattice

mathematical morphology, this paper introduces the reduced dilation-erosion

space with an appropriate reduced ordering. Such reduced ordering can be
determined using two approaches: One based on an ensemble of support vector
classifiers (SVCs) with different kernels and the other based on a bagging of
similar SVCs trained using different samples of the training set. Using several
binary classification datasets from the OpenML repository, the ensemble and
bagging r-DEP classifiers yielded in mean higher balanced accuracy scores than
the linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) SVCs as well as their

which exploits the dynamics of a many-body system, initialized in a product
state, along with a sequence of projective measurements in a specific basis.
The procedure has multiple practical advantages as it: (i) enables remote
quantum sensing, protecting a sample from the potentially invasive readout
apparatus; and (ii) simplifies initialization by avoiding complex entangled or
critical ground states. From a fundamental perspective, it harnesses a resource
so far unexploited for sensing, namely, the residual information from the
unobserved part of the many-body system after the wave-function collapses

losses have made significant advancement in visual recognition tasks in
computer vision. When training data exhibit class imbalances, the class-wise
reweighted version of logistic and softmax losses are often used to boost
performance of the unweighted version. In this paper, motivated to explain the
reweighting mechanism, we explicate the learning property of those two loss
functions by analyzing the necessary condition (e.g., gradient equals to zero)
after training CNNs to converge to a local minimum. The analysis immediately
provides us explanations for understanding (1) quantitative effects of the
class-wise reweighting mechanism: deterministic effectiveness for binary
classification using logistic loss yet indeterministic for multi-class
classification using softmax loss; (2) disadvantage of logistic loss for
single-label multi-class classification via one-vs.-all approach, which is due
to the averaging effect on predicted probabilities for the negative class
(e.g., non-target classes) in the learning process. With the disadvantage and
advantage of logistic loss disentangled, we thereafter propose a novel
reweighted logistic loss for multi-class classification. Our simple yet
effective formulation improves ordinary logistic loss by focusing on learning
hard non-target classes (target vs. non-target class in one-vs.-all) and turned
out to be competitive with softmax loss. We evaluate our method on several
benchmark datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

the robustness of a given in-painting neural network against variations in hole
geometry distributions. We observe that the robustness of an in-painting
network is dependent on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the hole
geometry presented to it during its training even if the underlying image
dataset used (in training and testing) does not alter. We develop an
experimental methodology for testing and evaluating relative robustness of
in-painting networks against four different kinds of hole geometry PDFs. We
examine a number of hypothesis regarding (1) the natural bias of in-painting
networks to the hole distribution used for their training, (2) the underlying
dataset's ability to differentiate relative robustness as hole distributions
vary in a train-test (cross-comparison) grid, and (3) the impact of the
directional distribution of edges in the holes and in the image dataset. We
present results for L1, PSNR and SSIM quality metrics and develop a specific
measure of relative in-painting robustness to be used in cross-comparison grids

that tensile strain induces ferromagnetism even in the absence of oxygen

  Channels for Binary Signal Detection Tasks","10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE-TMI",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective assessment of image quality (IQ) has been advocated for the
analysis and optimization of medical imaging systems. One method of obtaining
such IQ metrics is through a mathematical observer. The Bayesian ideal observer
is optimal by definition for signal detection tasks, but is frequently both
intractable and non-linear. As an alternative, linear observers are sometimes
used for task-based image quality assessment. The optimal linear observer is
the Hotelling observer (HO). The computational cost of calculating the HO
increases with image size, making a reduction in the dimensionality of the data
desirable. Channelized methods have become popular for this purpose, and many
competing methods are available for computing efficient channels. In this work,
a novel method for learning channels using an autoencoder (AE) is presented.
AEs are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are frequently employed
to learn concise representations of data to reduce dimensionality. Modifying
the traditional AE loss function to focus on task-relevant information permits
the development of efficient AE-channels. These AE-channels were trained and
tested on a variety of signal shapes and backgrounds to evaluate their
performance. In the experiments, the AE-learned channels were competitive with
and frequently outperformed other state-of-the-art methods for approximating
the HO. The performance gains were greatest for the datasets with a small
number of training images and noisy estimates of the signal image. Overall, AEs
are demonstrated to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods for generating
efficient channels for the HO and can have superior performance on small
datasets.

Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) Boolean SAT solvers. While the utility
of such policies has been well-established empirically, a theoretical
explanation of whether restarts are indeed crucial to the power of CDCL solvers
is lacking. In this paper, we prove a series of theoretical results that
characterize the power of restarts for various models of SAT solvers. More
precisely, we make the following contributions. First, we prove an exponential
separation between a {\it drunk} randomized CDCL solver model with restarts and
the same model without restarts using a family of satisfiable instances.
Second, we show that the configuration of CDCL solver with VSIDS branching and
restarts (with activities erased after restarts) is exponentially more powerful
than the same configuration without restarts for a family of unsatisfiable
instances. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first separation results
involving restarts in the context of SAT solvers. Third, we show that restarts
do not add any proof complexity-theoretic power vis-a-vis a number of models of

applications is data capacity and bandwidth, in both inter-node communications
and even more-so in on-node data motion. A new approach to address this
limitation is to make use of data compression in the form of a compressed data
array. Storing data in a compressed data array and converting to standard
IEEE-754 types as needed during a computation can reduce the pressure on
bandwidth and storage. However, repeated conversions (lossy compression and
decompression) introduce additional approximation errors, which need to be
shown to not significantly affect the simulation results. We extend recent work
[J. Diffenderfer, et al., Error Analysis of ZFP Compression for Floating-Point
Data, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2019] that analyzed the error of a
single use of compression and decompression of the ZFP compressed data array
representation [P. Lindstrom, Fixed-rate compressed floating-point arrays, IEEE
Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2014] to the case of
time-stepping and iterative schemes, where an advancement operator is
repeatedly applied in addition to the conversions. We show that the accumulated
error for iterative methods involving fixed-point and time evolving iterations
is bounded under standard constraints. An upper bound is established on the
number of additional iterations required for the convergence of stationary
fixed-point iterations. An additional analysis of traditional forward and
backward error of stationary iterative methods using ZFP compressed arrays is
also presented. The results of several 1D, 2D, and 3D test problems are

harmonic generation are studied by considering a tight-binding model expanded
up to third order in $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$. By solving exactly the
free-carrier dynamics of the carriers when interacting with intense and
ultrashort pulses of light, we predict the photogenerated current in a
nonperturbative way and study its harmonic composition. We find frequency and
amplitude modulation of the nonlinear current in quadratic and cubic models.
Furthermore, we demonstrate anisotropy-induced modulation of the intensity of
higher-order harmonics and the existence of harmonic crossovers, depending on

applied to any general effective two-band model and offer a pathway to identify

pulsed and imaged continuum flux densities throughout the eclipses reveals many
similarities between the excess material within the two binaries, irrespective
of the companion star properties. The observations show that the pulsar fluxes
are removed from the line of sight throughout the main body of the eclipses.
For PSR J1816+4510 we present the first direct evidence of an eclipse mechanism
that transitions from one that removes the pulsar flux from the line of sight
to one that merely smears out pulsations, and claim that this is a consequence
of scattering in a tail of material flowing behind the companion. Inferred mass

faults, resulting in significant performance declines. To allow fault recovery
from randomly injected faults to different robots in a swarm, a model-free
approach may be preferable due to the accumulation of faults in models and the
difficulty to predict the behaviour of neighbouring robots. One model-free
approach to fault recovery involves two phases: during simulation, a
quality-diversity algorithm evolves a behaviourally diverse archive of
controllers; during the target application, a search for the best controller is
initiated after fault injection. In quality-diversity algorithms, the choice of
the behavioural descriptor is a key design choice that determines the quality
of the evolved archives, and therefore the fault recovery performance. Although
the environment is an important determinant of behaviour, the impact of
environmental diversity is often ignored in the choice of a suitable
behavioural descriptor. This study compares different behavioural descriptors,
including two generic descriptors that work on a wide range of tasks, one
hand-coded descriptor which fits the domain of interest, and one novel type of
descriptor based on environmental diversity, which we call
Quality-Environment-Diversity (QED). Results demonstrate that the
above-mentioned model-free approach to fault recovery is feasible in the
context of swarm robotics, reducing the fault impact by a factor 2-3. Further,
the environmental diversity obtained with QED yields a unique behavioural

coherent evolution is interrupted by discrete events, such as binding of a

requiring small step sizes. Here, we completely re-assess the foundations of
chemical exchange models and redesign a master equation treatment accurate to

graphene near of the graphene-contact heterojunction. We also show that such
interaction is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the metal-graphene
interface. By changing the type metal in the contact, we observe that Ohmic
contacts can be strongly or weakly electrostatically coupled with graphene. For
strongly coupled contacts, the signature of the charge transfer effect promoted
by the contacts results on an asymmetric ambipolar conduction, and such
asymmetry can be tunable under interaction with H2. On the other hand, for
contacts weakly coupled with graphene, the hydrogen interaction has a more
profound effect. In such situation, the devices show a second charge neutrality
point in graphene transistor transfer curves (a double-peak response) upon H2
exposure. We propose that this double-peak phenomenon arises from the
decoupling of the work function of graphene and that of the metallic electrodes
induced by the H2 molecules. We also show that the gas-induced modifications at
the metal-graphene interface can be exploited to create a controlled graphene
p-n junction, with considerable electron transfer to graphene layer and
significant variation in the graphene resistance. These effects can pave the
way for a suitable metallic contact engineering providing great potential for

relations between some fundamental physical quantities, such as the
mass-metallicity and the main sequence relations. We aim at studying the
evolution of galaxies that, at a given redshift, lie simultaneously on the
mass-metallicity and main sequence relations (MZR, MSR). To this aim, we use
the analytical, 'leaky-box' chemical evolution model of Spitoni et al. (2017),
in which galaxy evolution is described by an infall timescale $\tau$ and a wind
efficiency $\lambda$. We provide a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution
of galactic metallicity, stellar mass, mass-weighted age and gas fraction. The
evolution of the galaxies lying on the MZR and MSR at $z\sim0.1$ suggests that
the average infall time-scale in two different bins of stellar masses
($M_{\star}<10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\star}>10^{10} M_{\odot}$) decreases
with decreasing redshift. This means that at each redshift, only the youngest
galaxies can be assembled on the shortest timescales and still belong to the
star-forming MSR. In the lowest mass bin, a decrease of the median $\tau$ is
accompanied by an increase of the median $\lambda$ value. This implies that
systems which have formed at more recent times will need to eject a larger
amount of mass to keep their metallicity at low values. Another important
result is that galactic downsizing, as traced by the age-mass relation, is
naturally recovered by imposing that local galaxies lie on both the MZR and
MSR. Finally, we study the evolution of the hosts of C$_{\rm IV}$ -selected
AGN, which at $z\sim 2$ follow a flat MZR, as found by Mignoli et al. (2019).
If we impose that these systems lie on the MSR, at lower redshifts we find an
'inverted' MZR, meaning that some additional processes must be at play in their
evolution.

Presently neutrino physics provides the most intriguing framework to formulate
new physics. This is so because, in addition to the problem of the lightness of
the active standard neutrinos, currently MiniBooNE experimental result may be
indicating that sterile neutrinos exist and are light, too. In this case, it is
reasonable to expect that the framework that yields light active and sterile
neutrinos could stabilize the vacuum, too. In order to achieve this goal, we
consider an extension of the standard model which involves new fermions in the
form of right-handed neutrinos ($\nu_R$) and new scalars in the form of triplet
($\Delta$) and singlet ($\sigma$). Within this framework, tiny masses are
obtained when we consider that lepton number is spontaneously broken at low
energy scale which means that $\Delta$ and $\sigma$, both, develop very small
vacuum expectation values. We investigate if this setting leads to a stable
vacuum. For this we obtain the whole set of conditions over the Quartic Terms
of the Potential that ensures that the model is Bounded From Below(BFB) and
evaluate the RGE-evolution of the self coupling of the Higgs. We show that in
such a scenario the Quartic Coupling $\Phi^T \Delta \Phi \sigma$, where $\Phi$
is the standard Higgs doublet, is responsible for the stability of the
Electroweak Vacuum up to Planck scale. We also extract constraints over the

important, H$_2$ sensors based on MoS$_2$ FETs show desirable properties such

experimental results indicate that the conductivity of MoS$_2$ monotonically
increases as a function of the H$_2$ concentration due to a reversible charge

H$_2$ adsorption driven by interaction with sulfur vacancies in the MoS$_2$

governing equations. Neglect of this commutation term gives rise to commutation
error. While the commutation error is well recognized, it is often ignored in
practice. Moreover, the commutation error arising from the implicit part of the
filter (i.e., projection onto the underlying discretization) has not been well
investigated. Modeling the commutator between numerical projection and
differentiation is crucial for correcting errors induced by resolution
inhomogeneity in practical LES settings, which typically rely solely on
implicit filtering. Here, we employ a multiscale asymptotic analysis to
investigate the characteristics of the commutator. This provides a statistical
description of the commutator, which can serve as a target for the statistical
characteristics of a commutator model. Further, we investigate how commutation
error manifests in simulation and demonstrate its impact on the convection of a
packet of homogeneous isotropic turbulence through an inhomogeneous grid. A
connection is made between the commutation error and the propagation properties

both more sensitive to new data and less affected by multiple minima ---

to say, instead of generating an arbitrary image as a sample from the manifold

super-resolution is the task of predicting the image closest to the ground

high resolution images given extremely small inputs with a new method called
Latent Adversarial Generator (LAG). In our generative sampling framework, we
only use the input (possibly of very low-resolution) to direct what class of

load-balancing policies are challenged by the rapid growth of cloud
infrastructure and the increasing levels of server heterogeneity. In such
heterogeneous systems with many load-balancers, traditional solutions, such as
JSQ, incur a prohibitively large communication overhead and detrimental incast
effects due to herd behavior. Alternative low-communication policies, such as
JSQ(d) and the recently proposed JIQ, are either unstable or provide poor
performance.
  We introduce the Local Shortest Queue (LSQ) family of load balancing
algorithms. In these algorithms, each dispatcher maintains its own, local, and
possibly outdated view of the server queue lengths, and keeps using JSQ on its
local view. A small communication overhead is used infrequently to update this
local view. We formally prove that as long as the error in these local
estimates of the server queue lengths is bounded in expectation, the entire
system is strongly stable. Finally, in simulations, we show how simple and
stable LSQ policies exhibit appealing performance and significantly outperform
existing low-communication policies, while using an equivalent communication
budget. In particular, our simple policies often outperform even JSQ due to
their reduction of herd behavior. We further show how, by relying on smart
servers (i.e., advanced pull-based communication), we can further improve
performance and lower communication overhead.

$T_{2LM} \propto (\eta/T)^{-1/2}$ with a phenomenological model of $^1$H-$^1$H

of the $T_{1} \propto f_0$ dispersion and $T_2$ of similar polymers simulated

agreement with measurements and the model. The $T_{1} \propto f_0$ dispersion

resonant with orbital motion; understanding this process is important for
accurately modeling GW emission from these binaries, and for extracting NS
information from GW data. In this paper, we carry out a systematic study on the
tidal excitation of fundamental modes of spinning NSs in coalescencing
binaries, focusing on the case when the NS spin is anti-aligned with the
orbital angular momentum-where the tidal resonance is most likely to take
place. We first expand NS oscillations into stellar eigen-modes, and then
obtain a Hamiltonian that governs the tidally coupled orbit-mode evolution. We
next find a new approximation that can lead to analytic expressions of tidal
excitations to a high accuracy, and are valid in all regimes of the binary
evolution: adiabatic, resonant, and post-resonance. Using the method of
osculating orbits, we obtain semi-analytic approximations to the orbital
evolution and GW emission; their agreements with numerical results give us
confidence in on our understanding of the system's dynamics. In particular, we
recover both the averaged post-resonance evolution, which differs from the
pre-resonance point-particle orbit by shifts in orbital energy and angular
momentum, as well as instantaneous perturbations driven by the tidal motion.
Finally, we use the Fisher matrix technique to study the effect of dynamical
tides on parameter estimation. We find that the dynamical tides may potentially
provide an additional channel to study the physics of NSs. The method presented

metric which parametrically deviates from the Kerr metric in a
model-independent way. Given such a metric, one can then predict the ensuing
corrections to both the inspiral and ringdown portions of the gravitational
waveform for black holes present in the new spacetime. With these tools in
hand, one can then test gravitational wave signals for such effects by two

apply this to two example beyond-Kerr spacetimes each parameterized by a single
non-Kerr parameter. We then predict the beyond-Kerr parameter magnitudes
required in an observed gravitational wave signal to be statistically
inconsistent with the Kerr case in general relativity. We find that the two

incompletely resolved brief anomaly feature around the peak of the light curve.
Although the origin of the anomaly is identified to be a companion to the lens

degeneracy types. The first type is the ambiguity in $\rho$, representing the
angular source radius scaled to the angular radius of the Einstein ring,
$\theta_{\rm E}$, and the other is the $s\leftrightarrow s^{-1}$ degeneracy.
The former type, `finite-source degeneracy', causes ambiguities in both $s$ and
$q$, while the latter induces an ambiguity only in $s$. Here $s$ denotes the
separation (in units of $\theta_{\rm E}$) in projection between the lens
components. We estimate that the lens components have masses $(M_1, M_2)\sim
(0.27^{+0.36}_{-0.15}~M_\odot, 11^{+16}_{-7}~M_{\rm J})$ and $\sim
(0.48^{+0.40}_{-0.28}~M_\odot, 1.3^{+1.1}_{-0.7}~M_{\rm J})$ according to the
two solutions subject to the finite-source degeneracy, indicating that the lens
comprises an M dwarf and a companion with a mass around the planet/brown dwarf
boundary or a Jovian-mass planet. It is possible to lift the finite-source
degeneracy by conducting future observations utilizing a high resolution
instrument because the relative lens-source proper motion predicted by the

loss while the long-term period increase is due to mass transfer from the less

identified from their clustering features in dynamical space using 6D kinematic
data by combining LAMOST DR5 and Gaia DR2 surveys. They map a diffuse structure
that extends over at least 100 degrees in the northern and southern Galactic
hemispheres, at heliocentric distances between 20 to 50 kpc. Taking advantage
of this expanded dataset, we model the stream with a suite of tailored N-body
simulations. Our findings exclude the possibility that the NGC 5824 globular
cluster is the core of the progenitor of the stream, as postulated by previous
studies. Our best models, which successfully reproduce the features of the CS
indicate that the progenitor is likely a dwarf galaxy of $\sim$
2$\times$10$^9$M$_{\odot}$, with a diffuse disc morphology. The merger occured
$\sim$ 5 Gyr ago and since then it has experienced approximately eight
apo-center passages. Our results suggest that NGC 5824 was either a globular
cluster situated off-centre in the dwarf progenitor or, alternatively, it was
the nuclear star cluster of another dwarf galaxy that has very similar orbit as
the progenitor of the CS. In both scenarios, the progenitor systems would leave
streams around NGC 5824, but with distinct distance distributions. To
discriminate between these scenarios, the detection and accurate distance
measurements of the predicted stream around the GC are crucial, which will be
possible in the upcoming LSST era. Our simulations also predict that part of
the Southern Cetus stream is very likely the newly discovered Palca stream, and
possibly related to another, more diffuse Southern substructure, the
Eridanus-Pheonix overdensity.

a time-dependent variation in path length for starlight traveling to Earth.
These variations can be used for coherently pulsating stars, such as the
{\delta} Scuti variables, to constrain the masses and orbits of their
companions. Observing these variations for {\delta} Scuti stars has previously
relied on subdividing the light curve and measuring the average pulsation phase
in equally sized subdivisions, which leads to under-sampling near periapsis. We
introduce a new approach that simultaneously forward-models each sample in the
light curve and show that this method improves upon current sensitivity limits
- especially in the case of highly eccentric and short-period binaries. We find
that this approach is sensitive enough to observe Jupiter mass planets around
{\delta} Scuti stars under ideal conditions, and use gravity-mode pulsations in
the subdwarf B star KIC 7668647 to detect its companion without radial velocity
data. We further provide robust detection limits as a function of the SNR of
the pulsation mode and determine that the minimum detectable light travel time
amplitude for a typical Kepler {\delta} Scuti is around 2 s. This new method
significantly enhances the application of light travel time variations to
detecting short period binaries with pulsating components, and pulsating A-type
exoplanet host stars, especially as a tool for eliminating false positives.

network verification tools have been developed that can certify robustness with

formal verification intractable. This work combines the adaptive stress testing

two of the richest known galaxy clusters within 100 million light-years,
nominally, Virgo and Fornax. Fornax UCD3 is the most luminous known UCD and M59
UCD3 is the most massive known UCD. With the detection of a 3.5 million solar
mass black hole (BH) in Fornax UCD3, we carefully model several dark matter
(DM) enhanced profile scenarios, considering the presence of both a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) and DM. For Fornax UCD3, the comparison of the
stellar and dynamical masses suggests that there is little content of DM in
UCDs. M59 UCD3 did not receive the same attention in simulations as Fornax
UCD3, however deep radio imaging and X-ray observations were performed for M59
UCD3 and can be used to place limits in DM content of these UCDs. We take an
average estimate of dark matter content and used the Salpeter and Kroupa mass
functions. We model Fornax UCD3 and M59 UCD3 to have a DM content that is the
average of these mass functions. We then analyze the constraints for Fornax and
M59 UCD3 coming from $\gamma$-ray and radio sources, considering a dark matter
particle with a mass between 10 and 34 GeV in our simulations. In the absence
of a strong $\gamma$-ray signature, we show that the synchrotron emission from
electrons and positrons produced by DM annihilations can be very sensitive to
indirect DM search. We find that DM parameters can be significantly constrained
at radio frequencies and that the spike profiles play an interesting role in
the deep study of the enhancements of DM & BH interactions in ultra-compact

comprises of (i) the emerging millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor to collect
the human body's point cloud along with the body centroid, and (ii) a
variational recurrent autoencoder (VRAE) to compute the anomaly level of the
body motion based on the acquired point cloud. A fall is claimed to have
occurred when the spike in anomaly level and the drop in centroid height occur
simultaneously. The mmWave radar sensor provides several advantages, such as
privacycompliance and high-sensitivity to motion, over the traditional sensing
modalities. However, (i) randomness in radar point cloud data and (ii)
difficulties in fall collection/labeling in the traditional supervised fall
detection approaches are the two main challenges. To overcome the randomness in
radar data, the proposed VRAE uses variational inference, a probabilistic
approach rather than the traditional deterministic approach, to infer the
posterior probability of the body's latent motion state at each frame, followed
by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the temporal features of the
motion over multiple frames. Moreover, to circumvent the difficulties in fall
data collection/labeling, the VRAE is built upon an autoencoder architecture in
a semi-supervised approach, and trained on only normal activities of daily
living (ADL) such that in the inference stage the VRAE will generate a spike in
the anomaly level once an abnormal motion, such as fall, occurs. During the
experiment, we implemented the VRAE along with two other baselines, and tested
on the dataset collected in an apartment. The receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve indicates that our proposed model outperforms the other two
baselines, and achieves 98% detection out of 50 falls at the expense of just 2
false alarms.

events triggering the variability in Arctic ice cover has drawn increasing
attention. A non-Gaussian $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process is thought to be an
appropriate model to describe such extreme event. The maximal likely
trajectory, based on the nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation, is applied to a
nonautonomous Arctic sea ice system under $\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise. Two
types of tipping times, the early-warning tipping time and the
disaster-happening tipping time, are used to predict the critical time for the
maximal likely transition from a perennially ice-covered state to a seasonally
ice-free one, and from a seasonally ice-free state to a perennially ice-free
one, respectively. We find that the increased intensity of extreme events
results in shorter warning time for sea ice melting, and that an enhanced
greenhouse effect will intensify this influence, making the arrival of warning
time significantly earlier. Meanwhile, for the enhanced greenhouse effect, we
discover that increased intensity and frequency of extreme events will advance
the disaster-happening tipping time, in which an ice-free state is maintained
throughout the year in the Arctic Ocean. Finally, we identify values of L\'evy
index $\alpha$ and noise intensity $\epsilon$ in $\alpha \epsilon$-space that
can trigger a transition between the Arctic sea ice state. These results
provide an effective theoretical framework for studying Arctic sea ice

transport and spin distribution at room temperature in a Si two-dimensional
(2D) inversion channel of back-gate-type spin metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors (spin MOSFETs). The magnetoresistance ratio of the
spin MOSFET with a channel length of 0.4$\mu$m was increased by a factor of 6
from that in our previous paper [Phys. Rev. B 99, 165301 (2019)] by lowering
the parasitic resistances at the source/drain junctions with
highly-phosphorus-doped n+-Si regions and by increasing the lateral electric
field in the channel along the electron transport, called ""spin drift"". Clear
Hanle signals with some oscillation peaks were observed for the spin MOSFET
with a channel length of 10 $\mu$ m under the lateral electric field,
indicating that the effective spin diffusion length is dramatically enhanced by
the spin drift. By taking into account the n+-Si regions and the spin drift in
the channel, one-dimensional analytic functions were derived for analyzing the
effect of the spin drift on the spin transport through the channel and these
functions were found to explain almost all the experimental results. From the
calculated spin current and spin distribution, it was revealed that almost all
the spins are unflipped during the spin-drift-assisted transport through the
0.4-$\mu$m-long inversion channel, but the most part of the injected spins from
the source electrode are relaxed in the n+-Si regions of both the source and
drain junctions. This means that the spin drift is useful and precise design of
the device structure is essential to obtain a higher magnetoresistance ratio.
Furthermore, we showed that the effective spin resistances that are introduced
in this study are very helpful to understand how to improve the
magnetoresistance ratio of spin MOSFETs for practical use.

expensive, as it requires many executions of a costly radiative transfer (RT)

surrogate model that predicts spectra given model parameters, providing a fast

significant speed enhancements over traditional RT, albeit not as much as ML
methods with lower posterior accuracy. Our method is ~9x faster per parallel

the solution quality. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly,
we develop a simple greedy algorithm that has provably strong worst case
guarantees. The greedy algorithm adds a simple preprocessing step to remove
noise, which can be combined with any $k$-means clustering algorithm. This
algorithm gives the first pseudo-approximation-preserving reduction from
$k$-means with outliers to $k$-means without outliers. Secondly, we show how to
construct a coreset of size $O(k \log n)$. When combined with our greedy
algorithm, we obtain a scalable, near linear time algorithm. The theoretical
contributions are verified experimentally by demonstrating that the algorithm
quickly removes noise and obtains a high-quality clustering.

with long-range attraction (BAWL). The long-range attraction makes hopping
biased in such a manner that particle's hopping along the direction to the
nearest particle has larger transition rate than hopping against the direction.
Still, unlike the L\'evy flight, a particle only hops to one of its
nearest-neighbor sites. The strength of bias takes the form $x^{-\sigma}$ with
non-negative $\sigma$, where $x$ is the distance to the nearest particle from a
particle to hop. By extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the
critical decay exponent $\delta$ varies continuously with $\sigma$ up to
$\sigma=1$ and $\delta$ is the same as the critical decay exponent of the
directed Ising (DI) universality class for $\sigma \ge 1$. Investigating the
behavior of the density in the absorbing phase, we argue that $\sigma=1$ is
indeed the threshold that separates the DI and non-DI critical behavior. We
also show by Monte Carlo simulations that branching bias with symmetric hopping
exhibits the same critical behavior as the BAWL.

categories in an aerial image. It empowers smart city traffic management and
disaster rescue. Researchers have made mount of efforts in this area and
achieved considerable progress. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge when the
objects are hard to distinguish, especially in low light conditions. To tackle
this problem, we construct a large-scale drone-based RGB-Infrared vehicle
detection dataset, termed DroneVehicle. Our DroneVehicle collects 28, 439
RGB-Infrared image pairs, covering urban roads, residential areas, parking
lots, and other scenarios from day to night. Due to the great gap between RGB
and infrared images, cross-modal images provide both effective information and
redundant information. To address this dilemma, we further propose an
uncertainty-aware cross-modality vehicle detection (UA-CMDet) framework to
extract complementary information from cross-modal images, which can
significantly improve the detection performance in low light conditions. An
uncertainty-aware module (UAM) is designed to quantify the uncertainty weights
of each modality, which is calculated by the cross-modal Intersection over
Union (IoU) and the RGB illumination value. Furthermore, we design an
illumination-aware cross-modal non-maximum suppression algorithm to better
integrate the modal-specific information in the inference phase. Extensive
experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate the flexibility and
effectiveness of the proposed method for crossmodality vehicle detection. The

depth estimation, but low-light conditions limit these capabilities. To restore
low-light LFs we should harness the geometric cues present in different LF
views, which is not possible using single-frame low-light enhancement
techniques. We, therefore, propose a deep neural network for Low-Light Light
Field (L3F) restoration, which we refer to as L3Fnet. The proposed L3Fnet not
only performs the necessary visual enhancement of each LF view but also
preserves the epipolar geometry across views. We achieve this by adopting a
two-stage architecture for L3Fnet. Stage-I looks at all the LF views to encode
the LF geometry. This encoded information is then used in Stage-II to
reconstruct each LF view. To facilitate learning-based techniques for low-light
LF imaging, we collected a comprehensive LF dataset of various scenes. For each
scene, we captured four LFs, one with near-optimal exposure and ISO settings
and the others at different levels of low-light conditions varying from low to
extreme low-light settings. The effectiveness of the proposed L3Fnet is
supported by both visual and numerical comparisons on this dataset. To further
analyze the performance of low-light reconstruction methods, we also propose an
L3F-wild dataset that contains LF captured late at night with almost zero lux
values. No ground truth is available in this dataset. To perform well on the
L3F-wild dataset, any method must adapt to the light level of the captured
scene. To do this we propose a novel pre-processing block that makes L3Fnet
robust to various degrees of low-light conditions. Lastly, we show that L3Fnet
can also be used for low-light enhancement of single-frame images, despite it
being engineered for LF data. We do so by converting the single-frame DSLR
image into a form suitable to L3Fnet, which we call as pseudo-LF.

thermoelectric performance of two dimensional monolayer HfS 2 , HfSe 2 and
their Janus monolayer HfSSe has been performed with the help of density
functional theory and Boltzmann transport equation. Thermodynamical stability
of all three structures has been confirmed from phonon dispersion curves. The
thermoelectric parameters such as Seebeck coefficient, power factor and
electrical conductivity have been calculated at 300K, 400K and 500K. The
lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature has been found very low in
monolayer HfS 2 , HfSe 2 and HfSSe Janus monolayer as compared to very popular
TMDCs such as MoS 2 and WS 2 . An ultralow value of lattice thermal
conductivity of the value of 0.36 W/mK at room temperature in Janus monolayer
HfSSe has been found which is lower than that of monolayer HfS 2 and HfSe 2
because of the very low group velocity and short phonon lifetime in HfSSe. This
ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in Janus monolayer HfSSe results a very
high thermoelectric figure of merit close to the value of 1 at room
temperature. By constructing the Janus monolayer of HfS 2 and HfSe 2 the
thermoelectric performances significantly enhanced. Our theoretical
investigation predicts that Janus monolayer HfSSe can be a revolutionary
candidate for the fabrication of next generation wearable thermoelectric power

  Chain Graph Model","Accepted by TKDD",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently latent factor model (LFM) has been drawing much attention in
recommender systems due to its good performance and scalability. However,
existing LFMs predict missing values in a user-item rating matrix only based on
the known ones, and thus the sparsity of the rating matrix always limits their
performance. Meanwhile, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective
way to alleviate the label (i.e., rating) sparsity problem by performing label
propagation, which is mainly based on the smoothness insight on affinity
graphs. However, graph-based SSL suffers serious scalability and graph
unreliable problems when directly being applied to do recommendation. In this
paper, we propose a novel probabilistic chain graph model (CGM) to marry SSL
with LFM. The proposed CGM is a combination of Bayesian network and Markov
random field. The Bayesian network is used to model the rating generation and
regression procedures, and the Markov random field is used to model the
confidence-aware smoothness constraint between the generated ratings.
Experimental results show that our proposed CGM significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of four evaluation metrics, and with a
larger performance margin when data sparsity increases.

for graph data. However, it is challenging for industrial communities to
leverage the techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), and solve
real-world problems at scale because of inherent data dependency in the graphs.
As such, we cannot simply train a GNN with classic learning systems, for
instance parameter server that assumes data parallel. Existing systems store
the graph data in-memory for fast accesses either in a single machine or graph
stores from remote. The major drawbacks are in three-fold. First, they cannot
scale because of the limitations on the volume of the memory, or the bandwidth
between graph stores and workers. Second, they require extra development of
graph stores without well exploiting mature infrastructures such as MapReduce
that guarantee good system properties. Third, they focus on training but ignore
the optimization of inference over graphs, thus makes them an unintegrated
system.
  In this paper, we design AGL, a scalable, fault-tolerance and integrated
system, with fully-functional training and inference for GNNs. Our system
design follows the message passing scheme underlying the computations of GNNs.
We design to generate the $k$-hop neighborhood, an information-complete
subgraph for each node, as well as do the inference simply by merging values
from in-edge neighbors and propagating values to out-edge neighbors via
MapReduce. In addition, the $k$-hop neighborhood contains information-complete
subgraphs for each node, thus we simply do the training on parameter servers
due to data independency. Our system AGL, implemented on mature
infrastructures, can finish the training of a 2-layer graph attention network
on a graph with billions of nodes and hundred billions of edges in 14 hours,
and complete the inference in 1.2 hour.

analysis (IVA) can solve the problem by separating into $M$ sources and
selecting the top $K$ highly nonstationary signals among them, but this
approach suffers from a waste of computation especially when $K \ll M$. Channel
reductions in preprocessing of IVA by, e.g., principle component analysis have
the risk of removing the target signals. We here extend IVA to resolve these
issues. One such extension has been attained by assuming the orthogonality
constraint (OC) that the sample correlation between the target and noise
signals is to be zero. The proposed IVA, on the other hand, does not rely on OC
and exploits only the independence between sources and the stationarity of the
noises. This enables us to develop several efficient algorithms based on block
coordinate descent methods with a problem specific acceleration. We clarify
that one such algorithm exactly coincides with the conventional IVA with OC,
and also explain that the other newly developed algorithms are faster than it.
Experimental results show the improved computational load of the new algorithms

analysis using the N2H+ 3-2 and 1-0 data, the density and temperature of the
filaments are estimated to be ~10^7 cm-3 and ~15-20 K, respectively. The core
fragmentation is observed in three massive filaments, one of which shows the
oscillations in the velocity and intensity that could be the signature of
core-forming gas motions. The gas kinetic temperature is significantly enhanced
in the eastern part of OMC1, likely due to the external heating from the high
mass stars in M42 and M43. In addition, the filaments are colder than their
surrounding regions, suggesting the shielding from the external heating due to
the dense gas in the filaments. The OMC1 region consists of three sub-regions,
i.e. north, west, and south of Orion KL, having different radial velocities
with sharp velocity transitions. There is a north-to-south velocity gradient
from the western to the southern regions. The observed velocity pattern

show that real image datasets are actually separated. With this property in
mind, we then prove that robustness and accuracy should both be achievable for
benchmark datasets through locally Lipschitz functions, and hence, there should
be no inherent tradeoff between robustness and accuracy. Through extensive
experiments with robustness methods, we argue that the gap between theory and
practice arises from two limitations of current methods: either they fail to
impose local Lipschitzness or they are insufficiently generalized. We explore
combining dropout with robust training methods and obtain better
generalization. We conclude that achieving robustness and accuracy in practice
may require using methods that impose local Lipschitzness and augmenting them

extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS) to study the role of bulges both
along and across the galaxy star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We show that the
slope in the $sSFR$-$M_{\star}$ relation flattens by $\sim$0.1 dex per decade
in $M_{\star}$ when re-normalising $sSFR$ by disc stellar mass instead of total
stellar mass. However, recasting the $sSFR$-$M_{\star}$ relation into the
framework of only disc-specific quantities shows that a residual trend remains
against disc stellar mass with equivalent slope and comparable scatter to that
of the total galaxy relation. This suggests that the residual declining slope
of the SFMS is intrinsic to the disc components of galaxies. We further
investigate the distribution of bulge-to-total ratios ($B/T$) as a function of
distance from the SFMS ($\Delta SFR_{MS}$). At all stellar masses, the average
$B/T$ of local galaxies decreases monotonically with increasing $\Delta
SFR_{MS}$. Contrary to previous works, we find that the upper-envelope of the
SFMS is not dominated by objects with a significant bulge component. This rules
out a scenario in which, in the local Universe, objects with increased star
formation activity are simultaneously experiencing a significant bulge growth.
We suggest that much of the discrepancies between different works studying the
role of bulges originates from differences in the methodology of structurally
decomposing galaxies.

structured signal recovery under a rather weak assumption on the measurements
that only a finite number of moments exists. High-dimensional recovery has been
one of the emerging topics in the last decade partly due to the celebrated work
of Candes, Romberg and Tao (e.g. [CRT06, CRT04]). The original analysis there
(and the works thereafter) necessitates a strong concentration argument
(namely, the restricted isometry property), which only holds for a rather
restricted class of measurements with light-tailed distributions. It had long
been conjectured that high-dimensional recovery is possible even if restricted
isometry type conditions do not hold, but the general theory was beyond the
grasp until very recently, when the works [Men14a, KM15] propose a new
small-ball method. In these two papers, the authors initiated a new analysis
framework for general empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems with respect
to the square loss, which is robust and can potentially allow heavy-tailed loss
functions. The materials in this thesis are partly inspired by [Men14a], but
are of a different mindset: rather than directly analyzing the existing ERMs
for signal recovery for which it is difficult to avoid strong moment
assumptions, we show that, in many circumstances, by carefully re-designing the
ERMs to start with, one can still achieve the minimax optimal statistical rate
of signal recovery with very high probability under much weaker assumptions
than existing works.

alternative approach to realize the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, a
typical example of magnetic topological phase, via engineering two-dimensional
(2D) magnetic van der Waals heterojunctions. Instead of a single magnetic
topological material, we search for the combinations of two 2D (typically
trivial) magnetic insulator compounds with specific band alignment so that they
can together form a type-III heterojunction with topologically non-trivial band
structure. By combining the data-driven materials search, first principles
calculations, and the symmetry-based analytical models, we identify 8 type-III
heterojunctions consisting of 2D ferromagnetic insulator materials from a
family of 2D monolayer MXY compounds (M = metal atoms, X = S, Se, Te, Y = F,
Cl, Br, I) as a set of candidates for the QAH effect. In particular, we
directly calculate the topological invariant (Chern number) and chiral edge
states in the MnNF/MnNCl heterojunction with ferromagnetic stacking. This work
illustrates how data-driven material science can be combined with
symmetry-based physical principles to guide the search for novel
heterojunction-based quantum materials hosting the QAH effect and other exotic
quantum states in general.

typically prohibitively expensive to acquire, so learning in simulation is a
popular strategy. Unfortunately, such polices are often not transferable to the
real world due to a mismatch between the simulation and reality, called
'reality gap'. Domain randomization methods tackle this problem by randomizing
the physics simulator (source domain) during training according to a
distribution over domain parameters in order to obtain more robust policies
that are able to overcome the reality gap. Most domain randomization approaches
sample the domain parameters from a fixed distribution. This solution is
suboptimal in the context of sim-to-real transferability, since it yields
policies that have been trained without explicitly optimizing for the reward on
the real system (target domain). Additionally, a fixed distribution assumes
there is prior knowledge about the uncertainty over the domain parameters. In
this paper, we propose Bayesian Domain Randomization (BayRn), a black-box
sim-to-real algorithm that solves tasks efficiently by adapting the domain
parameter distribution during learning given sparse data from the real-world
target domain. BayRn uses Bayesian optimization to search the space of source
domain distribution parameters such that this leads to a policy which maximizes
the real-word objective, allowing for adaptive distributions during policy
optimization. We experimentally validate the proposed approach in sim-to-sim as
well as in sim-to-real experiments, comparing against three baseline methods on
two robotic tasks. Our results show that BayRn is able to perform sim-to-real
transfer, while significantly reducing the required prior knowledge.

promising applications, have become an important research topic. Generation of
monodispersed bulk NBs with specified gas content remains a challenge. We
developed a simple method for generating bulk NBs, using porous alumina films
with ordered straight nano-scaled holes. Different techniques, such as
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), are used to confirm NB formation. The
NTA data demonstrates that the minimum size of the NBs formed is less than 100
nm, which is comparable to the diameter of nanoholes in the porous alumina
film. By generating NBs with different gases, including CO2, O2, N2, Ar, and
He, we discovered that the minimum size of NBs negatively correlated with the
solubility of encapsulated gases in water. Due to the monodispersed size of NBs
generated from the highly ordered porous alumina, we determined that NB size is
distributed discretely with a uniform increment factor of sqrt(2). To explain
the observed characteristic size distribution of NBs, we propose a simple model
in which two NBs of the same size are assumed to preferentially coalesce. This
characteristic bubble size distribution is useful for elucidating the basic
characteristics of nanobubbles, such as the long-term stability of NBs. This
distribution can also be used to develop new applications of NBs, for example,
nano-scaled reaction fields through bubble coalescence.

assisted with theoretical calculations. However, the analysis currently taken
in the community on the branching ratio of the XAS spectra generally does not
account for the hybridization effects between local $f$-orbitals and conduction
states. In this paper, we discuss an approach which employs the DFT+Gutzwiller
rotationally-invariant slave boson (DFT+GRISB) method to obtain a local
Hamiltonian for the single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM), and calculates the
XAS spectra by the exact diagonalization (ED) method. A customized numerical
routine was implemented for the ED XAS part of the calculation. By applying
this technique to the recently discovered 5$f$-electron topological Kondo
insulator PuB$_4$, we determined the signature of 5$f$-electronic correlation
effects in the theoretical X-ray spectra. We found that the Pu 5$f$-6$d$
hybridization effect provides an extra channel to mix the $j=5/2$ and $7/2$
orbitals in the 5$f$ valence. As a consequence, the resulting electron
occupation number and spin-orbit coupling strength deviate from the
intermediate coupling regime.

numerous sunspots; however, little research has been conducted to date into how
persistent these signatures are within sunspots on time-scales longer than a
few hours. Here, we analyse the lead sunspot of AR 12526 to infer the
properties and evolution of super-sonic downflows occurring within it. Sixteen
large, dense raster scans sampled by IRIS are analysed. These rasters tracked
the lead sunspot of AR 12526 at discrete times between the 27th March 2016 and
the 2nd April 2016. One sit-and-stare observation acquired on the 1st April
2016 is also studied in order to analyse the evolution of super-sonic downflows
on shorter time-scales. Super-sonic downflows are variable within this sunspot
both in terms of spatial structuring and velocities. 13 of the 16 raster scans
display some evidence of super-sonic downflows in the Si IV 1394 {\AA} line
co-spatial to a sustained bright structure detected in the 1400 {\AA} slit-jaw
imaging channel, with a peak velocity of 112 km s^{-1} being recorded on the
29th March 2016. Evidence for super-sonic downflows in the O IV 1401 {\AA} line
was found in 14 of these rasters, with the spatial structuring differing from
that inferred from the Si IV 1394 {\AA} line. In the sit-and-stare data, no
dual flow is initially detected, however, a super-sonic downflow does develop
after 60 minutes. This downflow accelerates from 73 km s^{-1} to close to 80 km
s^{-1} in both the Si IV 1394 {\AA} and O IV 1401 {\AA} lines over the course
of 20 minutes before the end of the observation. The morphology of these
downflows evolved over the course of both hours and days and was often
different in the Si IV 1394 {\AA} and O IV 1401 {\AA} lines. These events were
found co-spatial to a bright region in the core of the Si IV 1394 {\AA} line
which appeared to form at the foot-points of coronal fan loops.

  distributions in sensor networks","13 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Signal and
  Information Processing over Networks",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a distributed detection problem where measurements at each sensor
follow a general parametric distribution. The network does not have a central
processing unit or fusion center (FC). Thus, each node takes some measurements,
does some processing, exchanges messages with its neighbors and finally makes a
decision (typically the same for all nodes) about the phenomenon of interest.
The problem can be formulated as a composite hypothesis test with unknown
parameters where, in general, a uniformly most powerful test does not exist.
This leads naturally to the use of the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test.
As the measurements follow a general parametric distribution (which could model
spatial dependence of the data), the implementation of fully-distributed
detection procedures could be demanding in network resources. For this reason,
we study the use of a simpler test (referred as L-MP) which uses the product of
the marginals of the measurements taken at each node, where the unknown
parameters are easily estimated with only local measurements. Although this
simple proposal still requires network-wide cooperation between nodes, the
number of communications is significantly reduced with respect to the GLR test,
making it a suitable choice in severely resource-constrained sensor networks.
This simpler test does not exploit the full parametric model of data, so, it
becomes important to analyze its statistical properties and its potential
performance loss. This is done through the analysis of the L-MP asymptotic
distribution. Interestingly, despite the fact that the L-MP is simpler and more
efficient to implement than the GLR test, we obtain some conditions under which
the L-MP has superior asymptotic performance to the GLR test. Finally, we
present numerical results for a fully-distributed spectrum sensing application
for cognitive radios.

level spacing of diffusive metals in the usual Hermitian systems is replaced by
the Poisson distribution for quasiparticle level spacing of non-Hermitian
disordered metals in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. This is a
very surprising result because Poisson statistics is universally true for the
Anderson insulators where energy eigenstates do not overlap with each other so
that energy levels are independent from each other.For disordered metals where
different eigenstates overlap with each other, one should expect different
levels trying to stay away from each other so that the Poisson distribution
should not apply there. Our results show that the larger non-Hermitian energy
(dissipation) can invalidate level repulsion principle that holds dearly in
quantum mechanics. Thus, our theory provides a unified picture for recent
discovery of so called ""level attraction"" in various systems. It provides also
a theoretical basis for manipulating energy levels.

we fit the velocity field of the ionized gas to quantify the degree of
kinematic asymmetry. We find that the star formation rate (SFR) of the paired
galaxies with high kinematic asymmetry is significantly enhanced even when the
projected separation between the pair members is quite large (dp~100 kpc). On
the contrary, no significant SFR enhancement is found for the paired galaxies
with low kinematic asymmetry even when their projected separation is small (dp
< 30 kpc). Moreover, we also find that the fraction of galaxies with high
kinematic asymmetry is much higher in close pairs (dp < 30 kpc) than those with
larger dp, which explains well the early statistical findings of the
significant SFR enhancement in close pairs. Our new findings illustrate that
the kinematic asymmetry is an excellent indicator of galaxy-galaxy interaction
strength, which helps us better understand the merging stage of the observed
galaxy pairs.

importance to several real-time applications, such as connected and autonomous

quantify the information freshness of delivered messages to the involved

several performance benefits for Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) communications,
emphasizing on the experienced End-to-End (E2E) message delay. In this paper,
we argue that, when it comes to safety-critical use cases, such as the one of
Vulnerable Road User (VRU), additional metrics can be more insightful to
evaluate and address scalability issues in dense urban environments. In
particular, the impact of the packet inter-arrival time on the timeliness of
VRU messages arriving at nearby vehicles can be directly assessed by exploiting
the AoI metric. For that purpose, assuming a MEC-enabled multi-VRU system
setting, we model the AoI and, by means of a performance comparison to the
state-of-the-art network architecture based on numerical evaluations, we
provide evidence of the information freshness and system scalability

$a_{nn}$ and $r_{nn}$ with uncertainties of $\pm 0.21$ fm and $\pm 0.06$ fm,
respectively, for the case of $a_{nn}=-18.9$ fm and $r_{nn}=2.75$ fm. The
requirement of such narrow bin widths indicates that the momenta of the

results detect the anomaly at $\left(\pi,0\right)$ in the triplet spectrum,
agreeing well with the inelastic neutron scattering measurement of a
macroscopic sample. Surprisingly, our results also reveal a gapless and massive
1D singlet dispersion channel that is much lower than the triplet excitation.
We note, however, the dimensional transition is determined by the massless
triplet dispersion.

fertilization of the embryo. Embryonic development is of great importance
because it determines congenital anomalies and influences their severity.
Whereas there is detailed qualitative knowledge of the successive steps of
embryonic development, little is known about their probabilities of success or
failure. Embryonic mortality as a function of post fertilization time provides
a simple (albeit crude) way to identify major defects. We find that, in line
with the few other species for which data are available, the embryonic
mortality of zebrafish has a prominent peak shortly after fertilization. This
is called the early embryonic mortality (EEM) effect. Although a number of
immediate causes of death (e.g. infection, excess of carbon dioxide or of
lactic acid, chromosomal defects) can be cited, the common underlying factor
remains unknown.
  After reviewing embryonic mortality data available for chicken and a few
other farm animals, we explain that zebrafish are particularly suited for such
a study because embryogenesis can be followed from its very beginning and can
be observed easily thanks to transparent egg shells.
  We report the following findings. (i) The mortality peak occurs in the first
15% of the 75-80 hours of embryogenesis and it is about 50 times higher than
the low plateau which follows. (ii) The shape of the age-specific death rate is
largely independent of the death level.
  Presently, little is known about the nature of embryonic defects. However, by
reviewing two special cases we show that even small initial defects, e.g.
spatial cellular asymmetries or irregularities in the timing of development,
carry with them lethal effects in later stages of embryogenesis.

an approximate algorithm for solving binary integer LPs and a fast algorithm

of the dual problem of the relaxed LP and it essentially performs (one-pass)
projected stochastic subgradient descent in the dual space. We analyze the
algorithm in two different models, stochastic input and random permutation,
with minimal technical assumptions on the input data. The algorithm achieves
$O\left(m \sqrt{n}\right)$ expected regret under the stochastic input model and
$O\left((m+\log n)\sqrt{n}\right)$ expected regret under the random permutation

generalized to a multi-dimensional LP setting which covers a wider range of
applications. In addition, we employ the notion of permutational Rademacher
complexity and derive regret bounds for two earlier online LP algorithms for
comparison. Both algorithms improve the regret bound with a factor of
$\sqrt{m}$ by paying more computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
to convert the possibly infeasible solution to a feasible one through a

which assumes that the underlying world is finite and thus only considers the
finite completions of the instance. The major known decidable cases of FQA
derive from the following: the guarded fragment of first-order logic, which can
express referential constraints (data in one place points to data in another)
but cannot express number restrictions such as functional dependencies; and the
guarded fragment with number restrictions but on a signature of arity only two.
In this paper, we give the first decidability results for FQA that combine both
referential constraints and number restrictions for arbitrary signatures: we
show that, for unary inclusion dependencies and functional dependencies, the
finiteness assumption of FQA can be lifted up to taking the finite implication
closure of the dependencies. Our result relies on new techniques to construct

to an interaction between the asthenosphere-derived melts and lithospheric
peridotite variably hydrated due to penetration of hydrothermal water down to

interaction, we report results of experiments of reaction between serpentinite
and tholeiitic basaltic melt. Results show that the reaction proceeds via a
multi-stage mechanism: (i) transformation of serpentinite into Cr-rich
spinel-bearing harzburgite containing pore fluid, (ii) partial melting and
dissolution of the harzburgite assemblage with formation of interstitial
hydrous melts, and (iii) final assimilation of the Cr-rich spinel-bearing
harzburgite/dunite and formation of hybrid basaltic melts with high MgO and
elevated Cr and Ni contents. Assimilation of serpentinite by basaltic melt may
occur under elevated melt/rock ratios and may lead to chromitite formation. Our
experiments provide evidence that MORB and high-Mg-Cr orthopyroxene-rich
cumulates depleted in incompatible elements can be produced from common

TotP, a hard subclass of #P, is of key importance, as it contains
self-reducible counting problems with easy decision version, thus eligible to
be approximable. Indeed, most problems known so far to admit an fpras fall into
this class.
  An open question raised recently by the community of descriptive complexity
is to find a logical characterization of TotP and of robust subclasses of TotP.
In this work we define two subclasses of TotP, in terms of descriptive
complexity, both of which are robust in the sense that they have natural
complete problems, which are defined in terms of satisfiability of Boolean
formulae.
  We then explore the relationship between the class of approximable counting
problems and TotP.

$\nsubseteq$ TotP unless RP = P. To this end we introduce two ancillary classes

channel state information and to report the optimized phase shifts to the

explicitly consider the overhead during the resource allocation phase. This
work aims at filling this gap, developing an overhead-aware resource allocation
framework for wireless networks where reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are
used to improve the communication performance. An overhead model is developed
and incorporated in the expressions of the system rate and energy efficiencies,
which are then optimized with respect to the phase shifts of the reconfigurable
intelligent surface, the transmit and receive filters, and the power and
bandwidth used for the communication and feedback phases. The bi-objective
maximization of the rate and energy efficiency is carried out as well. The
proposed framework allows characterizing the trade-off between optimized radio
resources and the related overhead in networks with reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces.

physical phenomena such as viscous damping, wave diffraction, and nonlinear

variability in ice configuration, ranging from viscous grease ice slicks to
large icebergs through closed drift ice and landfast ice, makes it challenging
to develop robust and accurate waves in ice models. In this context, a reason
for the challenges modellers are facing may lie in the mismatch between the
relative scarcity of waves in ice data available for testing theories, and the
wide diversity of phenomena happening at sea. This lack of experimental data
may be explained, at least in part, by the high cost of waves in ice
instruments. Therefore, development of open source, low-cost, high-performance
instrumentation may be a critical factor in helping advance this field of
research. Here, we present recent developments of a new generation of open

their simple and modular design allows them to be customized for specific needs
quickly and at reduced cost. Therefore, they may be an important factor in
allowing more data to be gathered in a cost-effective way, providing
much-needed data to the waves in ice community. This approach is here validated
by presenting recent sea ice drift and wave activity data, and comparing these
results with those obtained with commercially available buoys. In addition, our
design may be used as a general platform for cost-effective development of
other in-situ instruments with similar requirements of low-power data logging,

the case of class labels in the target domain being only a subset of those in

and existing methods always suffer from two key problems, negative transfer and
uncertainty propagation. In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning
and propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques
termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty
Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in
misclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source
domain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label
distributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it
randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain
during domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On
the other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an
incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such
uncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during
alignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present
AUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted
complement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and
low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
our BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain adaptation tasks.

However, these methods require additional generative networks along with the

harder optimization. Meanwhile, post-processing techniques, such as query
expansion and database augmentation, have proposed the combination of feature
points to obtain additional semantic information. In this paper, inspired by
query expansion and database augmentation, we propose an augmentation method in
an embedding space for pair-based metric learning losses, called embedding
expansion. The proposed method generates synthetic points containing augmented
information by a combination of feature points and performs hard negative pair
mining to learn with the most informative feature representations. Because of
its simplicity and flexibility, it can be used for existing metric learning
losses without affecting model size, training speed, or optimization
difficulty. Finally, the combination of embedding expansion and representative
metric learning losses outperforms the state-of-the-art losses and previous
sample generation methods in both image retrieval and clustering tasks. The

reliably solve model predictive control problems. HPIPM currently supports
three QP types, and provides interior point method (IPM) solvers as well
(partial) condensing routines. In particular, the IPM for optimal control QPs
is intended to supersede the HPMPC solver, and it largely improves robustness
while keeping the focus on speed. Numerical experiments show that HPIPM
reliably solves challenging QPs, and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art
solvers in speed.

colliding unequal molecular clouds by performing magnetohydrodynamic
simulations with sub-parsec resolution (0.015 pc) that can resolve the
molecular cores. Initial clouds with the typical gas density of the molecular
clouds are immersed in various uniform magnetic fields. The turbulent magnetic
fields in the clouds consistent with the observation by Crutcher et al. (2010)
are generated by the internal turbulent gas motion before the collision, if the
uniform magnetic field strength is 4.0 $\mu$G. The collision speed of 10 km
s$^{-1}$ is adopted, which is much larger than the sound speeds and the
Alfv\'{e}n speeds of the clouds. We identify gas clumps with gas densities
greater than 5 $\times$ 10$^{-20}$ g cm$^{-3}$ as the dense cores and trace
them throughout the simulations to investigate their mass evolution and
gravitational boundness. We show that a greater number of massive,
gravitationally bound cores are formed in the strong magnetic field (4.0
$\mu$G) models than the weak magnetic field (0.1 $\mu$G) models. This is partly
because the strong magnetic field suppresses the spatial shifts of the shocked
layer that should be caused by the nonlinear thin shell instability. The
spatial shifts promote formation of low-mass dense cores in the weak magnetic
field models. The strong magnetic fields also support low-mass dense cores
against gravitational collapse. We show that the numbers of massive,
gravitationally bound cores formed in the strong magnetic field models are much
larger than the isolated, non-colliding cloud models, which are simulated for
comparison. We discuss the implications of our numerical results on massive
star formation.

the imposition of a congestion charge and a driver minimum wage. The impact is
assessed using a market equilibrium model to calculate the changes in the
number of passenger trips and trip fare, number of drivers employed, the TNC
platform profit, the number of TNC vehicles, and city revenue. Two charges are
considered: (a) a charge per TNC trip similar to an excise tax, and (b) a
charge per vehicle operating hour (whether or not it has a passenger) similar
to a road tax. Both charges reduce the number of TNC trips, but this reduction
is limited by the wage floor, and the number of TNC vehicles reduced is not
significant. The time-based charge is preferable to the trip-based charge
since, by penalizing idle vehicle time, the former increases vehicle occupancy.
In a case study for San Francisco, the time-based charge is found to be Pareto
superior to the trip-based charge as it yields higher passenger surplus, higher
platform profits, and higher tax revenue for the city.

building blocks serve as a complete basis to construct all possible Kitaev
superconductors that satisfy the symmetry requirements. Based on this Kitaev
construction, we identify a simple but powerful bulk Majorana counting rule
that can unambiguously diagnose the existence of higher-order topology for all
Kitaev superconductors. For a systematic construction, we propose two
inequivalent stacking strategies using the Kitaev building blocks and provide
minimal tight-binding models to explicitly demonstrate each stacking approach.
Notably, some of our Kitaev superconductors host higher-order topology that
cannot be captured by the existing symmetry indicators in the literature.
Nevertheless, our Majorana counting rule does enable a correct diagnosis for
these ""beyond-indicator"" models. We conjecture that all Wannierizable
superconductors should yield a decomposition in terms of our Kitaev building
blocks, up to adiabatic deformations. Based on this conjecture, we propose a
universal diagnosis of higher-order topology that possibly works for all
Wannierizable superconductors. We also present a realistic example of
higher-order topological superconductors with fragile Wannier obstruction to
verify our conjectured universal diagnosis. Our work paves the way for a
complete topological theory for superconductors.

handwritten words. On the contrary, when writing by hand, a great variability
is observed across different writers, and even when analyzing words scribbled
by the same individual, involuntary variations are conspicuous. In this work,
we take a step closer to producing realistic and varied artificially rendered
handwritten words. We propose a novel method that is able to produce credible
handwritten word images by conditioning the generative process with both
calligraphic style features and textual content. Our generator is guided by
three complementary learning objectives: to produce realistic images, to
imitate a certain handwriting style and to convey a specific textual content.
Our model is unconstrained to any predefined vocabulary, being able to render
whatever input word. Given a sample writer, it is also able to mimic its
calligraphic features in a few-shot setup. We significantly advance over prior
art and demonstrate with qualitative, quantitative and human-based evaluations
the realistic aspect of our synthetically produced images.

interest. A greedy framework has been introduced in Feng et al. [ESAIM: Math.
Model. Numer. Anal. 51(6), 2017] and in Feng and Benner [IEEE Trans. Microw.
Theory Techn. 67(12), 2019] to choose interpolation points automatically using
a posteriori error estimators. Nevertheless, when the parameter range is large
or if the parameter space dimension is larger than two, the greedy algorithm
may take considerable time, since the training set needs to include a
considerable number of parameters. As a remedy, we introduce an adaptive
training technique by learning an efficient a posteriori error estimator over
the parameter domain. A fast learning process is created by interpolating the
error estimator using radial basis functions (RBF) over a fine parameter
training set, representing the whole parameter domain. The error estimator is
evaluated only on a coarse training set including a few parameter samples. The
algorithm is an extension of the work in Chellappa et al. [arXiv e-prints

Beyond this work, we use a newly proposed inf-sup-constant-free error estimator

to have an algorithm which is tractable in combined complexity, i.e., in the
sizes of the input document and the VA; while ensuring the best possible data
complexity bounds in the input document size, i.e., constant delay in the
document size. Several recent works at PODS'18 proposed such algorithms but
with linear delay in the document size or with an exponential dependency in
size of the (generally nondeterministic) input VA. In particular, Florenzano et
al. suggest that our desired runtime guarantees cannot be met for general
sequential VAs. We refute this and show that, given a nondeterministic
sequential VA and an input document, we can enumerate the mappings of the VA on
the document with the following bounds: the preprocessing is linear in the
document size and polynomial in the size of the VA, and the delay is
independent of the document and polynomial in the size of the VA. The resulting
algorithm thus achieves tractability in combined complexity and the best

in disk graphs. It is not known whether this problem is NP-hard. We observe
that, so far, all the hardness proofs for Maximum Clique in intersection graph
classes $\mathcal I$ follow the same road. They show that, for every graph $G$
of a large-enough class $\mathcal C$, the complement of an even subdivision of
$G$ belongs to the intersection class $\mathcal I$. Then they conclude invoking
the hardness of Maximum Independent Set on the class $\mathcal C$, and the fact
that the even subdivision preserves that hardness. However there is a strong
evidence that this approach cannot work for disk graphs [Bonnet et al. '18]. We
suggest a new approach, based on a problem that we dub Max Interval Permutation
Avoidance, which we prove unlikely to have a subexponential-time approximation
scheme. We transfer that hardness to Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of
objects which can be either half-planes (or unit disks) or axis-parallel
rectangles. That problem is not amenable to the previous approach. We hope that
a scaled down (merely NP-hard) variant of Max Interval Permutation Avoidance

recently developed for solving the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in

with checkerboard domain decomposition. Although this diagonal sweeping DDM is
essentially multiplicative, it is highly suitable for parallel computing of the
Helmholtz problem with multiple right-hand sides when combined with the
pipeline processing since the number of sequential steps in each sweep is much
smaller than the number of subdomains. In this paper, we propose and analyze a
trace transfer-based diagonal sweeping DDM. A major advantage of changing from
source transfer to trace transfer for information passing between neighbor
subdomains is that the resulting diagonal sweeps become easier to analyze and
implement and more efficient, since the transferred traces have only $2n$
cardinal directions between neighbor subdomains while the transferred sources
come from a total of $3^n-1$ cardinal and corner directions. We rigorously
prove that the proposed diagonal sweeping DDM not only gives the exact solution
of the global PML problem in the constant medium case but also does it with at
most one extra round of diagonal sweeps in the two-layered media case, which
lays down the theoretical foundation of the method. Performance and parallel
scalability of the proposed DDM as direct solver or preconditioner are also

which explicitly models the arbitrary-order cross features with complexity
linear to feature dimension and order size. We term our proposed architecture
as Cross-GCN, and conduct experiments on three graphs to validate its
effectiveness. Extensive analysis validates the utility of explicitly modeling
cross features in GCN, especially for feature learning at lower layers.

priori estimates play a crucial role to prove the existence of classical
solutions. In particular, uniform bounds for the density of players'
distribution and its inverse are of utmost importance. Here, we investigate a
priori bounds for those quantities for a planning problem with a non-vanishing
potential. The presence of a potential raises non-trivial difficulties, which
we overcome by exploring a displacement-convexity property for the mean-field
planning problem with a potential together with Moser's iteration method. We
show that if the potential satisfies a certain smallness condition, then a
displacement-convexity property holds. This property enables $L^q$ bounds for
the density. In the one-dimensional case, the displacement-convexity property
also gives $L^q$ bounds for the inverse of the density. Finally, using these
$L^q$ estimates and Moser's iteration method, we obtain $L^\infty$ estimates

presented and investigated in this article, which can realize energy isolation

controlling states of PIN diodes. The whole structure mainly consists of a
broadband polarization-sensitive polarization converter (PC) and an active
frequency selective rasorber (AFSR) switching between a transmission mode and
absorption mode which is used as an energy-selective surface (ESS). Among them,
the function of the PC is to make the EM waves transmit asymmetrically, and the
purpose of AFSR is to make the high-power waves be reflected or absorbed, which
depends on the polarization type of the wave. Thus, the radome can realize both
asymmetric propagations of EM wave and electromagnetic shielding. The
equivalent circuit models (ECM) and parametric studies are considered to
explain the physical operating mechanism of PC and AFSR. The fabricated
structure with 7*7 unit cells is experimentally demonstrated and the measured
results agree with simulated results well. Considering the distinctive

diluted in the gaseous envelope, providing a compositional gradient that could
stabilise ordinary convection and produce a stably-stratified layer near the
core of these planets. This region could consist of semi-convective layers with
a staircase-like density profile, which have multiple convective zones
separated by thin stably-stratified interfaces, as a result of double-diffusive
convection. These layers could have important effects on wave propagation and
tidal dissipation that have not been fully explored. We analyse the effects of
these layers on the propagation and transmission of internal waves within giant
planets, extending prior work in a local Cartesian model. We adopt a simplified
global Boussinesq planetary model in which we explore the internal waves in a
non-rotating spherical body. We begin by studying the free modes of a region
containing semi-convective layers. We then analyse the transmission of internal
waves through such a region. The free modes depend strongly on the staircase
properties, and consist of modes with both internal and interfacial gravity
wave-like behaviour. We determine the frequency shifts of these waves as a
function of the number of steps to explore their potential to probe planetary
internal structures. We also find that wave transmission is strongly affected
by the presence of a staircase. Very large-wavelength waves are transmitted
efficiently, but small-scale waves are only transmitted if they are resonant
with one of the free modes. The effective size of the core is therefore larger
for non-resonant modes.

One of the first questions which then arises in analysis of the experimental
results is the relation between the energy flux in the cascade and the
amplitude of the Kelvin waves. We provide such relation based on the
L'vov-Nazarenko picture of the cascade. Remarkably, the amplitude of the waves
depends on the energy flux extermely weakly, as power one tenth.

subhalos sink and transfer energy via dynamical friction into the centres of

mechanism helps explain the observed off-center BHs in dwarf galaxies and also
predicts that off-center BHs are more common in higher mass dwarf galaxies
since dynamical friction becomes significantly weaker and BHs take more time to
sink back towards the centres of their host galaxies. One consequence of
off-center BHs during early epochs of dwarf galaxies is to quench any BH

obey the linearized second law for the scalar-hairy Lovelock gravity which
contains the higher curvature terms even if we replace the gravitational part
of Wald entropy with Jacobson-Myers (JM) entropy. This implies that we cannot
naively add the scalar field term of the Wald entropy to the JM entropy of the

metric, the action of the scalar field can be written as a purely Lovelock
action with another metric. Using this property, by analogy with the JM entropy
of the purely Lovelock gravity, we introduce a new formula of the entropy in
the scalar-hairy Lovelock gravity. Then, we show that this new JM entropy
increases along the event horizon for Vaidya-like black hole solutions and
therefore it obeys a linearized second law. Moreover, we show that different
from the entropy in $F($Riemann$)$ gravity, the difference between the JM
entropy and Wald entropy also contains some additional corrections from the

$\varphi(x)=x\log x$ and find that $\varphi(1/\sqrt{a})$ is a sub-solution of a

  Understanding Complex Systems",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last half century the liquid-gas phase transition and the
magnetization phase transition have come to be well understood. After an order
parameter, $r$, is defined, it can be derived how $r=0$ for $T>T_c$ and how $r
\propto (T_c - T)^\gamma$ at lowest order for $T < T_c$. The value of $\gamma$
appears to not depend on physical details of the system, but very much on
dimensionality. No phase transitions exist for one-dimensional systems. For
systems of four or more dimensions, each unit is interacting with sufficiently
many neighbors to warrant a mean-field approach. The mean-field approximation
leads to $\gamma = 1/2$. In this article we formulate a realistic system of
coupled oscillators. Each oscillator moves forward through a cyclic 1D array of
$n$ states and the rate at which an oscillator proceeds from state $i$ to state
$i+1$ depends on the populations in states $i+1$ and $i-1$. We study how the
phase transitions occur from a homogeneous distribution over the states to a
clustered distribution. A clustered distribution means that oscillators have
synchronized. We define an order parameter and we find that the critical
exponent takes on the mean-field value of 1/2 for any $n$. However, as the
number of states increases, the phase transition occurs for ever smaller values
of $T_c$. We present rigorous mathematics and simple approximations to develop
an understanding of the phase transitions in this system. We explain why and
how the critical exponent value of 1/2 is expected to be robust and we discuss
a wet-lab experimental setup to substantiate our findings.

transitions due to the fact that they have access to the relevant length and
time scales. However, simulations face the problem that nucleation is an
activated process. Therefore, rare event simulation techniques are needed to
promote the formation of the critical nucleus. The Seeding method, where the
simulations are started with the nucleus already formed, has proven quite
useful in efficiently providing estimates of the nucleation rate for a wide
range of orders of magnitude. So far, Seeding has been employed in the NPT
ensemble, where the nucleus either grows or redissolves. Thus, several
trajectories have to be run in order to find the thermodynamic conditions that
make the seeded nucleus critical. Moreover, the nucleus lifetime is short and
the statistics for obtaining its properties is consequently poor. To deal with
these shortcomings we extend the Seeding method to the NVT ensemble. We focus
on the problem of bubble nucleation in a mestastable Lennard Jones fluid. We
show that, in the NVT ensemble, it is possible to equilibrate and stabilise
critical bubbles for a long time. The nucleation rate inferred from NVT-Seeding
is fully consistent with that coming from NPT-Seeding. The former is quite
suitable to obtain the nucleation rate along isotherms, whereas the latter is
preferable if the dependence of the rate with temperature at constant pressure
is required. Care should be taken with finite size effects when using
NVT-Seeding. Further work is required to extend NVT seeding to other sorts of
phase transitions.

capable of determining the magnitude of the magnetic field and its direction in
the core of fusion plasmas. The primary excitation channel for fast hydrogen
atoms in injected neutral beams, with energy in the range of 25-1000 keV, is
due to collisions with protons and impurity ions (e.g., He$^{2+}$ and heavier
impurities). As a result of such excitation, at the particle density of
10$^{13}$-10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$, the line intensities of the Stark multiplets do
not follow statistical expectations (i.e., the populations of fine-structure
levels within the same principal quantum number $n$ are not proportional to
their statistical weights). Hence, any realistic modeling of MSE spectra has to
include the relevant collisional atomic data. In this paper we provide a
general expression for the excitation cross sections in parabolic states within
$n$=3 for an arbitrary orientation between the direction of the motion-induced
electric field and the proton-atom collisional axis. The calculations make use
of the density matrix obtained with the atomic orbital close coupling method
and the method can be applied to other collisional systems (e.g., He$^{2+}$,
Be$^{4+}$, C$^{6+}$, etc.). The resulting cross sections are given as simple
fits that can be directly applied to spectral modeling. For illustration we
note that the asymmetry detected in the first classical cathode ray experiments

to coordinate descent but without restricting directional derivatives to be
along the axes. Without requiring a full gradient, this mapping can be
performed by computing $\ell$ directional derivatives (e.g., via forward-mode

various convexity assumptions as well as probabilistic convergence results
under strong-convexity. Our method extends the well-known Gaussian smoothing
technique to descent in subspaces of dimension greater than one, opening the
doors to new analysis of Gaussian smoothing when more than one directional
derivative is used at each iteration. We also provide a finite-dimensional

privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) in time-series data sharing. Existing
approaches to PUT mainly focus on a single data point; however, temporal
correlations in time-series data introduce new challenges. Methods that
preserve the privacy for the current time may leak significant amount of
information at the trace level as the adversary can exploit temporal
correlations in a trace. We consider sharing the distorted version of a user's
true data sequence with an untrusted third party. We measure the privacy
leakage by the mutual information between the user's true data sequence and
shared version. We consider both the instantaneous and average distortion
between the two sequences, under a given distortion measure, as the utility
loss metric. To tackle the history-dependent mutual information minimization,
we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solve it
using asynchronous actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (RL). We evaluate
the performance of the proposed solution in location trace privacy on both

Newton gravitational constant $G$ at low redshifts. The momentum exchange
between dark energy and dark matter plays a crucial role for realizing weak
gravity, while the energy transfer is also required for the existence of

the dominant equation-of-state parameter and leaving a falsifiable torsion
field in the current epoch. This picture results from a new Poincar\'{e} gauge
theory (PGT), one of the most promising among the latest batch of 58 PGTs found
to be both power-counting renormalisable and free from ghosts and tachyons. We
systematically categorise the cosmologies of 33 of these PGTs, as special cases
of the most general parity-preserving, Ostrogradsky-stable PGT with a purely
Yang-Mills action. The theory we consider contains two propagating massless
gravitons, which may be $J^P=2^+$ (long-range gravitation and gravitational
waves). A conspiracy among the coupling constants eliminates the spatial
curvature $k\in\{\pm 1,0\}$ from the field equations. We show that this
`$k$-screening' is not restricted to conformal gravity theories. The flat
Friedmann equations are then emergent, with potentially tension-resolving
freedom at the early scale-invariant epoch that reliably gives way to an
attractor-like state of modern $\Lambda$CDM evolution. We compare with related
theories and promising special cases, such as $k$-screened theories with
negative-definite effective $k$, and more traditional theories with effective
$\Lambda$ and a $J^P=0^-$ massive graviton (dark matter candidate). As a bonus,
we analyse similarly constrained actions in the new extended Weyl gauge theory
(eWGT). We show that in cosmology, PGT and eWGT span exactly the same classical
phenomenology up to a linear map between their coupling constants, hinting at a
deeper relationship between the two.

formalism to capture this diversity and examine its implications for Stage-III
and Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. We account for the different IA signatures
at large and small scales, as well for the different contributions from
central/satellite and red/blue galaxies, and we use realistic mocks to account
for the characteristics of the galaxy populations as a function of redshift. We
inform our model using the most recent observational findings: we include a
luminosity dependence at both large and small scales and a radial dependence of
the signal within the halo. We predict the impact of the total IA signal on the
lensing angular power spectra, including the current uncertainties from the IA
best-fits to illustrate the range of possible impact on the lensing signal: the
lack of constraints for fainter galaxies is the main source of uncertainty for
our predictions of the IA signal. We investigate how well effective models with
limited degrees of freedom can account for the complexity of the IA signal.
Although these lead to negligible biases for Stage-III surveys, we find that,
for Stage-IV surveys, it is essential to at least include an additional
parameter to capture the redshift dependence.

to be accompanied by more expertlike attitudes and beliefs about physics and
learning physics. In fact, in both traditionally taught and active learning
classroom environments, students often become more novicelike in their
attitudes and beliefs following a semester of instruction. Further, prior to
instruction, men typically score higher than women on conceptual inventories,
such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and more expertlike on attitudinal
surveys, such as the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS),
and those gender gaps generally persist following instruction. In this paper,
we analyze three years of pre-post matched data for physics majors at Virginia

pedagogical model of peer instruction, group problem solving, and direct
instruction, along with an explicit focus on the importance of conceptual
understanding and a growth mindset. We found that the FCI gender gap decreased,

most surprisingly, we found a meaningful correlation between a student's post-

tested for the first time. Given the recent localizations of two non-repeating

and demonstrate how we can place constraints on key model parameters like the
magnetic field strength and age of the putative FRB-emitting neutron star. In
particular, we focus on models related to compact binary merger events
involving at least one neutron star, motivated by commonalities between the
host galaxies of the FRBs and the hosts of such merger events/short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs). We rule out the possibility that either FRB was produced during
the final inspiral stage of a merging binary system. Where possible, we predict
the light curve of electromagnetic emission associated with a given model and
use it to recommend multi-wavelength follow-up strategies that may help confirm
or rule out models for future FRBs. In addition, we conduct a targeted
sub-threshold search in Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for potential SGRB
candidates associated with either FRB, and show what a non-detection means for
relevant models. The methodology presented in this study may be easily applied
to future localized FRBs, and adapted to sources with possibly core-collapse

to non-harmonic baths we evaluate quadratic and the quartic terms in the
influence action. We find that for this model the quartic term vanish by
symmetry arguments. Although the influence of the bath on the system is of the
same form as from bosonic harmonic oscillators up to effects to sixth order in
the system-bath interaction, the temperature dependence is nevertheless rather
different, unless rather contrived models are considered.

build centralized models on the basis of collecting users' data. Both private
data and models are held by the recommender, which causes serious privacy
concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy preserving POI
Recommendation (PriRec) framework. First, to protect data privacy, users'
private data (features and actions) are kept on their own side, e.g., Cellphone
or Pad. Meanwhile, the public data need to be accessed by all the users are
kept by the recommender to reduce the storage costs of users' devices. Those
public data include: (1) static data only related to the status of POI, such as
POI categories, and (2) dynamic data depend on user-POI actions such as visited
counts. The dynamic data could be sensitive, and we develop local differential
privacy techniques to release such data to public with privacy guarantees.
Second, PriRec follows the representations of Factorization Machine (FM) that
consists of linear model and the feature interaction model. To protect the
model privacy, the linear models are saved on users' side, and we propose a
secure decentralized gradient descent protocol for users to learn it
collaboratively. The feature interaction model is kept by the recommender since
there is no privacy risk, and we adopt secure aggregation strategy in federated
learning paradigm to learn it. To this end, PriRec keeps users' private raw
data and models in users' own hands, and protects user privacy to a large
extent. We apply PriRec in real-world datasets, and comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that, compared with FM, PriRec achieves comparable or even better
recommendation accuracy.

measure the attosecond ionization time delay between Argon and Neon in full

time resolution without pump-probe time delay stabilization and without
attosecond pulses because only a stable XUV frequency comb is required as a

methods based on GANs learn representations ignoring their post-use scenario,
which can lead to increased generalisation ability. However, the model can
become redundant if it is intended for a specific task. For example, assume we
have a vast unlabelled audio dataset, and we want to learn a representation
from this dataset so that it can be used to improve the emotion recognition
performance of a small labelled audio dataset. During the representation
learning training, if the model does not know the post emotion recognition
task, it can completely ignore emotion-related characteristics in the learnt

representation learning model. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge
by proposing a novel GAN framework: Guided Generative Neural Network (GGAN),

superior quality samples for audio data leveraging fewer labelled samples.
Experimental results show that using a very small amount of labelled data as

using acoustic models that are more robust in the face of the speaker's
characteristics, we aim to use only context dependent characteristics
extrapolated with linguistic analysis techniques. In simple terms, we use the
intuitive idea that context dependent information is tightly correlated with
the related acoustic waveform. We propose a statistical model, which predicts
correcting values to reduce the systematic error produced by a state-of-the-art
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based speech segmentation. Our approach consists of
two phases: (1) identifying context-dependent phonetic unit classes (for
instance, the class which identifies vowels as being the nucleus of
monosyllabic words); and (2) building a regression model that associates the
mean error value made by the ASR during the segmentation of a single speaker
corpus to each class. The success of the approach is evaluated by comparing the
corrected boundaries of units and the state-of-the-art HHM segmentation against
a reference alignment, which is supposed to be the optimal solution. In
conclusion, our work supplies a first analysis of a model sensitive to
speaker-dependent characteristics, robust to defective and noisy information,
and a very simple implementation which could be utilized as an alternative to

brightness has enabled the determination of transient molecular structures of
small and medium-sized organic molecules in excited states and undergoing
chemical dynamics using X-ray scattering. This chapter provides an introduction
into X-ray scattering theory and considers several important aspects relating
to the experimental implementation. Ultrafast gas phase X-ray scattering is
shown to provide new observables to elucidate the dynamics of chemical
reactions by providing complete, time-dependent molecular structures.
Consideration of correlations between structural parameters are important for
molecules far from their equilibrium and the changes in electron density
distributions of molecules upon optical excitation need to be considered in the
analysis. Future technological developments are expected to lead to further
important advances.

memories contribute an estimated 25% to 40% to the overall power, performance,
and area (PPA) of a chip, memories must be designed carefully to meet the
system's requirements. Memory arrays are highly uniform and can be described by
approximately 10 parameters depending mostly on the complexity of the
periphery. Thus, to improve PPA utilization, memories are typically generated
by memory compilers. A key task in the design flow of a chip is to find optimal
memory compiler parametrizations which on the one hand fulfill system
requirements while on the other hand optimize PPA. Although most compiler
vendors also provide optimizers for this task, these are often slow or
inaccurate. To enable efficient optimization in spite of long compiler run
times, we propose training fully connected feed-forward neural networks to
predict PPA outputs given a memory compiler parametrization. Using an
exhaustive search-based optimizer framework which obtains neural network
predictions, PPA-optimal parametrizations are found within seconds after chip
designers have specified their requirements. Average model prediction errors of
less than 3%, a decision reliability of over 99% and productive usage of the
optimizer for successful, large volume chip design projects illustrate the
effectiveness of the approach.

suitable reward signal to accelerate learning and stabilize convergence is a
critical problem. The global reward signal assigns the same global reward to
all agents without distinguishing their contributions, while the local reward
signal provides different local rewards to each agent based solely on
individual behavior. Both of the two reward assignment approaches have some
shortcomings: the former might encourage lazy agents, while the latter might
produce selfish agents.
  In this paper, we study reward design problem in cooperative MARL based on
packet routing environments. Firstly, we show that the above two reward signals
are prone to produce suboptimal policies. Then, inspired by some observations
and considerations, we design some mixed reward signals, which are
off-the-shelf to learn better policies. Finally, we turn the mixed reward
signals into the adaptive counterparts, which achieve best results in our
experiments. Other reward signals are also discussed in this paper. As reward
design is a very fundamental problem in RL and especially in MARL, we hope that
MARL researchers can rethink the rewards used in their systems.

spatial concentration of wealth leads to a steady state with increased global
inequality and a magnified distinction between local and global measures of
combatting poverty. Individual saving propensity proves ineffective in the
segregated economy, while redistributive taxation transcends the spatial
inhomogeneity and greatly reduces inequality. Adding fluctuations to the

TopologyGAN that takes advantage of various physical fields computed on the
original, unoptimized material domain, as inputs to the generator of a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Compared to a baseline cGAN,
TopologyGAN achieves a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the mean squared error and
a $2.5\times$ reduction in the mean absolute error on test problems involving
previously unseen boundary conditions. Built on several existing network
models, we also introduce a hybrid network called
U-SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation)-ResNet for the generator that further increases
the overall accuracy. We publicly share our full implementation and trained
network.

often signals the speakers enjoyment and engagement in their communication. In
chatbots, methods have been proposed to add personas to the chatbots and to
train them to speak or to shift their dialogue style to that of the personas.
However, they often require a large dataset consisting of dialogues of the
target personalities to train. In this work, we explore a method that can learn
to mirror the speaking styles of a person incrementally. Our method extracts
ngrams that capture a persons speaking styles and uses the ngrams to create

the dynamic behavior of elastic waves and in turn can greatly effect dynamic
simulations of fracture propagation and material failure. Typically, the
influence functions that are used in peridynamic models are selected for their
numerical properties without regard to physical considerations. In this work,
we present a method of deriving the peridynamic influence function for a
one-dimensional initial/boundary value problem in a material with periodic
microstructure. Starting with the linear local elastodynamic equation of motion
in the microscale, we first use polynomial anzatzes to approximate
microstructural displacements and then derive the homogenized nonlocal dynamic
equation of motion for the macroscopic displacements; which, is easily
reformulated as linear peridyamic equation with a discrete influence function.
The shape and localization of the discrete influence function is completely
determined by microstructural mechanical properties and length scales. By
comparison with a highly resolved microstructural finite element model and the
standard linear peridynamic model with a linearly decaying influence function,
we demonstrate that the influence function derived from microstructural
considerations is more accurate in predicting time dependent displacements and
wave dynamics.

physical meaning only on classical level while on quantum level symmetry should
be defined by a Lie algebra of basic operators. Then the fact that de Sitter
symmetry is more general than Poincare one can be proved mathematically. The
problem of explaining cosmological acceleration is very difficult but, as
follows from our results, there exists a scenario that the phenomenon of
cosmological acceleration can be explained proceeding from basic principles of
quantum theory. The explanation has nothing to do with existence or
nonexistence of dark energy and therefore the cosmological constant problem and
the dark energy problem do not arise. We consider finite quantum theory (FQT)
where states are elements of a space over a finite ring or field with
characteristic $p$ and operators of physical quantities act in this space. We
prove that, with the same approach to symmetry, FQT and finite mathematics are
more general than standard quantum theory and classical mathematics,

Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability followed by the spontaneous emergence of
convection cells. For this to happen, particles are different in size and
density, the larger particles are the denser but still segregate toward the
surface. When the flow is, as usual, initially made of two layers, dense
particles above, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops during the flow. When
the flow is initially made of one homogeneous layer mixture, the granular
segregation leads to the formation of an unstable layer of large-dense

The unstable density gradient has been only induced by the motion of the
granular matter. This self-induced Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the
two-layer RT instability are studied using two different methods, experiments
and simulations. At last, contrarily to the usual fluid behavior where the RT
instability relaxes into two superimposed stable layers of fluid, the granular
