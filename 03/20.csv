while acting in a decentralised fashion. At the same time, it is often possible
to train the agents in a centralised fashion where global state information is
available and communication constraints are lifted. Learning joint
action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to
exploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting
decentralised policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based
method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end
fashion. QMIX employs a mixing network that estimates joint action-values as a
monotonic combination of per-agent values. We structurally enforce that the
joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, through the use of
non-negative weights in the mixing network, which guarantees consistency
between the centralised and decentralised policies. To evaluate the performance
of QMIX, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) as a new
benchmark for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. We evaluate QMIX on a
challenging set of SMAC scenarios and show that it significantly outperforms
existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.

problems. A majority of existing works focus on problems without constraint or
with simple constraints. Several recent works have studied FOMs for problems
with complicated functional constraints. In this paper, we design a novel
augmented Lagrangian (AL) based FOM for solving problems with non-convex
objective and convex constraint functions. The new method follows the framework
of the proximal point (PP) method. On approximately solving PP subproblems, it
mixes the usage of the inexact AL method (iALM) and the quadratic penalty
method, while the latter is always fed with estimated multipliers by the iALM.
We show a complexity result of $O(\varepsilon^{-\frac{5}{2}}|\log\varepsilon|)$
for the proposed method to achieve an $\varepsilon$-KKT point. This is the best
known result. Theoretically, the hybrid method has lower iteration-complexity
requirement than its counterpart that only uses iALM to solve PP subproblems,
and numerically, it can perform significantly better than a pure-penalty-based
method. Numerical experiments are conducted on nonconvex linearly constrained
quadratic programs and nonconvex QCQP. The numerical results demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed methods over existing ones.

promising perspectives in quantum information processing. However, the
characterization and measure of such kind of entanglement is of great
challenge. Here we consider the overlaps between the maximal quantum mean
values and the classical bound of the CHSH inequalities for pairwise-qubit
states in two-dimensional subspaces. We show that the concurrence of a pure
state in any high-dimensional multipartite system can be equivalently
represented by these overlaps. Here we consider the projections of an arbitrary
high-dimensional multipartite state to two-qubit states. We investigate the
non-localities of these projected two-qubit sub-states by their violations of
CHSH inequalities. From these violations, the overlaps between the maximal
quantum mean values and the classical bound of the CHSH inequality, we show
that the concurrence of a high-dimensional multipartite pure state can be
exactly expressed by these overlaps. We further derive a lower bound of the
concurrence for any quantum states, which is tight for pure states. The lower
bound not only imposes restriction on the non-locality distributions among the
pairwise qubit states, but also supplies a sufficient condition for
distillation of bipartite entanglement. Effective criteria for detecting
genuine tripartite entanglement and the lower bound of concurrence for genuine
tripartite entanglement are also presented based on such non-localities.

expansion model with over-night investment to assess the effect on the system
cost of (i) limiting/expanding the amount of land available for wind and solar
farms, (ii) allowing for nuclear power and (iii) disallowing for international
transmission. The assessment is done under three different cost regimes for
solar PV and battery storage. First, we find that the amount of available land
for wind and solar farms can have a significant impact on the system cost, with
a cost increase of 0-50% as a result of reduced available land. Second,
allowing for nuclear power has a minor effect in MENA, while it may decrease
the system cost in Europe by up to 20%. In Europe, the effect on system cost
from allowing for nuclear power is highly dependent on the PV and battery cost
regime. Third, disallowing for international transmission increases the system
cost by up to 25% in both Europe and MENA. The impacts on system cost from
these three controversial and policy-relevant factors in a decarbonized power
system thus play out differently, depending on (i) the region and (ii)
uncertain future investment costs for solar PV and storage. We conclude that a
renewable power system in MENA is likely to be less costly than one in Europe,

in many applications and in particular in medical imaging where local

cornerstone of several breakthroughs in texture analysis, including Local
Binary Patterns (LBP), Maximum Response 8 (MR8) and steerable filterbanks.
Whereas globally rotation invariant Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were
recently proposed, LRI was very little investigated in the context of deep
learning. LRI designs allow learning filters accounting for all orientations,
which enables a drastic reduction of trainable parameters and training data
when compared to standard 3D CNNs. In this paper, we propose and compare
several methods to obtain LRI CNNs with directional sensitivity. Two methods
use orientation channels (responses to rotated kernels), either by explicitly
rotating the kernels or using steerable filters. These orientation channels
constitute a locally rotation equivariant representation of the data. Local
pooling across orientations yields LRI image analysis. Steerable filters are
used to achieve a fine and efficient sampling of 3D rotations as well as a
reduction of trainable parameters and operations, thanks to a parametric
representations involving solid Spherical Harmonics (SH), which are products of
SH with associated learned radial profiles.Finally, we investigate a third
strategy to obtain LRI based on rotational invariants calculated from responses
to a learned set of solid SHs. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared
to standard CNNs on 3D datasets including synthetic textured volumes composed
of rotated patterns, and pulmonary nodule classification in CT. The results
show the importance of LRI image analysis while resulting in a drastic

interactions can be realised between ions in Rydberg states and be explored for
investigating correlated many-body systems. By laser coupling to Rydberg

emphasize the essential importance of using the correct characteristic

drastically overestimates the measured $\kappa$ for many of these materials,
while inclusion of four-phonon scattering gives significantly improved
agreement with measurements. We have identified new selection rules on
three-phonon processes that help explain many of these failures in terms of
anomalously weak anharmonic phonon decay rates predicted by the lowest-order

exceptionally weak four-phonon scattering, much weaker than in compounds that
do not contain B, C or N atoms. This new understanding helps explain the
ultrahigh $\kappa$ in several technologically important materials like cubic
boron arsenide, boron phosphide and silicon carbide. At the same time, it not
only makes the possibility of achieving high $\kappa$ in materials without B, C

four-phonon processes in many future studies. Our work gives new insights into

relatively new technology still under study, have shown to improve treatment
efficiency of urban wastewater. So far the vast majority of CW-MFC systems
investigated were designed as lab-scale systems working under rather
unrealistic hydraulic conditions using synthetic wastewater. The main objective
of this work was to quantify CW-MFCs performance operated under different
conditions in a more realistic setup using meso-scale systems with horizontal
flow fed with real urban wastewater. Operational conditions tested were organic
loading rate (4.9+-1.6, 6.7+-1.4 and 13.6+-3.2 g COD/m2.day) and hydraulic
regime (continuous vs intermittent feeding) as well as different electrical
connections: CW control (conventional CW without electrodes), open-circuit
CW-MFC (external circuit between anode and cathode not connected) and
closed-circuit CW-MFC (external circuit connected). Eight horizontal subsurface
flow CWs were operated for about four months. Each wetland consisted of a PVC
reservoir of 0.193 m2 filled with 4/8 mm granitic riverine gravel. All wetlands
had intermediate sampling points for gravel and interstitial liquid sampling.
The CW-MFCs were designed as three MFCs incorporated one after the other along
the flow path of the CWs. Results showed no significant differences between
tested organic loading rates, hydraulic regimes or electrical connections,
however, on average, systems operated in closed-circuit CW-MFC mode under
continuous flow outperformed the other experimental conditions. Closed-circuit
CW-MFC compared to conventional CW control systems showed around 5% and 22%
higher COD and ammonium removal, respectively. Correspondingly, overall
bacteria activity, as measured by the fluorescein diacetate technique, was
higher (4% to 34%) in closed-circuit systems when compared to CW control
systems.

this paper, we improve SA from two aspects to promote the performance of image
captioning. First, we propose Normalized Self-Attention (NSA), a
reparameterization of SA that brings the benefits of normalization inside SA.
While normalization is previously only applied outside SA, we introduce a novel
normalization method and demonstrate that it is both possible and beneficial to
perform it on the hidden activations inside SA. Second, to compensate for the
major limit of Transformer that it fails to model the geometry structure of the
input objects, we propose a class of Geometry-aware Self-Attention (GSA) that
extends SA to explicitly and efficiently consider the relative geometry
relations between the objects in the image. To construct our image captioning
model, we combine the two modules and apply it to the vanilla self-attention
network. We extensively evaluate our proposals on MS-COCO image captioning
dataset and superior results are achieved when comparing to state-of-the-art
approaches. Further experiments on three challenging tasks, i.e. video
captioning, machine translation, and visual question answering, show the
generality of our methods.

$a,e,$ and $i$ as well as absolute magnitude $H$, but has uniform distributions

perihelion $\omega.$ We then compare the detected distributions in each of
$\Omega, \omega,$ and $\varpi\equiv\Omega+\omega$ to those expected from the
isotropic population, using Kuiper's variant of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
The three angles are tested for each of 4 definitions of the eTNO population,
choosing among $a>(150,250)$ AU and perihelion $q>(30,37)$ AU. These choices
yield 3--7 eTNOs in the DES Y4 sample. Among the twelve total tests, two have
the likelihood of drawing the observed angles from the isotropic population at
$p<0.05.$ The 3 detections at $a>250, q>37$ AU, and the 4 detections at $a>250,
q>30$ AU, have $\Omega$ distribution with $p=0.03$ of coming from the isotropic
construction, but this is not strong evidence of anisotropy given the 12
different tests. The DES data taken on their own are thus consistent with
azimuthal isotropy and do not require a ""Planet 9"" hypothesis. The limited sky

adversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the
defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and
provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness
against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general
threat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified
framework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be
instantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor
attacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the
trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the
robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that
our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is
possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such
as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training
algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such
models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine
learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for
certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN
models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive
evaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust
learning strategies against general training time attacks.

understood. Asteroseismology can provide us with estimates of internal rotation
of stars and thereby advances our understanding of angular momentum transport.
We can measure core-rotation rates in red-giant stars and we can place upper
bounds on surface-rotation rates using measurements of dipole ($l=1$) modes.
Here, we aim to determine the theoretical sensitivity of modes of different
spherical degree towards the surface rotation. Additionally, we aim to identify
modes that can potentially add sensitivity at intermediate radii. We used
asteroseismic rotational inversions to probe the internal stellar rotation
profiles in red-giant models from the base of the red-giant branch up to the
luminosity bump. We used the inversion method of multiplicative optimally
localised averages (MOLA) to assess how well internal and surface rotation
rates can be recovered from different mode sets and different synthetic
rotation profiles. We confirm that dipole mixed modes are sufficient to set
constraints on the average core-rotation rates in red giants. However,
surface-rotation rates estimated with only dipole mixed modes are contaminated
by the core rotation. We show that the sensitivity to the surface rotation
decreases from the base of the red-giant branch until it reaches a minimum at
0.6-0.8$L_\text{bump}$ due to a glitch in the buoyancy frequency. Thereafter a
narrow range of increased surface sensitivity just below the bump luminosity
exists. Quadrupole and octopole modes have more sensitivity in the outer parts
of the star. If observed, quadrupole and octopole modes enable us to
distinguish between differential and solid body rotation in the convection
zone. To obtain accurate estimates of rotation rates at intermediate radii,
acoustic oscillation modes with a spherical degree of $l\approx10$ are needed.

accuracy can mask a subtle type of model failure. We find that high scoring
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on popular benchmarks exhibit troubling
pathologies that allow them to display high accuracy even in the absence of
semantically salient features. When a model provides a high-confidence decision
without salient supporting input features, we say the classifier has
overinterpreted its input, finding too much class-evidence in patterns that
appear nonsensical to humans. Here, we demonstrate that neural networks trained
on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet suffer from overinterpretation, and we find models on
CIFAR-10 make confident predictions even when 95% of input images are masked
and humans cannot discern salient features in the remaining pixel-subsets. We
introduce Batched Gradient SIS, a new method for discovering sufficient input
subsets for complex datasets, and use this method to show the sufficiency of
border pixels in ImageNet for training and testing. Although these patterns
portend potential model fragility in real-world deployment, they are in fact
valid statistical patterns of the benchmark that alone suffice to attain high
test accuracy. Unlike adversarial examples, overinterpretation relies upon
unmodified image pixels. We find ensembling and input dropout can each help
mitigate overinterpretation.

geometry of homogeneous isotropic solutions becomes flat Minkowski space in the
infinite past. In this primordial flat frame all mass scales vanish in the
infinite past and quantum scale symmetry is realized. The cosmological
evolution is dominantly described by the slow increase of a scalar field which
sets the scale of all masses. We construct the primordial flat frame for
standard models of inflation as Starobinsky inflation or chaotic inflation. In
particular, we discuss the evolution of inhomogeneous solutions in the
neighborhood of the homogeneous isotropic background solution and their
relation to the observable primordial fluctuation spectrum. If the propagators
for the graviton and scalar field remain regular, our observed inhomogeneous
Universe can be extrapolated back to the infinite past in physical time. In
this case there is no physical big-bang singularity -- the latter reflects only
a singular choice of ``field coordinates"". Independently of the issue of
singularity the primordial flat frame offers a new view on the physical
properties of the inflationary universe, which can be characterized as a very
slowly evolving almost empty vacuum state with approximate scale symmetry.

Traditional methods are either analytical and require manual effort or are

Lyapunov functions, which are in between, give formal guarantees but are
typically semi-automatic because they rely on the user to provide appropriate
function templates. We propose a method that finds Lyapunov functions fully
automatically$-$using machine learning$-$while also providing formal
guarantees$-$using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). We employ a
counterexample-guided approach where a numerical learner and a symbolic
verifier interact to construct provably correct Lyapunov neural networks
(LNNs). The learner trains a neural network that satisfies the Lyapunov
criteria for asymptotic stability over a samples set; the verifier proves via
SMT solving that the criteria are satisfied over the whole domain or augments
the samples set with counterexamples. Our method supports neural networks with
polynomial activation functions and multiple depth and width, which display
wide learning capabilities. We demonstrate our method over several non-trivial
benchmarks and compare it favourably against a numerical optimisation-based
approach, a symbolic template-based approach, and a cognate LNN-based approach.

  macrophage networks in multiple sclerosis",,,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying the nodes that have the potential to influence the state of a
network is a relevant question for many complex systems. In many applications
it is often essential to test the ability of an individual node to control a
specific target subset of the network. In biological networks, this might
provide precious information on how single genes regulate the expression of
specific groups of molecules in the cell. Taking into account these
constraints, we propose an optimized heuristic based on the Kalman rank
condition to quantify the centrality of a node as the number of target nodes it
can control. By introducing a hierarchy among the nodes in the target set, and
performing a step-wise research, we ensure for sparse and directed networks the
identification of a controllable driver-target configuration in a significantly
reduced space and time complexity. We show how the method works for simple
network configurations, then we use it to characterize the inflammatory
pathways in molecular gene networks associated with macrophage dysfunction in
patients with multiple sclerosis. Results indicate that the targeted secreted
molecules can in general be controlled by a large number of driver nodes (51%)
involved in different cell functions, i.e. sensing, signaling and
transcription. However, during the inflammatory response only a moderate
fraction of all the possible driver-target pairs are significantly coactivated,
as measured by gene expression data obtained from human blood samples. Notably,
they differ between multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls, and we
find that this is related to the presence of dysregulated genes along the
controllable walks. Our method, that we name step-wise target controllability,
represents a practical solution to identify controllable driver-target
configurations in directed complex networks and test their relevance from a
functional perspective.

too general to ensure Liouville integrability of a system. However, we prove
that the closed (or periodic) $n$-particle Toda lattice can be framed in such a

obtained as spectral invariants of a ""quasi-Nijenhuis recursion operator"", that
is, a tensor field $N$ of type $(1,1)$ defined on the phase space of the

whether one can define in a reasonable sense a notion of {\em involutive\}

Type IIb supernova (SN IIb) remnant, Cassiopeia A. Manganese ($^{55}$Mn after
decay of $^{55}$Co), a neutron-rich element, together with chromium ($^{52}$Cr
after decay of $^{52}$Fe), is mainly synthesized at the explosive incomplete Si
burning regime. Therefore, the Mn/Cr mass ratio with its neutron excess
reflects the neutronization at the relevant burning layer during the explosion.
Chandra's archival X-ray data of Cassiopeia A indicate a low Mn/Cr mass ratio
with values in the range 0.10--0.66, which, when compared to one-dimensional SN
explosion models, requires that the electron fraction be 0.4990 $\lesssim
Y_{\rm e} \lesssim$ 0.5 at the incomplete Si burning layer. An explosion model
assuming a solar-metallicity progenitor with a typical explosion energy ($1
\times 10^{51}$ erg) fails to reproduce such a high electron fraction. In such
models, the explosive Si-burning regime extends only to the Si/O layer
established during the progenitor's hydrostatic evolution; the $Y_e$ in the
Si/O layer is lower than the value required by our observational constraints.
We can satisfy the observed Mn/Cr mass ratio if the explosive Si-burning regime
were to extend into the O/Ne hydrostatic layer, which has a higher $Y_{\rm e}$.
This would require an energetic ($> 2 \times 10^{51}$ erg) and/or asymmetric
explosion of a sub-solar metallicity progenitor ($Z \lesssim 0.5Z_{\odot}$) for
Cassiopeia A. The low initial metallicity can be used to rule out a single-star
progenitor, leaving the possibility of a binary progenitor with a compact
companion (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole). We discuss the
detectability of X-rays from Bondi accretion onto such a compact companion
around the explosion site. We also discuss other possible mass-loss scenarios
for the progenitor system of Cassiopeia A.

In RF-Rhythm, each legitimate user performs a sequence of taps on his/her RFID
card according to a self-chosen secret melody. Such rhythmic taps can induce
phase changes in the backscattered signals, which the RFID reader can detect to
recover the user's tapping rhythm. In addition to verifying the RFID card's
identification information as usual, the backend server compares the extracted
tapping rhythm with what it acquires in the user enrollment phase. The user
passes authentication checks if and only if both verifications succeed. We also
propose a novel phase-hopping protocol in which the RFID reader emits
Continuous Wave (CW) with random phases for extracting the user's secret
tapping rhythm. Our protocol can prevent a capable adversary from extracting
and then replaying a legitimate tapping rhythm from sniffed RFID signals.
Comprehensive user experiments confirm the high security and usability of
RF-Rhythm with false-positive and false-negative rates close to zero.

reproduce the field-perpendicular power spectrum $E(k_\perp)$ of anti-sunward
Alfv\'enic fluctuations in the plasma frame (where $k_\perp$ is the
field-perpendicular wavenumber) from the corresponding measured frequency power
spectrum $P_{\rm sc}(\omega,\theta_b)$ along the sampling angle $\theta_b$,
which is the angle between the local magnetic field and the sampling direction.
Here $\omega=2\pi f$ and $f$ is the frequency of the time signal. Interestingly
enough, we found that for all corresponding measured frequency power spectrum
$P_{\rm sc}(\omega,\theta_b)$ the reproduced field-perpendicular power spectrum
$E(k_\perp)$ is the same and independent of the considered sampling angle
$\theta_b$. This finding is consistent with the fact that the analyzed
turbulence is strong and highly anisotropic with $k_\| \ll k_\perp$ (where
$k_\|$ is the field-parallel wavenumber). Furthermore, for this specific time
signal we found that the commonly used TA is still approximately valid with the
important difference that a broadening in $k_\perp$ for each angular frequency
$\omega$ is present. This broadening can be described in the context of the
methodology proposed in BP19.

change sign from positive to negative at a QPO frequency of ~2 Hz. In addition,
we find that the slope of this relation is significantly different between QPOs
below and above 2 Hz. The relation between the QPO lags and QPO rms can be well
fitted with a broken line: as the QPO lags go from negative to positive, the
QPO rms first increases, reaching its maximum at around zero lag, and then
decreases. The phase-lag behaviour of the subharmonic of the QPO is similar to
that of the QPO fundamental, where the subharmonic lags decrease with
subharmonic frequency and change sign from positive to negative at a
subharmonic frequency of ~1 Hz; on the contrary, the second harmonic of the QPO
shows a quite different phase-lag behaviour, where all the second harmonics
show hard lags that remain more or less constant. For both the QPO and its
(sub)harmonics, the slope of the lag-energy spectra shows a similar evolution
with frequency as the average phase lags. This suggests that the lag-energy
spectra drives the average phase lags. We discuss the possibility for the
change in lag sign, and the physical origin of the QPO lags.

$\ell_4$ norm that appear in other IPM frameworks (e.g. Cohen M\k{a}dry
Sankowski Vladu 2017, Axiotis M\k{a}dry Vladu 2020). Further, we show that
smoothed $\ell_2$-$\ell_p$ flows (Kyng, Peng, Sachdeva, Wang 2019), which we
previously used to efficiently maximize energy (Liu Sidford 2019), can also be
used to efficiently maximize divergence, thereby yielding our desired runtimes.
We believe both this generalized view of energy maximization and generalized
flow solvers we develop may be of further interest.

uncertainties of the analytical results in the few percent range are required,
the non-linear secondary fluorescence effect in multi-elemental samples may
complicate an otherwise straightforward quantification, since it can easily
exceed a relative contribution of 20%. The conventional solution, to rely on
good performing reference samples, is hindered by their low availability,
especially for thin film applications. To address this challenge, we
demonstrate a flexible production method of multilayered, alloyed thin films
with significant secondary fluorescence contributions. We use reference-free
XRF analysis to validate the reliability of the physical model for secondary

fundamental laws of physics by local symmetry constraints. For example, in
quantum electrodynamics, Gauss's law introduces an intrinsic local relation
between charged matter and electromagnetic fields, which protects many salient
physical properties including massless photons and a long-ranged Coulomb law.
Solving gauge theories by classical computers is an extremely arduous task,
which has stimulated a vigorous effort to simulate gauge-theory dynamics in
microscopically engineered quantum devices. Previous achievements implemented
density-dependent Peierls phases without defining a local symmetry, realized
mappings onto effective models to integrate out either matter or electric
fields, or were limited to very small systems. The essential gauge symmetry has
not been observed experimentally. Here, we report the quantum simulation of an
extended U(1) lattice gauge theory, and experimentally quantify the gauge
invariance in a many-body system comprising matter and gauge fields. These are
realized in defect-free arrays of bosonic atoms in an optical superlattice of
71 sites. We demonstrate full tunability of the model parameters and benchmark
the matter--gauge interactions by sweeping across a quantum phase transition.
Enabled by high-fidelity manipulation techniques, we measure the degree to

nine nearby barred galaxies from the TIMER project. We use integral field
observations with the MUSE instrument to derive unprecedented spatially
resolved maps of stellar ages, metallicities, [Mg/Fe] abundances and SFHs, as
well as H$\alpha$ as a tracer of ongoing star formation. We find a
characteristic V-shaped signature in the SFH perpendicular to the bar major
axis which supports the scenario where intermediate age stars ($\sim 2$-$6\
\mathrm{Gyr}$) are trapped on more elongated orbits shaping a thinner part of
the bar, while older stars ($> 8\ \mathrm{Gyr}$) are trapped on less elongated
orbits shaping a rounder and thicker part of the bar. We compare our data to
state-of-the-art cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of barred
galaxies and show that such V-shaped SFHs arise naturally due to the dynamical
influence of the bar on stellar populations with different ages and kinematic
properties. Additionally, we find an excess of very young stars ($< 2\
\mathrm{Gyr}$) on the edges of the bars, predominantly on the leading side,
confirming typical star formation patterns in bars. Furthermore, mass-weighted
age and metallicity gradients are slightly shallower along the bar than in the
disc likely due to orbital mixing in the bar. Finally, we find that bars are
mostly more metal-rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than the surrounding discs. We
interpret this as a signature that the bar quenches star formation in the inner
region of discs, usually referred to as star formation deserts. We discuss
these results and their implications on two different scenarios of bar
formation and evolution.

makes the model more natural and also reduces the induced non-derivative

neutral islands and (ii) the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation to model
the Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Our model is then used for simulating the
large-scale fluctuations in the effective optical depth as observed along sight
lines towards high$-z$ quasars. Our model is fully described by five

deck, the SP seismometer showed signals comparable to the Viking-2 seismometer

sensitivity showed similar patterns to the Viking instrument, although
amplitudes on InSight were ~80% larger for a given wind velocity. However,
during the low wind evening hours the instrument noise levels at frequencies
between 0.1 and 1 Hz were comparable to quiet stations on Earth, although
deployment to the surface below the Wind and Thermal Shield lowered
installation noise by roughly 40 dB in acceleration power. With the observed
noise levels and estimated seismicity rates for Mars, detection probability for
quakes for a deck-mounted instrument are low enough that up to years of on-deck
recordings may be necessary to observe an event. Because the noise is dominated
by wind acting on the lander, though, deck-mounted seismometers may be more
practical for deployment on airless bodies, and it is important to evaluate the
seismicity of the target body and the specific design of the lander. Detection
probabilities for operation on Europa reach over 99% for some proposed
seismicity models for a similar duration of operation if noise levels are
comparable to low-wind time periods on Mars.

models for specific subgroups of patients based on high-dimensional molecular
measurements such as gene expression data. Major objectives in modeling
high-dimensional data are good prediction performance and feature selection to
find a subset of predictors that are truly associated with a clinical outcome
such as a time-to-event endpoint. In clinical practice, this task is
challenging since patient cohorts are typically small and can be heterogeneous
with regard to their relationship between predictors and outcome. When data of
several subgroups of patients with the same or similar disease are available,
it is tempting to combine them to increase sample size, such as in multicenter
studies. However, heterogeneity between subgroups can lead to biased results
and subgroup-specific effects may remain undetected. For this situation, we
propose a penalized Cox regression model with a weighted version of the Cox
partial likelihood that includes patients of all subgroups but assigns them
individual weights based on their subgroup affiliation. Patients who are likely
to belong to the subgroup of interest obtain higher weights in the
subgroup-specific model. Our proposed approach is evaluated through simulations
and application to real lung cancer cohorts. Simulation results demonstrate
that our model can achieve improved prediction and variable selection accuracy
over standard approaches.

induces the linearity of the conditional mean estimator is a product gamma
distribution. Moreover, it is shown that the conditional mean estimator cannot
be linear when the dark current parameter of the Poisson noise is non-zero. The
second result produces a quantitative refinement of the first result.
Specifically, it is shown that if the conditional mean estimator is close to
linear in a mean squared error sense, then the prior distribution must be close
to a product gamma distribution in terms of their characteristic functions.
Finally, the results are compared to their Gaussian counterparts.

e.g., in a binary liquid mixture, if the surface of the colloids prefers the
species other than the one favored in the bulk liquid. Here, we study the
formation of liquid bridges induced by confining colloids to a slit, with the
slit walls having a preference opposite to the one of the colloid surface.
Using mean field theory, we show that there is a line of first-order phase
transitions between the bridge and the no-bridge states, which ends at a
critical point. By decreasing the slit width, this critical point is shifted
towards smaller separations between the colloids. However, at very small
separations, and far from criticality, we observe only a minor influence of the
slit width on the location of the transition. Monte Carlo simulations of the
Ising model, which mimics incompressible binary liquid mixtures, confirm the
occurrence of the bridging transitions, as manifested by the appearance of
bistable regions where both the bridge and the no-bridge configurations are
(meta)stable. Interestingly, we find no bistability in the case of small
colloids, but we observe a sharpening of the transition when the colloid size
increases. In addition, we demonstrate that the capillary force acting between
the colloids can depend sensitively on the slit width, and varies drastically
with temperature, thus achieving strengths orders of magnitude higher than at
criticality of the fluid.

a concrete layer as the encoder and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the

pilot locations, and the decoder reconstructs an approximate estimation of the
channel. Eventually, the ChannelNet is trained on the output of the ConcreteAE
aiming to reconstruct the ideal channel response. The estimation error results

motivating idea is that most 3D surfaces share geometric details at some scale

shapes at that size. Then, we use the decoder as a component in a shape
optimization that solves for a set of latent codes on a regular grid of
overlapping crops such that an interpolation of the decoded local shapes
matches a partial or noisy observation. We demonstrate the value of this

are excellent laboratories for calibrating theories of stellar interior
structure and evolution. We aim to investigate the mass discrepancy in binary
stars. We study the effect of near-core mixing on the mass of the convective
core of the stars and interpret the results in the context of the mass
discrepancy. Two scenarios are considered, where individual stellar components
of a binary system are treated independent of each other and where they are
forced to have the same age and initial chemical composition. We find that the
mass discrepancy is present in our sample and that it is anti-correlated with
the surface gravity of the star. No correlations are found with other
fundamental and atmospheric parameters, including the stellar mass. The mass
discrepancy can be partially accounted for by increasing the amount of
near-core mixing in stellar evolution models. We also find that ignoring the
microturbulent velocity and turbulent pressure in stellar atmosphere models of
hot evolved stars results in overestimation of their effective temperature by
up to 8%. Together with enhanced near-core mixing, this can almost entirely
account for the 30% mass discrepancy found for the evolved primary component of
V380 Cyg. We find a strong link between the mass discrepancy and the convective
core mass. The mass discrepancy can be solved by considering the combined
effect of extra near-core boundary mixing and consistent treatment in the
spectrum analysis of hot evolved stars. Our binary modelling results in
convective core masses between 17 and 35% of the stellar mass, in excellent
agreement with results from gravity-mode asteroseismology of single stars. This
implies larger helium core masses near the end of the main sequence than
anticipated so far.

on designing complex pairwise-distance losses, which require convoluted schemes
to ease optimization, such as sample mining or pair weighting. The standard
cross-entropy loss for classification has been largely overlooked in DML. On
the surface, the cross-entropy may seem unrelated and irrelevant to metric
learning as it does not explicitly involve pairwise distances. However, we
provide a theoretical analysis that links the cross-entropy to several
well-known and recent pairwise losses. Our connections are drawn from two
different perspectives: one based on an explicit optimization insight; the
other on discriminative and generative views of the mutual information between
the labels and the learned features. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the
cross-entropy is an upper bound on a new pairwise loss, which has a structure
similar to various pairwise losses: it minimizes intra-class distances while
maximizing inter-class distances. As a result, minimizing the cross-entropy can
be seen as an approximate bound-optimization (or Majorize-Minimize) algorithm
for minimizing this pairwise loss. Second, we show that, more generally,
minimizing the cross-entropy is actually equivalent to maximizing the mutual
information, to which we connect several well-known pairwise losses.
Furthermore, we show that various standard pairwise losses can be explicitly
related to one another via bound relationships. Our findings indicate that the
cross-entropy represents a proxy for maximizing the mutual information -- as
pairwise losses do -- without the need for convoluted sample-mining heuristics.
Our experiments over four standard DML benchmarks strongly support our
findings. We obtain state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent and complex
DML methods.

streams and survive in galaxies of $M_{\rm star} \!>\! 10^{9.5-10} M_\odot$
where merger-driven spin flips and supernova feedback are ineffective. The
rings survive after events of compaction to central nuggets. Ring longevity was
unexpected based on inward mass transport driven by torques from violent disc
instability. However, evaluating the torques from a tightly wound spiral
structure, we find that the timescale for transport per orbital time is long
and $\propto\! \delta_{\rm d}^{-3}$, with $\delta_{\rm d}$ the cold-to-total
mass ratio interior to the ring. A long-lived ring forms when the ring
transport is slower than its replenishment by accretion and the interior
depletion by SFR, both valid for $\delta_{\rm d} \!<\! 0.3$. The central mass
that lowers $\delta_{\rm d}$ is a compaction-driven bulge and/or dark matter,
aided by the lower gas fraction at $z \!<\! 4$, provided that it is not too
low. The ring is Toomre unstable for clump and star formation. The high-$z$
dynamic rings are not likely to arise form secular resonances or collisions.
AGN feedback is not expected to affect the rings. Mock images of simulated
rings through dust indicate qualitative consistency with observed rings about
bulges in massive $z\!\sim\!0.5\!-\!3$ galaxies, in $H_{\alpha}$ and deep HST
imaging. ALMA mock images indicate that $z\!\sim\!0.5\!-\!1$ rings should be
detectable. We quote expected observable properties of rings and their central

between ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations and a Fermi-surface reconstruction at
$H_\mathrm{m}$. $R_\mathrm{H}$ is very well described by incoherent skew
scattering above the coherence temperature $T_\mathrm{m}$ corresponding roughly
to the temperature of the maximum in the susceptibility $T_{\chi_\mathrm{max}}$
and coherent skew scattering at lower temperatures. The discontinuous field
dependence of both, $S(H)$ and the ordinary Hall coefficient $R_0$, at
$H_\mathrm{m}$ and at low temperature, provides evidence of a change in the
band structure at the Fermi level.

oil and gas exploration, production and recovery of unconventional reservoirs.
In this study, we apply concepts from the effective-medium approximation (EMA)
and universal power-law scaling from percolation theory. Although the EMA has
been successfully used to estimate relative permeability in conventional porous
media, to the best of our knowledge, its applications to unconventional
reservoir rocks have not been addressed yet. The main objective of this study,
therefore, is to evaluate the efficiency of EMA, in combination with universal
power-law scaling from percolation theory, in estimating gas relative
permeability from pore size distribution and pore connectivity. We presume that
gas flow is mainly controlled by two main mechanisms contributing in parallel
(1) hydraulic flow and (2) molecular flow. We then apply the EMA to determine
effective conductances and, consequently, gas relative permeability at higher
gas saturations, and the universal scaling from percolation theory at lower gas
saturation values. Comparisons with two pore-network simulations and six
experimental measurements from the literature show that, in the absence of
microfractures, the proposed model estimates gas relative permeability
reasonably well in shales and tight porous rocks. More specifically, we found
that the crossover point, gas saturation at which transport crosses from
percolation theory to the EMA, is non-universal. The value of crossover gas
saturation is a function of pore space characteristics such as pore size
distribution broadness and critical gas saturation. This means that one should
expect the crossover gas saturation to vary from one rock sample to another.

  learning model: a tale of random split of data into training and test sets",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This note uses a conformal prediction procedure to provide further support on
several points discussed by Professor Efron (Efron, 2020) concerning
prediction, estimation and IID assumption. It aims to convey the following
messages: (1) Under the IID (e.g., random split of training and testing data
sets) assumption, prediction is indeed an easier task than estimation, since
prediction has a 'homeostasis property' in this case -- Even if the model used
for learning is completely wrong, the prediction results maintain valid. (2) If
the IID assumption is violated (e.g., a targeted prediction on specific
individuals), the homeostasis property is often disrupted and the prediction
results under a wrong model are usually invalid. (3) Better model estimation
typically leads to more accurate prediction in both IID and non-IID cases. Good
modeling and estimation practices are important and, in many times, crucial for
obtaining good prediction results. The discussion also provides one explanation
why the deep learning method works so well in academic exercises (with
experiments set up by randomly splitting the entire data into training and
testing data sets), but fails to deliver many `killer applications' in real
world applications.

which associates a tensor with components in $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ to tangles

Finally, the general results are applied to the case

relevance of turbulence to stellar dynamos by including evolved, post main
sequence stars in the analysis of the rotation-activity relation. These stars
rotate very slowly compared with main sequence stars, but exhibit similar
activity levels. We show that the two evolutionary stages fall together in the
rotation-activity diagram and form a single sequence in the unsaturated regime
in relation only to Rossby numbers derived from stellar models, confirming
earlier preliminary results that relied on a more simplistic parametrisation of
the convective turnover time. This mirrors recent results of fully convective M
dwarfs, which likewise fall on the same rotation-activity sequence as partially
convective solar-type stars. Our results demonstrate that turbulence plays a
crucial role in driving stellar dynamos and suggest that there is a common
turbulence-related dynamo mechanism explaining the magnetic activity of all

that the hidden features of a neural network cannot be explained by logical

novel layerwise knowledge extraction method using M-of-N rules which seeks to
obtain the best trade-off between the complexity and accuracy of rules

approach produces rules close to an optimal complexity-error tradeoff. We apply
this method to a variety of deep networks and find that in the internal layers
we often cannot find rules with a satisfactory complexity and accuracy,
suggesting that rule extraction as a general purpose method for explaining the
internal logic of a neural network may be impossible. However, we also find
that the softmax layer in Convolutional Neural Networks and Autoencoders using

approach for semantic segmentation. Consistency training has proven to be a
powerful semi-supervised learning framework for leveraging unlabeled data under

low-density regions. In this work, we first observe that for semantic
segmentation, the low-density regions are more apparent within the hidden
representations than within the inputs. We thus propose cross-consistency
training, where an invariance of the predictions is enforced over different
perturbations applied to the outputs of the encoder. Concretely, a shared
encoder and a main decoder are trained in a supervised manner using the
available labeled examples. To leverage the unlabeled examples, we enforce a
consistency between the main decoder predictions and those of the auxiliary
decoders, taking as inputs different perturbed versions of the encoder's
output, and consequently, improving the encoder's representations. The proposed
method is simple and can easily be extended to use additional training signal,

gravity is analyzed. Two models are proposed. A toy model that complies with
local and cosmological constraints and gives appropriate qualitative
description of the cosmic evolution. This model contains a saddle
matter-dominant critical point that can evolve towards a late time de Sitter
attractor. Initial conditions have been proposed, showing that this toy model
has an acceptable matter era and gives an approximate qualitative behavior of
cosmic evolution. A second viable model, behaves very close to $\Lambda$CDM at
early times and can satisfy local and cosmological constraints. It behaves as
$R-2\Lambda$ at $R\rightarrow \infty$ and tends to zero at $R\rightarrow 0$,
containing flat spacetime solution. The model gives viable cosmological
trajectories that, as the first model, connect the matter dominated point with
a late time de Sitter attractor. The cosmic evolution of the main density
parameters in this model is consistent with current observations with an
equation of state very close to $-1$.

of galaxies. Understanding the internal processes of these stars is vital to
our understanding of their evolution and eventual end products. Deformations
from spherical geometry are common for massive stars; however, the tools that
are currently available for the study of these systems are almost exclusively
one-dimensional. We present a new spectroscopic analysis tool tailored for
massive stars that deviate from spherical symmetry. This code (entitled SPAMMS)
is a spectroscopic patch model that takes the three-dimensional surface
geometry of the system into account to produce spectral profiles at given
phases and orientations. In using the Wilson-Devinney-like code PHOEBE in
combination with the non local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative
transfer code FASTWIND, we created a three-dimensional mesh that represents the
surface geometry of our system and we assigned FASTWIND emergent intensity line
profiles to each mesh triangle, which take the local parameters such as
temperature, surface gravity, and radius into account. These line profiles were
then integrated across the visible surface, where their flux contribution and
radial velocity are taken into account, thus returning a final line profile for
the visible surface of the system at a given phase. We demonstrate that SPAMMS
can accurately reproduce the morphology of observed spectral line profiles for
overcontact systems. Additionally, we show how line profiles of
rapidly-rotating single stars differ when taking rotational distortion into
account, and the effects that these can have on the determined parameters.
Finally, we demonstrate the code's ability to reproduce the Rossiter-Mclaughlin

droplets of aqueous solution during interaction. The velocity of fluid inside
the droplets was investigated by confocal micro-PIV technique. Condensation on
the droplets was carried out inside a closed chamber by creating a difference
in vapor pressure between the droplet interface and a reservoir fluid
surrounding the droplet in the room temperature without any cooling.
Condensation on the droplet leads to spatial variation of solute concentration
inside the droplet causing buoyancy driven Rayleigh convection. Fluid flow
pattern inside a single condensing droplet is symmetric in nature where as the
fluid flow pattern for two interacting droplets is asymmetric in nature. The
neighboring droplet influences the internal convection through vapor mediated
interaction between the two condensing droplets. Here, the condensing droplet
senses the neighboring droplet from a distance without any physical contact.
The asymmetric nature of the flow pattern is attributed to the modification in
the distribution of condensation flux of the droplet in the presence of the
neighboring droplet. The flow pattern observed for interacting droplets during
condensation is opposite to that of evaporating droplets. The effect of the
neighboring droplet on the internal convection of the condensing droplet
reduces with increase in separation distance between the droplets.

for the $a$-number of a $\mathbf{Z}/p \mathbf{Z}$-cover of $X$ with branch

the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in
some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported.
Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an
exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem
to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out
recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down
with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic
was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries
like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other
European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first
countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems
to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most
affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local
case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give
interpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and
conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases,
are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.

retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes. We demonstrate
accurate segmentation of the vascular morphology for the superficial capillary
plexus and deep vascular complex (SCP and DVC) using a convolutional neural
network (CNN) for quantitative analysis.
  Methods: Retinal OCT-A with a 6x6mm field of view (FOV) were acquired using a
Zeiss PlexElite. Multiple-volume acquisition and averaging enhanced the vessel
network contrast used for training the CNN. We used transfer learning from a
CNN trained on 76 images from smaller FOVs of the SCP acquired using different
OCT systems. Quantitative analysis of perfusion was performed on the automated
vessel segmentations in representative patients with DR.
  Results: The automated segmentations of the OCT-A images maintained the
hierarchical branching and lobular morphologies of the SCP and DVC,
respectively. The network segmented the SCP with an accuracy of 0.8599, and a
Dice index of 0.8618. For the DVC, the accuracy was 0.7986, and the Dice index
was 0.8139. The inter-rater comparisons for the SCP had an accuracy and Dice
index of 0.8300 and 0.6700, respectively, and 0.6874 and 0.7416 for the DVC.
  Conclusions: Transfer learning reduces the amount of manually-annotated
images required, while producing high quality automatic segmentations of the
SCP and DVC. Using high quality training data preserves the characteristic
appearance of the capillary networks in each layer.
  Translational Relevance: Accurate retinal microvasculature segmentation with

Therefore, designing highly ion-conductive materials is in strongly demand.
Because of advancement in computers and enhancement of computational codes,
theoretical simulations have become effective tools for investigating the
performance of ion-conductive materials. However, an exhaustive search
conducted by theoretical computations can be prohibitively expensive. Further,
for practical applications, both dynamic conductivity as well as static
stability must be satisfied at the same time. Therefore, we propose a
computational framework that simultaneously optimizes dynamic conductivity and
static stability; this is achieved by combining theoretical calculations and
the Bayesian multi-objective optimization that is based on the Pareto
hyper-volume criterion. Our framework iteratively selects the candidate
material, which maximizes the expected increase in the Pareto hyper-volume
criterion; this is a standard optimality criterion of multi-objective
optimization. Through two case studies on oxygen and lithium diffusions, we
show that ion-conductive materials with high dynamic conductivity and static
stability can be efficiently identified by our framework.

composed of pieces of different dimensions. For instance, $\Omega$ can be a
ball on $\mathbb R^3$, minus one of its diameters $D$, or $\Omega \subset
\mathbb R^3$ could be a so-called saw-tooth domain, with a boundary consisting
of pieces of 1-dimensional curves intercepted by 2-dimensional spheres. Under
appropriate geometric assumptions, such as the existence of doubling measures
on $\Omega$ and $\partial \Omega$ with appropriate size conditions, we
construct a class of degenerate elliptic operators $L$ adapted to the geometry,
and establish key estimates of elliptic theory associated to those operators.
This includes boundary Poincar\'e and Harnack inequalities, maximum principle,
and H\""older continuity of solutions at the boundary. We introduce Hilbert
spaces naturally associated to the geometry, construct appropriate trace and
extension operators, and use them to define weak solutions to $Lu=0$. Then we
prove De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates inside $\Omega$ and on the boundary, solve
the Dirichlet problem and thus construct an elliptic measure $\omega_L$
associated to $L$. At last, we introduce Green functions, and use them to prove
a comparison principle. Since our theory emphasizes measures, rather than the
geometry per se, the results are new even in the classical setting of a
half-plane $\mathbb R^2_+$ when the boundary $\partial \mathbb R^2_+= \mathbb
R$ is equipped with a doubling measure $\mu$ singular with respect to the
Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R$. Finally, the present paper provides a
generalization of the celebrated Caffarelli-Sylvestre extension operator from
its classical setting of $\mathbb R^{n+1}_+$ to general open sets, and hence,
an extension of the concept of fractional Laplacian to Ahlfors regular

to compute a parameter that minimizes the average of their local cost

that can solve this problem, they are typically vulnerable to ``Byzantine''
agents that do not follow the algorithm. Recent attempts to address this issue
focus on single dimensional functions, or assume certain statistical properties

Our schemes involve two filters, (1) a distance-based filter and (2) a min-max
filter, which each remove neighborhood states that are extreme (defined
precisely in our algorithms) at each iteration. We show that these algorithms
can mitigate the impact of up to $F$ (unknown) Byzantine agents in the
neighborhood of each regular agent. In particular, we show that if the network
topology satisfies certain conditions, all of the regular agents' states are
guaranteed to converge to a bounded region that contains the minimizer of the

the 1880's, consists of diluting the samples several times and incubating each
dilution to verify the existence of microbial Colony Forming Units or CFU's,
seen by the naked eye. The main problem in the dilution series data analysis is
the uncertainty quantification of the simple point estimate of the original
number of CFU's in the sample (i.e., at dilution zero). Common approaches such
as log-normal or Poisson models do not seem to handle well extreme cases with
low or high counts, among other issues. We build a novel binomial model, based
on the actual design of the experimental procedure including the dilution
series. For repetitions we construct a hierarchical model for experimental
results from a single lab and in turn a higher hierarchy for inter-lab
analyses. Results seem promising, with a systematic treatment of all data
cases, including zeros, censored data, repetitions, intra and inter-laboratory

associated to an Hermitian operator. As a consequence it is impossible to
explain dynamics in an isolated system without invoking an external classical
clock, a fact that becomes particularly problematic in the context of quantum
gravity. An unconventional solution was pioneered by Page and Wootters (PaW) in
1983. PaW showed that dynamics can be an emergent property of the entanglement
between two subsystems of a static Universe. In this work we first investigate
the possibility to introduce in this framework a Hermitian time operator
complement of a clock Hamiltonian having an equally-spaced energy spectrum. An
Hermitian operator complement of such Hamiltonian was introduced by Pegg in
1998, who named it ""Age"". We show here that Age, when introduced in the PaW
context, can be interpreted as a proper Hermitian time operator conjugate to a
""good"" clock Hamiltonian. We therefore show that, still following Pegg's
formalism, it is possible to introduce in the PaW framework bounded clock
Hamiltonians with an unequally-spaced energy spectrum with rational energy
ratios. In this case time is described by a POVM and we demonstrate that Pegg's
POVM states provide a consistent dynamical evolution of the system even if they
are not orthogonal, and therefore partially un-distinguishables.

TESS, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of transiting exoplanets ideal
for atmospheric characterization via spectroscopy with large platforms such as
JWST and ARIEL. However their next predicted mid-transit time could become so
increasingly uncertain over time that significant overhead would be required to
ensure the detection of the entire transit. As a result, follow-up observations
to characterize these exoplanetary atmospheres would require less-efficient use
of an observatory's time---which is an issue for large platforms where
minimizing observing overheads is a necessity. Here we demonstrate the power of
citizen scientists operating smaller observatories ($\le$1-m) to keep
ephemerides ""fresh"", defined here as when the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty in the
mid-transit time is less than half the transit duration. We advocate for the
creation of a community-wide effort to perform ephemeris maintenance on
transiting exoplanets by citizen scientists. Such observations can be conducted
with even a 6-inch telescope, which has the potential to save up to
$\sim$10,000~days for a 1000-planet survey. Based on a preliminary analysis of
14 transits from a single 6-inch MicroObservatory telescope, we empirically
estimate the ability of small telescopes to benefit the community. Observations
with a small-telescope network operated by citizen scientists are capable of
resolving stellar blends to within 5''/pixel, can follow-up long period
transits in short-baseline TESS fields, monitor epoch-to-epoch stellar
variability at a precision 0.67\%$\pm$0.12\% for a 11.3 V-mag star, and search
for new planets or constrain the masses of known planets with transit timing
variations greater than two minutes.

DECT-derived RSP maps could potentially be compromised by image noise levels
and the severity of artifacts when using physics-based mapping techniques,
which would affect subsequent clinical applications. This work presents a
noise-robust learning-based method to predict RSP maps from DECT for proton

cycle-consistent generative adversarial (CycleGAN) network. CycleGAN were used
to let the DECT-to-RSP mapping be close to a one-to-one mapping by introducing
an inverse RSP-to-DECT mapping. We retrospectively investigated 20

simulation. Ground truth RSP values were assigned by calculation based on
chemical compositions, and acted as learning targets in the training process
for DECT datasets, and were evaluated against results from the proposed method
using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results: The predicted RSP
maps showed an average normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 2.83% across the
whole body volume, and average mean error (ME) less than 3% in all volumes of
interest (VOIs). With additional simulated noise added in DECT datasets, the
proposed method still maintained a comparable performance, while the
physics-based stoichiometric method suffered degraded inaccuracy from increased
noise level. The average differences in DVH metrics for clinical target volumes

significantly compromising the range of applicability of the Redfield equation.
Instead of full-scale coarse-graining, this approximation only truncates terms
in the Redfield equation that average out over a time-scale typical of the
quantum system. The first step in this approximation is to properly renormalize
the system Hamiltonian, to symmetrize the gains and losses of the state due to
the environmental coupling. In the second step, we swap out an arithmetic mean
of the spectral density with a geometric one, in these gains and losses,
thereby restoring complete positivity. This completely positive approximation,
GAME (geometric-arithmetic master equation), is adaptable between its
time-independent, time-dependent, and Floquet form. In the exactly solvable,

convection zone to the solar surface has been substantiated as a probable
mechanism for sunspot formation. The origin of flux-tubes of sufficient
strength (~10^5 G) is however uncertain. This paper considers the instability
of a large-scale toroidal magnetic field caused by the magnetic suppression of
convective heat transport as a candidate for the flux tube forming mechanism.
The consideration employs the analytical dependence of the eddy diffusion on
the magnetic field supplied by mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. The instability
tends to produce regions of increased field strength with spatial scales of an
order of 100 Mm at the base of the convection zone. Characteristic growth times
of the instability are short compared to the 11-year cycle. The threshold field
strength for the onset of the instability increases from several hundred Gauss
in the vicinity of the equator to some kilo-Gauss at middle latitudes. Growth
rates of unstable disturbances decrease with latitude. These latitudinal trends
can be the reason for the observed confinement of sunspot activity to a
near-equatorial belt.

forecasts for a 'straw man' tSZ survey that will observe a sky area between
$200$ and $10^4$ deg$^2$ to an rms noise level between 2.8 and 20.2
$\mu$K-arcmin. The probes we consider are the cluster number counts (as a
function of the integrated Compton-$Y$ parameter and redshift) and their
angular clustering (as a function of redshift). At fixed observing time, we
find that wider surveys constrain cosmology slightly better than deeper ones
due to their increased ability to detect rare high-mass clusters. In all cases,
we notice that adding the clustering information does not practically improve
the constraints derived from the number counts. We compare forecasts obtained
by sampling the posterior distribution with the Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo method
against those derived using the Fisher-matrix formalism. We find that the
latter produces slightly optimistic constraints where errors are underestimated
at the 10 per cent level. Most importantly, we use an analytic method to
estimate the selection function of the survey and account for its response to
variations of the cosmological parameters in the likelihood function. Our
analysis demonstrates that neglecting this effect (as routinely done in the

existing recommender system for better performance. In the real-world
scenarios, it is common that some attributes of items/users are missing (e.g.,
some movies miss the genre data). Prior studies usually use a default value
(i.e., ""other"") to represent the missing attribute, resulting in sub-optimal
performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present an
attribute-aware attentive graph convolution network (A${^2}$-GCN). In
particular, we first construct a graph, whereby users, items, and attributes
are three types of nodes and their associations are edges. Thereafter, we
leverage the graph convolution network to characterize the complicated
interactions among <users, items, attributes>. To learn the node
representation, we turn to the message-passing strategy to aggregate the
message passed from the other directly linked types of nodes (e.g., a user or
an attribute). To this end, we are capable of incorporating associate
attributes to strengthen the user and item representations, and thus naturally
solve the attribute missing problem. Considering the fact that for different
users, the attributes of an item have different influence on their preference
for this item, we design a novel attention mechanism to filter the message
passed from an item to a target user by considering the attribute information.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on several publicly accessible
datasets to justify our model. Results show that our model outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our attention
method.

acquired infections (HAI) which often be transmitted by medical staffs in
contact with patients in the operating room (OR). Hand hygiene monitoring could
be important to investigate and reduce the outbreak of infections within the
OR. However, an effective monitoring tool for hand hygiene compliance is
difficult to develop due to the visual complexity of the OR scene. Recent
progress in video understanding with convolutional neural net (CNN) has
increased the application of recognition and detection of human actions.
Leveraging this progress, we proposed a fully automated hand hygiene monitoring
tool of the alcohol-based hand rubbing action of anesthesiologists on OR video
using spatio-temporal features with 3D CNN. First, the region of interest (ROI)
of anesthesiologists' upper body were detected and cropped. A temporal
smoothing filter was applied to the ROIs. Then, the ROIs were given to a 3D CNN
and classified into two classes: rubbing hands or other actions. We observed
that a transfer learning from Kinetics-400 is beneficial and the optical flow
stream was not helpful in our dataset. The final accuracy, precision, recall
and F1 score in testing is 0.76, 0.85, 0.65 and 0.74, respectively.

reconstructing the images approximating the original dataset utilized for
pre-training the teachers. Then a dual generator is trained by taking the

networks (CNNs) for severity staging of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
injuries.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was conducted on 1243 knee
MR images (1008 intact, 18 partially torn, 77 fully torn, and 140 reconstructed
ACLs) from 224 patients (age 47 +/- 14 years, 54% women) acquired between 2011
and 2014. The radiologists used a modified scoring metric. To classify ACL
injuries with deep learning, two types of CNNs were used, one with
three-dimensional (3D) and the other with two-dimensional (2D) convolutional
kernels. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, weighted
Cohen's kappa, and overall accuracy, followed by McNemar's test to compare the
CNNs performance.
  Results: The overall accuracy and weighted Cohen's kappa reported for ACL
injury classification were higher using the 2D CNN (accuracy: 92% (233/254) and
kappa: 0.83) than the 3D CNN (accuracy: 89% (225/254) and kappa: 0.83) (P =
.27). The 2D CNN and 3D CNN performed similarly in classifying intact ACLs (2D
CNN: 93% (188/203) sensitivity and 90% (46/51) specificity; 3D CNN: 89%
(180/203) sensitivity and 88% (45/51) specificity). Classification of full
tears by both networks were also comparable (2D CNN: 82% (14/17) sensitivity
and 94% (222/237) specificity; 3D CNN: 76% (13/17) sensitivity and 100%
(236/237) specificity). The 2D CNN classified all reconstructed ACLs correctly.
  Conclusion: 2D and 3D CNNs applied to ACL lesion classification had high
sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that these networks could be used to
help grade ACL injuries by non-experts.

RIS-aided system can outperform the AF relay system having the same transmit

level of DFT method using the rang-separated functional. In this mechanism, the
light moiety, i.e. H roams around far from the B5 cluster caused by a
stereo-specific energy transfer of translational energy to the cluster
vibrational energy through the direct coupling due to the large amplitude
motion of the unstable B5 cluster. We confirmed by the comparative computation
that a clear change occur from the roaming trajectory to the repulsive
trajectory, when we froze the vibrational motion of the B5 cluster. This
drastic change of the trajectory due to the change between the structurally
unstable B5 cluster and the frozen B5 cluster revealed the importance of
kinematic energy transfer resulted in the soft-landing-like hydrogen absorption
which manifested the present stereo-specific entangled roaming mechanism. The
trajectory calculation revealed that the present new type of roaming mechanism
is very sensitive to the azimuthal angle of the H atom attack, especially to
the bisection of the B-B bond of the B5 cluster, where the energy flow from
relative kinetic energy to the vibrational energy of the cluster efficiently
takes place through the roaming trajectory driven due to the structural

system aims to automatically monitor users' eating activities through
identifying the fine-grained eating motions and detecting the chewing and

the system has the capability of identifying chewing and swallowing through
detecting users' minute facial muscle movements based on the derived CSI

stoichiometric CeCo$_{2}$Ga$_{8}$ compound, which crystallizes in a
quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure with Ga-Ce-Co chains along the
$c$-axis. The low-temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility
($\chi\sim-\ln T$), heat capacity ($C_p/T\sim-\ln T$), and resistivity
($\rho\sim T^{n}$) firmly confirm the non-Fermi liquid ground state of
CeCo$_{2}$Ga$_{8}$. We studied the low-energy spin dynamics of
CeCo$_{2}$Ga$_{8}$ compound utilizing zero field (ZF-) and longitudinal field
(LF-) muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. ZF-$\mu$SR measurement
reveals the absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 70 mK, and
interestingly below 1 K, the electronic relaxation rate sharply rises,
intimating the appearance of low energy quantum spin fluctuations in
CeCo$_{2}$Ga$_{8}$.

Formamide (HCONH2) is the simplest molecule containing the peptide bond

been observed in high temperature regions such as hot corinos, where thermal
desorption is responsible for the sublimation of frozen mantles into the gas
phase. The interpretation of observations can benefit from information gathered
in the laboratory, where it is possible to simulate the thermal desorption
process and to study formamide under simulated space conditions such as UV
irradiation. Methods. Here, two laboratory analyses are reported: we studied
formamide photo-stability under UV irradiation when it is adsorbed by space
relevant minerals at 63 K and in the vacuum regime. We also investigated
temperature programmed desorption of pure formamide ice in the presence of TiO2
dust before and after UV irradiation. Results. Through these analyses, the
effects of UV degradation and the interaction between formamide and different
minerals are compared.We find that silicates, both hydrates and anhydrates,
offer molecules a higher level of protection from UV degradation than mineral
oxides. The desorption temperature found for pure formamide is 220 K. The
desorption temperature increases to 250 K when the formamide desorbs from the
surface of TiO2 grains. Conclusions. Through the experiments outlined here, it
is possible to follow the desorption of formamide and its fragments, simulate
the desorption process in star forming regions and hot corinos, and constrain
parameters such as the thermal desorption temperature of formamide and its
fragments and the binding energies involved. Our results offer support to

of the dijet cross sections on a nucleus and the proton,
$\sigma_A/(A\sigma_p)$, depends on $x_A^{\rm obs}$ in a similar way as the
ratio of gluon densities, $g_A(x_A,\mu^2)/[A g_p(x_A,\mu^2)]$, for which
current nPDFs predict a strong suppression due to nuclear shadowing in the
region $x_A^{\rm obs} < 0.01$. Dijet photoproduction at future lepton-nucleus
colliders can therefore be used to test this prediction and considerably reduce
the current uncertainties of nPDFs.

classical machine learning algorithms fail in the unitary limit of an infinite

plays an important role in our understanding of bound strongly interacting
fermionic systems and can be realized in cold atom experiments. Here, we
develop a formalism that explains the unitary limit in terms of what we define

limit geometrically in potential space, but also provides a numerically simple

numerical method being used to have both stable shock-capturing capability and
high spectral resolution. Recently, a family of Targeted Essentially
Non-Oscillatory (TENO) schemes are developed to fulfill such requirements.
Although TENO has very low dissipation for smooth flow, it introduces a cutoff
value $C_T$ to maintain the non-oscillatory shock-capturing property. $C_T$ is
problem depended and therefore needs adjustments by trial and error for
different problems. As $C_T$ actually controls the dissipation property of
TENO, the choice of $C_T$ for better shock-capturing capability always means
higher dissipation. To overcome this, in this paper, a local adaptive method is
proposed for the choice of $C_T$. By introducing a novel adaptive function
based on the WENO smoothness indicators, $C_T$ is dynamically adjusted form
$1.0 \times 10.0^{-10}$ for lower dissipation to $1.0 \times 10.0^{-4}$ for
better capturing of shock according to the smoothness of the reconstruction
stencil. Numerical results of the new method are compared with those of the
original TENO method and the TENO-A method (Fu et al., JCP, 2017). It reveals
that the new method is capable of better suppressing numerical oscillations
near discontinuities while maintaining the low dissipation property of TENO at
lower extra computational cost.

changes in the form of asynchronous and sparse ""events"". Recently, pattern
recognition algorithms, such as learning-based methods, have made significant
progress with event cameras by converting events into synchronous dense,
image-like representations and applying traditional machine learning methods
developed for standard cameras. However, these approaches discard the spatial
and temporal sparsity inherent in event data at the cost of higher
computational complexity and latency. In this work, we present a general
framework for converting models trained on synchronous image-like event
representations into asynchronous models with identical output, thus directly
leveraging the intrinsic asynchronous and sparse nature of the event data. We
show both theoretically and experimentally that this drastically reduces the
computational complexity and latency of high-capacity, synchronous neural
networks without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, our framework has several
desirable characteristics: (i) it exploits spatio-temporal sparsity of events
explicitly, (ii) it is agnostic to the event representation, network
architecture, and task, and (iii) it does not require any train-time change,
since it is compatible with the standard neural networks' training process. We
thoroughly validate the proposed framework on two computer vision tasks: object
detection and object recognition. In these tasks, we reduce the computational
complexity up to 20 times with respect to high-latency neural networks. At the
same time, we outperform state-of-the-art asynchronous approaches up to 24% in
prediction accuracy.

enables features of the novel categories to cluster near the category weights,

shifts to eventually minimize the domain discrepancy. However, they still
overlook to match crucial image regions and important instances across domains,
which will strongly affect domain shift mitigation. In this work, we propose a
simple but effective categorical regularization framework for alleviating this
issue. It can be applied as a plug-and-play component on a series of Domain
Adaptive Faster R-CNN methods which are prominent for dealing with domain
adaptive detection. Specifically, by integrating an image-level multi-label
classifier upon the detection backbone, we can obtain the sparse but crucial
image regions corresponding to categorical information, thanks to the weakly
localization ability of the classification manner. Meanwhile, at the instance
level, we leverage the categorical consistency between image-level predictions
(by the classifier) and instance-level predictions (by the detection head) as a
regularization factor to automatically hunt for the hard aligned instances of
target domains. Extensive experiments of various domain shift scenarios show
that our method obtains a significant performance gain over original Domain

not overly bad for particular individuals or groups). In a context where the
latter is our main concern, veto-based rules -- giving individuals or groups
the ability to strike off certain candidates from the list -- are a natural and
effective way of ensuring that no minority is left with an outcome they find
untenable. However, such rules often fail to be anonymous, or impose specific
restrictions on the number of voters and candidates. These issues can be
addressed by considering the proportional veto core -- the solution to a
cooperative game where every coalition is given the power to veto a number of
candidates proportional to its size. However, the na\""ive algorithm for the
veto core is exponential, and the only known rule for selecting from the core,
with an arbitrary number of voters, fails anonymity. In this paper we present a
polynomial time algorithm for computing the core, study its expected size, and
present an anonymous rule for selecting a candidate from it. We study the

alternating masses already shows a certain breaking of symmetry. Three exact
families of periodic solutions can be identified and a few exact invariant

complementary nature of DWT and SWT is leveraged to get the structural relation
between the input image and its low resolution approximation. The structural
relation is represented by optimal model parameters obtained through particle

states as amplitudes of a quantum state. Converting this amplitude encoded
information to a digital format enables us to compare them efficiently, thus
completing the reduction. Unlike classical $k$NN and existing quantum $k$NN
algorithms, the proposed algorithm can be directly used on quantum data thereby
bypassing expensive processes such as quantum state tomography. As an example,
we show the applicability of this algorithm in entanglement classification and
quantum state discrimination.

active species in the interstellar medium (ISM). Nitrogen bearing molecules
have great importance as they are actively involved in the formation of
biomolecules. Therefore, it is essential to look for nitrogen-bearing species
in various astrophysical sources, specifically around high-mass star-forming
regions where the evolutionary history is comparatively poorly understood. In
this paper, we report the observation of three potential pre-biotic molecules,
namely, isocyanic acid (HNCO), formamide (NH2CHO), and methyl isocyanate
(CH3NCO), which contain peptide-like bonds (-NH-C(=O)-) in a hot molecular
core, G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Along with the identification of these
three complex nitrogen-bearing species, we speculate their spatial distribution
in the source and discuss their possible formation pathways under such
conditions. The rotational diagram method under the LTE condition has been
employed to estimate the excitation temperature and the column density of the
observed species. Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was used to obtain the best
suited physical parameters of G10 as well as line properties of some species.
We also determined the hydrogen column density and the optical depth for
different continuum observed in various frequency ranges. Finally, based on
these observational results, we have constructed a chemical model to explain
the observational findings. We found that HNCO, NH2CHO, and CH3NCO are
chemically linked with each other.

predict that, due to electronic correlations, the emerging 2D electron gas is
located at the LMO side of the interface. This is in contrast to DFT results
that locate the electron gas on the STO side. We estimate the transition
temperature for the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition, which may
be verified experimentally. Importantly, we also clarify that the epitaxial
strain is a key ingredient for the emergence of the exotic ferromagnetic

and use random matrix theory to quantify the strength and range of repulsion as
a function of the buzzard population density, thus providing a novel approach
to model density dependence. As an indicator of territorial behaviour, we
perform a large-scale analysis of the distribution of buzzard nests in an area

distribution between nests is compared to the two-dimensional Poisson
distribution, originating from uncorrelated random variables, to the complex
eigenvalues of random matrices, which are strongly correlated, and to a
two-dimensional Coulomb gas interpolating between these two. A one-parameter
fit to a time-moving average reveals a significant increase of repulsion
between neighbouring nests, as a function of the observed increase in absolute
population density over the monitored period of time, thereby proving an
unexpected yet simple model for density-dependent spacing of predator
territories. A similar effect is obtained for next-to-nearest neighbours,
albeit with weaker repulsion, indicating a short-range interaction. Our results

navigation in a crowded place. Our proposed approach, Learning to Balance (L2B)
framework enables mobile robot agents to steer safely towards their
destinations by avoiding collisions with a crowd, while actively clearing a
path by asking nearby pedestrians to make room, if necessary, to keep their
travel efficient. We observe that the safety and efficiency requirements in
crowd-aware navigation have a trade-off in the presence of social dilemmas
between the agent and the crowd. On the one hand, intervening in pedestrian
paths too much to achieve instant efficiency will result in collapsing a
natural crowd flow and may eventually put everyone, including the self, at risk
of collisions. On the other hand, keeping in silence to avoid every single
collision will lead to the agent's inefficient travel. With this observation,
our L2B framework augments the reward function used in learning an interactive
navigation policy to penalize frequent active path clearing and passive
collision avoidance, which substantially improves the balance of the
safety-efficiency trade-off. We evaluate our L2B framework in a challenging
crowd simulation and demonstrate its superiority, in terms of both navigation
success and collision rate, over a state-of-the-art navigation approach.

a signal of QCD anomaly dominance for all the flavors, and the positiveness of
$\pi_{\rm s}^*$ beyond $e\bar{I}_2^{c_1}$ indicates QED anomaly dominance for
strange quark. For the lowest-lying neutral collective modes, the masses of

the decoder recovers the original image. To this end, the loss function makes
the background/detail feature maps of source images similar/dissimilar. In the

streaming in protoplanetary disc is studied using the local approach to
dynamics of gas-dust perturbations in the limit of the small dust fraction.
Turbulence in a disc is represented by the effective viscosity and diffusivity
in equations of motion for gas and dust, respectively. In the standard case of
the Schmidt number (ratio of the effective viscosity to diffusivity) Sc = 1,
the reduced description of RDI in terms of the inertial wave (IW) and the
streaming dust wave (SDW) falling in resonance with each other reveals that
damping solution differs from the inviscid solution simply by adding the
characteristic damping frequency to its growth rate. RDI is fully suppressed at
the threshold viscosity, which is estimated analytically, first, for radial
drift, next, for vertical settling of dust, and at last, in the case of
settling combined with radial drift of the dust. In the last case, RDI survives
up to the highest threshold viscosity, with a greater excess for smaller
solids. Once Sc \neq 1, a new instability specific for dissipative
perturbations on the dust settling background emerges. This instability of the
quasi-resonant nature is referred to as settling viscous instability (SVI). The
mode akin to SDW (IW) becomes growing in a region of long waves provided that
Sc > 1 (Sc < 1). SVI leads to an additional increase of the threshold
viscosity.

disease. They have a large economic burden and affect several aspects of
quality of life. Incidence data underestimate the real occurrence of genital
warts because this infection is often under-reported, mostly due to their
specific characteristics such as the asymptomatic course. Genital warts cases
for the analysis were obtained from the catalan public health system database
(SIDIAP) for the period 2009-2016, covering 74\% of the Catalan population.
People under 15 and over 94 years old were excluded from the analysis as the
incidence of genital warts in this population is negligible. This work
introduces a time series model based on a mixture of two distributions, capable
of detecting the presence of under-reporting in the data. In order to identify
potential differences in the magnitude of the under-reporting issue depending
on sex and age, these covariates were included in the model. This work shows
that only about 80\% in average of genital warts incidence in Catalunya in the
period 2009-2016 was registered, although the frequency of under-reporting has
been decreasing over the study period. It can also be seen that the
under-reported issue has a deeper impact on women over 30 years old. The
registered incidence in the Catalan public health system is underestimating the
real burden in almost 10,000 cases in Catalunya, around 23\% of the registered
cases. The total annual cost in Catalunya is underestimated in at least about
10 million Euros respect the 54 million Euros annually devoted to genital warts
in Catalunya, representing 0.4\% of the total budget of the public health

achieved in such THz-gated STM is ultimately limited by the sub-cycle temporal
variation of the tip-enhanced THz field acting as an ultrafast voltage pulse,
and hence by the ability to feed high-frequency, broadband THz pulses into the

single-cycle THz pulses from a spintronic THz emitter(STE) into a metallic STM
junction. We demonstrate broadband phase-resolved detection of the THz voltage
transient directly in the STM junction via THz-field-induced modulation of
ultrafast photocurrents. Comparison to the unperturbed far-field THz waveform
reveals the antenna response of the STM tip. Despite tip-induced low-pass
filtering, frequencies up to 15 THz can be detected in the tip-enhanced
near-field, resulting in THz transients with a half-cycle period of 115 fs. We
further demonstrate simple polarity control of the THz bias via the STE
magnetization, and show that up to 2 V THz bias at 1 MHz repetition rate can be
achieved in the current setup. Finally, we find a nearly constant THz voltage
and waveform over a wide range of tip-sample distances, which by comparison to
numerical simulations confirms the quasi-static nature of the THz pulses. Our
results demonstrate the suitability of spintronic THz emitters for ultrafast
THz-STM with unprecedented bandwidth of the THz bias, and provide insight into
the femtosecond response of defined nanoscale junctions.

work, we make contributions to shock capturing schemes on unstructured grids

from conventional shock capturing schemes which only use polynomials as
interpolation functions on unstructured grids, the proposed scheme employs the
linear polynomial as well as non-polynomial as reconstruction candidates. For
linear polynomial, the second order MUSCL scheme with the MLP
(Multi-dimensional Limiting Process) slope limiter is adopted. The
multi-dimensional THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) function
with quadratic surface representation and Gaussian quadrature, so-called
THINC/QQ, is used as the non-polynomial reconstruction candidate. With these
reconstruction candidates, a multi-stage boundary variation diminishing (BVD)
algorithm which aims to minimize numerical dissipation is designed on
unstructured grids to select the final reconstruction function. The resulted
shock capturing scheme is named as MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD. The performance of the
proposed scheme is demonstrated through solving compressible single-phase and
multi-phase problems where the discontinuity is the typical flow structure. The
numerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable of capturing sharp
discontinuous profiles without numerical oscillations as well as resolving
vortices associated with Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities along shear layers and
material interfaces. In comparison with schemes only replying on high order
polynomials, the proposed scheme shows significant improvement of resolution
across discontinuities. Thus, this work provides an accurate and robust
shock-capturing scheme to resolve discontinuities in compressible flows.

System, such as Europa and Enceladus, have already been shown to possess liquid
water, a prerequisite for life on Earth. We intend to investigate under what
circumstances small, icy moons may sustain subsurface oceans and thus be
""subsurface habitable"". We pay specific attention to tidal heating. We made use
of a phenomenological approach to tidal heating. We computed the orbit averaged
flux from both stellar and planetary (both thermal and reflected stellar)
illumination. We then calculated subsurface temperatures depending on
illumination and thermal conduction to the surface through the ice shell and an
insulating layer of regolith. We adopted a conduction only model, ignoring
volcanism and ice shell convection as an outlet for internal heat. In doing so,
we determined at which depth, if any, ice melts and a subsurface ocean forms.
We find an analytical expression between the moon's physical and orbital
characteristics and the melting depth. Since this expression directly relates
icy moon observables to the melting depth, it allows us to swiftly put an upper
limit on the melting depth for any given moon. We reproduce the existence of
Enceladus' subsurface ocean; we also find that the two largest moons of Uranus
(Titania & Oberon) could well sustain them. Our model predicts that Rhea does
not have liquid water. Habitable exomoon environments may be found across an
exoplanetary system, largely irrespective of the distance to the host star.
Small, icy subsurface habitable moons may exist anywhere beyond the snow line.
This may, in future observations, expand the search area for extraterrestrial
habitable environments beyond the circumstellar habitable zone.

Along with the shape of the power density spectra, the nature of the
characteristic frequencies and the fractional rms amplitude of the timing
features imply that the source stayed in the low/hard state during these
observations. Moreover, photon index and other spectral parameters also
indicate the low/hard state behavior of the source. Unlike the soft lag
detected in this source during the 2008 and 2014 failed outbursts, we observe
hard time-lag of $0.40\pm0.15$ and $0.32\pm0.07$ s in the 0.07--0.4 Hz

correlation between the photon index and the centroid frequency of the QPO is

guaranteed upper bound of the difference between the exact minimizer u and any
function (approximation) from the corresponding energy class (which consists of
the functions in $H^2$ satisfying the prescribed boundary conditions and the
restrictions stipulated by the obstacle). For this purpose we use the duality
method of the calculus of variations and general type error identities earlier
derived for a wide class of convex variational problems. By this method, we
define a combined primal--dual measure of error. It contains four terms of
different nature. Two of them are the norms of the difference between the exact
solutions (of the direct and dual variational problems) and corresponding
approximations. Two others are nonlinear measures, related to approximation of
the coincidence set (they vanish if the coincidence set defined by means of the
approximate solution coincides with the exact one). The measure satisfies the
error identity, which right hand side depends on approximate solutions only
and, therefore, is fully computable. Thus, the identity provides direct
estimation of the primal--dual errors. However, it contains a certain
restriction on the form of the dual approximation. In the second part of the
paper, we present a way to skip the restriction. As a result, we obtain a fully
guaranteed and directly computable error majorant valid for a wide class of
approximations regardless of the method used for their construction. The
estimates are verified in a series of tests with different approximate
solutions. Some of them are quite close to the exact solution and others are
rather coarse and have coincidence sets that differ much from the exact one.
The results show that the estimates are robust and effective in all the cases.

respective fraction $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d$ from each set. Steiger and Zhao
[DCG 2010] proved a discrete analogue of this theorem, which we call the
\emph{$\alpha$-Ham-Sandwich theorem}. They gave an algorithm to find the

Reinforcement Learning (DRL) research towards solving complex problems and
achieving super-human performance on many of them. Nevertheless, Q-Learning is
known to be positively biased since it learns by using the maximum over noisy
estimates of expected values. Systematic overestimation of the action values
coupled with the inherently high variance of DRL methods can lead to
incrementally accumulate errors, causing learning algorithms to diverge.
Ideally, we would like DRL agents to take into account their own uncertainty
about the optimality of each action, and be able to exploit it to make more
informed estimations of the expected return. In this regard, Weighted
Q-Learning (WQL) effectively reduces bias and shows remarkable results in
stochastic environments. WQL uses a weighted sum of the estimated action
values, where the weights correspond to the probability of each action value
being the maximum; however, the computation of these probabilities is only
practical in the tabular setting. In this work, we provide methodological
advances to benefit from the WQL properties in DRL, by using neural networks
trained with Dropout as an effective approximation of deep Gaussian processes.
In particular, we adopt the Concrete Dropout variant to obtain calibrated
estimates of epistemic uncertainty in DRL. The estimator, then, is obtained by
taking several stochastic forward passes through the action-value network and
computing the weights in a Monte Carlo fashion. Such weights are Bayesian
estimates of the probability of each action value corresponding to the maximum
w.r.t. a posterior probability distribution estimated by Dropout. We show how
our novel Deep Weighted Q-Learning algorithm reduces the bias w.r.t. relevant
baselines and provides empirical evidence of its advantages on representative

volumetric technique for noninvasive estimation of electrical properties (EP)
from magnetic resonance measurements. Previous work evaluated GMT using ideal
radiofrequency (RF) excitations. The aim of this simulation study was to assess
GMT performance with a realistic RF coil. Methods: We designed a
transmit-receive RF coil with $8$ decoupled channels for $7$T head imaging. We
calculated the RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) inside heterogeneous head models for
different RF shimming approaches, and used them as input for GMT to reconstruct
EP for all voxels. Results: Coil tuning/decoupling remained relatively stable
when the coil was loaded with different head models. Mean error in EP
estimation changed from $7.5\%$ to $9.5\%$ and from $4.8\%$ to $7.2\%$ for
relative permittivity and conductivity, respectively, when changing head model
without re-tuning the coil. Results slightly improved when an SVD-based RF
shimming algorithm was applied, in place of excitation with one coil at a time.
Despite errors in EP, RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) and absorbed power could be
predicted with less than $0.5\%$ error over the entire head. GMT could
accurately detect a numerically inserted tumor. Conclusion: This work
demonstrates that GMT can reliably reconstruct EP in realistic simulated
scenarios using a tailored 8-channel RF coil design at $7$T. Future work will
focus on construction of the coil and optimization of GMT's robustness to
noise, to enable in-vivo GMT experiments. Significance: GMT could provide
accurate estimations of tissue EP, which could be used as biomarkers and could
enable patient-specific estimation of RF power deposition, which is an unsolved
problem for ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging.

the state-of-the-art Densely-Sampled Light Field (DSLF) reconstruction methods.
It reconstructs Epipolar-Plane Images (EPIs) in image domain via an iterative
regularization algorithm restoring their coefficients in shearlet domain.
Consequently, the ST method tends to be slow because of the time spent on
domain transformations for dozens of iterations. To overcome this limitation,
this letter proposes a novel self-supervised DSLF reconstruction method,
CycleST, which applies ST and cycle consistency to DSLF reconstruction.
Specifically, CycleST is composed of an encoder-decoder network and a residual
learning strategy that restore the shearlet coefficients of densely-sampled
EPIs using EPI reconstruction and cycle consistency losses. Besides, CycleST is
a self-supervised approach that can be trained solely on Sparsely-Sampled Light

results of DSLF reconstruction on SSLFs with large disparity ranges (16 - 32
pixels) from two challenging real-world light field datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CycleST method. Furthermore,
CycleST achieves ~ 9x speedup over ST, at least.

graph $G$ with $n$ nodes, in each step $t\geq 0$, one unit of load is created,

picks a random neighbor, and the two nodes balance their loads by averaging
them. We are interested in the expected gap between the minimum and maximum
loads at nodes as the process progresses, and its dependence on $n$ and on the
graph structure.
  Similar variants of the above graphical balanced allocation process have been
studied by Peres, Talwar, and Wieder, and by Sauerwald and Sun for regular
graphs. These authors left as open the question of characterizing the gap in
the case of \emph{cycle graphs} in the \emph{dynamic} case, where weights are
created during the algorithm's execution. For this case, the only known upper
bound is of $\mathcal{O}( n \log n )$, following from a majorization argument

  In this paper, we provide an upper bound of $\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt n \log n )$

a new potential analysis technique, which enables us to bound the difference in
load between $k$-hop neighbors on the cycle, for any $k \leq n / 2$. We
complement this with a ""gap covering"" argument, which bounds the maximum value
of the gap by bounding its value across all possible subsets of a certain

catalogues. Although differences between the catalogues mean that there is no
one definitive group galaxy HIMF, in general we find that the low-mass slope is
flat, in agreement with studies based on small samples of individual groups,
and that the 'knee' mass is slightly higher than that of the global HIMF of the
full ALFALFA sample. We find that the observed fraction of ALFALFA galaxies in
groups is approximately 22 per cent. These group galaxies were removed from the
full ALFALFA source catalogue to calculate the field HIMF using the remaining
galaxies. Comparison between the field and group HIMFs reveals that group
galaxies make only a small contribution to the global HIMF as most ALFALFA
galaxies are in the field, but beyond the HIMF 'knee' group galaxies dominate.
Finally we attempt to separate the group galaxy HIMF into bins of group halo
mass, but find that too few low-mass galaxies are detected in the most massive
groups to tightly constrain the slope, owing to the rarity of such groups in
the nearby Universe where low-mass galaxies are detectable with existing HI

$AdS_{p+2}\times S^2$ and that the $AdS_{p+2}$ section has an internal

Gaussian null coordinates. We show that the bulk scalar field satisfying the

modes, which for certain suitable quantization conditions are well-behaved at
the boundary of $AdS_{p+2}$ space. Furthermore, we show that picking the
normalizable modes results in the existence of conserved quantities on the

focus particle beams or confine plasma in ion sources. The real magnetic field
created by PMM is calculated by magnetic field simulation software and then
used in particle tracking codes by means of 3 dimensional magnetic field map. A
common alternative is to use the so-called 'hard edge' model, which gives an
approximation of the magnetic field inside the PMM assuming a null fringe
field. This work proposes an investigation of the PMM fringe field properties.
An analytical model of PMM magnetic field is developed using the Fourier
multipole expansion. A general axial potential function with a unique parameter
${\lambda}$, able to reproduce the actual PMM magnetic field (including its two
fringe fields) with an explicit dependence on the PMM length is proposed. An
analytical first order model including the axial fringe field is derived. This
simple model complies with the Maxwell equations (curl(B)=0 and div(B)=0) and
can replace advantageously the 'hard edge' model when fast analytical
calculation are required. Higher order analytical multipole expansion model
quality is assessed by means of ${\chi^2}$ estimators. The general dependence
of the potential function parameter ${\lambda}$ is given as a function of the
PMM geometry for quadrupole, hexapole and multipole, allowing to use the
developed model in simulation programs where the multipole geometry is an input

comparing observations of thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star crust
with theoretical models. Nuclear burning of lighter elements that diffuse to
deeper layers of the envelope can alter the relation between surface and
interior temperatures and can change the chemical composition over time. We
calculate new temperature relations and consider two effects of diffusive
nuclear burning (DNB) for H-C envelopes. First, we consider the effect of a
changing envelope composition and find that hydrogen is consumed on short
timescales and our temperature evolution simulations correspond to those of a
hydrogen-poor envelope within ~100 days. The transition from a hydrogen-rich to
a hydrogen-poor envelope is potentially observable in accreting NS systems as
an additional initial decline in surface temperature at early times after the
outburst. Second, we find that DNB can produce a non-negligible heat flux, such
that the total luminosity can be dominated by DNB in the envelope rather than
heat from the deep interior. However, without continual accretion, heating by
DNB in H-C envelopes is only relevant for <1-80 days after the end of an
accretion outburst, as the amount of light elements is rapidly depleted.
Comparison to crust cooling data shows that DNB does not remove the need for an
additional shallow heating source. We conclude that solving the time-dependent
equations of the burning region in the envelope self-consistently in thermal
evolution models instead of using static temperature relations would be
valuable in future cooling studies.

splitting of the $e_g$ level of Mn$^{3+}$ ions into $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{z^2}$. For $x$ = 0.4, the distortion in the $T_B$O$_6$ octahedra is

Mn. Ferrimagnetic ordering in $x$ = 0.4 and $x$ = 0.2 sets in at 110.3 and 78.2

Ti$^{3+}$, Mn$^{3+}$, and Co$^{3+}$ occupying the octahedral, whereas,

introduced recently [1]. Graph burning models the spread of contagion (fire) in
a graph in discrete time steps. $bn(G)$ is the minimum time needed to burn a
graph $G$.The problem is NP-complete. In this paper, we develop first
heuristics to solve the problem in general (connected) graphs. In order to test
the performance of our algorithms, we applied them on some graph classes with
known burning number such as theta graphs, we tested our algorithms on DIMACS
and BHOSLIB that are known benchmarks for NP-hard problems in graph theory. We
also improved the upper bound for burning number on general graphs in terms of
their distance to cluster. Then we generated a data set of 2000 random graphs
with known distance to cluster and tested our heuristics on them.

understanding the development of team science. However, it is an elusive task
due to diversity in the collaboration patterns of researchers. This study
provides a learning model for the dynamics of this variable; the parameters are
learned from empirical data that consist of the number of publications and the
number of coauthors at given time intervals. The model is based on relationship
between the annual number of new coauthors and time given an annual number of
publications, the relationship between the annual number of publications and
time given a historical number of publications, and Lotka's law. The
assumptions of the model are validated by applying it on the high-quality dblp
dataset. The effectiveness of the model is tested on the dataset by
satisfactory fittings on the evolutionary trend of the number of coauthors for
researchers, the distribution of this variable, and the occurrence probability
of collaboration events. Due to its regression nature, the model has the
potential to be extended to assess the confidence level of the prediction
results and thus has applicability to other empirical research.

anti-copying 2D barcodes. Prior hidden information detection schemes are either
heuristicbased or Machine Learning (ML) based. The key limitation of prior
heuristics-based schemes is that they do not answer the fundamental question of
why the information hidden at a 2D barcode can be detected. The key limitation
of prior MLbased information schemes is that they lack robustness because a
printed 2D barcode is very much environmentally dependent, and thus an
information hiding detection scheme trained in one environment often does not
work well in another environment. In this paper, we propose two hidden
information detection schemes at the existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. The
first scheme is to directly use the pixel distance to detect the use of an
information hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred as to the Pixel Distance
Based Detection (PDBD) scheme. The second scheme is first to calculate the
variance of the raw signal and the covariance between the recovered signal and
the raw signal, and then based on the variance results, detects the use of
information hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred as to the Pixel Variance
Based Detection (PVBD) scheme. Moreover, we design advanced IC attacks to
evaluate the security of two existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. We implemented
our schemes and conducted extensive performance comparison between our schemes
and prior schemes under different capturing devices, such as a scanner and a
camera phone. Our experimental results show that the PVBD scheme can correctly
detect the existence of the hidden information at both the 2LQR code and the
LCAC 2D barcode. Moreover, the probability of successfully attacking of our IC
attacks achieves 0.6538 for the 2LQR code and 1 for the LCAC 2D barcode.

solution of 2D inverse problems in light and acoustic holography with synthetic
data. Statistical information on objects such as their center location,
diameter size, orientation, as well as material properties, are extracted by
sampling the posterior distribution. Assuming the number of objects known,
comparison of the results obtained by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and by
sampling a Gaussian distribution found by linearization about the maximum a
posteriori estimate show reasonable agreement. The latter procedure has low
computational cost, which makes it an interesting tool for uncertainty studies

larger measurement noise. When the number of objects is unknown, we devise a

cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the
first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western
Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of
confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds,
dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results,
hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction
number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than
February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the
epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The
median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of
positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.
The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We
estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We
estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around

nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of
COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely

observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with

from Type Ib to Type IIn over $\sim$200 days. This transformation is consistent
with a helium star having exploded in a cavity surrounded by a dense shell of

post-explosion, the ejecta continued to interact with an outer, extended
component of circumstellar medium (CSM) that was ejected even before the dense
shell. It is still unclear, however, what kind of progenitor could have
undergone such a complicated mass-loss history before it produced this peculiar
SN. In this paper, we report a new analysis of SN 2014C's host star cluster
based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). By carefully fitting its
spectral energy distribution (SED), we derive a precise cluster age of
20.0$^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ Myr, which corresponds to the progenitor's lifetime
assuming coevolution. Combined with binary stellar evolution models, we find
that SN 2014C's progenitor may have been an $\sim$11-$M_\odot$ star in a
relatively wide binary system. The progenitor's envelope was partially stripped
by Case C or Case BC mass transfer via binary interaction, followed by a
violent eruption that ejected the last hydrogen layer before terminal
explosion. Thus, SN 2014C, in common with SNe 2006jc and 2015G, may be a third
example that violent eruptions, with mass-loss rates matching luminous blue

pseudo-gradient dynamics, and require either double-layer iterations or
conservative conditions on the step sizes. To overcome both these flaws and
improve efficiency, we design the first fully-distributed single-layer
algorithms based on proximal best-response. Our schemes are fixed-step and
allow for inexact updates, which is crucial for reducing the computational
complexity. Under standard assumptions on the game primitives, we establish
convergence to a variational equilibrium (with linear rate for games without
coupling constraints) by recasting our algorithms as proximal-point methods,
opportunely preconditioned to distribute the computation among the agents.
Since our analysis hinges on a restricted monotonicity property, we also
provide new general results that significantly extend the domain of
applicability of proximal-point methods. Besides, the operator-theoretic
approach favors the implementation of provably correct acceleration schemes

scientific goal in the space weather research and prediction community is to
develop, implement and optimize numerical models for specifying the large-scale
properties of solar wind conditions at the inner boundary of the heliospheric
model domain. Here we present an adaptive prediction system that fuses
information from in situ measurements of the solar wind into numerical models
to better match the global solar wind model solutions near the Sun with
prevailing physical conditions in the vicinity of Earth. In this way, we
attempt to advance the predictive capabilities of well-established solar wind
models for specifying solar wind speed, including the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)
model. In particular, we use the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation (HUX) model
for mapping the solar wind solutions from the near-Sun environment to the
vicinity of Earth. In addition, we present the newly developed Tunable HUX
(THUX) model which solves the viscous form of the underlying Burgers equation.
We perform a statistical analysis of the resulting solar wind predictions for

investigated coronal/heliospheric model combinations and produces better
estimates of the solar wind state at Earth than our reference baseline model.

jeopardizes its viability. In this work, we critically compare the two main
solutions of the convergence problem, i.e. the $y$-parametrizations of the
redshift and the alternatives to Taylor expansions based on Pad\'e series. In
particular, among several possibilities, we consider two widely adopted
parametrizations, namely $y_1=1-a$ and $y_2=\arctan(a^{-1}-1)$, being $a$ the
scale factor of the Universe. We find that the $y_2$-parametrization performs
relatively better than the $y_1$-parametrization over the whole redshift
domain. Even though $y_2$ overcomes the issues of $y_1$, we get that the most
viable approximations of the luminosity distance $d_L(z)$ are given in terms of
Pad\'e approximations. In order to check this result by means of cosmic data,
we analyze the Pad\'e approximations up to the fifth order, and compare these
series with the corresponding $y$-variables of the same orders. We investigate
two distinct domains involving Monte Carlo analysis on the Pantheon Superovae
Ia data, $H(z)$ and shift parameter measurements. We conclude that the (2,1)
Pad\'e approximation is statistically the optimal approach to explain low and
high-redshift data, together with the fifth-order $y_2$-parametrization. At
high redshifts, the (3,2) Pad\'e approximation cannot be fully excluded, while
the (2,2) Pad\'e one is essentially ruled out.

some aspects of such modeling by analyzing a simple individual-based model, in
which tumor cells are presented as point particles drifting in
$\mathbf{R}_{+}:=[0,+\infty)$ towards the origin with unit speed. At the
origin, each of them splits into two new particles that instantly appear in
$\mathbf{R}_{+}$ at random positions. During their drift the particles are
subject to a random death before splitting. In this model, trait $x\in

death is caused by therapeutic factors. On its base we demonstrate how to
derive a condition -- involving the therapy related death rate and cell cycle
distribution parameters -- under which the tumor size remains bounded in time,
which practically means combating the disease.

transition of this model by extending our previous results to arbitrary
temperature: We compute the partition function of the model at all
temperatures, and derive several critical exponents associated with the
infinite perimeter limit. We show that the model has a local limit at any
temperature, whose properties depend drastically on the temperature. At high
temperatures, the local limit is reminiscent of the uniform infinite
half-planar triangulation (UIHPT) decorated with a subcritical percolation. At
low temperatures, the local limit develops a bottleneck of finite width due to
the energy cost of the main Ising interface between the two spin clusters
imposed by the Dobrushin boundary condition. This change can be summarized by a
novel order parameter with a nice geometric meaning. In addition to the phase
transition, we also generalize our construction of the local limit from the
two-step asymptotic regime used in [arXiv:1806.06668] to a more natural
diagonal asymptotic regime. We obtain in this regime a scaling limit related to
the length of the main Ising interface, which coincides with predictions from

wave-vectors, $\textbf{k}$, quasi-parallel and oblique to $\mathbf{B}_0$,
finding that the helicity of Alfv\'enic fluctuations is consistent with
predictions from linear Vlasov theory. This result suggests that the non-linear
turbulent fluctuations at these scales share at least some polarisation
properties with Alfv\'en waves. We also investigate the dependence of proton
temperature in the $\beta_p$-$\theta_{vB}$ plane to probe for possible
signatures of turbulent dissipation, finding that it correlates with
$\theta_{vB}$. The proton temperature parallel to $\mathbf{B}_0$ is higher in
the parameter space where we measure the helicity of right-handed Alfv\'enic
fluctuations, and the temperature perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}_0$ is higher
where we measure left-handed fluctuations. This finding is inconsistent with
the general assumption that by sampling different $\theta_{vB}$ in the solar
wind we can analyse the dependence of the turbulence distribution on
$\theta_{kB}$, the angle between $\textbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{B}_0$. After ruling
out both instrumental and expansion effects, we conclude that our results
provide new evidence for the importance of local kinetic processes that depend
on $\theta_{vB}$ in determining proton temperature in the solar wind.

also from the theoretical perspective. In this work the question is addressed
for the example of the German soccer Bundesliga how a theoretically optimum
forecast of the goal difference of a match can be characterized. This involves
a careful analysis of the random contributions in a match and its
disentanglement from the informative contributions, resulting from the
individual team strengths. An important aspect is the consideration of the time
dependence of the team strength which turns out to mainly fluctuate around a
team-specific value during the course of a season. Two types of time-dependent
properties have to be distinguished, one being uncorrelated between different
match-days, the other being correlated and thus accessible by an appropriate
correlation analysis. For some performance indicators, which may be used to
estimate the team strength, the quality of the respective forecast is compared
to the theoretical optimum. Knowledge of the informative contribution allows
one to conclude that the offensive team strength is more important than the
defensive team strength for the final success.

investigate whether the dust scattering indeed reduces the observed continuum
intensity by comparing the ALMA archival data of the TW Hya disk at Band 3, 4,
6, 7 and 9 to models obtained by radiative transfer simulations. We find that
the model with scattering by 300 ${\rm \mu m}$-sized grains well reproduces the
observed SED of the central part of the TW Hya disk while the model without
scattering is also consistent within the errors of the absolute fluxes. To
explain the intensity at Band 3, the dust surface density needs to be $\sim$ 10
${\rm g\,cm^{-2}}$ at 10 au in the model with scattering, which is 26 times
more massive than previously predicted. The model without scattering needs 2.3
times higher dust mass than the model with scattering because it needs lower
temperature. At Band 7, scattering reduces the intensity by $\sim$ 35% which
makes the disk looks optically thin even though it is optically thick. Our
study suggests the TW Hya disk is still capable of forming cores of giant

the number of e-folds from horizon crossing to the pivot scale $N_{ke}+N_{ep}$

16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 from 150 CT images. The feature extraction process
was applied to patches to increase the classification performance. Grey Level
Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Directional Pattern (LDP), Grey Level Run
Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) algorithms were used as feature extraction methods.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) classified the extracted features. 2-fold, 5-fold
and 10-fold cross-validations were implemented during the classification
process. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score metrics
were used to evaluate the classification performance. The best classification
accuracy was obtained as 99.68% with 10-fold cross-validation and GLSZM feature
extraction method.

early detection of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The proposed QC-SPHARM can
distinguish between normal control (NC) subjects and AD patients, as well as
between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients having high
possibility progressing into AD and those who do not. Using the spherical
harmonics (SPHARM) based registration, hippocampal surfaces segmented from the
ADNI data are individually registered to a template surface constructed from
the NC subjects using SPHARM. Local geometric distortions of the deformation
from the template surface to each subject are quantified in terms of
conformality distortions and curvatures distortions. The measurements are
combined with the spherical harmonics coefficients and the total volume change
of the subject from the template. Afterwards, a t-test based feature selection
method incorporating the bagging strategy is applied to extract those local
regions having high discriminating power of the two classes. The disease
diagnosis machine can therefore be built using the data under the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) setting. Using 110 NC subjects and 110 AD patients from
the ADNI database, the proposed algorithm achieves 85:2% testing accuracy on 80
random samples as testing subjects, with the incorporation of surface geometry
in the classification machine. Using 20 aMCI patients who has advanced to AD
during a two-year period and another 20 aMCI patients who remain non-AD for the
next two years, the algorithm achieves 81:2% accuracy using 10 randomly picked
subjects as testing data. Our proposed method is 6%-15% better than other
classification models without the incorporation of surface geometry. The
results demonstrate the advantages of using local geometric distortions as the
discriminating criterion for early AD diagnosis.

emission. Owing to the compactness of this binary, emission of non-thermal
X-ray photons via inverse Compton scattering is expected. We first revised the
orbital solution for Cyg OB2 #8a using new optical spectra. We then reduced and
analysed X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton, Swift, INTEGRAL, and NuSTAR.
The analysis of the XMM-Newton and Swift data allows us to better characterise
the X-ray emission from the stellar winds and colliding winds region at
energies below 10 keV. We confirm the variation of the broad-band light curve
of Cyg OB2 #8a along the orbit with, for the first time, the observation of the
maximum emission around phase 0.8. The minimum ratio of the X-ray to bolometric
flux of Cyg OB2 #8a remains well above the level expected for single O-type
stars, indicating that the colliding wind region is not disrupted during the
periastron passage. The analysis of the full set of publicly available INTEGRAL
observations allows us to refine the upper limit on the non-thermal X-ray flux
of the Cyg OB2 region between 20 and 200 keV. Two NuSTAR observations (phases
0.028 and 0.085) allow us to study the Cyg OB2 #8a spectrum up to 30 keV. These
data do not provide evidence of the presence of non-thermal X-rays, but bring
more stringent constraints on the flux of a putative non-thermal component.
Finally, we computed, thanks to a new dedicated model, the anisotropic inverse
Compton emission generated in the wind shock region. The theoretical
non-thermal emission appears to be compatible with observational limits and the
kinetic luminosity computed from these models is in good agreement with the
unabsorbed flux observed below 10 keV.

gaining popularity in decision-making for autonomous driving. However, learned
policies often fail to generalize and cannot handle novel situations well.
Asking and answering questions in the form of ""Would a policy perform well if
the other agents had behaved differently?"" can shed light on whether a policy
has seen similar situations during training and generalizes well. In this work,
a counterfactual policy evaluation is introduced that makes use of
counterfactual worlds - worlds in which the behaviors of others are non-actual.
If a policy can handle all counterfactual worlds well, it either has seen
similar situations during training or it generalizes well and is deemed to be
fit enough to be executed in the actual world. Additionally, by performing the
counterfactual policy evaluation, causal relations and the influence of
changing vehicle's behaviors on the surrounding vehicles becomes evident. To
validate the proposed method, we learn a policy using reinforcement learning
for a lane merging scenario. In the application-phase, the policy is only
executed after the counterfactual policy evaluation has been performed and if
the policy is found to be safe enough. We show that the proposed approach
significantly decreases the collision-rate whilst maintaining a high
success-rate.

generates electricity by use of gas, and then exploits the waste heat to supply
community with heat and cooling. In this paper, we consider a smart city
consisting of a number of communities (CCHPs) and an agent of power grid (APG),
where CCHPs can sell energy to the APG according to its bid. To study all
utilities of entities in such a city from energy trading, a noncooperative
Stackelberg game between APG and CCHPs is formulated. Here, the APG gives a bid
for buying the energy from CCHPs, then CCHPs respond to the APG with their
optimal energy supply that maximizing their utilities according to this bid. We
show that the maximum profit to the APG and utilities to the CCHPs can be
obtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is guaranteed to exist and
unique. Because the complete information about energy supply of each CCHP is
unknown to the APG in advance, we propose a distributed algorithm that is able
to find the point of equilibrium through a limited number of iterations. Taking
privacy protection and transaction security into consideration, we design a
blockchain-enabled energy management system. This system is composed of
Internet of Energy (IoE) sub-system and blockchain sub-system, where the
information interactions as well as energy transactions between APG and CCHPs
can be carried out effectively and safely. Finally, security analysis and
numerical simulations show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed

  Multiple-Access Optical Frequency Transfer",,,,,"physics.ins-det physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While it has been shown that backscattering induced phase noise can be
suppressed by adopting acoustic-optic-modulators (AOMs) at the local and remote
sites to break the frequency symmetry in both directions. However, this issue
can not be avoided for conventional fiber-optic multiple-access coherent
optical phase dissemination in which the interference of the signal light with
the Rayleigh backscattered light will probably destroy the coherence of the
stabilized optical signal. We suppress the backscattering effect by locally
breaking the frequency symmetry at the extraction point by inserting an
additional AOM. Here, we theoretically analyze and experimentally demonstrate
an add-drop one more AOM approach for suppressing the Rayleigh backscattering
within the fiber link. Near-complete suppression of backscattering noise is
experimentally confirmed through the measurement the elimination of a common
interference term of the signal light and the Rayleigh backscattered light. The
results demonstrate that the Rayleigh backscattering light has a limited effect
compared to the residual delay-limited fiber phase noise on the system's
performance. Our results also provide new evidence that it is possible to
largely suppress Rayleigh and other backscattering noise within a long optical
fiber link, where the accumulated phase noise could be large, by using
frequency symmetry breaking at each access node to achieve robust
multiple-access coherent optical phase propagation in spite of scatters or
defects.

regulator that mediates adaptation to nutritional variations in order to
maintain a proper energy balance in cells. We show here that suckling-weaning
and fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in
AMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional
transitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose
utilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the
glucagon:insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the
respective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse
primary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates
AMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK.
Challenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened
both AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion limited-glucose conditions,
whereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both
insulin and glucagon induced AMPK$\alpha$ phosphorylation at its Ser-485/491
residue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular
ATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under
fasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic
inflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic
energy charge. Our results suggest that nutritional changes (i.e. glucose
availability), rather than the related hormonal changes (i.e. the
glucagon:insulin ratio), sensitize AMPK activation to the energetic stress
induced by the dietary transition during fasting. This effect is critical for
preserving the cellular energy state in the liver.

For an interior source, we discover a sequence of image charges lying outside.
For a point source close the surface of a spheroid, series solutions for the

image system for a point charge on the axis of a prolate spheroid that extends

point charge in real space which applies when source lies near the surface, or
a point charge in complex space which projects as a ring in the real space

fill-edges, using the minimum vertex degree heuristic. Since H is necessarily a
weakly chordal graph, we use an algorithm for deleting edges from a weakly
chordal graph that preserves the weak chordality property of H. The edges that
are candidates for deletion are the fill-edges that were inserted into G. In
order to delete a maximal number of fill-edges, we maintain these in a queue. A
fill-edge is removed from the front of the queue, which we then try to delete
from H. If this violates the weak chordality property of H, we reinsert this
edge at the back of the queue. This loop continues till no more fill-edges can
be removed from H. Operationally, we implement this by defining a deletion
round as one in which the edge at the back of the queue is at the front.We stop

it is endowed with an energy conservation law from which the energy
conservation law associated with the original SGN model is retrieved when the

annotations (e.g. label class for classification task, pixel- or voxel-wised

obtain. During the training of a deep neural network, the annotated samples are
fed into the network in a mini-batch way, where they are often regarded of
equal importance. However, some of the samples may become less informative

adaptively selects informative samples that are fed to the training process.
The adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware

response of multilayered elastic spheres. The main idea is to describe
analytically the problem along the angular coordinates with spherical harmonics
and to discretize the radial direction with one-dimensional finite elements.
The proper test function must be carefully chosen so that both vector and
tensor spherical harmonics orthogonality relationships can be used. The
proposed approach yields a general one-dimensional formulation with a fully
analytical description of the angular behaviour, suitable for any interpolating
technique. A linear eigenvalue problem, simple and fast to solve, is then
obtained. The eigensolutions are the spheroidal and torsional modes. They are
favourably compared with literature results for a homogeneous sphere. The
eigensolutions are superposed to compute explicitly the forced response. The
latter is used to reconstruct the propagation of surfaces waves. In particular,
the collimation of a Rayleigh wave (non-diffracted surface wave propagating
with a quasi-constant width) excited by a line source in a homogeneous sphere
is recovered with the model. Based on the vibration eigenmodes, a modal
analysis shows that such a wave is a superposition of fundamental spheroidal
modes with a displacement confined at the equator of the sphere. These modes
are the so-called Rayleigh modes, of sectoral type and high polar wavenumbers.
When a thin viscoelastic coating is added to the sphere, the Rayleigh mode
behaviour is recovered in a limited frequency range, allowing the generation of
a collimating wave at the interface between the sphere and the coating.
