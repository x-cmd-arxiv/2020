$k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points over a field of $k^{O(1)}$ elements requires
$k^{\Omega(k)}$ time unless the \#ETH---a counting extension of the Exponential
Time Hypothesis of Impagliazzo and Paturi [CCC 1999] due to Dell {\em et al.}
[ACM TALG 2014]---is false. This holds also for linear matroids that admit a
representation where every point is associated to a vector with at most two
nonzero coordinates. We also show that the same is true for computing the Tutte
polynomial of a binary matroid of dimension $k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points with at
most three nonzero coordinates in each point's vector. This is in sharp
contrast to computing the Tutte polynomial of a $k$-vertex graph (that is, the
Tutte polynomial of a {\em graphic} matroid of dimension $k$---which is
representable in dimension $k$ over the binary field so that every vector has
two nonzero coordinates), which is known to be computable in $2^k k^{O(1)}$
time [Bj\""orklund {\em et al.}, FOCS 2008]. Our lower-bound proofs proceed via
(i) a connection due to Crapo and Rota [1970] between the number of tuples of
codewords of full support and the Tutte polynomial of the matroid associated
with the code; (ii) an earlier-established \#ETH-hardness of counting the
solutions to a bipartite $(d,2)$-CSP on $n$ vertices in $d^{o(n)}$ time; and
(iii) new embeddings of such CSP instances as questions about codewords of full
support in a linear code. We complement these lower bounds with two algorithm
designs. The first design computes the Tutte polynomial of a linear matroid of
dimension~$k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points in $k^{O(k)}$ operations. The second design
generalizes the Bj\""orklund~{\em et al.} algorithm and runs in
$q^{k+1}k^{O(1)}$ time for linear matroids of dimension $k$ defined over the
$q$-element field by $k^{O(1)}$ points with at most two nonzero coordinates
each.

previously been identified. Here, we present the results from a radio
monitoring campaign of FRB~121102 using the 76-m Lovell telescope. Using the

report a detection of periodic behaviour of the source over the span of five

turn `on' for the approximate MJD range $59002-59089$ (2020-06-02 to

another repeating FRB, highlights the need for long-term monitoring of
repeating FRBs at a high cadence. Using simulations, we show that one needs at
least 100 hours of telescope time to follow-up repeating FRBs at a cadence of
0.5--3 days to detect periodicities in the range of 10--150 days. If the period
is real, it shows that repeating FRBs can have a large range in their activity

original data for calibration or fine-tuning to get better performance.
However, in many real-world scenarios, the data may not be available due to
confidential or private issues, thereby making existing quantization methods
not applicable. Moreover, due to the absence of original data, the recently
developed generative adversarial networks (GANs) cannot be applied to generate
data. Although the full-precision model may contain rich data information, such

generating new meaningful data. In this paper, we investigate a

propose a knowledge matching generator to produce meaningful fake data by
exploiting classification boundary knowledge and distribution information in

In the case of event-timestamped data, the stream processing system must
promptly handle late events that arrive after the corresponding window has been
processed. To enable this late processing, the window state must be maintained
for a long period of time. However, current systems maintain this state in
memory, which either imposes a maximum period of tolerated lateness, or causes
the system to degrade performance or even crash when the system memory runs
out.
  In this paper, we propose AION, a comprehensive solution for handling late
events in an efficient manner, implemented on top of Flink. In designing AION,
we go beyond a naive solution that transfers state between memory and
persistent storage on demand. In particular, we introduce a proactive caching
scheme, where we leverage the semantics of stream processing to anticipate the
need for bringing data to memory. Furthermore, we propose a predictive cleanup
scheme to permanently discard window state based on the likelihood of receiving
more late events, to prevent storage consumption from growing without bounds.
  Our evaluation shows that AION is capable of maintaining sustainable levels
of memory utilization while still preserving high throughput, low latency, and
low staleness.

yielded impressive results. However, the available methods focus mainly on the
difference information between multitemporal remote sensing images and lack
robustness to pseudo-change information. To overcome the lack of resistance of
current methods to pseudo-changes, in this paper, we propose a new method,
namely, dual attentive fully convolutional Siamese networks (DASNet) for change
detection in high-resolution images. Through the dual-attention mechanism,
long-range dependencies are captured to obtain more discriminant feature
representations to enhance the recognition performance of the model. Moreover,
the imbalanced sample is a serious problem in change detection, i.e. unchanged
samples are much more than changed samples, which is one of the main reasons
resulting in pseudo-changes. We put forward the weighted double margin
contrastive loss to address this problem by punishing the attention to
unchanged feature pairs and increase attention to changed feature pairs. The
experimental results of our method on the change detection dataset (CDD) and
the building change detection dataset (BCDD) demonstrate that compared with

have been explored in various applications. However, due to the default
assumption that outliers are non-concentrated, unsupervised outlier detection
may not correctly detect group anomalies with higher density levels. As for the
supervised outlier detection, although high detection rates and optimal
parameters can usually be achieved, obtaining sufficient and correct labels is
a time-consuming task. To address these issues, we focus on semi-supervised
outlier detection with few identified anomalies, in the hope of using limited
labels to achieve high detection accuracy. First, we propose a novel detection
model Dual-GAN, which can directly utilize the potential information in
identified anomalies to detect discrete outliers and partially identified group
anomalies simultaneously. And then, considering the instances with similar
output values may not all be similar in a complex data structure, we replace
the two MO-GAN components in Dual-GAN with the combination of RCC and M-GAN
(RCC-Dual-GAN). In addition, to deal with the evaluation of Nash equilibrium
and the selection of optimal model, two evaluation indicators are created and
introduced into the two models to make the detection process more intelligent.
Extensive experiments on both benchmark datasets and two practical tasks
demonstrate that our proposed approaches (i.e., Dual-GAN and RCC-Dual-GAN) can
significantly improve the accuracy of outlier detection even with only a few
identified anomalies. Moreover, compared with the two MO-GAN components in
Dual-GAN, the network structure combining RCC and M-GAN has greater stability

theoretically investigate the onset of this phenomenon in a semiconductor

excitation. Two-photon absorption in this system may occur in two ways:
incoherent -- due to a consecutive ground-to-one-exciton-to-biexciton
transition and coherent -- due to a coherent two-photon process, involving the
direct ground-to-biexciton transition in the quantum dot. The presence of the
nanoshell nearby the quantum dot gives rise to two principal effects: (i) --
renormalization of the applied field amplitude and (ii) -- renormalization of
the resonance frequencies and radiation relaxation rates of the quantum dot,
both depending on the the quantum dot level populations. We show that in the
perturbation regime, when the excitonic levels are only slightly populated,
each of these factors may give rise to either suppression or enhancement of the
two-photon absorption. The complicated interplay of the two determines the
final effect. Beyond the perturbation regime, it is found that the two-photon
absorption experiences a drastic enhancement, which occurs independently of the
type of excitation, either into the one-exciton resonance or into the
two-photon resonance. Other characteristic features of the two-photon
absorption of the composite, emerging from the coupling between both
nanoparticles, are bistability and self-oscillations.

common across many areas of speech, in both formal and informal text. In the
last century, numerous explanations have been given to describe what order
people use for these binomials, from differences in semantics to differences in
phonology. These rules describe primarily `frozen' binomials that exist in
exactly one ordering and have lacked large-scale trials to determine efficacy.
  Online text provides a unique opportunity to study these lists in the context
of informal text at a very large scale. In this work, we expand the view of
binomials to include a large-scale analysis of both frozen and non-frozen
binomials in a quantitative way. Using this data, we then demonstrate that most
previously proposed rules are ineffective at predicting binomial ordering. By
tracking the order of these binomials across time and communities we are able
to establish additional, unexplored dimensions central to these predictions.
  Expanding beyond the question of individual binomials, we also explore the
global structure of binomials in various communities, establishing a new model
for these lists and analyzing this structure for non-frozen and frozen

high-precision extraction of foreground objects from natural images. Image
matting and background detection can be achieved easily through chroma keying
in a studio setting when the background is either pure green or blue.
Nonetheless, image matting in natural scenes with complex and uneven depth
backgrounds remains a tedious task that requires human intervention. To achieve
complete automatic foreground extraction in natural scenes, we propose a method
that assimilates semantic segmentation and deep image matting processes into a
single network to generate detailed semantic mattes for image composition task.
The contribution of our proposed method is two-fold, firstly it can be
interpreted as a fully automated semantic image matting method and secondly as
a refinement of existing semantic segmentation models. We propose a novel model
architecture as a combination of segmentation and matting that unifies the
function of upsampling and downsampling operators with the notion of attention.
As shown in our work, attention guided downsampling and upsampling can extract
high-quality boundary details, unlike other normal downsampling and upsampling
techniques. For achieving the same, we utilized an attention guided
encoder-decoder framework which does unsupervised learning for generating an
attention map adaptively from the data to serve and direct the upsampling and
downsampling operators. We also construct a fashion e-commerce focused dataset
with high-quality alpha mattes to facilitate the training and evaluation for
image matting.

UAVs adopt frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology to efficiently
and securely communicate with their radio controllers (RC) where the signal
follows a hopping pattern to prevent harmful interference. In order to
realistically distinguish the frequency hopping (FH) RC signals, one should
consider the real-world radio propagation environment since many UAVs
communicate with RCs from a far distance in which signal faces both slow and
fast fading phenomenons. Therefore, in this study different from the
literature, we consider a system that works under real-conditions by capturing
over-the-air signals at hilly terrain suburban environments in the presence of
foliages. We adopt the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) approach to capture
the hopping sequence of each signal. Furthermore, time guards associated with
each hopping sequence are calculated using the autocorrelation function (ACF)
of the STFT which results in differentiating the each UAV RC signal accurately.
In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, the results of
normalized mean square error (MSE) respect to different signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), window size and Tx-Rx separation values are given.

multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time.
It is also unclear which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction
models. We aim to give some answers to these questions by means of a
large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction methods from
machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets
from the database ""The Cancer Genome Atlas"", containing from 35 to 1,000
observations and from 60,000 to 100,000 variables. The considered outcome was
the (censored) survival time. Twelve methods based on boosting, penalized
regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods that do and
that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The
Kaplan-Meier estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used
as reference methods. The methods were compared using several repetitions of
5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated Brier-score served as
performance metrics. The results show that, although multi-omics data can
improve the prediction performance, this is not generally the case. Only the
method block forest slightly outperformed the Cox model on average over all
datasets. Taking into account the multi-omics structure improves the predictive
performance and protects variables in low-dimensional groups - especially
clinical variables - from not being included in the model. All analyses are
reproducible using freely available R code.

are mainly accelerated at the forward shocks driven by a pair of opposing jets
from Sgr A*. We find that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet event happened
$5-6$ Myr ago can naturally reproduce the bilobular morphology of the bubbles,
and the postshock gas temperature in the bubbles is heated to $\sim0.4$ keV,
consistent with recent X-ray observations. The forward shocks compress the hot
halo gas, and at low latitudes, the compressed gas shows an X-shaped structure,
naturally explaining the biconical X-ray structure in the ROSAT 1.5 keV map in
both morphology and X-ray surface brightness. CR acceleration is most efficient
in the head regions of the bubbles during the first 2 Myrs. The opposing jets
release a total energy of $\sim 10^{55}$ erg with an Eddington ratio of $\sim
10^{-3}$, which falls well in the range of the hot accretion flow mode for
black holes. Our simulations further show that the forward shocks driven by
spherical winds at the GC typically produce bubbles with much wider bases than
observed, and could not reproduce the biconical X-ray structure at low
latitudes. This suggests that starburst or AGN winds are unlikely the origin of
the bubbles in the shock scenario.

which is in equilibrium with a planetary crust. Methods. The molecular
composition of the gas above a surface made of a mixture of solid and liquid
materials is determined by assuming phase equilibrium for given pressure,
temperature and element abundances. We study total element abundances that
represent different parts of the Earth's crust (Continental Crust, Bulk
Silicate Earth, Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt), CI chondrites and abundances
measured in polluted white dwarfs. For temperatures between 600K and 3500K, the
near-crust atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly
composed of H2O, CO2, SO2 and in some cases of O2 and H2. For temperatures
500K, only N2-rich or CH4-rich atmospheres remain. For 3500K, the atmospheric
gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO,
CaO, AlO, FeO) and some metal hydroxides (KOH, NaOH). The inclusion of
phyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower
temperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700K and
inhibit the presence of liquid water. Measurements of the atmospheric
composition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet
crusts. H2O, O2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different
kinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers,
but do emerge naturally as result of the thermodynamic interaction between
crust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules
might be a sufficient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical
equilibrium.

Tools like random forests have an established track record of off-the-shelf
success and even offer various strategies for analyzing the underlying
relationships among variables. Here, motivated by recent insights into random
forest behavior, we introduce the simple idea of augmented bagging (AugBagg), a
procedure that operates in an identical fashion to classical bagging and random
forests, but which operates on a larger, augmented space containing additional
randomly generated noise features. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this
simple act of including extra noise variables in the model can lead to dramatic
improvements in out-of-sample predictive accuracy, sometimes outperforming even
an optimally tuned traditional random forest. As a result, intuitive notions of
variable importance based on improved model accuracy may be deeply flawed, as
even purely random noise can routinely register as statistically significant.
Numerous demonstrations on both real and synthetic data are provided along with

of complexity of complete (or exact) algorithms for robot motion planning. The
term ``complete'' indicates that an approach is guaranteed to find the correct
solution (a motion path or trajectory in our setting), or to report that none
exists otherwise (in case that for instance, no feasible path exists).
Complexity theory is a fundamental tool in computer science for analyzing the
performance of algorithms, in terms of the amount of resources they require.
(While complexity can express different quantities such as space and
communication effort, our focus in this chapter is on time complexity.)
Moreover, complexity theory helps to identify ``hard'' problems which require
excessive amount of computation time to solve. In the context of motion
planning, complexity theory can come in handy in various ways, some of which
are illustrated here.

approach to attenuate overfitting is the use of network regularization
techniques. We propose a novel regularization method that progressively
penalizes the magnitude of activations during training. The combined activation
signals produced by all neurons in a given layer form the representation of the
input image in that feature space. We propose to regularize this representation

generalization is analyzed with label randomization tests and cumulative
ablations. Experimental results show the advantages of our approach in

statistics, and as datasets grow larger and models grow more complex, many
popular MCMC algorithms become too computationally expensive to be practical.
Recent progress has been made on this problem through development of MCMC
algorithms based on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs),
irreversible processes that can be engineered to converge at a rate which is
independent of the size of data. While there has understandably been a surge of
theoretical studies following these results, PDMPs have so far only been
implemented for models where certain gradients can be bounded, which is not
possible in many statistical contexts. Focusing on the Zig-Zag process, we
present the Numerical Zig-Zag (NuZZ) algorithm, which is applicable to general
statistical models without the need for bounds on the gradient of the log
posterior. This allows us to perform numerical experiments on: (i) how the
Zig-Zag dynamics behaves on some test problems with common challenging
features; and (ii) how the error between the target and sampled distributions
evolves as a function of computational effort for different MCMC algorithms
including NuZZ. Moreover, due to the specifics of the NuZZ algorithms, we are
able to give an explicit bound on the Wasserstein distance between the exact
posterior and its numerically perturbed counterpart in terms of the
user-specified numerical tolerances of NuZZ.

scattering of jets of particles, and also include amplitudes for the production

These models have emergent energy, momentum and angular conservation laws,

in which no intermediate black holes are produced have a time-ordered Feynman

propagation of free particles (really Sterman-Weinberg jets of particles).
However, there are also amplitudes where jets collide to form large meta-stable
objects, with all the scaling properties of black holes: energy, entropy and
temperature, as well as the characteristic time scale for the decay of
perturbations. We generalize the conjecture of Sekino and Susskind, to claim
that all of these models are fast scramblers. The rationale for this claim is
that the interactions are invariant under fuzzy subgroups of the group of
volume preserving diffeomorphisms, so that they are highly non-local on the

calculate an organism's metabolic activity at each time-step of a dynamic
simulation, using the well-known technique of flux balance analysis. For
microbial communities, this calculation is especially costly and involves
solving a linear constrained optimization problem for each member of the
community at each time step. However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as
prior solutions can be used to inform future time steps. Here, we show that a
basis for the space of internal fluxes can be chosen for each microbe in a
community and this basis can be used to simulate forward by solving a
relatively inexpensive system of linear equations at most time steps. We can
use this solution as long as the resulting metabolic activity remains within
the optimization problem's constraints (i.e. the solution to the linear system
of equations remains a feasible to the linear program). As the solution becomes
infeasible, it first becomes a feasible but degenerate solution to the
optimization problem, and we can solve a different but related optimization
problem to choose an appropriate basis to continue forward simulation. We
demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method by comparing with
currently used methods on a four species community, and show that our method
requires at least $91\%$ fewer optimizations to be solved. For reproducibility,
we prototyped the method using Python. Source code is available at

heavy nuclei is well described in the language of hydrodynamics. Non-central
collisions are characterized by very large angular momentum, which in a fluid
system manifests as flow vorticity. This rotational structure can lead to a
spin polarization of the hadrons that eventually emerge from the plasma,
providing experimental access to flow substructure at unprecedented detail.
Recently, first observations of $\Lambda$ hyperon polarization along the
direction of collisional angular momentum have been reported. These
measurements are in broad agreement with hydrodynamic and transport-based
calculations and reveal that the QGP is the most vortical fluid ever observed.
However, there remain important tensions between theory and observation which
might be fundamental in nature. In the relatively mature field of heavy ion
physics, the discovery of global hyperon polarization and three-dimensional
simulations of the collision have opened an entirely new direction of research.
We discuss the current status of this rapidly developing area and directions

version of SalsaNet [1] which has an encoder-decoder architecture where the
encoder unit has a set of ResNet blocks and the decoder part combines upsampled
features from the residual blocks. In contrast to SalsaNet, we introduce a new
context module, replace the ResNet encoder blocks with a new residual dilated
convolution stack with gradually increasing receptive fields and add the
pixel-shuffle layer in the decoder. Additionally, we switch from stride
convolution to average pooling and also apply central dropout treatment. To
directly optimize the Jaccard index, we further combine the weighted
cross-entropy loss with Lovasz-Softmax loss [2]. We finally inject a Bayesian
treatment to compute the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for each point
in the cloud. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the
Semantic-KITTI dataset [3], which demonstrates that the proposed SalsaNext
outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks and ranks
first on the Semantic-KITTI leaderboard. We also release our source code

relative to each other in word embedding spaces. Previous approaches learned
constant vector offsets: vectors that point from source tokens to target tokens
with an assumption that these offsets were parallel to each other. We show that
the offsets between related tokens are closer to orthogonal than parallel, and
that they have low cosine similarities. We proceed by making a different
assumption; target tokens are linearly separable from source and un-labeled
tokens. We show that a max-margin hyperplane can separate target tokens and
that vectors orthogonal to this hyperplane represent the relationship between
source and targets. We find that this representation of the relationship
obtains the best results in dis-covering linguistic regularities. We experiment
with vector space models trained by a variety of algorithms (Word2vec:
CBOW/skip-gram, fastText, or GloVe), and various word context choices such as
linear word-order, syntax dependency grammars, and with and without knowledge
of word position. These experiments show that our model, SVMCos, is robust to a

serves the job with the shortest remaining processing time first. In this work
we are interested in studying the asymptotic behavior of suitably scaled
measure-valued state descriptors that describe the evolution of a sequence of
SRPT queuing systems. Gromoll, Kruk, and Puha (2011) have studied this problem
under diffusive scaling. In the setting where the processing time distributions
have unbounded support, under suitable conditions, they show that the diffusion
scaled measures converge in distribution to the process that is identically
zero. In Puha (2015) for the setting where the processing time distributions
have unbounded support and light tails, a non-standard scaling of the queue
length process is shown to give rise to a form of state space collapse that
results in a nonzero limit. In the current work we consider the case where
processing time distributions have finite second moments and regularly varying
tails. We show that the measure valued process, under a non-standard scaling,
converges in distribution in the space of paths of measures. In sharp contrast
with previous results, there is no state space collapse. Nevertheless, the
description of the limit is simple and given explicitly in terms of a certain
$\mathbb{R}_+$ valued random field which is determined from a single Brownian
motion. Along the way we establish convergence of suitably scaled workload and
queue length processes. We also show that as the tail of the distribution of
job processing times becomes lighter in an appropriate fashion, the difference
between the limiting queue length process and the limiting workload process
converges to zero, thereby approaching the behavior of state space collapse.

  title to reflect the broader focus of the paper",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An arc is a subset of $\mathbb F_q^2$ which does not contain any collinear
triples. Let $A(q,k)$ denote the number of arcs in $\mathbb F_q^2$ with
cardinality $k$. This paper is primarily concerned with estimating the size of
$A(q,k)$ when $k$ is relatively large, namely $k=q^t$ for some $t>0$. Trivial
estimates tell us that
  \[
  {q \choose k} \leq A(q,k) \leq {q^2 \choose k}.
  \]
  We show that the behaviour of $A(q,k)$ changes significantly close to
$t=1/2$. Below this threshold an elementary argument is used to prove that the
trivial upper bound above cannot be improved significantly.
  On the other hand, for $t \geq 1/2+\delta$, we use the theory of hypergraph
containers to get an improved upper bound
  \[
  A(q,k) \leq {q^{2-t+2\delta} \choose k}.
  \]
  This technique is also used to give an upper bound for the size of the
largest arc in a random subset of $\mathbb F_q^2$ which holds with high
probability. For example, we prove that a $p$-random subset $Q \subset \mathbb
F_q^2$ with $q^{-3/2}<p<q^{-1}$ contains an arc of size $\Omega(q^{1/2})$ with
high probability. The result is optimal for this range of $p$.
  Finally, this optimal bound for arcs in random sets is used to prove a finite
field analogue of a result of Balogh and Solymosi, with a better exponent:
there exists a subset $P \subset \mathbb F_q^2$ which does not contain any
collinear quadruples, but with the property that for every $P' \subset P$ with
$|P'| \geq |P|^{3/4+o(1)}$, $P'$ contains a collinear triple.

model the source statistics in each subregion with individual but mutually

optimization algorithm for the point process and decision tree parameters.
Thus, we introduce a model that can jointly infer the source statistics and an
adaptive partitioning of the spatial region. Finally, we provide experimental
results on real-life data, which provides significant improvement due to space
adaptation and joint optimization compared to standard well-known methods in
the literature.

  Version accepted by Journal of Computer Security",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work explores the extent to which LSB embedding can be made secure
against structural steganalysis through a modification of cover image
statistics prior to message embedding. Natural images possess symmetries that
are expressed through approximately equal cardinalities of certain sets of
$k$-tuples of consecutive pixels. LSB embedding disturbs this balance and a
$k^{\rm th}$-order structural attack infers the presence of a hidden message
with a length in proportion to the size of the imbalance amongst sets of
$k$-tuples. To protect against $k^{\rm th}$-order structural attacks, cover
modifications involve the redistribution of $k$-tuples among the different sets
so that symmetries of the cover image are broken, then repaired through the act
of LSB embedding so that the stego image bears the statistics of the original
cover. To protect against all orders up to some order $k$, the statistics of
$n$-tuples must be preserved where $n$ is the least common multiple of all
orders $\leq k$. We find that this is only feasible for securing against up to
$3^{\rm rd}$-order attacks (Sample Pairs and Triples analyses) since
higher-order protections result in virtually zero embedding capacities.
Securing up to $3^{\rm rd}$-order requires redistribution of sextuplets: rather
than perform these $6^{\rm th}$-order cover modifications, which result in tiny
embedding capacities, we reduce the problem to the redistribution of triplets
in a manner that also preserves the statistics of pairs. This is done by
embedding into only certain pixels of each sextuplet, constraining the maximum
embedding rate to be $\leq 2/3$ bits per channel. Testing on a variety of image
formats, we report best performance for JPEG-compressed images with a mean
maximum embedding rate undetectable by $2^{\rm nd}$- and $3^{\rm rd}$-order
attacks of 0.21 bits per channel.

investigate the role of temperature-dependent energy-yield and levelized cost
of energy (LCOE) of bifacial solar farms relative to monofacial farms,
stand-alone bifacial modules, and various competing bifacial technologies. In
this work, we integrate irradiance and light collection models with
experimentally validated, physics-based temperature-dependent efficiency models

energy yield and LCOE by approximately -10 to 15%. Indeed, the results differ
significantly depending on the location of the farm (which defines the
illumination and ambient temperature), elevation of the module (increases
incident energy), as well as the temperature-coefficients of various bifacial

realistically assess location-specific relative advantage and economic

velocimetry (PIV) for velocity fields with planar laser induced fluorescence
(PLIF) for species fields, are widely used in experimental turbulent combustion
applications for the analysis of a plethora of complex physical processes. Such
physical analyses are driven by the interpretation of spatial correlations
between these fields by the experimenter. However, these correlations also
imply some amount of intrinsic redundancy; the simultaneous fields contain
overlapping information content. The goal of this work lies in the quantitative
extraction of this overlapping information content in simultaneous field
measurements. Specifically, the amount of PIV information contained in
simultaneously measured OH-PLIF fields in the domain of a swirl-stabilized
combustor is sought. This task is accomplished using machine learning
techniques based on artificial neural networks designed to optimize PLIF-to-PIV
mappings. It was found that most of the velocity information content could be
retrieved when considering linear combinations of neighborhoods of OH-PLIF
signal spanning roughly two integral lengthscales (half of the considered
domain), and that PLIF signal interactions contained in smaller, local regions
(less than half of the domain) contained no PIV information. Further, by
visualizing the coherent structures contained within the neural network
parameters, the role of multi-scale interactions related to velocity field
retrieval from the OH-PLIF signal became more apparent. Overall, this study
reveals a useful pathway (in the form of overlapping information content
extraction) to develop diagnostic tools that capture more information using the
same experimental resources by minimizing redundancy.

online hard negatives to train the model. For each image or text anchor in a
training mini-batch, the model is trained to distinguish between a positive and
the most confusing negative of the anchor mined from the mini-batch (i.e.
online hard negative). This strategy improves the model's capacity to discover
fine-grained correspondences and non-correspondences between image and text
inputs. However, the above approach has the following drawbacks: (1) the
negative selection strategy still provides limited chances for the model to
learn from very hard-to-distinguish cases. (2) The trained model has weak
generalization capability from the training set to the testing set. (3) The
penalty lacks hierarchy and adaptiveness for hard negatives with different
""hardness"" degrees. In this paper, we propose solutions by sampling negatives
offline from the whole training set. It provides ""harder"" offline negatives
than online hard negatives for the model to distinguish. Based on the offline
hard negatives, a quintuplet loss is proposed to improve the model's
generalization capability to distinguish positives and negatives. In addition,
a novel loss function that combines the knowledge of positives, offline hard
negatives and online hard negatives is created. It leverages offline hard
negatives as the intermediary to adaptively penalize them based on their
distance relations to the anchor. We evaluate the proposed training approach on
three state-of-the-art image-text models on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets.
Significant performance improvements are observed for all the models, proving
the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Code is available at

such as reputation based on user activity, while the mechanism is more opaque
in other networks. Nonetheless, there are always individuals who obtain greater
rewards and reputation than their peers. An intuitive yet important question to
ask is whether these successful users employ strategic behaviors to become
influential. It might appear that the influencers have gamed the system.
However, it remains difficult to conclude the rationality of their actions due
to factors like the combinatorial strategy space, inability to determine
payoffs, and resource limitations faced by individuals. The challenging nature
of this question has drawn attention from both the theory and data mining
communities. Therefore, in this paper, we are motivated to investigate if
resource-limited individuals discover strategic behaviors associated with high
payoffs when producing collaborative or interactive content in social networks.
We propose a novel framework of Dynamic Dual Attention Networks or DDAN which
models content production strategies of users through a generative process,
under the influence of social interactions involved in the process. Extensive
experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our model in modeling user
behavior. We make three strong empirical findings. Different strategies give
rise to different social payoffs, the best performing individuals exhibit
stability in their preference over the discovered strategies, which indicates
the emergence of strategic behavior, and the stability of strategy preference
is correlated with high payoffs.

is being adopted in various critical real-world applications. However, recent
research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to multiple security and
privacy attacks. In particular, backdoor attacks against ML models have
recently raised a lot of awareness. A successful backdoor attack can cause
severe consequences, such as allowing an adversary to bypass critical
authentication systems.
  Current backdooring techniques rely on adding static triggers (with fixed
patterns and locations) on ML model inputs which are prone to detection by the
current backdoor detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the first
class of dynamic backdooring techniques against deep neural networks (DNN),
namely Random Backdoor, Backdoor Generating Network (BaN), and conditional
Backdoor Generating Network (c-BaN). Triggers generated by our techniques can
have random patterns and locations, which reduce the efficacy of the current
backdoor detection mechanisms. In particular, BaN and c-BaN based on a novel
generative network are the first two schemes that algorithmically generate
triggers. Moreover, c-BaN is the first conditional backdooring technique that
given a target label, it can generate a target-specific trigger. Both BaN and
c-BaN are essentially a general framework which renders the adversary the
flexibility for further customizing backdoor attacks.
  We extensively evaluate our techniques on three benchmark datasets: MNIST,
CelebA, and CIFAR-10. Our techniques achieve almost perfect attack performance
on backdoored data with a negligible utility loss. We further show that our
techniques can bypass current state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against
backdoor attacks, including ABS, Februus, MNTD, Neural Cleanse, and STRIP.

metaheuristic algorithms as an alternative method to solve large-scale problem;
they need the evaluation of many candidate solutions to tackle them prior to
their convergence, which is not affordable for practical applications since the
most of them are computationally expensive. In other words, these problems are
not only large-scale but also computationally expensive, that makes them very
difficult to solve. There is no efficient surrogate model to support
large-scale expensive global optimization (LSEGO) problems. As a result, the
algorithms should address LSEGO problems using a limited computational budget
to be applicable in real-world applications. Coordinate Descent (CD) algorithm
is an optimization strategy based on the decomposition of a n-dimensional
problem into n one-dimensional problem. To the best our knowledge, there is no
significant study to assess benchmark functions with various dimensions and
landscape properties to investigate CD algorithm. In this paper, we propose a
modified Coordinate Descent algorithm (MCD) to tackle LSEGO problems with a
limited computational budget. Our proposed algorithm benefits from two leading
steps, namely, finding the region of interest and then shrinkage of the search
space by folding it into the half with exponential speed. One of the main
advantages of the proposed algorithm is being free of any control parameters,
which makes it far from the intricacies of the tuning process. The proposed
algorithm is compared with cooperative co-evolution with delta grouping on 20
benchmark functions with dimension 1000. Also, we conducted some experiments on
CEC-2017, D=10, 30, 50, and 100, to investigate the behavior of MCD algorithm
in lower dimensions. The results show that MCD is beneficial not only in
large-scale problems, but also in low-scale optimization problems.

object manipulation, called telemanipulation, is a new promising yet
challenging problem. This has unique challenges--on top of teleoperation
challenges in general--due to difficulties of physical discrepancy between
human hands and robot hands as well as the fine motion constraints to
constitute task success. We present an intuitive shared-control strategy where
the focus is on generating robotic grasp poses which are better suited for
human perception of successful teleoperated object manipulation and feeling of
being in control of the robot, rather than developing objective stable grasp
configurations for task success or following the human motion. The former is
achieved by understanding human intent and autonomously taking over control on
that inference. The latter is achieved by considering human inputs as hard
motion constraints which the robot must abide. An arbitration of these two
enables a trade-off for the subsequent robot motion to balance accomplishing
the inferred task and motion constraints imposed by the operator. The
arbitration framework adapts to the level of physical discrepancy between the
human and different robot structures, enabling the assistance to indicate and
appear to intuitively follow the user. To understand how users perceive good
arbitration in object telemanipulation, we have conducted a user study with a
hands-free telemanipulation setup to analyze the effect of factors including
task predictability, perceived following, and user preference. The hands-free
telemanipulation scene is chosen as the validation platform due to its more
urgent need of intuitive robotics assistance for task success.

the system close, in terms of an appropriate metric, to the goal density. The
solution to the latter infinite-dimensional problem can be, however, a complex
and computationally expensive task. Instead, we propose a more tractable and
intuitive approach which relies on a greedy control policy. The latter control
policy is comprised of the first elements of the control policies that solve a
sequence of corresponding linearized covariance steering problems. Each of
these covariance steering problems relies only on information available about
the state mean and state covariance at the current stage and can be formulated
as a tractable (finite-dimensional) convex program. At each stage, the

higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous
orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false

  Learning of Error",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes inverse feature learning as a novel supervised feature
learning technique that learns a set of high-level features for classification
based on an error representation approach. The key contribution of this method
is to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current
representation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are
obtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted
ones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for
each class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore,
this method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes
without retraining. Error representation learning can also help with
generalization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of
impactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships
between each instance and different classes through an error generation and
analysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where
the instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones
with imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that the proposed method
results in significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art
classification techniques for several popular data sets. We hope this paper can
open a new path to utilize the proposed perspective of error representation
learning in different feature learning domains.

different types of misclassification. It is thus important to develop
cost-sensitive classifiers which minimize the total misclassification cost.
Although binary cost-sensitive classifiers have been well-studied, solving
multicategory classification problems is still challenging. A popular approach
to address this issue is to construct K classification functions for a K-class
problem and remove the redundancy by imposing a sum-to-zero constraint.
However, such method usually results in higher computational complexity and
inefficient algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel angle-based
cost-sensitive classification framework for multicategory classification
without the sum-to-zero constraint. Loss functions that included in the
angle-based cost-sensitive classification framework are further justified to be
Fisher consistent. To show the usefulness of the framework, two cost-sensitive
multicategory boosting algorithms are derived as concrete instances. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that proposed boosting algorithms yield competitive
classification performances against other existing boosting approaches.

fluid under the action of some form of propulsion. The propulsion can come from
an external body force or from external shear flow. It may also come from
externally-induced stresses at the surface, arising from imposed chemical,
thermal or electrical gradients. The resulting motion arises jointly from the
driven particle and the displaced fluid. If the objects are asymmetric, every
aspect of their motion and interaction depends on the orientation of the
objects. This orientation in turn changes in response to the driving. The
objects' shape can thus lead to a range of emergent anisotropic and chiral
motion not possible with isotropic spherical particles. We first consider what
aspects of a body's asymmetry can affect its drift through a fluid, especially
chiral motion. We next discuss driving by injecting external force or torque
into the particles. Then we consider driving without injecting force or torque.
This includes driving by shear flow and driving by surface stresses, such as
electrophoresis. We consider how time-dependent driving can induce collective
orientational order and coherent motion. We show how a given particle shape can
be represented using an assembly of point forces called a Stokeslet object. We
next consider the interactions between anisotropic propelled particles, the
symmetries governing the interactions, and the possibility of bound pairs of
particles. Finally we show how the collective hydrodynamics of a suspension can
be qualitatively altered by the particles' shapes. The asymmetric responses
discussed here are broadly relevant also for swimming propulsion of active
micron-scale objects such as microorganisms.

trajectory space. An open question is how the dynamic facilitation theory of
the glass transition may be reconciled with thermodynamic theories that posit a
vanishing configurational entropy. Dynamic facilitation theory invokes a
dynamical phase transition, between an active phase (close to the normal
liquid) and an inactive phase which is glassy, whose order parameter is either
dynamic or a time-averaged structural quantity. In particular, the dynamical
phase transition in systems with non-trivial thermodynamics manifests
signatures of a lower critical point, which lies close to the putative Kauzmann
temperature, where any thermodynamic phase transition to an ideal glass state
might occur. We discuss these findings, and suggest that the lower critical
point of the structural-dynamical phase transition may be related to the large
drop in configurational entropy that occurs in the inactive phase of the
dynamical phase transition. Increasing supercooling thus brings configurational
entropy of the normal liquid much lower, along with the temperature.

images. It plays a central role in many applications such as image search, face
verification, and zero-shot learning. It is desirable to have a universal deep
embedding model applicable to various domains of images. However, existing
methods mainly rely on training specialist embedding models each of which is
applicable to images from a single domain. In this paper, we study an important
but unexplored task: how to train a single universal image embedding model to
match the performance of several specialists on each specialist's domain.
Simply fusing the training data from multiple domains cannot solve this problem
because some domains become overfitted sooner when trained together using
existing methods. Therefore, we propose to distill the knowledge in multiple
specialists into a universal embedding to solve this problem. In contrast to
existing embedding distillation methods that distill the absolute distances
between images, we transform the absolute distances between images into a
probabilistic distribution and minimize the KL-divergence between the
distributions of the specialists and the universal embedding. Using several
public datasets, we validate that our proposed method accomplishes the goal of
universal image embedding.

language interpretation. It requires models to recognize isolated sign words
from videos. However, annotating WSLR data needs expert knowledge, thus
limiting WSLR dataset acquisition. On the contrary, there are abundant
subtitled sign news videos on the internet. Since these videos have no
word-level annotation and exhibit a large domain gap from isolated signs, they
cannot be directly used for training WSLR models. We observe that despite the
existence of a large domain gap, isolated and news signs share the same visual
concepts, such as hand gestures and body movements. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a novel method that learns domain-invariant visual
concepts and fertilizes WSLR models by transferring knowledge of subtitled news
sign to them. To this end, we extract news signs using a base WSLR model, and
then design a classifier jointly trained on news and isolated signs to coarsely
align these two domain features. In order to learn domain-invariant features
within each class and suppress domain-specific features, our method further
resorts to an external memory to store the class centroids of the aligned news
signs. We then design a temporal attention based on the learnt descriptor to
improve recognition performance. Experimental results on standard WSLR datasets
show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods

predictions less ambiguous. However, previous studies of fine-grained image
retrieval primarily focus on semantic similarities or visual similarities. In a
real application, merely using visual similarity may not satisfy the need of
consumers to search merchandise with real-life images, e.g., given a red coat

visual similarity since they are visually similar. But the users actually want
a coat rather than suit even the coat is with different color or texture

propose a hierarchical adaptive semantic-visual tree (ASVT) to depict the

consumers for similar merchandise with the query while the visual information
optimizes the correlations within the semantic class. At each level, we set
different margins based on the semantic hierarchy and incorporate them as prior

transform image features into 3D representations. However, these methods are
vulnerable to images containing noisy backgrounds and heavy occlusions because
the extracted image features do not contain enough information to reconstruct
high-quality 3D shapes. Humans routinely use incomplete or noisy visual cues
from an image to retrieve similar 3D shapes from their memory and reconstruct
the 3D shape of an object. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method, named
Mem3D, that explicitly constructs shape priors to supplement the missing
information in the image. Specifically, the shape priors are in the forms of
""image-voxel"" pairs in the memory network, which is stored by a well-designed
writing strategy during training. We also propose a voxel triplet loss function
that helps to retrieve the precise 3D shapes that are highly related to the
input image from shape priors. The LSTM-based shape encoder is introduced to
extract information from the retrieved 3D shapes, which are useful in
recovering the 3D shape of an object that is heavily occluded or in complex
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that Mem3D significantly
improves reconstruction quality and performs favorably against state-of-the-art
methods on the ShapeNet and Pix3D datasets.

performance dissimilarities between the SM and the CAV under test usually
exist, and it can lead to the generation of suboptimal scenario libraries. In
this paper, an adaptive testing scenario library generation (ATSLG) method is
proposed to solve this problem. A customized testing scenario library for a
specific CAV model is generated through an adaptive process. To compensate the
performance dissimilarities and leverage each test of the CAV, Bayesian
optimization techniques are applied with classification-based Gaussian Process
Regression and a new-designed acquisition function. Comparing with a
pre-determined library, a CAV can be tested and evaluated in a more efficient
manner with the customized library. To validate the proposed method, a cut-in
case study was performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed method
can further accelerate the evaluation process by a few orders of magnitude.

In this article, we propose a Shannon-limit approached (SLA) IR scheme, which

Afterwards, only the failure corrected sub-blocks perform the additional

improved to 1.091 with the IR block length of 128Mb. Furthermore, the

unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al.
(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)]
to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL
analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific
heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for
cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections,
suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter
(M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds
(COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health
interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the
infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and
below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0
coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19
outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection
threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality
rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity
UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of
coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed
from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of
infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of

Without associating the moving trajectories, these image-based data-driven

owing to the one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a novel task to

We introduce the video-based object-oriented video captioning network (OVC)-Net
via temporal graph and detail enhancement to effectively analyze the activities
along time and stably capture the vision-language connections under
small-sample condition. The temporal graph provides useful supplement over
previous image-based approaches, allowing to reason the activities from the
temporal evolution of visual features and the dynamic movement of spatial
locations. The detail enhancement helps to capture the discriminative features
among different objects, with which the subsequent captioning module can yield
more informative and precise descriptions. Thereafter, we construct a new
dataset, providing consistent object-sentence pairs, to facilitate effective
cross-modal learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct experiments

up to k steps. Unlike other approaches that need to train another value network
to evaluate the rollouts, we can directly apply this look-ahead module to
improve the decoding of any sequence model trained in a maximum likelihood
framework. We evaluate our look-ahead module on three datasets of varying
difficulties: IM2LATEX-100k OCR image to LaTeX, WMT16 multimodal machine
translation, and WMT14 machine translation. Our look-ahead module improves the
performance of the simpler datasets such as IM2LATEX-100k and WMT16 multimodal
machine translation. However, the improvement of the more difficult dataset
(e.g., containing longer sequences), WMT14 machine translation, becomes
marginal. Our further investigation using the k-step look-ahead suggests that
the more difficult tasks suffer from the overestimated EOS (end-of-sentence)
probability. We argue that the overestimated EOS probability also causes the
decreased performance of beam search when increasing its beam width. We tackle
the EOS problem by integrating an auxiliary EOS loss into the training to
estimate if the model should emit EOS or other words. Our experiments show that
improving EOS estimation not only increases the performance of our proposed
look-ahead module but also the robustness of the beam search.

object picking. However, the trial samples lack the complete ground truth
because the observable parts of the agent are limited. That is, the information
contained in the trial samples is often insufficient to learn the specific
grasping position of each object. Consequently, the training falls into a local
solution, and the grasp positions learned by the robot are independent of the
state of the object. In this study, the optimal grasping position of an
individual object is determined from the grasping score, defined as the
distance in the feature space obtained using metric learning. The closeness of
the solution to the pre-designed optimal grasping position was evaluated in
trials. The proposed method incorporates two types of feedback control: one
feedback enlarges the grasping score when the grasping position approaches the
optimum; the other reduces the negative feedback of the potential grasping
positions among the grasping candidates. The proposed online self-supervised
learning method employs two deep neural networks. : SSD that detects the
grasping position of an object, and Siamese networks (SNs) that evaluate the
trial sample using the similarity of two input data in the feature space. Our
method embeds the relation of each grasping position as feature vectors by
training the trial samples and a few pre-samples indicating the optimum
grasping position. By incorporating the grasping score based on the feature
space of SNs into the SSD training process, the method preferentially trains
the optimum grasping position. In the experiment, the proposed method achieved
a higher success rate than the baseline method using simple teaching signals.
And the grasping scores in the feature space of the SNs accurately represented

transport properties modulated by the velocity barrier were studied in the
normal/ferromagnetic/normal monolayer MoS$_{2}$ quantum structure. Based on
Snell's Law in optics, we define the velocity barrier as $\xi=v_{2}/v_{1}$ by
changing the Fermi velocity of the intermediate ferromagnetic region to obtain
a deflection condition during the electron transport process in the structure.
The results show that both the magnitude and the direction of spin- and
valley-dependent electron polarization can be regulated by the velocity
barrier. $-100\%$ polarization of spin- and valley-dependent electron can be
achieved for $\xi>1$, while $100\%$ polarization can be obtained for $\xi<1$.
Furthermore, it is determined that perfect spin and valley transport always
occur at a large incident angle. In addition, the spin- and valley-dependent
electron transport considerably depends on the length $k_{F}L$ and the gate
voltage $U(x)$ of the intermediate ferromagnetic region. These findings provide
an effective method for designing novel spin and valley electronic devices.

cooperatively take actions as a team to maximize a total team reward. We
analyze the robustness of c-MARL to adversaries capable of attacking one of the
agents on a team. Through the ability to manipulate this agent's observations,
the adversary seeks to decrease the total team reward.
  Attacking c-MARL is challenging for three reasons: first, it is difficult to
estimate team rewards or how they are impacted by an agent mispredicting;
second, models are non-differentiable; and third, the feature space is
low-dimensional. Thus, we introduce a novel attack. The attacker first trains a
policy network with reinforcement learning to find a wrong action it should
encourage the victim agent to take. Then, the adversary uses targeted
adversarial examples to force the victim to take this action.
  Our results on the StartCraft II multi-agent benchmark demonstrate that
c-MARL teams are highly vulnerable to perturbations applied to one of their
agent's observations. By attacking a single agent, our attack method has highly
negative impact on the overall team reward, reducing it from 20 to 9.4. This
results in the team's winning rate to go down from 98.9% to 0%.

applicability of this technology for soft robot control has been limited by
complicated fabrication and tuning processes, and also the need for external
signals such as clocks and digital references. We propose a method to develop
pneumatic soft robots in which coordinated interactions between multiple
actuators are performed using controllers implemented on components
distributedly embedded in the soft structures of the system. In this approach,
the notions of binary and multi-valued actuator logic states are introduced. In
this way, the physical local dynamical couplings between the analog states of
the actuators, established using soft valves of a new type, can be thought of
as logic-gate-based mappings acting on discretized representations of the
actuator states. Consequently, techniques for digital logic design can be
applied to derive the architectures of the localized mechanical couplings that
intelligently coordinate the oscillation patterns of the actuator responses.
For the purposes of controller tuning, the soft valves are conceived so that
their main physical parameters can be adjusted from the exterior of the robot
through simple geometrical changes of the corresponding structural elements. To
demonstrate the proposed approach, we present the development of a six-state
locomoting soft robot.

Machine Learning methods can automate the mining process; however, the required
negative (non-security) class is too expensive to obtain. We propose a novel

the posts, and then develops a two-stage PU model to identify security content
using the labelled Positive and Unlabelled posts. We evaluate PUMiner on more
than 17.2 million posts on Stack Overflow and 52,611 posts on Security
StackExchange. We show that PUMiner is effective with the validation
performance of at least 0.85 across all model configurations. Moreover,
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of PUMiner is 0.906, 0.534 and 0.084
points higher than one-class SVM, positive-similarity filtering, and one-stage
PU models on unseen testing posts, respectively. PUMiner also performs well
with an MCC of 0.745 for scenarios where string matching totally fails. Even
when the ratio of the labelled positive posts to the unlabelled ones is only
1:100, PUMiner still achieves a strong MCC of 0.65, which is 160% better than
fully-supervised learning. Using PUMiner, we provide the largest and up-to-date

formation of a black hole. Two approaches are considered: in the first, the
embedding is constructed for the whole manifold at once; in the second, the
idea of a junction of solutions, obtained separately for areas inside and
outside the dust ball, is used. In the framework of the first approach, a
global smooth embedding in 7D space with a signature (2 + 5) was constructed.
It corresponds to the formation of the horizon as a result of matter falling
from infinity. The second approach generally leads to an embedding in 7D space
with the signature (1 + 6). This embedding corresponds to the case when matter
flies out of a white hole with the disappearance of its horizon, after which
the radius of the dust ball reaches its maximum, and then a collapse occurs
with the formation of the horizon of a black hole. The embedding obtained is
not smooth everywhere --- it contains a kink on the edge of the dust ball, and
{also, it is} not quite global. In the particular case, when the maximum radius
of the dust ball coincides with the radius of the horizon, it is possible to
construct a global smooth embedding in a flat 6D space with a signature (1 +

mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), a non-convex NPhard problem with
uncertainties due to renewable generation and demand. A model predictive
control approach is used to handle the uncertainties and price variations. This
in-turn requires solving a time-coupled multi-time step MINLP during each

convex programs with the ability of meta-heuristic techniques to handle complex
nonlinear problems. The performance of the SB3 solver is validated in the

dynamics. Recently, coherent control in the extreme-ultraviolet range was
demonstrated, with timing stability of the applied light fields in the
few-attosecond range. At hard x-ray energies, M\""ossbauer nuclei feature narrow
nuclear resonances, and spectroscopy of these resonances is a widespread tool
to study magnetic, structural and dynamical properties of matter. It has been
shown that the power and scope of M\""ossbauer spectroscopy can be significantly
advanced using various control techniques. However, the coherent control of
atomic nuclei using near-resonant x-ray fields remains an open challenge, also
because of the extreme stability requirements on the x-ray light in the

we argue that the curse of dimensionality is the underlying reason of limiting
the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. To address this issue, we
propose Progressive Adversarial Network (PAN) that is capable of coping with
this difficulty for domain-specific image super-resolution. The key principle
of PAN is that we do not apply any distance-based reconstruction errors as the
loss to be optimized, thus free from the restriction of the curse of
dimensionality. To maintain faithful reconstruction precision, we resort to
U-Net and progressive growing of neural architecture. The low-level features in
encoder can be transferred into decoder to enhance textural details with U-Net.
Progressive growing enhances image resolution gradually, thereby preserving
precision of recovered image. Moreover, to obtain high-fidelity outputs, we
leverage the framework of the powerful StyleGAN to perform adversarial
learning. Without the curse of dimensionality, our model can super-resolve
large-size images with remarkable photo-realistic details and few distortions.

model the MDS coding based cooperative caching as a Markov decision process to

small-scale system by embedding the cooperative MDS coding into Q-learning. To
cope with the large-scale case, we approximate the state-action value function
heuristically. The approximated function includes only a small number of
learnable parameters and enables us to propose a fast and efficient
action-selection approach, which dramatically reduces the complexity. Numerical
results verify the optimality/near-optimality of the proposed RL based

cylindrical air-gap are widely employed in Kibble balances. These experiments
require a uniform magnetic flux density along a vertical path, typically a
substantial fraction of the length of the air-gap. Fringe fields that are
present at both ends of the air-gap limit the region where the flux density
does not change more than a certain relative fraction (here: $5\times 10^{-4}$)
of the flux density in the center of the magnet system. By simply adding an
iron ring with a rectangular cross-section to the inner yoke at each end of the
air gap, the effects of the fringe fields can be counteracted, and, hence, the
length of the region, where the flux density remains within a given tolerance
band is increased. Compared to the alternative, employing a taller magnet, the
proposed method yields a magnet system with an extended region of a uniform
field without significantly increasing the mass of the magnet system. Potential
applications include compact and table-top Kibble balances. We investigate
possible adverse effects on the performance of the magnet system caused by the
additional rings: magnetic field strength, coil-current effect, and a
dependence of the radial field on the radial position in the field. No
substantial disadvantage was found. Instead, the method presented here
outperformed previously suggested methods to improve the radial dependence of
the radial field, e.g., shorter outer yoke. In summary, adding rings to the
inner yoke improves the uniformity of the field without a detrimental effect to
function, cost, and form factor of the magnet system.

performance in locating facial landmarks. However, three major problems still
exist among these models: (1) they are computationally expensive; (2) they
usually lack explicit constraints on global shapes; (3) domain gaps are
commonly present. To address these problems, we propose Pixel-in-Pixel Net
(PIPNet) for facial landmark detection. The proposed model is equipped with a
novel detection head based on heatmap regression, which conducts score and
offset predictions simultaneously on low-resolution feature maps. By doing so,
repeated upsampling layers are no longer necessary, enabling the inference time
to be largely reduced without sacrificing model accuracy. Besides, a simple but
effective neighbor regression module is proposed to enforce local constraints
by fusing predictions from neighboring landmarks, which enhances the robustness
of the new detection head. To further improve the cross-domain generalization
capability of PIPNet, we propose self-training with curriculum. This training
strategy is able to mine more reliable pseudo-labels from unlabeled data across
domains by starting with an easier task, then gradually increasing the
difficulty to provide more precise labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of PIPNet, which obtains state-of-the-art results on three out
of six popular benchmarks under the supervised setting. The results on two
cross-domain test sets are also consistently improved compared to the
baselines. Notably, our lightweight version of PIPNet runs at 35.7 FPS and 200

thus align them uniformly, regardless of their diverse complexities. In fact,
semantics are diverse (i.e. involving different kinds of semantic concepts),
and humans usually follow a latent structure to combine them into
understandable languages. It may be difficult to optimally capture such
sophisticated correspondences in existing methods. In this paper, to address
such a deficiency, we propose an Iterative Matching with Recurrent Attention
Memory (IMRAM) method, in which correspondences between images and texts are
captured with multiple steps of alignments. Specifically, we introduce an
iterative matching scheme to explore such fine-grained correspondence
progressively. A memory distillation unit is used to refine alignment knowledge
from early steps to later ones. Experiment results on three benchmark datasets,

knowledge from the source domain to the target domain in the context of

the ground truth to fully exploit the unlabeled target-domain data. Yet the
pseudo labels of the target-domain data are usually predicted by the model
trained on the source domain. Thus, the generated labels inevitably contain the
incorrect prediction due to the discrepancy between the training domain and the
test domain, which could be transferred to the final adapted model and largely
compromises the training process. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes
to explicitly estimate the prediction uncertainty during training to rectify
the pseudo label learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation adaptation.
Given the input image, the model outputs the semantic segmentation prediction
as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Specifically, we model the
uncertainty via the prediction variance and involve the uncertainty into the
optimization objective. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
evaluate the proposed method on two prevalent synthetic-to-real semantic

demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed approach (1)

significant improvements over the conventional pseudo label learning and yields
competitive performance on all three benchmarks.

Gumbel-Softmax. In addition, we introduce an unbiased gradient estimator,
RELAX, leading to an efficient and effective one-pass optimization strategy to
learn an efficient and accurate DA policy. We conduct extensive experiments on

quantified by von Neumann entropy. However, as we know, the von Neumann entropy
is only statistical quantity or operator, it therefore has fluctuation. The
quantum fluctuation of entanglement (QFE) between Unruh-Dewitt detector modeled
by a two-level atom is investigated in a relativistic setting. The Unruh
radiation and quantum fluctuation effects affect the precise measurement of
quantum entanglement. Inspired by this we present how the relativistic motion
effects QFE for two entangled Unruh-Dewitt detectors when one of them is
accelerated and interacts with the neighbor external scalar field. We find that
QFE first increases by the Unruh thermal noise and then suddenly decays when
the acceleration reaches at a considerably large value, which indicates that
relativistic effect will lead to non-negligible QFE effect. We also find that
the initial QFE (without acceleration effect) is minimum with the maximally
entangled state. Moreover, although QFE has a huge decay when the acceleration
is greater than $\sim0.96$, concurrence also decays to a very low value, the
ratio $\Delta E/C$ therefore still large. According to the equivalence
principle, our findings could be in principle applied to dynamics of QFE under
the influence of gravitation field.

dissipation. On the other hand, the DW in an antiferromagnet (AFM) moves at a
high velocity with weak stray field. In this work, the AFM DW motion induced by
a gradient of magnetic anisotropy energy under a voltage pulse has been
investigated in theory. The dynamics equation for the DW motion was derived.
The solution indicates that the DW velocity is higher than 100 m/s, and because
of inertia, the DW is able to keep moving at a speed of around 100 m/s for
several nano seconds after turning off the voltage in a period of pulse. The
mechanism for this DW inertia is explained based on the Lagrangian route. On
the other hand, a spin wave is emitted while the DW is moving, yet the DW is
still able to move at an ever increasing velocity with enlarging DW width. This
indicates energy loss from emission of spin wave is less than the energy gain
from the effective field of the gradient of anisotropy energy.

patterns, which makes unraveling the underlying mechanisms that control cell
migration a daunting challenge. For efficient migration cells require a
mechanism for polarization, so that traction forces are produced in the
direction of motion, while adhesion is released to allow forward migration. To
simplify the study of this process cells have been studied when placed along
one-dimensional tracks, where single cells exhibit both smooth and stick-slip
migration modes. The stick-slip motility mode is characterized by protrusive
motion at the cell front, coupled with slow cell elongation, which is followed
by rapid retractions of the cell back. In this study, we explore a minimal
physical model that couples the force applied on the adhesion bonds to the
length variations of the cell and the traction forces applied by the polarized
actin retrograde flow. We show that the rich spectrum of cell migration
patterns emerges from this model as different \emph{deterministic} dynamical
phases. This result suggests a source for the large cell-to-cell variability
(CCV) in cell migration patterns observed in single cells over time and within
cell populations. The large heterogeneity can arise from small fluctuations in
the cellular components that are greatly amplified due to moving the cells'
internal state across the dynamical phase transition lines. Temporal noise is
shown to drive random changes in the cellular polarization direction, which is
enhanced during the stick-slip migration mode. These results offer a new
framework to explain experimental observations of migrating cells, resulting
from noisy switching between underlying deterministic migration modes.

However, initialization can have some significant influence on the performance

initialization methods on the convergence and accuracy of five optimizers:
differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search
(CS), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). We have
used 19 different test functions with different properties and modalities to
compare the possible effects of initialization, population sizes and the
numbers of iterations. Rigorous statistical ranking tests indicate that 43.37\%
of the functions using the DE algorithm show significant differences for
different initialization methods, while 73.68\% of the functions using both PSO
and CS algorithms are significantly affected by different initialization
methods. The simulations show that DE is less sensitive to initialization,
while both PSO and CS are more sensitive to initialization. In addition, under
the condition of the same maximum number of function evaluations (FEs), the
population size can also have a strong effect. Particle swarm optimization
usually requires a larger population, while the cuckoo search needs only a
small population size. Differential evolution depends more heavily on the
number of iterations, a relatively small population with more iterations can
lead to better results. Furthermore, ABC is more sensitive to initialization,
while such initialization has little effect on GA. Some probability
distributions such as the beta distribution, exponential distribution and
Rayleigh distribution can usually lead to better performance. The implications

sequences (crew pairings) that cover all flights in an airline's highly

the fuel cost, CPOP solutioning is critically important for an airline.
However, CPOP is NP-hard, and tackling it is quite challenging. The literature
suggests, that when the CPOP's scale and complexity is reasonably limited, and
an enumeration of all crew pairings is possible, then Metaheuristics are used,
predominantly Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Else, Column Generation (CG) based
Mixed Integer Programming techniques are used. Notably, as per the literature,
a maximum of 45,000 crew pairings have been tackled by GAs. In a significant
departure, this paper considers over 800 flights of a US-based large airline

domain-knowledge in GA operations, particularly initialization and crossover,
is highlighted through suitable experiments. Finally, the proposed GA's
performance is compared with a CG-based approach (developed in-house by the

cost-quality and run time, it is hoped that this paper will help in better
understanding the strengths and limitations of domain-knowledge-driven

pattern (in k-space) and the reconstruction model, which are customized to the
type of training data, by using an end-to-end learning strategy. We propose a
1D probabilistic undersampling layer, to obtain the optimal undersampling

1D inverse Fourier transform layer, which connects the Fourier domain and the

reducing the geometric collision kernel to the clearance rate, which we model
accurately by superposing turbulent velocity and organism motion. This

software functionality of vehicles, techniques to deliver new software value at
a fast pace are needed. Continuous Experimentation, a practice coming from the
web-based systems world, is one of such techniques. It enables researchers and
developers to use real-world data to verify their hypothesis and steer the
software evolution based on performances and user preferences, reducing the
reliance on simulations and guesswork. Several challenges prevent the verbatim
adoption of this practice on automotive cyber-physical systems, e.g., safety
concerns and limitations from computational resources; nonetheless, the
automotive field is starting to take interest in this technique. This work aims
at demonstrating and evaluating a prototypical Continuous Experimentation
infrastructure, implemented on a distributed computational system housed in a
commercial truck tractor that is used in daily operations by a logistic company
on public roads. The system comprises computing units and sensors, and software
deployment and data retrieval are only possible remotely via a mobile data
connection due to the commercial interests of the logistics company. This study
shows that the proposed experimentation process resulted in the development
team being able to base software development choices on the real-world data
collected during the experimental procedure. Additionally, a set of previously
identified design criteria to enable Continuous Experimentation on automotive
systems was discussed and their validity confirmed in the light of the
presented work.

implementations. Existing methods that synchronize simple sets are mainly based
on compact data structures such as Bloom filter and its variants. However,
these methods are infeasible to synchronize a pair of multisets which allow an
element to appear for multiple times. To this end, in this paper, we propose to
leverage the counting cuckoo filter (CCF), a novel variant of cuckoo filter, to
represent and thereafter synchronize a pair of multisets. The cuckoo filter
(CF) is a minimized hash table that uses cuckoo hashing to resolve collisions.
CF has an array of buckets, each of which has multiple slots to store element
fingerprints. Based on CF, CCF extends each slot as two fields, the fingerprint
field and the counter field. The fingerprint field records the fingerprint of
element which is stored by this slot; while the counter field counts the
multiplicity of the stored element. With such a design, CCF is competent to
represent any multiset. After generating and exchanging the respective CCFs
which represent the local multi-sets, we propose the query-based and the
decoding-based methods to identify the different elements between the given
multisets. The comprehensive evaluation results indicate that CCF outperforms
the counting Bloom filter (CBF) when they are used to synchronize multisets, in
terms of both synchronization accuracy and the space-efficiency, at the cost of
a little higher time-consumption.

namely, neighborhood information-based probabilistic algorithm (NIPA). We also
define a new centrality-based importance measure (IM), which combines the
contribution ratios of the neighbor nodes of each target node and two-hop node
information. Our proposed NIPA has been tested for different network benchmarks
and compared with three other methods: optimal attack strategy (OAS), high
betweenness first (HBF) and high degree first (HDF). Experiments suggest that
the proposed NIPA is most effective among all four methods. In general, NIPA
can identify the most crucial node combination with higher effectiveness, and
the set of optimal key nodes found by our proposed NIPA is much smaller than
that by heuristic centrality prediction. In addition, many previously neglected
weakly connected nodes are identified, which become a crucial part of the newly
identified optimal nodes. Thus, revised strategies for protection are
recommended to ensure the safeguard of network integrity. Further key issues

effects of the delay on the geometry of the reconstructions. If the delay is
chosen too small, the reconstructed dynamics are flattened along the main
diagonal of the embedding space; too-large delays, on the other hand, can
overfold the dynamics. Calculating the curvature of a two-dimensional delay
reconstruction is an effective way to identify these extremes and to find a
middle ground between them: both the sharp reversals at the ends of an
insufficiently unfolded reconstruction and the folds in an overfolded one
create spikes in the curvature. We operationalize this observation by computing
the mean over the Menger curvature of 2D reconstructions for different time
delays. We show that the mean of these values gives an effective heuristic for
choosing the time delay. In addition, we show that this curvature-based
heuristic is useful even in cases where the customary approach, which uses
average mutual information, fails --- e.g., noisy or filtered data.

  Styles","Accepted to CVPR2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples. Existing works have mostly focused on either digital adversarial
examples created via small and imperceptible perturbations, or physical-world
adversarial examples created with large and less realistic distortions that are
easily identified by human observers. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, called Adversarial Camouflage (\emph{AdvCam}), to craft and
camouflage physical-world adversarial examples into natural styles that appear
legitimate to human observers. Specifically, \emph{AdvCam} transfers large
adversarial perturbations into customized styles, which are then ""hidden""
on-target object or off-target background. Experimental evaluation shows that,
in both digital and physical-world scenarios, adversarial examples crafted by
\emph{AdvCam} are well camouflaged and highly stealthy, while remaining
effective in fooling state-of-the-art DNN image classifiers. Hence,
\emph{AdvCam} is a flexible approach that can help craft stealthy attacks to
evaluate the robustness of DNNs. \emph{AdvCam} can also be used to protect
private information from being detected by deep learning systems.

  application to streaming data","12 pages, 11 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Streaming data applications are becoming more common due to the ability of
different information sources to continuously capture or produce data, such as
sensors and social media. Despite recent advances, most visualization
approaches, in particular, multidimensional projection or dimensionality
reduction techniques, cannot be directly applied in such scenarios due to the
transient nature of streaming data. Currently, only a few methods address this
limitation using online or incremental strategies, continuously processing
data, and updating the visualization. Despite their relative success, most of
them impose the need for storing and accessing the data multiple times, not
being appropriate for streaming where data continuously grow. Others do not
impose such requirements but are not capable of updating the position of the
data already projected, potentially resulting in visual artifacts. In this
paper, we present Xtreaming, a novel incremental projection technique that
continuously updates the visual representation to reflect new emerging
structures or patterns without visiting the multidimensional data more than
once. Our tests show that Xtreaming is competitive in terms of global distance
preservation if compared to other streaming and incremental techniques, but it
is orders of magnitude faster. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
methodology that is capable of evolving a projection to faithfully represent
new emerging structures without the need to store all data, providing reliable
results for efficiently and effectively projecting streaming data.

examination of the American Board of Pathology? To achieve this goal, the first
step is to create a visual question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent
is presented with a pathology image together with a question and is asked to
give the correct answer. Our work makes the first attempt to build such a
dataset. Different from creating general-domain VQA datasets where the images
are widely accessible and there are many crowdsourcing workers available and
capable of generating question-answer pairs, developing a medical VQA dataset
is much more challenging. First, due to privacy concerns, pathology images are
usually not publicly available. Second, only well-trained pathologists can
understand pathology images, but they barely have time to help create datasets
for AI research. To address these challenges, we resort to pathology textbooks
and online digital libraries. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract
pathology images and captions from textbooks and generate question-answer pairs
from captions using natural language processing. We collect 32,799 open-ended
questions from 4,998 pathology images where each question is manually checked
to ensure correctness. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset for
pathology VQA. Our dataset will be released publicly to promote research in
medical VQA.

paper, we present MLoc, a novel infrastructure-free localization system to

crowdsourcing, we collect accelerometer,magnetometer and barometer readings on
smartphones, and analyze these sensor data to extract patterns. Through
advanced data manipulating techniques, we build the pattern map for the entire

to demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and robustness of M-Loc. The results
of our field studies in 3 metro lines with 55 stations show that M-Loc achieves
an accuracy of 93% when travelling 3 stations, 98% when travelling 5 stations.

for studying the mental activity and behavior tendencies of users. Through the
analysis of collected Twitter data, models were developed for classifying
drug-related tweets. Using topic pertaining keywords, such as slang and methods
of drug consumption, a set of tweets was generated. Potential candidates were
then preprocessed resulting in a dataset of 3,696,150 rows. The classification
power of multiple methods was compared including support vector machines (SVM),
XGBoost, and convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifiers. Rather than
simple feature or attribute analysis, a deep learning approach was implemented
to screen and analyze the tweets' semantic meaning. The two CNN-based
classifiers presented the best result when compared against other
methodologies. The first was trained with 2,661 manually labeled samples, while
the other included synthetically generated tweets culminating in 12,142
samples. The accuracy scores were 76.35% and 82.31%, with an AUC of 0.90 and
0.91. Additionally, association rule mining showed that commonly mentioned
drugs had a level of correspondence with frequently used illicit substances,
proving the practical usefulness of the system. Lastly, the synthetically
generated set provided increased scores, improving the classification
capability and proving the worth of this methodology.

as images being acquired in a massive way. However, consideration from the
privacy or legislation perspective still demands the need for intellectual
content protection. In this paper, we propose a general deep neural network
(DNN) based watermarking method to fulfill this goal. Instead of training a
neural network for protecting a specific image, we train on an image set and
use the trained model to protect a distinct test image set in a bulk manner.
Respective evaluations both from the subjective and objective aspects confirm
the supremacy and practicability of our proposed method. To demonstrate the
robustness of this general neural watermarking mechanism, commonly used
manipulations are applied to the watermarked image to examine the corresponding
extracted watermark, which still retains sufficient recognizable traits. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a general way to perform
watermarking using DNN. Considering its performance and economy, it is
concluded that subsequent studies that generalize our work on utilizing DNN for
intellectual content protection is a promising research trend.

  Cognitive Radio Networks","This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE TCOM",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cognitive radio is a promising technology to improve spectral efficiency.
However, the secure performance of a secondary network achieved by using
physical layer security techniques is limited by its transmit power and channel
fading. In order to tackle this issue, a cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) communication network is studied by exploiting the high flexibility of a
UAV and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links. The average
secrecy rate of the secondary network is maximized by robustly optimizing the
UAV's trajectory and transmit power. Our problem formulation takes into account
two practical inaccurate location estimation cases, namely, the worst case and
the outage-constrained case. In order to solve those challenging non-convex
problems, an iterative algorithm based on $\mathcal{S}$-Procedure is proposed
for the worst case while an iterative algorithm based on Bernstein-type
inequalities is proposed for the outage-constrained case. The proposed
algorithms can obtain effective suboptimal solutions of the corresponding
problems. Our simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm under the
outage-constrained case can achieve a higher average secrecy rate with a low
computational complexity compared to that of the algorithm under the worst
case. Moreover, the proposed schemes can improve the secure communication
performance significantly compared to other benchmark schemes.
