  Attentive Recovery and Landmark Estimation","Accepted to CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent works based on deep learning and facial priors have succeeded in
super-resolving severely degraded facial images. However, the prior knowledge
is not fully exploited in existing methods, since facial priors such as
landmark and component maps are always estimated by low-resolution or coarsely
super-resolved images, which may be inaccurate and thus affect the recovery
performance. In this paper, we propose a deep face super-resolution (FSR)
method with iterative collaboration between two recurrent networks which focus
on facial image recovery and landmark estimation respectively. In each
recurrent step, the recovery branch utilizes the prior knowledge of landmarks
to yield higher-quality images which facilitate more accurate landmark
estimation in turn. Therefore, the iterative information interaction between
two processes boosts the performance of each other progressively. Moreover, a
new attentive fusion module is designed to strengthen the guidance of landmark
maps, where facial components are generated individually and aggregated
attentively for better restoration. Quantitative and qualitative experimental
results show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSR
methods in recovering high-quality face images.

Grilo","Two combinatorial MA-complete problems","Minor changes; Published in the proceedings of ITCS 2021",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the interest in the complexity class MA, the randomized analog of NP,
just a few natural MA-complete problems are known. The first problem was found
by (Bravyi and Terhal, SIAM Journal of Computing 2009); it was then followed by
(Crosson, Bacon and Brown, PRE 2010) and (Bravyi, Quantum Information and
Computation 2015). Surprisingly, two of these problems are defined using
terminology from quantum computation, while the third is inspired by quantum
computation and keeps a physical terminology. This prevents classical
complexity theorists from studying these problems, delaying potential progress,
e.g., on the NP vs. MA question.
  Here, we define two new combinatorial problems and prove their
MA-completeness. The first problem, ACAC, gets as input a succinctly described
graph, with some marked vertices. The problem is to decide whether there is a
connected component with only unmarked vertices, or the graph is far from
having this property. The second problem, SetCSP, generalizes standard
constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) into constraints involving sets of
strings.
  Technically, our proof that SetCSP is MA-complete is based on an observation
by (Aharonov and Grilo, FOCS 2019), in which it was noted that a restricted
case of Bravyi and Terhal's problem (namely, the uniform case) is already
MA-complete; a simple trick allows to state this restricted case using
combinatorial language. The fact that the first, more natural, problem of ACAC
is MA-hard follows quite naturally from this proof, while the containment of
ACAC in MA is based on the theory of random walks.
  We notice that the main result of Aharonov and Grilo carries over to the
SetCSP problem in a straightforward way, implying that finding a
gap-amplification procedure for SetCSP (as in Dinur's PCP proof) is equivalent
to MA=NP. This provides an alternative new path towards the major problem of
derandomizing MA.

fuel efficiency. However, scalable platooning operations require junction-level
coordination, which has not been well studied. In this paper, we study the
coordination of vehicle platooning at highway junctions. We consider a setting
where CAVs randomly arrive at a highway junction according to a general renewal
process. When a CAV approaches the junction, a system operator determines
whether the CAV will merge into the platoon ahead according to the positions
and speeds of the CAV and the platoon. We formulate a Markov decision process
to minimize the discounted cumulative travel cost, i.e. fuel consumption plus
travel delay, over an infinite time horizon. We show that the optimal policy is
threshold-based: the CAV will merge with the platoon if and only if the
difference between the CAV's and the platoon's predicted times of arrival at
the junction is less than a constant threshold. We also propose two
ready-to-implement algorithms to derive the optimal policy. Comparison with the
classical value iteration algorithm implies that our approach explicitly
incorporating the characteristics of the optimal policy is significantly more
efficient in terms of computation. Importantly, we show that the optimal policy
under Poisson arrivals can be obtained by solving a system of integral
equations. We also validate our results in simulation with Real-time Strategy
(RTS) using real traffic data. The simulation results indicate that the
proposed method yields better performance compared with the conventional
method.

sets in business networks grows and not every neural net transfer is
successful, indicators are needed for its impact on the target performance-its
transferability. We perform an empirical study on a unique real-world use case
comprised of sales data from six different restaurants. We train and transfer
neural nets across these restaurant sales data and measure their
transferability. Moreover, we calculate potential indicators for
transferability based on divergences of data, data projections and a novel

its symmetrized variant under $H_{1n}(\rho)$ , which enables us to construct

  the Spread of a Virus",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, tracking and controlling the spread of a virus is a crucial need for
almost all countries. Doing this early would save millions of lives and help
countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a
virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact
with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority
(e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both
healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although
beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy
concerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this
problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially
privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide
unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set
intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are
recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health
authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the
disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy
individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the
diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed
scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous
contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help
them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure
that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals
and not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show
its efficiency and scalability via simulations.

foundational concept in modern sciences, tying together fields as diverse as
physics, biology, economics, and ecology. Despite it's apparent universality

fields. Recent theoretical work using information theory and network science to
formalize emergence in state-transition networks (causal emergence) has
provided a promising way forward, however the relationship between this new
framework and other well-studied system dynamics is unknown. In this study, we
apply causal emergence analysis to two well-described dynamical systems: the 88
unique elementary cellular automata and the continuous Rossler system in
periodic, critical, and chaotic regimes. We find that emergence, as well as its
component elements (determinism, degeneracy, and effectiveness) vary
dramatically in different dynamical regimes in sometimes unexpected ways. We
conclude that the causal emergence framework provides a rich new area of
research to explore both to theoreticians and natural scientists in many

we propose a structure-preserving super resolution method to alleviate the
above issue while maintaining the merits of GAN-based methods to generate
perceptual-pleasant details. Specifically, we exploit gradient maps of images
to guide the recovery in two aspects. On the one hand, we restore
high-resolution gradient maps by a gradient branch to provide additional

loss which imposes a second-order restriction on the super-resolved images.
Along with the previous image-space loss functions, the gradient-space
objectives help generative networks concentrate more on geometric structures.
Moreover, our method is model-agnostic, which can be potentially used for
off-the-shelf SR networks. Experimental results show that we achieve the best
PI and LPIPS performance and meanwhile comparable PSNR and SSIM compared with

effectively selects learning knowledge from other agents to decide agents'

design and build a generative partial multi-view clustering model, named as
GP-MVC, to address the incomplete multi-view problem by explicitly generating
the data of missing views. The main idea of GP-MVC lies at two-fold. First,
multi-view encoder networks are trained to learn common low-dimensional
representations, followed by a clustering layer to capture the consistent
cluster structure across multiple views. Second, view-specific generative
adversarial networks are developed to generate the missing data of one view
conditioning on the shared representation given by other views. These two steps
could be promoted mutually, where learning common representations facilitates
data imputation and the generated data could further explores the view
consistency. Moreover, an weighted adaptive fusion scheme is implemented to
exploit the complementary information among different views. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets are provided to show the effectiveness of
the proposed GP-MVC over the state-of-the-art methods.

decoders, however most of them rely on some tuning. Given an estimate for the
noise level a common convex approach to recover the signal is basis pursuit
denoising. If the measurement matrix has the robust null space property with
respect to the $\ell_2$-norm, basis pursuit denoising obeys stable and robust
recovery guarantees. In the case of unknown noise levels, nonnegative least
squares recovers non-negative signals if the measurement matrix fulfills an
additional property (sometimes called the $M^+$-criterion). However, if the

guarantees are important, since binary expander matrices are sparse and thus
allow for fast sketching and recovery. We will further present a method to

the local geometric features by considering the information from all input

model extracts the representative geometric features for spatio-angular
upsampling through the global residual learning. Additionally, a refinement
network is followed to further enhance the spatial details by minimizing a
perceptual loss. Compared with previous work, our model is tailored to the rich
structure inherent in the LF, and therefore can reduce the artifacts near

approach enables high-quality reconstruction even in challenging regions and

  Resolution",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-resolved MR angiography (tMRA) has been widely used for dynamic contrast
enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) due to its highly accelerated acquisition. In tMRA, the
periphery of the k-space data are sparsely sampled so that neighbouring frames
can be merged to construct one temporal frame. However, this view-sharing
scheme fundamentally limits the temporal resolution, and it is not possible to
change the view-sharing number to achieve different spatio-temporal resolution
trade-off. Although many deep learning approaches have been recently proposed
for MR reconstruction from sparse samples, the existing approaches usually
require matched fully sampled k-space reference data for supervised training,
which is not suitable for tMRA. This is because high spatio-temporal resolution
ground-truth images are not available for tMRA. To address this problem, here
we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning using optimal transport driven
cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN). In contrast to the
conventional cycleGAN with two pairs of generator and discriminator, the new
architecture requires just a single pair of generator and discriminator, which
makes the training much simpler and improves the performance. Reconstruction
results using in vivo tMRA data set confirm that the proposed method can
immediately generate high quality reconstruction results at various choices of
view-sharing numbers, allowing us to exploit better trade-off between spatial
and temporal resolution in time-resolved MR angiography.

consider the effect of ocean salinity on land ice formation through the
hydrological cycle. We consider two categories of such planets: planets with
deep oceans, but intrinsically high salinities due to the weaker salt removal
process by hydrothermal vents; and planets with shallow oceans, where the
increase in salt content and decrease in ocean area during the onset of
glaciation cause a negative feedback, helping delay the spread of land ice. We
developed a toy climate model of a habitable planet on the verge of an ice age,
using a range of initial salt concentrations. Planets with deep oceans and high
salinity show considerable increase in the time necessary to fill arctic land
with ice sheets, up to 23% considering the maximum salinity range. For planets
with shallow oceans, the effect of intrinsic high salinity is reinforced by the
negative feedback, counteracting positive feedbacks like the ice-albedo and
Croll-Milankovitch perturbations, to the point of effectively terminating land
ice sheet growth rate during the simulated timescale. We also apply this model
to the putative ocean of early Mars, finding intermediate results: salinity
probably did not play a role in the evolution of Mars' climate, considering the
timescale of its ice ages. We conclude that this phenomenon is essentially an
abiotic self-regulation mechanism against ice ages and should be regarded in
the context of habitable planets smaller and drier than the Earth, which may
well represent the bulk of habitable planets.

information-specific accuracy measures, such as the covariate-specific and the

ROCnReg that allows estimating the pooled (unadjusted) ROC curve, the
covariate-specific ROC curve, and the covariate-adjusted ROC curve by different
methods, both from (semi) parametric and nonparametric perspectives and within
Bayesian and frequentist paradigms. From the estimated ROC curve (pooled,
covariate-specific or covariate-adjusted), several summary measures of
accuracy, such as the (partial) area under the ROC curve and the Youden index,
can be obtained. The package also provides functions to obtain ROC-based
optimal threshold values using several criteria, namely, the Youden Index
criterion and the criterion that sets a target value for the false positive
fraction. For the Bayesian methods, we provide tools for assessing model fit
via posterior predictive checks, while model choice can be carried out via
several information criteria. Numerical and graphical outputs are provided for
all methods. The package is illustrated through the analyses of data from an

different mentions of the same real-world entity. Active learning is one way to
address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically
collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the
learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active
learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine
different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The
goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to
what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we
perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from
product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a
variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection
latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer
labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In
fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning
combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our
framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the
learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection
latencies by up to 10x without affecting the quality of the model.

communications to obtain a large amount of information required for navigation
and road safety purposes. This can be achieved through: (i) leveraging
millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies to achieve multi- Gbps data rates, and
(ii) exploiting the temporal and spatial correlation of vehicular contents to
offload a portion of the traffic from the infrastructure via caching.
Characterizing such a system under mmWave directional beamforming, high
vehicular mobility, channel fluctuations, and different caching strategies is a
complex task. In this article, we propose the first stochastic geometry
framework for caching in mmWave V2X networks, which is validated via rigorous
Monte Carlo simulation. In addition to common parameters considered in
stochastic geometry models, our derivations account for caching as well as the
speed and the trajectory of the vehicles. Furthermore, our evaluations provide
interesting design insights: (i) higher base station/vehicle densities does not
necessarily improve caching performance; (ii) although using a narrower beam
leads to a higher SINR, it also reduces the connectivity probability; and (iii)
V2X caching can be an inexpensive way of compensating some of the unwanted
mmWave channel characteristics.

The critical Pr concentration for magnetic moment ordering was determined from
linear extrapolation of the ordering temperature $versus$ $x$ to the lowest

  Analysis of Broadcast Channels","29 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a broadcast channel with $n$ users, where different users receive
different messages, and suppose that each user has to receive $m$ packets. A
quantity of interest here, introduced by Sharif and Hassibi (2006-7) \cite{Sh},
\cite{S-H}, is the (\emph{packet}) \emph{delay} $D_{m,n}$, namely the number of
channel uses required to guarantee that all users will receive $m$ packets. For
the case of a \emph{homogeneous} network, where in each channel use the
transmitter chooses a user at random, i.e. with probability $1/n$, and sends
him$/$her a packet, the same quantity $D_{m,n}$ had already appeared in the
\emph{coupon collector} context, in the works of Newman and Shepp (1960)
\cite{N-S} and of Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi (1961) \cite{E-R}.
  A problem of particular interest in wireless communications, related to the
delay $D_{m,n}$, is to determine its behavior as $n$ and $m$ grow large.
Regarding this problem, Sharif and Hassibi \cite{Sh}, \cite{S-H} managed to
calculated the asymptotics of the mean value $\mathbb{E}[D_{m,n}]$, as $n \to
\infty$, for the cases (a) $m = \ln n$ and (b) $m = (\ln n)^{\rho}$, $\rho >
1$. It is remarkable that Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi \cite{E-R} had, also, raised
the question of the determination of the asymptotic profile of $D_{m,n}$ for

$D_{m,n}$ for large $m$ and $n$ was determined (in great generality) by
Ivchenko \cite{I1} and \cite{I2}.
  In this article we determine the asymptotics of the moments of $D_{m,n}$ for
large $m$ and $n$. We also derive its limiting distribution in the
""supercritical case"" where $m$ grows faster than $\ln n$ and in the ""critical
case"" $m \sim \beta \ln n$, by an approach which is different from the one used
by Ivchenko.

our model allows input variables to directly interact with all latent variables
in a neural network to influence what information the latent variables should
encode in order to generate the output variables accurately. In this setting,
the direct connections between input and latent variables makes the latent
variables partially interpretable; furthermore, the connectivity among the
latent variables in the neural network serves to model their potential causal
relationships to each other and to the output variables. A series of simulation
experiments provide support that the RINN method can successfully recover
latent causal structure between input and output variables.

utilizes the known geometry of vanishing points in the surveilled scene to

simplification of the problem of detecting 3D bounding boxes to detection of 2D

extended experimental evaluation of speed estimation. We test our algorithm on

approach with different configurations to gauge the relationship between
accuracy and computational costs and benefits of 3D bounding box detection over
2D detection. All of the tested configurations run in real-time and are fully
automatic. Compared to other published state-of-the-art fully automatic results
our algorithm reduces the mean absolute speed measurement error by 32% (1.10

  with Additive Information",,,,,"cs.LG math.AT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the strength of Topological Data Analysis has been explored in many
studies on high dimensional numeric data, it is still a challenging task to
apply it to text. As the primary goal in topological data analysis is to define
and quantify the shapes in numeric data, defining shapes in the text is much
more challenging, even though the geometries of vector spaces and conceptual
spaces are clearly relevant for information retrieval and semantics. In this
paper, we examine two different methods of extraction of topological features
from text, using as the underlying representations of words the two most
popular methods, namely word embeddings and TF-IDF vectors. To extract
topological features from the word embedding space, we interpret the embedding
of a text document as high dimensional time series, and we analyze the topology
of the underlying graph where the vertices correspond to different embedding
dimensions. For topological data analysis with the TF-IDF representations, we
analyze the topology of the graph whose vertices come from the TF-IDF vectors
of different blocks in the textual document. In both cases, we apply
homological persistence to reveal the geometric structures under different
distance resolutions. Our results show that these topological features carry
some exclusive information that is not captured by conventional text mining
methods. In our experiments we observe adding topological features to the
conventional features in ensemble models improves the classification results
(up to 5\%). On the other hand, as expected, topological features by themselves
may be not sufficient for effective classification. It is an open problem to
see whether TDA features from word embeddings might be sufficient, as they seem
to perform within a range of few points from top results obtained with a linear
support vector classifier.

degrees. This in particular holds for all pairs of neighbours in regular
graphs, while a lot such pairs can be expected e.g. in many random models. Is
there a universal constant $K$, say $K=3$, such that one may always dispose of
such pairs from any given connected graph with at least three vertices by
blowing its selected edges into at most $K$ parallel edges? This question was
first posed in 2004 by Karo\'nski, {\L}uczak and Thomason, who equivalently
asked if one may assign weights $1,2,3$ to the edges of every such graph so
that adjacent vertices receive distinct weighted degrees - the sums of their
incident weights. This basic problem is commonly referred to as the 1-2-3
Conjecture nowadays, and has been addressed in multiple papers. Thus far it is
known that weights $1,2,3,4,5$ are sufficient [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 100
(2010) 347-349]. We show that this conjecture holds if only the minimum degree
$\delta$ of a graph is large enough, i.e. when $\delta = \Omega(\log\Delta)$,
where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree of the graph. The principle idea
behind our probabilistic proof relies on associating random variables with a
special and carefully designed distribution to most of the vertices of a given
graph, and then choosing weights for major part of the edges depending on the
values of these variables in a deterministic or random manner.

challenges as to how to select from a massive amount of PAs high-quality ones,
how to set an appropriate stop condition for weakly-supervised training, and
how to initialize PAs pertaining to VAAS. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a general Weakly-Supervised framework with a Wise Selection of training

quality-inconsistent PAs, WS^2 employs a learning-based selection to select
effective PAs and a novel region integrity criterion as a stopping condition
for weakly-supervised training. In addition, a 3D-Conv GCAM is devised to adapt
to the VAAS task. Extensive experiments show that WS^2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both weakly-supervised VOS and VAAS tasks and

provides a space selectivity for devices with planar multi-layered structure,
effectively amplifying current noise contributions coming from the most
resistive element of the stack. In the studied solar cells, we observe near
full-scale shot noise, indicating the dominance of noise generation by a single
source, likely the interface between the perovskite and the spiro-OMeTAD
hole-transport layer. We argue that the strong 1/f noise term has contributions
both from the perovskite layer and interfaces. It displays non-ideal dependence
on photocurrent, $S \propto I^{1.4}$ (instead of usual $S \propto I^2$ ), which
is likely due to current-induced halide migration. Finally, we observe
generation-recombination noise. The relaxation time of this process grows
linearly with photocurrent, which allows to attribute this contribution to
bimolecular recombination in the perovskite bulk absorption layer.
Extrapolating our results, we estimate that at the standard 1 sun illumination
the electron-hole recombination time is 5 microseconds.

behaviour. In this work, inspired by a system gap metric from robust control
theory, the $\nu$-gap, we present a data-efficient algorithm for estimating the
similarity between pairs of robot systems. In a multi-source inter-robot
transfer learning setup, we show that this similarity metric allows us to
predict relative transfer performance and thus informatively select experiences
from a source robot before knowledge transfer. We demonstrate our approach with
quadrotor experiments, where we transfer an inverse dynamics model from a real
or virtual source quadrotor to enhance the tracking performance of a target
quadrotor on arbitrary hand-drawn trajectories. We show that selecting
experiences based on the proposed similarity metric effectively facilitates the
learning of the target quadrotor, improving performance by 62% compared to a
poorly selected experience.

  We give a (constant pass, arbitrary order) streaming algorithm that can
circumvent this lower bound for \emph{low degeneracy graphs}. The degeneracy,
$\kappa$, is a nuanced measure of density, and the class of constant degeneracy
graphs is immensely rich (containing planar graphs, minor-closed families, and
preferential attachment graphs). We design a streaming algorithm with space
complexity $\widetilde{O}(m\kappa/T)$. For constant degeneracy graphs, this
bound is $\widetilde{O}(m/T)$, which is significantly smaller than both
$m^{3/2}/T$ and $m/\sqrt{T}$. We complement our algorithmic result with a

a family of protocols we call $1\Delta$ that have near-optimal good-case

approach for distance-based classification using mixture distributions (DCMD).
The method aims to improve classification performance when using microbiome
community data, where the predictors are composed of sparse and heterogeneous
count data. This approach models the inherent uncertainty in sparse counts by
estimating a mixture distribution for the sample data, and representing each
observation as a distribution, conditional on observed counts and the estimated
mixture, which are then used as inputs for distance-based classification. The
method is implemented into a k-means and k-nearest neighbours framework and we
identify two distance metrics that produce optimal results. The performance of
the model is assessed using simulations and applied to a human microbiome
study, with results compared against a number of existing machine learning and
distance-based approaches. The proposed method is competitive when compared to
the machine learning approaches and showed a clear improvement over commonly

noisy quantum computers can provide computational advantage over classical
computers. Specifically, we study noisy random circuit sampling in one
dimension (or 1D noisy RCS) as a simple model for exploring the effects of
noise on the computational power of a noisy quantum device. In particular, we
simulate the real-time dynamics of 1D noisy random quantum circuits via matrix
product operators (MPOs) and characterize the computational power of the 1D
noisy quantum system by using a metric we call MPO entanglement entropy. The
latter metric is chosen because it determines the cost of classical MPO
simulation. We numerically demonstrate that for the two-qubit gate error rates
we considered, there exists a characteristic system size above which adding
more qubits does not bring about an exponential growth of the cost of classical
MPO simulation of 1D noisy systems. Specifically, we show that above the
characteristic system size, there is an optimal circuit depth, independent of
the system size, where the MPO entanglement entropy is maximized. Most
importantly, the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy is bounded by a
constant that depends only on the gate error rate, not on the system size. We
also provide a heuristic analysis to get the scaling of the maximum achievable
MPO entanglement entropy as a function of the gate error rate. The obtained
scaling suggests that although the cost of MPO simulation does not increase
exponentially in the system size above a certain characteristic system size, it
does increase exponentially as the gate error rate decreases, possibly making
classical simulation practically not feasible even with state-of-the-art
supercomputers.

zero applied flux, corresponding to zero phase winding, and a gapped region
with a discrete zero-energy state around one applied flux quantum, {\Phi}_0 =

capacity of the core; the well-relaxed core can be directly compared to the

experience a rapid change in mean field potential through stellar- and heat-

directions due to the opposite Berry curvatures under an applied electric
field, leading to a large OHE. This is in complete contrast to the
inversion-symmetric systems, where the orbital moment is induced only by the
external electric field. We show that the valley-orbital locking as well as the
OHE both appear even in the absence of the spin-orbit coupling. The non-zero
spin-orbit coupling leads to the well-known valley-spin locking and the spin
Hall effect, which we find to be weak, making the TMDCs particularly suitable
for direct observation of the OHE, with potential application in {\it

input set $S$ of $n$ points in ${\mathbb R}^d$ in a differentially private
manner. This question, which is trivial non-privately, turns out to be quite
deep when imposing differential privacy. In particular, it is known that the
input points must reside on a fixed finite subset $G\subseteq{\mathbb R}^d$,
and furthermore, the size of $S$ must grow with the size of $G$. Previous works
focused on understanding how $n$ needs to grow with $|G|$, and showed that
$n=O\left(d^{2.5}\cdot8^{\log^*|G|}\right)$ suffices (so $n$ does not have to
grow significantly with $|G|$). However, the available constructions exhibit
running time at least $|G|^{d^2}$, where typically $|G|=X^d$ for some (large)
discretization parameter $X$, so the running time is in fact $\Omega(X^{d^3})$.
  In this paper we give a differentially private algorithm that runs in
$O(n^d)$ time, assuming that $n=\Omega(d^4\log X)$. To get this result we study
and exploit some structural properties of the Tukey levels (the regions $D_{\ge
k}$ consisting of points whose Tukey depth is at least $k$, for $k=0,1,...$).
In particular, we derive lower bounds on their volumes for point sets $S$ in
general position, and develop a rather subtle mechanism for handling point sets
$S$ in degenerate position (where the deep Tukey regions have zero volume). A
naive approach to the construction of the Tukey regions requires $n^{O(d^2)}$
time. To reduce the cost to $O(n^d)$, we use an approximation scheme for
estimating the volumes of the Tukey regions (within their affine spans in case
of degeneracy), and for sampling a point from such a region, a scheme that is
based on the volume estimation framework of Lov\'asz and Vempala (FOCS 2003)
and of Cousins and Vempala (STOC 2015). Making this framework differentially

1) Though the density information is demonstrated to be an important clue, they
all use it in an implicit way and have not exploited it in depth. 2) For
feature learning, they often learn the feature embedding based on the single
data sample and ignore the neighborhood information. 3) For label-propagation
based pseudo-label generation, it is often done offline and difficult to be
end-to-end trained with feature learning. Motivated by these limitations, this
paper proposes to solve the SSL problem by building a novel density-aware
graph, based on which the neighborhood information can be easily leveraged and
the feature learning and label propagation can also be trained in an end-to-end
way. Specifically, we first propose a new Density-aware Neighborhood
Aggregation(DNA) module to learn more discriminative features by incorporating
the neighborhood information in a density-aware manner. Then a novel
Density-ascending Path based Label Propagation(DPLP) module is proposed to
generate the pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples more efficiently according to
the feature distribution characterized by density. Finally, the DNA module and
DPLP module evolve and improve each other end-to-end.

dynamic on-off architecture is adopted under a sophisticated path loss model
incorporating both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight transmissions.
Generally, this paper focuses on the successful download probability (SDP) of
user equipments (UEs) from small-cell base stations (SBSs) that cache the
requested files under various caching strategies. To be more specific, the SDP
is first analyzed using stochastic geometry theory, by considering the
distribution of such two-tier UEs and SBSs as Homogeneous Poisson Point
Processes. Second, an optimized caching strategy (OCS) is proposed to maximize
the average SDP. Third, the performance limits of the average SDP are developed
for the popular caching strategy (PCS) and the uniform caching strategy (UCS).
Finally, the impacts of the key parameters, such as the SBS density, the cache
size, the exponent of Zipf distribution and the height of aerial user, are
investigated on the average SDP. The analytical results indicate that the UCS
outperforms the PCS if the SBSs are sufficiently dense, while the PCS is better
than the UCS if the exponent of Zipf distribution is large enough. Furthermore,
the proposed OCS is superior to both the UCS and PCS.

representations that capture document-level dependencies on the source side. We
further propose two different methods to learn and integrate such
contextualized sentence embeddings into NMT: a joint training method that
jointly trains an NMT model with the source context prediction model and a
pre-training & fine-tuning method that pretrains the source context prediction
model on a large-scale monolingual document corpus and then fine-tunes it with
the NMT model. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-German translation
show that both methods can substantially improve the translation quality over a
strong document-level Transformer baseline.

guarantee on the type I error rate whenever the distribution of the samples

increasing popularity and empirical success, theoretical properties of the
permutation test, especially its power, have not been fully explored beyond
simple cases. In this paper, we attempt to partly fill this gap by presenting a
general non-asymptotic framework for analyzing the minimax power of the
permutation test. The utility of our proposed framework is illustrated in the
context of two-sample and independence testing under both discrete and
continuous settings. In each setting, we introduce permutation tests based on
U-statistics and study their minimax performance. We also develop exponential
concentration bounds for permuted U-statistics based on a novel coupling idea,
which may be of independent interest. Building on these exponential bounds, we
introduce permutation tests which are adaptive to unknown smoothness parameters
without losing much power. The proposed framework is further illustrated using
more sophisticated test statistics including weighted U-statistics for
multinomial testing and Gaussian kernel-based statistics for density testing.
Finally, we provide some simulation results that further justify the
permutation approach.

representations of nodes, which can be applied to various real-life
applications such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction.
Although significant progress has been made on this problem in recent years,
several important challenges remain, such as how to properly capture temporal
information in evolving networks. In practice, most networks are continually
evolving. Some networks only add new edges or nodes such as authorship
networks, while others support removal of nodes or edges such as internet data
routing. If patterns exist in the changes of the network structure, we can
better understand the relationships between nodes and the evolution of the
network, which can be further leveraged to learn node representations with more
meaningful information. In this paper, we propose the Embedding via Historical
Neighborhoods Aggregation (EHNA) algorithm. More specifically, we first propose
a temporal random walk that can identify relevant nodes in historical
neighborhoods which have impact on edge formations. Then we apply a deep
learning model which uses a custom attention mechanism to induce node
embeddings that directly capture temporal information in the underlying feature
representation. We perform extensive experiments on a range of real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach in
the network reconstruction task and the link prediction task.

towards the solar surface, and is often observed above solar active regions.
They are generally thought to be produced by thermal instability in the corona
and their lifetime is limited by the time they take to reach the chromosphere.
Although the rain usually fragments into smaller clumps while falling down,
their specific spatial and temporal scales remain unclear. In addition, the
observational signatures of the impact of the rain with the chromosphere have
not been clarified yet. In this study, we investigate the time evolution of
velocity and intensity of coronal rain above a sunspot by analyzing coronal
images obtained by the AIA onboard the SDO satellite as well as the Slit-Jaw
Images (SJIs) and spectral data taken by the IRIS satellite. We identify dark
and bright threads moving towards the umbra in AIA images and in SJIs,
respectively, and co-spatial chromospheric intensity enhancements and redshifts
in three IRIS spectra, Mg II k 2796 Angstrom, Si IV 1394 Angstrom, and C II
1336 Angstrom. The intensity enhancements and coronal rain redshifts occur
almost concurrently in all the three lines, which clearly demonstrates the
causal relationship with coronal rain. Furthermore, we detect bursty intensity
variation with a timescale shorter than 1 minute in Mg II k, Si IV and C II
spectra, indicating that a length scale of rain clumps is about 2.7 Mm if we
multiply the typical time scale of the busty intensity variation at 30 sec by
the rain velocity at 90 $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. Such rapid enhancements in the
IRIS lines are excited within a time lag of 5.6 sec limited by the temporal
resolution. These temporal and spatial scales may reflect the physical
processes responsible for the rain morphology, and are suggestive of
instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz.

prices for consumption and incentives for flexibility, and allows for
probabilistic allocation of power to loads. Considering each load as

These data can often
arrive in chunks/batches. Traditional static clustering algorithms are not
suitable for dynamic datasets, i.e., when data arrive in streams of
chunks/batches. If we apply a conventional clustering technique over the
combined dataset, then every time a new batch of data comes, the process can be
slow and wasteful. Moreover, it can be challenging to store the combined
dataset in memory due to its ever-increasing size. As a result, various
incremental clustering techniques have been proposed. These techniques need to
efficiently update the current clustering result whenever a new batch arrives,
to adapt the current clustering result/solution with the latest data. These
techniques also need the ability to detect concept drifts when the clustering
pattern of a new batch is significantly different from older batches.
Sometimes, clustering patterns may drift temporarily in a single batch while
the next batches do not exhibit the drift. Therefore, incremental clustering
techniques need the ability to detect a temporary drift and sustained drift. In
this paper, we propose an efficient incremental clustering algorithm called
UIClust. It is designed to cluster streams of data chunks, even when there are
temporary or sustained concept drifts. We evaluate the performance of UIClust
by comparing it with a recently published, high-quality incremental clustering
algorithm. We use real and synthetic datasets. We compare the results by using
well-known clustering evaluation criteria: entropy, sum of squared errors

allows us to use these eignets to solve inverse problems such as finding a good
approximation to the probability law that governs the data, and finding the
local smoothness of the target function near different points in the domain. In
fact, we develop a wavelet-like representation using our eignets. Our theory is
applicable to approximation on a general locally compact metric measure space.
Special examples include approximation by periodic basis functions on the
torus, zonal function networks on a Euclidean sphere (including smooth ReLU
networks), Gaussian networks, and approximation on manifolds. We construct

events in a video sequence. Anomaly detection methods based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) typically leverage proxy tasks, such as reconstructing
input video frames, to learn models describing normality without seeing
anomalous samples at training time, and quantify the extent of abnormalities
using the reconstruction error at test time. The main drawbacks of these
approaches are that they do not consider the diversity of normal patterns
explicitly, and the powerful representation capacity of CNNs allows to
reconstruct abnormal video frames. To address this problem, we present an
unsupervised learning approach to anomaly detection that considers the
diversity of normal patterns explicitly, while lessening the representation
capacity of CNNs. To this end, we propose to use a memory module with a new
update scheme where items in the memory record prototypical patterns of normal
data. We also present novel feature compactness and separateness losses to
train the memory, boosting the discriminative power of both memory items and
deeply learned features from normal data. Experimental results on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which
outperforms the state of the art.

type have been obtained. Moreover, when those bounds are achieved, related

Bishop-type volume comparison proven in [8,11] and the Escobar-type eigenvalue
comparisons for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of the Laplacian proven in
[22], for manifolds with radial sectional curvature upper bound, under suitable
preconditions, we can show that the first nonzero Wentzell eigenvalue of the
geodesic ball on these manifolds can be bounded from above by that of the
geodesic ball with the same radius in the model space (i.e., spherically
symmetric manifolds) determined by the curvature bound. Besides, this upper
bound for the first nonzero Wentzell eigenvalue can be achieved if and only if
these two geodesic balls are isometric with each other. This conclusion can be
seen as an extension of eigenvalue comparisons in [7,22]. Second, we prove a
general Reilly formula for the drifting Laplacian, and then use the formula to
give a sharp lower bound for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of the
drifting Laplacian on compact smooth metric measure spaces with boundary and
convex potential function. Besides, this lower bound can be achieved only for
the Euclidean ball of the prescribed radius. This conclusion gives a partial

Recently domain-adversarial training (DAT) has shown promising capacity to
learn a domain-invariant feature space by reversing the gradient propagation of
a domain classifier. However, DAT is still vulnerable in several aspects
including (1) training instability due to the overwhelming discriminative
ability of the domain classifier in adversarial training, (2) restrictive
feature-level alignment, and (3) lack of interpretability or systematic
explanation of the learned feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel
Max-margin Domain-Adversarial Training (MDAT) by designing an Adversarial
Reconstruction Network (ARN). The proposed MDAT stabilizes the gradient
reversing in ARN by replacing the domain classifier with a reconstruction
network, and in this manner ARN conducts both feature-level and pixel-level
domain alignment without involving extra network structures. Furthermore, ARN
demonstrates strong robustness to a wide range of hyper-parameters settings,
greatly alleviating the task of model selection. Extensive empirical results
validate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art domain alignment
methods. Moreover, reconstructing adapted features reveals the domain-invariant
feature space which conforms with our intuition.

Radon measure coincides with the Lebesgue measure, the corresponding solution

Evolutionary robotics aims to solve this by optimizing both the control and
body (morphology) of a robot, allowing adaptation to internal, as well as
external factors. Most work in this field has been done in physics simulators,
which are relatively simple and not able to replicate the richness of
interactions found in the real world. Solutions that rely on the complex

this paper, we rely solely on real-world evaluations and apply evolutionary
search to yield combinations of morphology and control for our mechanically
self-reconfiguring quadruped robot. We evolve solutions on two distinct
physical surfaces and analyze the results in terms of both control and

high-performing and diverse morphology-controller configurations by adapting
both control and body to the different properties of the physical environments.
We additionally find that morphology and control vary with statistical
significance between the environments. Moreover, we observe that our method
allows for morphology and control parameters to transfer to previously-unseen

allocation algorithm is required, in particular, the energy fairness issue
among IoT sensors has been a critical challenge of the WPT system. In this
paper, considering energy fairness as the minimum received energy of all energy
poverty IoT sensors (EPISs), we allocate orthogonal frequency bands to several
EPISs and transfer the RF power on each orthogonal band, using energy
beamforming. Based on the energy poverty, we propose orthogonal frequency bands
assignment rule, granting the priority to the EPISs with less received energy.
We also formulate two transmission power allocation problems, incorporated the
nonlinear logarithm-energy harvesting (EH) model. First, the total received
power maximization (TRPM) problem is presented and solved by combining the
well-known Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the modified water-filling

proposes a method of specifying the scope of the solution for the objective
function defined by the sum of monotonous functions. In numerical results,
assuming the mobility of EPISs by the one-dimensional random walk model, the
effectiveness of the mobility of EPISs on the minimum received energy of all

adversary, which selects the worst-case distribution. To systematically adjust
the conservativeness of our method, the opponent receives a penalty
proportional to the amount, measured with the Wasserstein metric, of deviation
from the empirical distribution. In the finite-horizon case, using a Riccati
equation, we derive a closed-form expression of the unique optimal policy and
the opponent's policy that generates the worst-case distribution. This result
is then extended to the infinite-horizon setting by identifying conditions
under which the Riccati recursion converges to the unique positive
semi-definite solution to an associated algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). The
resulting optimal policy is shown to stabilize the expected value of the system
state under the worst-case distribution. We also discuss that our method can be

Eliminating (DVBE) network that constructs two complementary visual

second-order visual statistics to compact the semantic-free representation, and
design an adaptive margin Softmax to maximize inter-class divergences. Thus,
the semantic-free representation becomes discriminative enough to not only
predict seen class accurately but also filter out unseen images, i.e., domain
detection, based on the predicted class entropy. For unseen images, we
automatically search an optimal semantic-visual alignment architecture, rather
than manual designs, to predict unseen classes. With accurate domain detection,
the biased recognition problem towards the seen domain is significantly
reduced. Experiments on five benchmarks for classification and segmentation
show that DVBE outperforms existing methods by averaged 5.7% improvement.

temperature increase in the disk midplane, a convectively unstable entropy
profile, and a surface emissivity equivalent to a viscous heating of $\alpha

authentication has been corroborated to be an effective method for establishing

technologies for smartphones have also become increasingly sophisticated and
popular. But it is noteworthy that the application potential of palmprints for
smartphones is seriously underestimated. Studies in the past two decades have
shown that palmprints have outstanding merits in uniqueness and permanence, and
have high user acceptance. However, currently, studies specializing in
palmprint verification for smartphones are still quite sporadic, especially
when compared to face- or fingerprint-oriented ones. In this paper, aiming to
fill the aforementioned research gap, we conducted a thorough study of
palmprint verification on smartphones and our contributions are twofold. First,
to facilitate the study of palmprint verification on smartphones, we
established an annotated palmprint dataset named MPD, which was collected by
multi-brand smartphones in two separate sessions with various backgrounds and
illumination conditions. As the largest dataset in this field, MPD contains
16,000 palm images collected from 200 subjects. Second, we built a DCNN-based
palmprint verification system named DeepMPV+ for smartphones. In DeepMPV+, two
key steps, ROI extraction and ROI matching, are both formulated as learning
problems and then solved naturally by modern DCNN models. The efficiency and
efficacy of DeepMPV+ have been corroborated by extensive experiments. To make
our results fully reproducible, the labeled dataset and the relevant source
codes have been made publicly available at

replacing centralizers of elementary abelian $p$-subgroups with components of
Lannes' $T$-functor, and utilizing the techniques of unstable algebras over the
Steenrod algebra, we are able to generalize Kuhn's result to a large class of
connected Noetherian unstable algebras. We show how this generalizes Kuhn's
result to more general classes of groups, such as groups of finite virtual
cohomological dimension, profinite groups, and Kac-Moody groups. In fact, our
results apply much more generally, for example, we establish results for
$p$-local compact groups in the sense of Broto-Levi-Oliver, for connected
$H$-spaces with Noetherian mod $p$ cohomology, and for the Borel equivariant
cohomology of a compact Lie group acting on a manifold. Along the way we
establish several results of independent interest. For example, we formulate

to provide trustworthy artificial intelligence techniques for practical
applications. Existing studies typically involve linking semantic concepts to
units or layers of DNNs, but fail to explain the inference process. In this
paper, we introduce neural architecture disentanglement (NAD) to fill the gap.
Specifically, NAD learns to disentangle a pre-trained DNN into
sub-architectures according to independent tasks, forming information flows
that describe the inference processes. We investigate whether, where, and how
the disentanglement occurs through experiments conducted with handcrafted and
automatically-searched network architectures, on both object-based and
scene-based datasets. Based on the experimental results, we present three new
findings that provide fresh insights into the inner logic of DNNs. First, DNNs
can be divided into sub-architectures for independent tasks. Second, deeper
layers do not always correspond to higher semantics. Third, the connection type
in a DNN affects how the information flows across layers, leading to different
disentanglement behaviors. With NAD, we further explain why DNNs sometimes give
wrong predictions. Experimental results show that misclassified images have a

(FGVC). Recent methods have shown that the matrix power normalization can
stabilize the second-order information in bilinear features, but some problems,
e.g., redundant information and over-fitting, remain to be resolved. In this
paper, we propose an efficient Multi-Objective Matrix Normalization (MOMN)
method that can simultaneously normalize a bilinear representation in terms of
square-root, low-rank, and sparsity. These three regularizers can not only
stabilize the second-order information, but also compact the bilinear features
and promote model generalization. In MOMN, a core challenge is how to jointly
optimize three non-smooth regularizers of different convex properties. To this
end, MOMN first formulates them into an augmented Lagrange formula with
approximated regularizer constraints. Then, auxiliary variables are introduced
to relax different constraints, which allow each regularizer to be solved
alternately. Finally, several updating strategies based on gradient descent are
designed to obtain consistent convergence and efficient implementation.
Consequently, MOMN is implemented with only matrix multiplication, which is
well-compatible with GPU acceleration, and the normalized bilinear features are
stabilized and discriminative. Experiments on five public benchmarks for FGVC
demonstrate that the proposed MOMN is superior to existing normalization-based
methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The code is available:

devising simple and compact conditional domain adversarial training methods. We
first revisit the simple concatenation conditioning strategy where features are
concatenated with output predictions as the input of the discriminator. We find
the concatenation strategy suffers from the weak conditioning strength. We
further demonstrate that enlarging the norm of concatenated predictions can
effectively energize the conditional domain alignment. Thus we improve
concatenation conditioning by normalizing the output predictions to have the
same norm of features, and term the derived method as Normalized OutpUt
coNditioner~(NOUN). However, conditioning on raw output predictions for domain
alignment, NOUN suffers from inaccurate predictions of the target domain. To
this end, we propose to condition the cross-domain feature alignment in the
prototype space rather than in the output space. Combining the novel
prototype-based conditioning with NOUN, we term the enhanced method as
PROtotype-based Normalized OutpUt coNditioner~(PRONOUN). Experiments on both
object recognition and semantic segmentation show that NOUN can effectively
align the multi-modal structures across domains and even outperform
state-of-the-art domain adversarial training methods. Together with
prototype-based conditioning, PRONOUN further improves the adaptation
performance over NOUN on multiple object recognition benchmarks for UDA.

sometimes stalled in nuclear rings, recent observations reaching 10pc scale

gun evidence of fueling, within a randomly oriented nuclear molecular disk. AGN
feedback is also observed, in the form of narrow and collimated molecular
outflows, which point towards the radio mode, or entrainment by a radio jet.
Precession has been observed in a molecular outflow, indicating the precession
of the radio jet. One of the best candidates for precession is the
Bardeen-Petterson effect at small scale, which exerts a torque on the accreting
material, and produces an extended disk warp.
  The misalignment between the inner and large-scale disk, enhances the
coupling of the AGN feedback, since the jet sweeps a large part of the

large number of individuals, both to determine the line of treatment as well as
to know the spread of infection to plan containment, mitigation and future
responses. However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck,
especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where
the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills
and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost
of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for
poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a
test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single
test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample
likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It
thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore,
requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat
increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two
patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test
kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.

task-specific expert models, subsequently aggregated using a concealed
unsupervised user prior. Aggregation avoids retraining, whereas the user prior
conceals sensitive raw user data, and grants unsupervised adaptation. Second,
local user-adaptation incorporates a domain adaptation point of view, adapting
regularizing batch normalization parameters to the user data. We explore
various empirical user configurations with different priors in categories and a
tenfold of transforms for MIT Indoor Scene recognition, and classify numbers in
a combined MNIST and SVHN setup. Extensive experiments yield promising results

are restricted to a single parameter, connected to a concordance measure such
as Kendall's tau. This often leads to poor statistical fits, particularly in
the joint tails, and can sometimes even limit the ability to model concordance
or tail dependence mathematically. This work suggests outer power (OP)
transformations of Archimedean generators to overcome these limitations. The
copulas generated by OP-transformed generators can, for example, allow one to
capture both a given concordance measure and a tail dependence coefficient
simultaneously. For exchangeable OP-transformed ACs, a formula for computing
tail dependence coefficients is obtained, as well as two feasible OP AC
estimators are proposed and their properties studied by simulation. For
hierarchical extensions of OP-transformed ACs, a new construction principle,
efficient sampling and parameter estimation are addressed. By simulation,
convergence rate and standard errors of the proposed estimator are studied.
Excellent tail fitting capabilities of OP-transformed hierarchical AC models
are demonstrated in a risk management application. The results show that the OP
transformation is able to improve the statistical fit of exchangeable ACs,
particularly of those that cannot capture upper tail dependence or strong
concordance, as well as the statistical fit of hierarchical ACs, especially in
terms of tail dependence and higher dimensions. Given how comparably simple it
is to include OP transformations into existing exchangeable and hierarchical AC
models, this transformation provides an attractive trade-off between
computational effort and statistical improvement.

further extended Internet of Things (IoT) from the sole ""things"" aspect to the
omnipotent role of ""intelligent connection of things"". Meanwhile, the concept
of internet of everything (IoE) is presented as such an omnipotent extension of
IoT. However, the IoE realization meets critical challenges including the
restricted network coverage and the limited resource of existing network
technologies. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted
significant attentions attributed to their high mobility, low cost, and
flexible deployment. Thus, UAVs may potentially overcome the challenges of IoE.
This article presents a comprehensive survey on opportunities and challenges of
UAV-enabled IoE. We first present three critical expectations of IoE: 1)
scalability requiring a scalable network architecture with ubiquitous coverage,
2) intelligence requiring a global computing plane enabling intelligent things,
3) diversity requiring provisions of diverse applications. Thereafter, we
review the enabling technologies to achieve these expectations and discuss four
intrinsic constraints of IoE (i.e., coverage constraint, battery constraint,
computing constraint, and security issues). We then present an overview of
UAVs. We next discuss the opportunities brought by UAV to IoE. Additionally, we
introduce a UAV-enabled IoE (Ue-IoE) solution by exploiting UAVs's mobility, in
which we show that Ue-IoE can greatly enhance the scalability, intelligence and
diversity of IoE. Finally, we outline the future directions in Ue-IoE.

disjunctive manner. That allows us to formulate linear constraints to account
for the non-holonomy and collision avoidance. These constraints are
approximations, for which we introduce the theory. We show the applicability in
two benchmark scenarios and prove the feasibility by solving the same models

elusive, requiring the investigation of single crystals. In this work,
high-quality p-type Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Bi2 single crystals have been grown by using
a self-flux method. The electrical resistivity \r{ho} of Mg3Bi2 single crystal
displays an anisotropy with \r{ho} in-plane twice larger than out-of-plane. The

Things network underlaying on the spectrum licensed to a primary cellular
network. In the considered network, the impoverished channel sensing/probing
capability and computational resource on the IoT devices make them difficult to
acquire the detailed Channel State Information (CSI) for the shared multiple
channels. In practice, the unknown patterns of the primary users' transmission
activities and the time-varying CSI (e.g., due to small-scale fading or device
mobility) also cause stochastic changes in the channel quality. Decentralized
IoT links are thus expected to learn channel conditions online based on partial
observations, while acquiring no information about the channels that they are
not operating on. They also have to reach an efficient, collision-free solution
of channel allocation with limited coordination. Our study maps this problem
into a contextual multi-player, multi-armed bandit game, and proposes a purely
decentralized, three-stage policy learning algorithm through trial-and-error.
Theoretical analyses shows that the proposed scheme guarantees the IoT links to
jointly converge to the social optimal channel allocation with a sub-linear
(i.e., polylogarithmic) regret with respect to the operational time.
Simulations demonstrate that it strikes a good balance between efficiency and
network scalability when compared with the other state-of-the-art decentralized

practitioners. With a need for more large-scale approaches, automated methods
using machine learning have gained traction. However, detection performance
still implies considerable error rates. Findings from other domains suggest
that hybrid human-machine integrations could offer a viable path in deception
detection tasks. Method: We collected a corpus of truthful and deceptive
answers about participants' autobiographical intentions (n=1640) and tested
whether a combination of supervised machine learning and human judgment could
improve deception detection accuracy. Human judges were presented with the
outcome of the automated credibility judgment of truthful and deceptive
statements. They could either fully overrule it (hybrid-overrule condition) or
adjust it within a given boundary (hybrid-adjust condition). Results: The data
suggest that in neither of the hybrid conditions did the human judgment add a
meaningful contribution. Machine learning in isolation identified truth-tellers
and liars with an overall accuracy of 69%. Human involvement through
hybrid-overrule decisions brought the accuracy back to the chance level. The
hybrid-adjust condition did not deception detection performance. The
decision-making strategies of humans suggest that the truth bias - the tendency

symbolic names of networked devices to their corresponding Internet Protocol

a DNS service definition, it was becoming apparent that DNS implementations
will need to comply with some modified DNS behaviour. One such modification is
that DNS continues to use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to transmit DNS
payloads that are longer than 512 bytes. Until the emergence of the Extension
DNS (EDNS) specification, DNS servers would switch over from UDP to
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) if the response payload was larger than 512
bytes. With the new EDNS capability, it was required that DNS replies would
continue to provide responses as UDP datagrams even though the response was
larger than 512 bytes. To the author's best knowledge, there are no academic
articles dealing with the assessment of the DNS servers against EDNS
specification. This paper examines the level of compatibility for a number of
public DNS servers for some popular internet domains. It also explores
behaviour of some contemporary DNS implementations such as Microsoft Windows

the block fading channel whereas most constructions involve complex
iterative-calculation. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework to
analyze the error performance of polar codes in the case of block mapping and
random mapping. For both the mappings, by introducing the new concept, named
split polar spectrum, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of
polarized channel which explicitly reveals the relationship between the
diversity order L and the block-wise weight distribution of the codeword. For
the special case L=2 in the block mapping, we design the enumeration algorithm
to calculate the exact split polar spectrum based on the general MacWilliams
identities. For arbitrary diversity order in the random mapping, with the help
of uniform interleaving, we derive the approximate split polar spectrum by
combining the polar spectrum and the probability of fading pattern for a
specific weight. Furthermore, we propose the design criteria to construct polar
codes over the block fading channel. The full diversity criterion is the
primary target so as to achieve the diversity gain and the product distance
criterion requires to maximize the product of the block-wise Hamming distance
whereby obtain the coding gain. Guided by these design criteria, the
construction metric, named polarized diversity weight (PDW) is proposed to
design the polar codes in both mappings. Such a simple metric can construct
polar codes with similar or better performance over those based on traditional
methods in block fading channel.

today's wirelessly connected world, which implies that the physical signals are
available for malicious interceptors to snoop within a 5-10 m distance, also
increasing interference and reducing channel capacity. Recently,
Electro-quasistatic (EQS) human body communication was demonstrated which
utilizes the human body's conductive properties to communicate without
radiating the signals outside the body. Previous experiments showed that an
attack with an antenna is unsuccessful, more than 1 cm of the body surface and
15 cm of an EQS-HBC device. However, since this is a new communication
modality, it calls for investigation of new attack modalities - that can
potentially exploit the physics utilized in the EQS-HBC to break the system. In
this study, we present a novel attack method for EQS-HBC devices, using the
body of the attacker itself as a coupling surface and capacitive inter-body
coupling between the user and the attacker. We develop theoretical
understanding backed by experimental results for inter-body coupling, as a
function of distance between the subjects. We utilize this newly developed
understanding to design EQS-HBC transmitters to minimize the attack distance
through inter-body coupling as well as minimize the interference among multiple
EQS-HBC users due to inter-body coupling. This understanding allows us to
develop more secure and robust EQS-HBC based body area networks in the future.

The recent great development of stochastic algorithmic tools focused
significantly onto proximal gradient iterations, in order to find an efficient

finding optimal predictors by minimizing regularized risk is largely understood
for simple regularizations such as $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norms. However, more complex
properties desired for the predictor necessitates highly difficult regularizers

through an interacting medium. This process is often simulated by the use of
the Monte Carlo method, which involves the probabilistic determination and
tracking of simulated photon packages. In the regime of high optical depths,
this approach encounters difficulties since a proper representation of the
various physical processes can only be achieved by considering high numbers of
simulated photon packages. As a consequence, the demand for computation time
rises accordingly and thus practically puts a limit on the optical depth of
models that can be simulated. Here we present a method that aims to solve the
problem of high optical depths in dusty media, which relies solely on the use
of unbiased Monte Carlo radiative transfer. For that end, we identified and
precalculated repeatedly occuring and simulated processes, stored their outcome
in a multidimensional cumulative distribution function, and immediately
replaced the basic Monte Carlo transfer during a simulation by that outcome.
During the precalculation, we generated emission spectra as well as deposited
energy distributions of photon packages traveling from the center of a sphere
to its rim. We carried out a performance test of the method to confirm its
validity and gain a boost in computation speed by up to three orders of
magnitude. We then applied the method to a simple model of a viscously heated
circumstellar disk, and we discuss the necessity of finding a solution for the
optical depth problem with regard to a proper temperature calculation. We find
that the impact of an incorrect treatment of photon packages in highly
optically thick regions extents even to optically thin regions, thus, changing
the overall observational appearance of the disk.

robustness of admissibility with respect to bounded linear perturbations and we
use these answers to study the semilinear problem and its linearization. Partly
as an application of the material developed up to that point, and partly as a
justification of existing work on local bifurcations in models taking the form
of abstract DDEs, we compare the construction of center manifolds in the
non-sun-reflexive case with known results by Diekmann and Van Gils for the
sun-reflexive case. We show that a systematic use of the space
$X^{\odot\times}$ facilitates a generalization of the existing results with
relatively little effort. In this context we also give sufficient conditions
for the existence of appropriate spectral decompositions of $X$ and

response approach. With different manners, a supercell can be introduced in
both methods. Unless the supercell is large enough, the interpolated phonon
property highly depends on the shape and size of the supercell and the imposed
periodicity could give unphysical results that can be easily overlooked. Along

addressed by NaCl, PbTiO$_3$, monolayer CrI$_3$, and twisted bilayer graphene
as examples for illustrating the effects of the imposed supercell periodicity.
To diminish the unphysical effects, a simple method of partitioning force
constants, which relies only on the translational symmetry and interatomic
distances, is demonstrated to be able to deliver reasonable results. The
partition method is also compatible with the mixed-space approach for
describing LO-TO splitting. The proper partition is especially important for
studying moderate-size systems with low symmetry, such as two-dimensional
materials on substrates, and useful for the implementation of phonon

no echoes in the existing data. The null search gives a constraint comparable
to that from galactic wide binaries, though the methods of redshift inference
from dispersion measure would impact a little. Furthermore, we make an improved
forecast basing on the distributions of real data for the ongoing and upcoming

will be detected. In such a case, the parameter space of COs can be pinned down
very well since the lens mass can be directly determined through the observed

simultaneously in NLTE. In this work we take into account how departures from
LTE in one element can affect others through changes in the opacities due to

departures from LTE in the low-energy states, can impact the NLTE populations
of Ca, leading to abundance corrections as large as 0.07 dex. The differences
in the derived abundances between the single-element and the multi-element
cases can exceed those between the single-element NLTE and an LTE analysis,
warning that this is not always a second-order effect. By means of detailed
tests for three stars with reliable atmospheric parameters (Arcturus, Procyon
and the Sun) we conclude that our NLTE calculations provide abundance
corrections in the optical up to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.7 dex for Ca, Na and K, but LTE
is a good approximation for Mg. In the H-band, NLTE corrections are much
smaller, under 0.1 dex. The derived NLTE abundances in the optical and in the
IR are consistent. For all four elements, in all three stars, NLTE line
profiles fit better the observations than the LTE counterparts. For elements
where over-ionisation is an important NLTE mechanism are likely affected by
departures from LTE in Mg . Special care must be taken with the collisions
adopted for high-lying levels when calculating NLTE profiles of lines in the

For weakly interacting assembly the equilibrium magnetization is shown to
deviate significantly from the Langevin law in the range of moderate and large
magnetic fields due to the influence of magnetic anisotropy energy. For dense
assemblies with noticeable influence of the magneto-dipole interaction a
significant dependence of the initial susceptibility on the assembly density is
revealed. The difference between the initial susceptibility and the
corresponding Langevin susceptibility can serve as an indication of the
influence of the magneto-dipole interaction on the assembly properties. A new
self-consistent approach is developed to explain the effect of mutual

random magnetic field acting on magnetic nanoparticles are calculated at

based on singlereference theory, and therefore has a relatively straightforward
formulation and modest computational complexity. The main difference from
established methods is the bivariational formulation, in which independent
parameterizations of the wavefunction (ket) and its complex conjugate (bra) are
made. Importantly, this allows manifest multiplicative separability (exact in
the extended bivar-MRECC version of the method, and approximate otherwise),
while preserving polynomial scaling of the working equations. A feature of the
bivariational principle is that the formal bra and ket references can be
included as bivariational parameters, which eliminates much of the bias towards
the formal reference. A pilot implementation is described, and extensive
benchmark calculations on several standard problems are performed. The results
from the bivar-MRCC method are comparable to established state-specific

collisions between the tagged particle and fluid particles is rather small. At
such a time scale, we should explicitly consider individual collision events
between the tagged particle and the surrounding fluid particles. In this study,
we analyzed the short-time dynamics of the tagged particle in an ideal gas,
where we do not have static nor hydrodynamic correlations between fluid
particles. We performed event-driven hard sphere simulations and show that the
short-time dynamics of the tagged particle is correlated even under such an
idealized situation. Namely, the velocity autocorrelation function becomes
negative when the tagged particle is relatively light and the fluid density is
relatively high. This result can be attributed to the dynamical correlation
between collision events. To investigate the physical mechanism, which causes
the dynamical correlation, we analyzed the correlation between successive
collision events. We found that the tagged particle can collide with the same

channel is a core problem of information theory. One of the most important
aspects of real world communication, e.g. via wifi, is that it may happen at
varying levels of information transfer. The bandwidth-limited channel models
this phenomenon. In this study we consider learning coding with the
bandwidth-limited channel (BWLC). Recently, neural communication models such as
variational autoencoders have been studied for the task of source compression.
We build upon this work by studying neural communication systems with the BWLC.
Specifically,we find three modelling choices that are relevant under expected
information loss. First, instead of separating the sub-tasks of compression
(source coding) and error correction (channel coding), we propose to model both
jointly. Framing the problem as a variational learning problem, we conclude
that joint systems outperform their separate counterparts when coding is
performed by flexible learnable function approximators such as neural networks.
To facilitate learning, we introduce a differentiable and computationally
efficient version of the bandwidth-limited channel. Second, we propose a design
to model missing information with a prior, and incorporate this into the

introducing auxiliary latent variables in the decoder. Experimental results
justify the validity of our design decisions through improved distortion and

moving groups (MGs) have been identified, but there has been less systematic
effort to quantify or characterise young stars that do not belong to previously
identified MGs. Using a kinematically unbiased sample of 225 lithium-rich stars
within 100 pc, we find that only $50 \pm 10$ per cent of young ($\lesssim 125$
Myr), low-mass ($0.5<M/M_{\odot}<1.0$) stars, are kinematically associated with
known MGs. Whilst we find some evidence that six of the non-MG stars may be
connected with the Lower Centaurus-Crux association, the rest form a
kinematically ""hotter"" population, much more broadly dispersed in velocity, and
with no obvious concentrations in space. The mass distributions of the MG
members and non-MG stars is similar, but the non-MG stars may be older on
average. We briefly discuss several explanations for the origin of the non-MG

learning algorithms. A key and often overlooked aspect of this problem is to
try to make the adversarial noise magnitude as large as possible to enhance the

on higher levels of noise possible. We next evaluate this idea rigorously on
MNIST ($\epsilon$ up to $\approx 0.40$) and CIFAR10 ($\epsilon$ up to $\approx
32/255$) datasets assuming the $\ell_{\infty}$ attack model. Additionally, in
order to establish the limits of $\epsilon$ in which the learning is feasible,
we study the optimal robust classifier assuming full access to the joint data

on kernel density estimation (KDE), the most popular nonparametric density
estimation approach developed in modern statistics, to overcome issues
surrounding binning of LFs. One challenge in applying KDE to LFs is how to
treat the boundary bias problem, since astronomical surveys usually obtain
truncated samples predominantly due to the flux-density limits of surveys. We
use two solutions, the transformation KDE method ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{t}}$),
and the transformation-reflection KDE method ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tr}}$) to
reduce the boundary bias. We develop a new likelihood cross-validation
criterion for selecting optimal bandwidths, based on which, the posterior
probability distribution of bandwidth and transformation parameters for
$\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{t}}$ and $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ are derived within a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. The simulation result shows
that $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{t}}$ and $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ perform better
than the traditional binned method, especially in the sparse data regime around
the flux-limit of a survey or at the bright-end of the LF. To further improve
the performance of our KDE methods, we develop the transformation-reflection
adaptive KDE approach ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tra}}$). Monte Carlo simulations
suggest that it has a good stability and reliability in performance, and is
around an order of magnitude more accurate than using the binned method. By
applying our adaptive KDE method to a quasar sample, we find that it achieves
estimates comparable to the rigorous determination by a previous work, while
making far fewer assumptions about the LF. The KDE method we develop has the
advantages of both parametric and non-parametric methods.

following characteristics: 1) amplitude similar than in 2015 and lower than in
2005; 2) duration less than one year as in previous events; 3) rise (decline)
speed of 0.018 (0.031) mag/day, which is different from previous cases; 4) a
gradual blueing of the [$g-r$] color is observed over time, while the [$r-i$]
color remains roughly unchanged; 5) with few exceptions, the near-infrared
lines (mainly HI recombination) are the same observed in 2015; 6) the mass
accretion rate peaks at Macc $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ Msun/yr, and decreases in about a
month down to a few 10$^{-8}$ Msun/yr. Our analysis shows that the comparison
of data from different outbursts of the same source is a non-trivial exercise,

be the sites of moon formation as well as an intermediate reservoir of gas that
feeds the growth of the gas giant. How the physical properties of such CPDs are
affected by the planetary mass and the overall opacity is relatively poorly
understood. In order to clarify this, we use the global radiation hydrodynamics
code FARGOCA, with a grid structure that allows resolving the planetary
gravitational potential sufficiently well for a CPD to form. We then study the
gas flows and density/temperature structures that emerge as a function of
planet mass, opacity and potential depth. Our results indicate interesting
structure formation for Jupiter-mass planets at low opacities, which we
subsequently analyse in detail. Using an opacity level that is 100 times lower
than that of ISM dust, our Jupiter-mass protoplanet features an envelope that
is sufficiently cold for a CPD to form, and a free-fall region separating the
CPD and the circumstellar disc emerges. Interestingly, this free-fall region
appears to be a result of supersonic erosion of outer envelope material, as
opposed to the static structure formation that one would expect at low
opacities. Our analysis reveals that the planetary spiral arms seem to pose a
significant pressure barrier that needs to be overcome through radiative
cooling in order for gas to free-fall onto the CPD. The circulation inside the
CPD is near-keplerian and modified by the presence of CPD spiral arms. For high
opacities we recover results from the literature, finding an essentially
featureless hot envelope. With this work, we demonstrate the first simulation

analyzing the facial expressions and, in some cases, also the body pose. Some
of these methods work remarkably well in specific settings. However, their
performance is limited in natural, unconstrained environments. Psychological
studies show that the scene context, in addition to facial expression and body
pose, provides important information to our perception of people's emotions.
However, the processing of the context for automatic emotion recognition has
not been explored in depth, partly due to the lack of proper data. In this
paper we present EMOTIC, a dataset of images of people in a diverse set of
natural situations, annotated with their apparent emotion. The EMOTIC dataset
combines two different types of emotion representation: (1) a set of 26
discrete categories, and (2) the continuous dimensions Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance. We also present a detailed statistical and algorithmic analysis of
the dataset along with annotators' agreement analysis. Using the EMOTIC dataset
we train different CNN models for emotion recognition, combining the

their environment, which capture both static elements of the scene such as road
layout as well as dynamic elements such as other cars and pedestrians.
Generating these map representations on the fly is a complex multi-stage
process which incorporates many important vision-based elements, including
ground plane estimation, road segmentation and 3D object detection. In this
work we present a simple, unified approach for estimating maps directly from
monocular images using a single end-to-end deep learning architecture. For the
maps themselves we adopt a semantic Bayesian occupancy grid framework, allowing
us to trivially accumulate information over multiple cameras and timesteps. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating against several
challenging baselines on the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets, and show that we
are able to achieve a relative improvement of 9.1% and 22.3% respectively
compared to the best-performing existing method.

masses $|m_s| \gg H$ can be well described by a single-field EFT with an
imaginary sound speed $c_s$. Among other features, they predict an exponential
enhancement of the spectrum of scalar perturbations which however is not
inherited by non-Gaussianities. In this work, I complete the calculation of the
trispectrum in this EFT by considering the contributions from the contact
interaction and the exchange diagram. While for most shapes the trispectrum is
approximately constant, I find that for certain configurations where all the
momenta collapse to a line the trispectrum is proportional to $(m_s/H)^5$ for
the contact interaction and to $(m_s/H)^6$ for the exchange diagram, as
anticipated by previous work. I also discuss the UV sensitivity of the results
and argue why the EFT provides a good order of magnitude estimate. In the end,
I confront the different predictions for the scalar spectrum against
observations. In models where the entropic mass is proportional to a positive
power of the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$, like in hyperinflation, the
spectrum grows on small scales and becomes constrained by the overproduction of
primordial black holes. Imposing such constraint jointly with the correct
amplitude and spectral tilt at CMB scales excludes a large set of potentials.
Only those where the spectral tilt is controlled by $m_s \delta/H \sim {\cal
O}(-0.01)$, where $\delta=\dot{\epsilon}/(\epsilon H)$ is the second slow-roll
parameter, are likely observationally viable. Finally, the constraints on the
bispectrum generically impose $|c_s m_s|/H \lesssim 10-20$ while those on the
trispectrum give a weaker bound when using the constraints on
$g_\text{NL}^{\dot{\sigma}^4}$ as a proxy. For hyperinflation the bispectrum
bound translates into $\omega \lesssim 11$ where $\omega$ is the turning rate
in field-space.

exoplanetary atmospheres. We mostly focus on the sub- to super-Earth domain,
although these methods are applicable to all types of exoplanets. We consider
both thermal and nonthermal loss processes. The type of thermal loss mechanism
depends on so-called escape parameter $\beta$, which is the ratio of the
gravitational energy of a particle to its thermal energy. While $\beta$ is
decreasing, an exoplanet switches from classical Jeans to modified Jeans and
finally to blow-off escape mechanisms. During blow-off the majority of the
atmospheric particles dispose of enough energy to escape the planet's gravity
field. This leads to extreme gas losses.
  Although nonthermal losses never exceed blow-off escape, they are of
significant importance for planets with relatively weak Jeans-type escape. From
the diversity of nonthermal escape mechanisms, in the present chapter we focus
on ion pickup and discuss the importance of other loss mechanisms. The general
conclusion of the chapter is, that escape processes strongly shape the
evolution of the exoplanets and determine, if the planet loses its atmosphere
due to erosion processes or, on the contrary, stays as mini-Neptune type body,
which can probably not be considered as a potential habitat as we know it.

decades. A number of previous works have shown that it performs well in
measuring the similarities of individuals given a set of correctly labeled
pairwise data by domain experts. These important and precisely-labeled pairwise
data are often highly sensitive in real world (e.g., patients similarity). This
paper studies, for the first time, how pairwise information can be leaked to
attackers during distance metric learning, and develops differential pairwise
privacy (DPP), generalizing the definition of standard differential privacy,
for secure metric learning. Unlike traditional differential privacy which only
applies to independent samples, thus cannot be used for pairwise data, DPP
successfully deals with this problem by reformulating the worst case.
Specifically, given the pairwise data, we reveal all the involved correlations
among pairs in the constructed undirected graph. DPP is then formalized that
defines what kind of DML algorithm is private to preserve pairwise data. After
that, a case study employing the contrastive loss is exhibited to clarify the
details of implementing a DPP-DML algorithm. Particularly, the sensitivity
reduction technique is proposed to enhance the utility of the output distance
metric. Experiments both on a toy dataset and benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed scheme achieves pairwise data privacy without compromising the output
performance much (Accuracy declines less than 0.01 throughout all benchmark
datasets when the privacy budget is set at 4).

are completely different. Unfortunately, this tends to be the case for current
visual feature representations of the same scene across varying seasons or
times of day. The aim of this paper is to provide a dense feature
representation that can be used to perform localization, sparse matching or
image retrieval, regardless of the current seasonal or temporal appearance.
  Recently, there have been several proposed methodologies for deep learning
dense feature representations. These methods make use of ground truth
pixel-wise correspondences between pairs of images and focus on the spatial
properties of the features. As such, they don't address temporal or seasonal
variation. Furthermore, obtaining the required pixel-wise correspondence data
to train in cross-seasonal environments is highly complex in most scenarios.
  We propose Deja-Vu, a weakly supervised approach to learning season invariant
features that does not require pixel-wise ground truth data. The proposed
system only requires coarse labels indicating if two images correspond to the
same location or not. From these labels, the network is trained to produce
""similar"" dense feature maps for corresponding locations despite environmental
changes. Code will be made available at:

deuterated molecules and a search for lithium hydride, 7LiH, at redshift z=0.89
in the spiral galaxy intercepting the line of sight to the quasar PKS1830-211.
We used ALMA to observe several submillimeter lines of ND, NH2D, and HDO, and
their related isotopomers NH2, NH3, and H2^18O, in absorption against the
southwest image of the quasar, allowing us to derive XD/XH abundance ratios.
The absorption spectra mainly consist of two distinct narrow velocity
components for which we find remarkable differences. One velocity component
shows XD/XH abundances that is about 10 times larger than the primordial
elemental D/H ratio, and no variability of the absorption profile during the
time span of our observations. [...] The second component has XD/XH abundances
that are 100 times larger than the primordial D/H ratio, a deepening of the
absorption by a factor of two within a few months, and a rich chemical
composition, with relative enhancements of N2H+, CH3OH, SO2, and complex
organic molecules. We therefore speculate that this component is associated
with the analog of a Galactic dark cloud, while the first component is likely
more diffuse. Our search for the 7LiH (1--0) line was unsuccessful and we
derive an upper limit 7LiH/H2 = 4 x 10^-13 (3sigma) in the z=0.89 absorber
toward PKS1830-211. Besides, with ALMA archival data, we could not confirm the
previous tentative detections of this line in the z=0.68 absorber toward
B0218+357; we derive an upper limit 7LiH/H2 = 5 x 10^-11 (3sigma), although
this is less constraining than our limit toward PKS1830-211. We conclude that,
as in the Milky Way, only a tiny fraction of lithium nuclei are possibly bound
in LiH in these absorbers at intermediate redshift.

CAD software produces. Objective: To generate a database of annotated computed

positive rate of current algorithms and to develop new methods that improve
such metrics. Methods: 91 Computed tomography pulmonary angiography scans were
annotated by at least one radiologist by segmenting all pulmonary emboli
visible on the study. 20 annotated CTPAs were open to the public in the form of
a medical image analysis challenge. 20 more were kept for evaluation purposes.
51 were made available post-challenge. 8 submissions, 6 of them novel, were

sensitivity vs. false positives per scan curve. Results: The best algorithms
achieved a per-embolus sensitivity of 75% at 2 false positives per scan (fps)

mostly led by the computer science community with the goal of developing better
machine learning applications, mainly focused on predictive modeling. However,
economic, management, and technology forecasting research has so far been
hesitant to apply predictive modeling techniques and workflows. In this paper,
we introduce a machine learning (ML) approach to quantitative analysis geared
towards optimizing the predictive performance, contrasting it with standard
practices inferential statistics, which focus on producing good parameter
estimates. We discuss the potential synergies between the two fields against
the backdrop of this, at first glance, target-incompatibility. We discuss
fundamental concepts in predictive modeling, such as out-of-sample model
validation, variable and model selection, generalization, and hyperparameter
tuning procedures. We are providing a hands-on predictive modeling introduction
for a quantitative social science audience while aiming at demystifying
computer science jargon. We use the illustrative example of patent quality
estimation - which should be a familiar topic of interest in the Scientometrics
community - guiding the reader through various model classes and procedures for
data pre-processing, modeling, and validation. We start off with more familiar
easy to interpret model classes (Logit and Elastic Nets), continues with less
familiar non-parametric approaches (Classification Trees, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosted Trees), and finally presents artificial neural network
architectures, first a simple feed-forward and then a deep autoencoder geared
towards rare-event prediction.

simulation tools have been extended to cover secondary interactions from muons

the effective volume of neutrino detectors. Also, muon and tau neutrinos can
create several detectable showers, with the result that double signatures do
not constitute an exclusive signature for tau neutrinos. We also find that the
background of atmospheric muons from cosmic rays is non-negligible for in-ice
arrays and that an air shower veto should be considered helpful for radio
detectors.

function subject to a cardinality constraint, which, due to its numerous
applications, has recently been studied in various computational models. We
consider a clean multi-player model that lies between the offline and streaming
model, and study it under the aspect of one-way communication complexity. Our
model captures the streaming setting (by considering a large number of
players), and, in addition, two player approximation results for it translate
into the robust setting. We present tight one-way communication complexity
results for our model, which, due to the above-mentioned connections, have
multiple implications in the data stream and robust setting.
  Even for just two players, a prior information-theoretic hardness result
implies that no approximation factor above $1/2$ can be achieved in our model,
if only queries to feasible sets are allowed. We show that the possibility of
querying infeasible sets can actually be exploited to beat this bound, by
presenting a tight $2/3$-approximation taking exponential time, and an
efficient $0.514$-approximation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first example where querying a submodular function on infeasible sets leads to
provably better results. Through the above-mentioned link to the robust
setting, both of these algorithms improve on the current state-of-the-art for
robust submodular maximization, showing that approximation factors beyond $1/2$
are possible. Moreover, exploiting the link of our model to streaming, we
settle the approximability for streaming algorithms by presenting a tight
$1/2+\varepsilon$ hardness result, based on the construction of a new family of
coverage functions. This improves on a prior $1-1/e+\varepsilon$ hardness and
matches, up to an arbitrarily small margin, the best known approximation
algorithm.

cycle of the jet activity in Active Galactic Nuclei. Due to a sharp
discontinuity of the GHz spectral index distribution within its lobes, the
radio galaxy 3C388 has for long being claimed to be a peculiar example of AGN
with multi-epoch activity. In this work we have performed, for the first time,
a spatially resolved study of the radio spectrum of this source down to
MHz-frequencies, aimed at investigating its radiative age and duty cycle. We
have used new low frequency observations at 144 MHz performed with LOFAR and at
350 MHz performed with the VLA combined with archival data at higher
frequencies. We find that the spectral indices in the lower frequency range
144-614 MHz have flatter values ($\sim$0.55-1.14) than those observed in the
higher frequency range 1400-4850 MHz ($\sim$0.75-1.57) but follow the same
distribution across the lobes, with a systematic steepening towards the edges.
However, the spectral shape throughout the source is not uniform and often
deviates from standard models. This suggests that mixing of different particle
populations is occurring, although it remains difficult to understand whether
this is caused by observational limitations (insufficient spatial resolution
and/or projection effects) or by the intrinsic presence of multiple particle
populations, possibly related to the two different outbursts. By using
single-injection radiative models we compute that the total source age is
$\lesssim$80 Myr and that the duty cycle is about $\rm t_{on}/t_{tot}\sim$ 60%,
which is enough to prevent the intracluster medium from cooling according to
X-ray estimates. While to date the radio spectral distribution of 3C388 remains
a rare case among radio galaxies, upcoming multi-frequency surveys will soon

In this paper, we propose the RPM-Net -- a less sensitive to initialization and
more robust deep learning-based approach for rigid point cloud registration. To
this end, our network uses the differentiable Sinkhorn layer and annealing to
get soft assignments of point correspondences from hybrid features learned from
both spatial coordinates and local geometry. To further improve registration
performance, we introduce a secondary network to predict optimal annealing

be tuned to ferromagnetic in some combinations of heterostructures, dictated by
d orbital occupations. Strong interlayer magnetic coupling can be realized if
the medial p electrons are delocalized and the d bands of magnetic atoms are
near the Fermi level. The knowledge on the interlayer coupling mechanism

the plasma is calculated from the density and temperature using CHIANTI tables
and the intensity is then determined by integration along the line of sight. We
consider several different profiles for the radial density and temperature
profiles, each of which are constrained by the observational data alone with no
further physical assumptions. We demonstrate the method first by applying it to
a quiet region of the corona, and then use it as the background component of a
model including coronal holes, allowing the plasma densities and temperatures
inside and outside the hole to be estimated. We compare our results with
differential emission measure (DEM) inversions. More accurate estimates for the
coronal density and temperature profiles have the potential to help constrain
plasma properties such as the magnetic field strength when used in combination
with methods such as seismology.

different tasks. With more drones in the sky, the risk of accidents rises,
sparkling the need for conflict management solutions. Aircraft use a system
called Automatic Dependent System-Broadcast (ADS-B) to continuously broadcast
their position and speed but this system is not suitable for small drones
because of its cost, complexity and capacity limitations.
  Broadband technologies such as Wi-Fi beacons are more suited for such dense
scenarios, and they also offer the benefit of wide availability and low cost.
The main challenges for Wi-Fi are (a) the multi-channel nature of the
technology makes transmitter and receiver coordination difficult, and (b)
standard chipsets are not designed for frequent broadcast transmission and
reception. In this paper, we propose and analyze a multi-channel position
broadcast solution that is robust against jamming and achieves a reliable
location update within 125~ms. In addition, we implement the protocol on
inexpensive embedded Wi-Fi modules and analyze the hardware limitations of such
devices. Our conclusions are that even on the simplest Wi-Fi chipsets, our
protocol can be implemented to achieve a realistic location broadcast solution
that still perfectly mimics simulation and analytical results on the lab bench
and still can achieve approximately 4~message/s throughput at a distance of
900~m on flying UAVs.

the metaprism can also be designed so that it focuses the signal towards a
specific position depending on the subcarrier, provided that it is in the
near-field, with consequent path-loss reduction. A critical discussion is also
presented about the path-loss gain obtainable from metaprisms and, more
generally, from metasurfaces. The numerical results show that this solution is
surprisingly effective in extending the coverage in areas experiencing severe

We introduce a simple yet effective crossover model driven by the search
history (abbreviated as SHX). In particular, the search history is clustered
and each cluster is assigned a score for SHX. In essence, the proposed SHX is a
data-driven method which exploits the search history to perform offspring
selection after the offspring generation. Since no additional fitness
evaluations are needed, SHX is favorable for the tasks with limited budget or
expensive fitness evaluations. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of
SHX over 4 benchmark functions. Quantitative results show that our SHX can
significantly enhance the performance of RCGA, in terms of accuracy.

generating numerical invariants, namely: (1) template-based methods, and (2)
recurrence-based methods. A template-based method begins with a template that
contains unknown quantities, and finds invariants that match the template by
extracting and solving constraints on the unknowns. A disadvantage of
template-based methods is that they require fixing the set of terms that may
appear in an invariant in advance. This disadvantage is particularly prominent
for non-linear invariant generation, because the user must supply maximum
degrees on polynomials, bases for exponents, etc. On the other hand,
recurrence-based methods are able to find sophisticated non-linear mathematical
relations, including polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms, because such
relations arise as the solutions to recurrences. However, a disadvantage of
past recurrence-based invariant-generation methods is that they are primarily
loop-based analyses: they use recurrences to relate the pre-state and
post-state of a loop, so it is not obvious how to apply them to a recursive
procedure, especially if the procedure is non-linearly recursive (e.g., a
tree-traversal algorithm). In this paper, we combine these two approaches and
obtain a technique that uses templates in which the unknowns are functions
rather than numbers, and the constraints on the unknowns are recurrences. The
technique synthesizes invariants involving polynomials, exponentials, and
logarithms, even in the presence of arbitrary control-flow, including any
combination of loops, branches, and (possibly non-linear) recursion. For
instance, it is able to show that (i) the time taken by merge-sort is $O(n

adversarial examples, even if the attacker is only given black-box query access
to the model. The main drawback of these attacks is that: (i) they are
query-inefficient, as they rely on iteratively applying random transformations
to the input malware; and (ii) they may also require executing the adversarial
malware in a sandbox at each iteration of the optimization process, to ensure
that its intrusive functionality is preserved. In this paper, we overcome these
issues by presenting a novel family of black-box attacks that are both
query-efficient and functionality-preserving, as they rely on the injection of
benign content - which will never be executed - either at the end of the
malicious file, or within some newly-created sections. Our attacks are
formalized as a constrained minimization problem which also enables optimizing
the trade-off between the probability of evading detection and the size of the
injected payload. We empirically investigate this trade-off on two popular
static Windows malware detectors, and show that our black-box attacks can
bypass them with only few queries and small payloads, even when they only
return the predicted labels. We also evaluate whether our attacks transfer to
other commercial antivirus solutions, and surprisingly find that they can
evade, on average, more than 12 commercial antivirus engines. We conclude by
discussing the limitations of our approach, and its possible future extensions

recent years, it has benefited from the powerful features learnt by deep neural
networks, and handcrafted features specialized for abnormality detectors.
However, these approaches with large complexity still have limitations in
handling long term sequential data (e.g., videos), and their learnt features do
not thoroughly capture useful information. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
have been shown to be capable of robustly dealing with temporal data in long
term sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel version of Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU), called Single Tunnelled GRU for abnormality detection.
Particularly, the Single Tunnelled GRU discards the heavy weighted reset gate
from GRU cells that overlooks the importance of past content by only favouring
current input to obtain an optimized single gated cell model. Moreover, we
substitute the hyperbolic tangent activation in standard GRUs with sigmoid
activation, as the former suffers from performance loss in deeper networks.
Empirical results show that our proposed optimized GRU model outperforms
standard GRU and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks on most metrics for
detection and generalization tasks on CUHK Avenue and UCSD datasets. The model
is also computationally efficient with reduced training and testing time over
standard RNNs.

lines covered by the ALMA observations at a $\sim$3$^{\prime\prime}$ angular
resolution ($\sim$0.02 pc) reveal that the spatially unresolved non-thermal
motions are predominantly subsonic and transonic, a condition analogous to that
found in low-mass star-forming molecular clouds. The observed supersonic
non-thermal velocity dispersions in massive star forming regions, often
reported in the literature, might be significantly biased by poor spatial
resolutions that broaden the observed line widths due to unresolved motions
within the telescope beam. Our 3~mm continuum image resolves 49 dense cores,
whose masses range from 0.17 to 14 $M_{\odot}$. The majority of them are
resolved with multiple velocity components. Our analyses of these gas velocity
components find an anti-correlation between the gas mass and the virial
parameter. This implies that the more massive structures tend to be more
gravitationally unstable. Finally, we find that the external pressure in the

roots is more challenging than above-ground data collection. Thus, an effective
super-resolution (SR) algorithm is desired for overcoming resolution
limitations of sensors, reducing storage space requirements, and boosting the
performance of later analysis, such as automatic segmentation. We propose a SR
framework for enhancing images of plant roots by using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). We compare three alternatives for training the SR model: i)
training with non-plant-root images, ii) training with plant-root images, and
iii) pretraining the model with non-plant-root images and fine-tuning with
plant-root images. We demonstrate on a collection of publicly available
datasets that the SR models outperform the basic bicubic interpolation even
when trained with non-root datasets. Also, our segmentation experiments show
that high performance on this task can be achieved independently of the SNR.
Therefore, we conclude that the quality of the image enhancement depends on the
application.

memory occupation), such an approach guarantees high performance, scalability,
and availability. Unfortunately, such an approach requires to send information
to be processed (e.g., signals, images, positions, sounds, videos) to the
Cloud, hence having potentially catastrophic-impacts on the privacy of users.
This paper introduces a novel distributed architecture for
deep-learning-as-a-service that is able to preserve the user sensitive data
while providing Cloud-based machine and deep learning services. The proposed
architecture, which relies on Homomorphic Encryption that is able to perform
operations on encrypted data, has been tailored for Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) in the domain of image analysis and implemented through a
client-server REST-based approach. Experimental results show the effectiveness
of the proposed architecture.

the technology of logical relations. The approach taken is that each form of
bisimulation corresponds to an algebraic structure derived from a transition
system, and the general result is that a relation $R$ between two transition
systems on state spaces $S$ and $T$ is a bisimulation if and only if the
derived algebraic structures are in the logical relation automatically
generated from $R$. We show that this approach works for the original
Park-Milner bisimulation and that it extends to weak bisimulation, and
branching and semi-branching bisimulation. The paper concludes with a
discussion of probabilistic bisimulation, where the situation is slightly more
complex, partly owing to the need to encompass bisimulations that are not just

increase adherence to daily self-report in longitudinal epidemiological

operationalized theoretical constructs in the light of design constraints, user

systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

building blocks for CNNs. They are motivated by quantitative analyses of kernel

from which we derive efficient implementations using only standard layers.
Moreover, our approach provides a thorough theoretical derivation,
interpretation, and justification for the application of depthwise separable
convolutions (DSCs) in general, which have become the basis of many modern
network architectures. Ultimately, we reveal that DSC-based architectures such
as MobileNets implicitly rely on cross-kernel correlations, while our BSConv
formulation is based on intra-kernel correlations and thus allows for a more
efficient separation of regular convolutions. Extensive experiments on
large-scale and fine-grained classification datasets show that BSConvs clearly
and consistently improve MobileNets and other DSC-based architectures without
introducing any further complexity. For fine-grained datasets, we achieve an
improvement of up to 13.7 percentage points. In addition, if used as drop-in
replacement for standard architectures such as ResNets, BSConv variants also
outperform their vanilla counterparts by up to 9.5 percentage points on

lines are reported in this paper. First, a boundary condition is derived, which
states that the fluid near a solid wall must have a certain density $\rho_{0}$
depending on the solid's properties. Unlike previous derivations, the one
presented here is based on the same physics as the DIM itself and does not
require additional assumptions. Second, asymptotic estimates are used to check
a conjecture lying at the foundation of the DIM, as well as all other models of
contact lines: that liquid-vapor interfaces are nearly isothermal. It turns out
that, for water, they are not -- although, for a more viscous fluid, they can
be. The non-isothermaility occurs locally, near the interface, but can still
affect the contact-line dynamics. Third, the DIM coupled with a realistic
equation of state for water is used to compute the dependence of the surface
tension $\sigma$ on the temperature $T$, which agrees well with the empiric
$\sigma(T)$. Fourth, the same framework is used to compute the static contact
angle of a water-vapor interface. It is shown that, with increasing
temperature, the contact angle becomes either $180^{\circ}$ (perfect
hydrophobicity) or $0^{\circ}$ (perfect hydrophilicity), depending on whether
$\rho_{0}$ matches the density of saturated vapor or liquid, respectively. Such
behavior presumably occurs in all fluids, not just water, and for all
sufficiently strong variations of parameters, not just that of the temperature
-- as corroborated by existing observations of drops under variable electric
field.

triangulation is a maximal straight-line embedded plane graph on P. A partial
triangulation is a full triangulation of some subset P' of P containing all
extreme points in P. A bistellar flip on a partial triangulation flips an edge
(an edge flip), removes a non-extreme point of degree 3, or adds a point in P \
P' as vertex of degree 3. The bistellar flip graph has all partial
triangulations as vertices, and a pair of partial triangulations is adjacent if
they can be obtained from one another by a bistellar flip. The edge flip graph
is defined with full triangulations as vertices, and edge flips determining the
adjacencies. Lawson showed in the early 70s that these graphs are connected.
Our goal is to investigate these graphs, with emphasis on vertex connectivity.
  For sets of n points in the plane in general position, we show that the edge
flip graph is (n/2-2)-connected, and the bistellar flip graph is
(n-3)-connected; both results are tight. The latter bound matches the situation
for the subfamily of regular triangulations, ie. partial triangulations
obtained by lifting the points to 3-space and projecting back the lower convex
hull. Here (n-3)-connectivity has been known since the late 80s via the
secondary polytope due to Gelfand, Kapranov & Zelevinsky and Balinski's
Theorem. For the edge flip-graphs, the vertex connectivity can be shown to be
at least as large as (and hence equal to) the minimum degree, provided n is
large enough. Our methods yield several other results.

different consumers in a smart grid. The retailer's objective is to maximize
the revenue, minimize the operating cost, and maximize the consumer's welfare.
The retailer wants to optimize a convex combination of the above objectives
using price signals specific to each consumer. However, variability in unit
prices across consumers is bounded by a parameter $\eta$, hence limiting the
discrimination. We formulate the pricing problem as a Stackelberg game where
the retailer is the leader and consumers are followers. Since the retailer's
optimization problem turns out to be non-convex, we convexify it via
relaxations. We provide performance guarantees for the relaxations in the
asymptotic sense (when number of consumers tends to $\infty$). Further, we show
that despite the variability in pricing, the pricing scheme proposed by our
model is fair as higher prices are charged to consumers who have higher
willingness for demand. We extend our analysis to the scenario where consumers
can feed energy back to the grid via net-metering. We show that our pricing
policy promotes fairness even in this scenario as prosumers who contribute more
to the grid, are given large cuts on buying rates. The policy is also found to
incentivize more prosumers to invest in renewable energy, thus encouraging

mirror is a promising path to produce bright attosecond light bursts. Yet, a
major challenge has been to find a way to generate isolated attosecond pulses,
better suited to timed-resolved experiments, rather than trains of pulses. A
promising technique is the attosecond lighthouse effect, which consists in
imprinting different propagation directions to successive attosecond pulses of
the train, and then spatially filtering one pulse in the far field. However, in
the relativistic regime, plasma mirrors get curved by the radiation pressure of
the incident laser and thus focus the generated harmonic beams. This increases
the harmonic beam divergence and makes it difficult to separate the attosecond
pulses angularly. In this article, we propose two novel techniques readily
applicable in experiments to significantly reduce the divergence of Doppler
harmonics, and achieve the generation of isolated attosecond pulses from the
lighthouse effect without requiring few-cycle laser pulses. Their validity is
demonstrated using state-of-the-art simulations, which show that isolated
attosecond pulses with $10$TW peak power in the X-UV range can be generated
with PW-class lasers. These techniques can equally be applied to other
generation mechanisms to alleviate the constraints on the duration on the laser
pulses needed to generate isolated attosecond pulses.

investigated extensively in the context of reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy signal using observations obtained by
WMAP and Planck satellite missions. In this article, we, for the first time,
apply the ILC method to reconstruct the large scale CMB E mode polarization
signal, which serves as the unique probe of ionization history of the Universe,
using simulated observations of 15 frequency CMB polarization maps of future
generation COrE satellite mission. We find that usual ILC cleaned E mode map is
highly erroneous due to presence of a chance-correlation between CMB and
astrophysical foreground components in the empirical covariance matrix which is
used to estimate the weight factors. The cleaned angular power spectrum for E
mode is strongly biased and erroneous due to these chance correlation factors.
In order to address the issues of bias and errors we extend and improve the
usual ILC method for CMB E mode reconstruction by incorporating prior
information of theoretical E mode angular power spectrum while estimating the
weights for linear combination of input maps. Using the E mode covariance
matrix effectively suppresses the CMB-foreground chance correlation power
leading to an accurate reconstruction of cleaned CMB E mode map and its angular
power spectrum. We provide a comparative study of the performance of the usual
ILC and the new method over large angular scales of the sky and show that the
later produces significantly statistically improved results than the former.
The new E mode CMB angular power spectrum contains neither any significant
negative bias at the low multipoles nor any positive foreground bias at
relatively higher mutlipoles. The error estimates of the cleaned spectrum agree
very well with the cosmic variance induced error.

scarce resource at the sensor nodes, the system is modeled as a tandem
computation-transmission queue with power-efficient computing. Jobs arrive at
the computation server with rate $\lambda$ as a Poisson process with no
available data buffer. The computation server can be in one of three states:
(i) OFF: the server is turned off and no jobs are observed or processed, (ii)
ON-Idle: the server is turned on but there is no job in the server, (iii)
ON-Busy: the server is turned on and a job is processed in the server. These
states cost zero, one and $p_c$ units of power, respectively. Under a long-term
power constraint, the computation server switches from one state to another in
sequence: first a deterministic $T_o$ time units in OFF state, then waiting for
a job arrival in ON-Idle state and then in ON-Busy state for an independent
identically distributed compute time duration. The transmission server has a
single unit data buffer to save incoming packets and applies last come first
serve with discarding as well as a packet deadline to discard a sitting packet
for maintaining information freshness, which is measured by the Age of
Information (AoI). Additionally, there is a monotonic functional relation
between the mean time spent in ON-Busy state and the mean transmission time. We
obtain closed-form expressions for average AoI and average peak AoI. Our
numerical results illustrate various regimes of operation for best AoI
performances optimized over packet deadlines with relation to power efficiency.

spin axis is tilted by 98 degrees. That its satellite system is equally
inclined and prograde suggests that it was formed as a consequence of the
impact. However, the disks predicted by the impact simulations generally have
sizes one order smaller and masses two orders larger than those of the observed
system at present. Here we show, by means of a theoretical model, that the
Uranian satellite formation is regulated by the evolution of the
impact-generated disk. Because the vaporization temperature of water ice is low
and both Uranus and the impactor are assumed to be ice-dominated, we can
conclude that the impact-generated disk has mostly vaporized. We predict that
the disk lost a significant amount of water vapour mass and spread to the
levels of the current system until the disk cooled down enough for ice
condensation and accretion of icy particles to begin. From the predicted
distribution of condensed ices, our N-body simulation is able to reproduce the
observed mass-orbit configuration of Uranian satellites. This scenario
contrasts with the giant-impact model for the Earth's Moon, in which about half
of the compact, impact-generated, solid or liquid disk is immediately
incorporated into the Moon on impact.

wavelengths from X-ray to THz, with amplitude describing transmittance (or
reflectivity) and phase revealing intrinsic structure of the target object.
Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) employs iterative phase retrieval algorithms
to process diffraction measurements and is the predominant non-interferometric
method to image complex fields. However, the working spectrum of CDI is quite
narrow, because the diffraction measurements on which it relies require dense
array detection with ultra-high dynamic range. Here we report a single-pixel
CDI technique that works for a wide waveband. A single-pixel detector instead
of an array sensor is employed in the far field for detection. It repeatedly
records the DC-only component of the diffracted wavefront scattered from an
object as it is illuminated by a sequence of binary modulation patterns. This
decreases the measurements' dynamic range by several orders of magnitude. We
employ an efficient single-pixel phase-retrieval algorithm to jointly recover
the object's 2D amplitude and phase maps from the 1D intensity-only
measurements. No a priori object information is needed in the recovery process.
We validate the technique's quantitative phase imaging nature using both
calibrated phase objects and biological samples, and demonstrate its wide
working spectrum with both 488-nm visible light and 980-nm near-infrared light.
Our approach paves the way for complex-field imaging in a wider waveband where
2D detector arrays are not available, with broad applications in life and
material sciences.

multiple temporal ""spikes"" which limit the longitudinal coherence of the
optical output; hence, alternate schemes that improve on the longitudinal
coherence of the SASE emission are of interest. In this paper, we consnider
electron bunches that are shorter than the SASE spike separation. In such
cases, the spontaneously generated radiation consists of a single optical pulse
with better longitudinal coherence than is found in typical SASE FELs. To
investigate this regime, we use two FEL simulation codes. One (MINERVA) uses
the slowly-varying envelope approximation(SVEA) which breaks down for extremely
short pulses. The second (PUFFIN) is a particle-in-cell (PiC) simulation code
that is considered to be a more complete model of the underlying physics and
which is able to simulate very short pulses. We first anchor these codes by
showing that there is substantial agreement between the codes in simulation of
the SPARC SASE FEL experiment at ENEA Frascati. We then compare the two codes
for simulations using electron bunch lengths that are shorter than the SASE

and currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory
failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks
efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory
failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in
COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified
tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating
lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene
expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human
COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that
twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515
cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,
including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as
TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these
twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such
as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of
twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also
uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In
summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms
leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and
CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.

change in line with the Paris Agreement and reaching the sustainable
development goal of eradicating poverty have been proposed recently. They imply
a strong reduction in carbon footprint inequality by 2030 that effectively
halves the Gini coefficient to about 0.25. This paper examines feasibility of
these scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted
international inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global
inequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a
new dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones. In
both cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially
attributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the
distribution, with footprints more unequal than territorial emissions. These
results show that realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an
unprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels.
Moreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to
2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5.
This observation confirms an earlier prediction based on maximal entropy
reasoning that the Lorenz curve converges to the exponential distribution. This
saturation further undermines feasibility of the redistributive scenarios,
which are also hindered by structural tendencies that reinforce carbon
footprint inequality under global capitalism. One way out of this conundrum is
a fast decarbonization of the global energy supply in order to decrease global
carbon emissions without relying crucially on carbon inequality reduction.

applications and wider adoption through commoditisation of the technology. We
address these challenges by demonstrating, through using a simple optical
measurement, photoplethysmography (PPG) used conventionally for heart rate
detection in wrist-worn sensors, that we can provide improved heart rate and
human activity recognition (HAR) simultaneously at low sample rates, without an
inertial measurement unit. This simplifies hardware design and reduces costs
and power budgets. We apply two deep learning pipelines, one for human activity
recognition and one for heart rate estimation. HAR is achieved through the
application of a visual classification approach, capable of robust performance
at low sample rates. Here, transfer learning is leveraged to retrain a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish characteristics of the PPG
during different human activities. For heart rate estimation we use a CNN
adopted for regression which maps noisy optical signals to heart rate
estimates. In both cases, comparisons are made with leading conventional
approaches. Our results demonstrate a low sampling frequency can achieve good
performance without significant degradation of accuracy. 5 Hz and 10 Hz were
shown to have 80.2% and 83.0% classification accuracy for HAR respectively.
These same sampling frequencies also yielded a robust heart rate estimation

256 Hz.

involve modeling very large domains and/or very complex equations. HPC systems
allow running large models, but limits in performance increase that have become
more prominent in the last 5-10 years will likely be experienced. Therefore new
approaches are needed to increase application performance. Deep learning
appears to be a promising way to achieve this. Recently deep learning has been
employed to enhance solving problems that traditionally are solved with
large-scale numerical simulations using HPC. This type of application, deep
learning for high-performance computing, is the theme of this whitepaper. Our
goal is to provide concrete guidelines to scientists and others that would like
to explore opportunities for applying deep learning approaches in their own
large-scale numerical simulations. These guidelines have been extracted from a
number of experiments that have been undertaken in various scientific domains
over the last two years, and which are described in more detail in the
Appendix. Additionally, we share the most important lessons that we have
learned.

that a human designer specifies to an AI learner and a potential catastrophic
outcome that does not reflect what the human designer really wants. We argue
that a formalism of AI alignment that does not distinguish between strategic
and agnostic misalignments is not useful, as it deems all technology as
un-safe. We propose a definition of a strategic-AI-alignment and prove that
most machine learning algorithms that are being used in practice today do not
suffer from the strategic-AI-alignment problem. However, without being careful,
today's technology might lead to strategic misalignment.

  Systems","A thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree
  of Doctor of Philosophy",,,,"cs.CY cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Standardisation of healthcare has been the focus of hospital management and
clinicians since the 1990's. Electronic health records were already intended to
provide clinicians with real-time access to clinical knowledge and care plans
while also recording and storing vast amounts of patient data. It took more
than three decades for electronic health records to start to become ubiquitous
in all aspects of healthcare. Learning health systems are the next stage in
health information systems whose potential benefits have been promoted for more
than a decade - yet few are seen in clinical practice. Clinical care process
specifications are a primary form of clinical documentation used in all aspects
of healthcare, but they lack standardisation. This thesis contends that this
lack of standardisation was inherited by electronic health records and that
this is a significant issue holding back the development and adoption of
learning health systems. Standardisation of clinical documents is used to
mitigate issues in electronic health records as a basis for enabling learning
health systems. One type of clinical document, the caremap, is standardised in
order to achieve an effective approach to containing resources and ensuring
consistency and quality. This led not only to improved clinicians'
comprehension and acceptance of the clinical document, but also to reduced time
expended in developing complicated learning health systems built using the
input of clinical experts.

accurately determining patient acuity, need for resources, and establishing
effective acuity-based patient prioritization. The purpose of this
retrospective study was to determine whether historical EHR data can be
extracted and synthesized with clinical natural language processing (C-NLP) and
the latest ML algorithms (KATE) to produce highly accurate ESI predictive
models. An ML model (KATE) for the triage process was developed using 166,175
patient encounters from two participating hospitals. The model was then tested
against a gold set that was derived from a random sample of triage encounters
at the study sites and correct acuity assignments were recorded by study
clinicians using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) standard as a guide. At the
two study sites, KATE predicted accurate ESI acuity assignments 75.9% of the
time, compared to nurses (59.8%) and average individual study clinicians
(75.3%). KATE accuracy was 26.9% higher than the average nurse accuracy
(p-value < 0.0001). On the boundary between ESI 2 and ESI 3 acuity assignments,
which relates to the risk of decompensation, KATE was 93.2% higher with 80%
accuracy, compared to triage nurses with 41.4% accuracy (p-value < 0.0001).
KATE provides a triage acuity assignment substantially more accurate than the
triage nurses in this study sample. KATE operates independently of contextual
factors, unaffected by the external pressures that can cause under triage and
may mitigate the racial and social biases that can negatively affect the
accuracy of triage assignment. Future research should focus on the impact of
KATE providing feedback to triage nurses in real time, KATEs impact on
mortality and morbidity, ED throughput, resource optimization, and nursing
outcomes.

challenges for missing data recovery by being largely stochastic in nature and
highly unbalanced in the duration of rain vs non-rain. Here we present a
two-step analysis utilising current machine learning techniques for imputing
precipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by devolving the task into
(a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the
absolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in
the UK, this machine learning process produces more accurate predictions for
recovering precipitation data than an established surface fitting technique
utilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available features for the
training of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the
integration of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain
gauges providing the highest performance. This method informs machine learning
models by utilising information in concurrently collected environmental data to
make accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear
relationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at
sub-hourly resolutions. Such pipelines for data recovery can be developed and
deployed for highly automated and near instantaneous imputation of missing
values in ongoing datasets at high temporal resolutions.

  Workshop 2020",,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Named entity recognition is an important task in natural language processing.
It is very well studied for rich language, but still under explored for
low-resource languages. The main reason is that the existing techniques
required a lot of annotated data to reach good performance. Recently, a new
distributional representation of words has been proposed to project named
entities from a rich language to a low-resource one. This representation has
been coupled to a neural network in order to project named entities from
English to Ewondo, a Bantu language spoken in Cameroon. Although the proposed
method reached appreciable results, the size of the used neural network was too
large compared to the size of the dataset. Furthermore the impact of the model
parameters has not been studied. In this paper, we show experimentally that the
same results can be obtained using a smaller neural network. We also emphasize
the parameters that are highly correlated to the network performance. This work
is a step forward to build a reliable and robust network architecture for named
entity projection in low resource languages.
