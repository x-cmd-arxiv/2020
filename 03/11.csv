several relevant network measures.
  In particular, we focus on how a sampling strategy optimized to recover a
particular spectral centrality measure impacts other topological quantities.
Our goal is on one hand to extend the analysis of the behavior of TCEC
[Ruggeri2019], a theoretically-grounded sampling method for eigenvector
centrality estimation.
  On the other hand, to demonstrate more broadly how sampling can impact the
estimation of relevant network properties like centrality measures different
than the one aimed at optimizing, community structure and node attribute
distribution.
  Finally, we adapt the theoretical framework behind TCEC for the case of
PageRank centrality and propose a sampling algorithm aimed at optimizing its
estimation. We show that, while the theoretical derivation can be suitably
adapted to cover this case, the resulting algorithm suffers of a high
computational complexity that requires further approximations compared to the
eigenvector centrality case.

  Australia",,,,"cs.PF cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  All computing infrastructure suffers from performance variability, be it
bare-metal or virtualized. This phenomenon originates from many sources: some
transient, such as noisy neighbors, and others more permanent but sudden, such
as changes or wear in hardware, changes in the underlying hypervisor stack, or
even undocumented interactions between the policies of the computing resource
provider and the active workloads. Thus, performance measurements obtained on
clouds, HPC facilities, and, more generally, datacenter environments are almost
guaranteed to exhibit performance regimes that evolve over time, which leads to
undesirable nonstationarities in application performance. In this paper, we
present our analysis of performance of the bare-metal hardware available on the
CloudLab testbed where we focus on quantifying the evolving performance regimes
using changepoint detection. We describe our findings, backed by a dataset with
nearly 6.9M benchmark results collected from over 1600 machines over a period
of 2 years and 9 months. These findings yield a comprehensive characterization
of real-world performance variability patterns in one computing facility, a
methodology for studying such patterns on other infrastructures, and contribute
to a better understanding of performance variability in general.

  welcome!",,,,"math.AG math.CO math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We generalize a formula due to Macdonald that relates the singular Betti
numbers of $X^{n}/G$ to those of $X$, where $X$ is a compact manifold and $G$
is any subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ acting on $X^{n}$ by permuting
coordinates. Our result is completely axiomatic: in a general setting, given an
endomorphism on the cohomology $H^{\bullet}(X)$, it explains how we can
explicitly relate the Lefschetz series of the induced endomorphism on
$H^{\bullet}(X^{n})^{G}$ to that of the given endomorphism on $H^{\bullet}(X)$
in the presence of the K\""unneth formula with respect to a cup product. For
example, when $X$ is a compact manifold, we take the Lefschetz series given by
the singular cohomology with rational coefficients. On the other hand, when $X$
is a projective variety over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we use the
$l$-adic \'etale cohomology with a suitable choice of prime number $l$. We also
explain how our formula generalizes the P\'olya enumeration theorem, a
classical theorem in combinatorics that counts colorings of a graph up to given
symmetries, where $X$ is taken to be a finite set of colors. When $X$ is a
smooth projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$, our formula also generalizes a
result of Cheah that relates the Hodge numbers of $X^{n}/G$ to those of $X$. We
will also see that our result generalizes the following facts: 1. the
generating function of the Poincar\'e polynomials of symmetric powers of a
compact manifold $X$ is rational; 2. the generating function of the
Hodge-Deligne polynomials of symmetric powers of a smooth projective variety
$X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is rational; 3. the zeta series of a projective variety
$X$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is rational. We also prove analogous rationality
results when we replace $S_{n}$ with $A_{n}$, alternating groups.

  Just as the polynomial functors on $\mathsf{Set}$ are the copresheaves that
can be written as sums of representables, one can express any Dirichlet series,
e.g.\ $\sum_{n=0}^\infty n^x$, as a coproduct of representable presheaves. A
Dirichlet polynomial is a finite Dirichlet series, that is, a finite sum of

Dirichlet analogues can be understood in terms of bundles, and go on to prove
that the category of Dirichlet polynomials is an elementary topos.

($\Lambda$) production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation can be described using the

Using a simple Gaussian model, we perform an extraction of the TMD PFFs by
fitting the BELLE collaboration's recent measurement of the $\Lambda$
transverse polarization in back-to-back $\Lambda+h$ production in $e^+ e^-$
collisions, $e^{-} + e^{+} \rightarrow \Lambda^{\uparrow}+h+X$. We find that
this simple model accurately describes the experimental data for $\Lambda$
production associated with pions and kaons, and we are able to determine TMD
PFFs for different quark flavors. We use these newly extracted TMD PFFs to make
predictions for the transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ produced in
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering at a future electron-ion collider, and
find that such a polarization is around $10\%$ and should be measurable.

remarkably rich variety of structures under compression due to the simple
interplay between the hard-core and soft-shoulder length scales in their
interactions. Most studies in this area model the soft shell interaction as a
square shoulder potential. Although appealing from a theoretical point of view,
the potential is physically unrealistic because there is no repulsive force in
the soft shell regime, unlike in experimental HCSS systems. To make the model
more realistic, here we consider HCSS particles with a range soft shell
potential profiles beyond the standard square shoulder form and study the model
using both minimum energy calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find
that by tuning density and the soft shell profile, HCSS particles in the thin
shell regime (i.e., shell to core ratio $r_1/r_0 \leq \sqrt{3}$) can form a
large range of structures, including hexagons, chains, squares, rhomboids and
two distinct zig-zag structures. Furthermore, by tuning the density and
$r_1/r_0$, we find that HCSS particles with experimentally realistic linear
ramp soft shoulder repulsions can form honeycombs and quasicrystals with
10-fold and 12-fold symmetry. Our study therefore suggests the exciting
possibility of fabricating these exotic 2D structures experimentally through
colloidal self-assembly.

  Terahertz Communication Networks","2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging wireless services with extremely high data rate requirements, such
as real-time extended reality applications, mandate novel solutions to further
increase the capacity of future wireless networks. In this regard, leveraging
large available bandwidth at terahertz frequency bands is seen as a key
enabler. To overcome the large propagation loss at these very high frequencies,
it is inevitable to manage transmissions over highly directional links.
However, uncoordinated directional transmissions by a large number of users can
cause substantial interference in terahertz networks. While such interference
will be received over short random time intervals, the received power can be
large. In this work, a new framework based on reinforcement learning is
proposed that uses an adaptive multi-thresholding strategy to efficiently
detect and mitigate the intermittent interference from directional links in the
time domain. To find the optimal thresholds, the problem is formulated as a
multidimensional multi-armed bandit system. Then, an algorithm is proposed that
allows the receiver to learn the optimal thresholds with very low complexity.
Another key advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not rely on any
prior knowledge about the interference statistics, and hence, it is suitable
for interference mitigation in dynamic scenarios. Simulation results confirm
the superior bit-error-rate performance of the proposed method compared with
two traditional time-domain interference mitigation approaches.

  It was mentioned by Forbes that this result would probably break when going

to Nisan, but concerning the analytic closure. We observe the same behavior
here: The set of polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is closed
for single-(source,sink) ABPs and not closed for trace ABPs. The proofs reveal
an intriguing connection between tangent spaces and the vector space of flows

fill-factor, RSD represent the new enabling technology for high-precision

mechanism of Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD), they benefit from the very
good timing performances of such technology together with an unprecedented
resolution of the spatial tracking, which allows to reach the micron-level
scale in the track reconstruction. This is essentially due to the absence of
any segmentation structure between pads (100% fill-factor) and to other two
innovative key-features: the first one is a properly doped n+ resistive layer,
slowing down the charges just after being multiplied, and the second one is a
dielectric layer grown on Silicon, inducing a capacitive coupling on the metal
pads deposited on top of the detector. The very good spatial resolution
(micron-level) we measured experimentally - higher than the nominal pad pitch -
comes from the analogical nature of the readout of signals, whose amplitude
attenuates from the pad center to its periphery, while the outstanding results
in terms of timing (less than 14 ps, even better than standard LGAD) are due to
a combination of very-fine pitch, analogical response and charge
multiplication.

First, we show that the heights given by the maximum likelihood estimate are
generically transcendental. For a cell in one dimension, the maximum likelihood

Even more, we show that finding the log-concave maximum likelihood estimate is
equivalent to solving a collection of polynomial-exponential systems of a

solutions to these systems. As an alternative, we use Smale's alpha-theory to

are underlying hierarchically structured, how to model human structures is the
central theme in this task. Focusing on this, we seek to simultaneously exploit
the representational capacity of deep graph networks and the hierarchical human
structures. In particular, we provide following two contributions. First, three
kinds of part relations, i.e., decomposition, composition, and dependency, are,
for the first time, completely and precisely described by three distinct
relation networks. This is in stark contrast to previous parsers, which only
focus on a portion of the relations and adopt a type-agnostic relation modeling
strategy. More expressive relation information can be captured by explicitly
imposing the parameters in the relation networks to satisfy the specific
characteristics of different relations. Second, previous parsers largely ignore
the need for an approximation algorithm over the loopy human hierarchy, while
we instead address an iterative reasoning process, by assimilating generic
message-passing networks with their edge-typed, convolutional counterparts.
With these efforts, our parser lays the foundation for more sophisticated and
flexible human relation patterns of reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on
five datasets demonstrate that our parser sets a new state-of-the-art on each.

irregular moons, most of which are members of the Ananke, Carme and Pasiphae
groups. By comparing 19 known continuous distributions, it is verified that
suitable distribution functions exist to describe the orbital distributions of
these natural satellites. For each distribution type, interval estimation is
used to estimate the corresponding parameter values. At a given significance
level, a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric test is applied to verify
the specified distribution, and we often select the one with the largest
$p$-value. The results show that the semi-major axis, mean inclination and
orbital period of the moons in the Ananke group and Carme group obey Stable
distributions. In addition, according to Kepler's third law of planetary motion
and by comparing the theoretically calculated best-fitting cumulative
distribution function (CDF) with the observed CDF, we demonstrate that the
theoretical distribution is in good agreement with the empirical distribution.
Therefore, these characteristics of Jupiter's irregular moons are indeed very
likely to follow some specific distribution laws, and it will be possible to
use these laws to help study certain features of poorly investigated moons or
even predict undiscovered ones.

electromagnetic fields. These anomalies relate to the chiral current (or
current) non-conservation and chiral energy-momentum (or energy-momentum)
non-conservation, respectively, which can be applied to the $^{3}\text{He-A}$
phase, the chiral superconductors and the Weyl semimetals with dislocations and
disclinations. In sharp difference with other anomalies, there exist torsional
anomalies depending on the position of Weyl nodes in the energy-momentum space.
These anomalies originate from particles pumped up through the Weyl nodes and
they are thus insensitive to the ultra-violet physics, while the Nieh-Yan
anomaly is from the particle inflow through the ultra-violet cut-off. The
current non-conservation as well as the energy-momentum non-conservation are
found, which stem from the zero modes trapped in the dislocations and they can
be understood from the Callan-Harvey mechanism. Finally, by comparing our

shows that KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b cannot possess an inversion layer caused by a

likely be caused by metal atoms such as Fe\,{\sc i} and Fe\,{\sc ii}. Finally,

best known running time for this problem and, by well-known reductions, also
implies improved running times for the shortest path problem with negative

$\|\boldsymbol{\mathit{b}}\|_1 = O(m)$, and recovers the running time of the
currently fastest algorithm for maximum flow in graphs with unit capacities
(Liu-Sidford, 2020).
  Our algorithm relies on developing an interior point method-based framework
which acts on the space of circulations in the underlying graph. From the
combinatorial point of view, this framework can be viewed as iteratively
improving the cost of a suboptimal solution by pushing flow around
circulations. These circulations are derived by computing a regularized version
of the standard Newton step, which is partially inspired by previous work on
the unit-capacity maximum flow problem (Liu-Sidford, 2019), and subsequently
refined based on the very recent progress on this problem (Liu-Sidford, 2020).
The resulting step problem can then be computed efficiently using the recent
work on $\ell_p$-norm minimizing flows (Kyng-Peng-Sachdeva-Wang, 2019). We
obtain our faster algorithm by combining this new step primitive with a
customized preconditioning method, which aims to ensure that the graph on which
these circulations are computed has sufficiently large conductance.

advantage to be model-independent.
  Millisecond time resolution on the arrival time delay at two different

a great extent in the past few years, but there are still a number of open
questions. Among these, a problem of great significance, both fundamentally and
for constructing efficient sensing networks, is that of the role of
inter-sensor correlations in the simultaneous estimation of multiple linear
functions, where the latter are taken over a collection local parameters and
can thus be seen as global properties. In this work we provide a solution to
this when each node is a qubit and the state of the network is
sensor-symmetric. First we derive a general expression linking the amount of
inter-sensor correlations and the geometry of the vectors associated with the
functions, such that the asymptotic error is optimal. Using this we show that
if the vectors are clustered around two special subspaces, then the optimum is
achieved when the correlation strength approaches its extreme values, while
there is a monotonic transition between such extremes for any other geometry.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that entanglement can be detrimental for estimating
non-trivial global properties, and that sometimes it is in fact irrelevant.
Finally, we perform a non-asymptotic analysis of these results using a Bayesian
approach, finding that the amount of correlations needed to enhance the
precision crucially depends on the number of measurement data. Our results will
serve as a basis to investigate how to harness correlations in networks of
quantum sensors operating both in and out of the asymptotic regime.

using 6-digit PINs instead of 4-digit PINs provides little to no increase in
security, and surprisingly may even decrease security. We also study the
effects of blocklists, where a set of ""easy to guess"" PINs is disallowed during
selection. Two such blocklists are in use today by iOS, for 4-digits (274 PINs)
as well as 6-digits (2910 PINs). We extracted both blocklists compared them
with four other blocklists, including a small 4-digit (27 PINs), a large
4-digit (2740 PINs), and two placebo blocklists for 4- and 6-digit PINs that
always excluded the first-choice PIN. We find that relatively small blocklists

suggests that a blocklist at about 10% of the PIN space may provide the best
balance between usability and security.

of the cyclotron resonance in the irradiated magnetoresistance in ultraclean
two-dimensional electron systems. The motivation is the experimental
observation of a totally unexpected strong resistance peak showing up at the
second harmonic. We extend the radiation-driven electron orbit model
(previously developed to study photocurrent oscillations and zero resistance
states) to a ultraclean scenario that implies longer scattering time and longer
mean free path. Thus, when the mean free path is equivalent, in terms of
energy, to twice the cyclotron energy ($2\hbar w_{c}$), the electron behaves as
under an effective magnetic field twice the one really applied. Then, at high
radiation power and/or low temperature, a resistance spike can be observed {\it
at the second harmonic}. For even cleaner samples the energy distance could
increase to three or four times the cyclotron energy giving rise to resistance
peaks at higher harmonics (third, fourth, etc.), i.e., a resonance peak shift
to lower magnetic fields as the quality of the sample increases. Thus, by
selecting the sample mobility one automatically would select the radiation
resonance response without altering the radiation frequency.

geopotential height (Z500). However, while robust trimodality is visibly
apparent in jet latitude indices, Z500 clusters require highly sensitive
significance tests to distinguish them from autocorrelated noise. As a result,
even small shifts in the time-period considered can notably alter the diagnosed
regimes. Fixing the optimal regime number is also hard to justify. We argue
that the jet speed, a near-Gaussian distribution projecting strongly onto the
Z500 field, is the source of this lack of robustness. Once its influence is
removed, the Z500 phase space becomes visibly non-Gaussian, and clustering
algorithms easily recover three extremely stable regimes, corresponding to the
jet latitude regimes. Further analysis supports the existence of two additional
regimes, corresponding to a tilted and split jet. This framework therefore
naturally unifies the two regime perspectives.

absorption. Recently, high-resolution measurements of absorption in the He I
triplet line at 10830 angstroms of several exoplanets (including HD 209458b)
have been reported, creating a new opportunity to probe escaping atmospheres.
We aim to better understand the atmospheric regions of HD 209458b from where
the escape originates. We developed a 1D hydrodynamic model with spherical
symmetry for the HD 209458 b thermosphere coupled with a non-local
thermodynamic model for the population of the He triplet state. In addition, we
performed high-resolution radiative transfer calculations of synthetic spectra
for the He triplet lines and compared them with the measured absorption
spectrum in order to retrieve information about the atmospheric parameters. We
find that the measured spectrum constrains the [H]/[H$^{+}$] transition
altitude occurring in the range of 1.2 to 1.9Rp. H is almost fully ionised at
altitudes above 2.9Rp. We also find that the X-ray and EUV absorption takes
place at effective radii from 1.16 to 1.30Rp, and that the He triplet peak
density occurs at altitudes from 1.04 to 1.60Rp. Additionally, the averaged mmw
is confined to the 0.61-0.73 g/mole interval, and the thermospheric H/He ratio
should be larger than 90/10, and most likely approximately 98/2. We also
provide a one-to-one relationship between mass-loss rate and temperature. Based
on the energy-limited escape approach and assuming heating efficiencies of
0.1-0.2, we find a mass-loss rate in the range of (0.42-1.00)$\times 10^{11}$

wide spectrum of applications. Stable gravimetric measurements over timescales
from several days to decades are required to provide relevant insight into
geophysical processes. Users of AGs participate in comparisons with a
metrological reference in order to monitor the temporal stability of the
instruments and determine the bias to that reference. However, since no
measurement standard of higher-order accuracy currently exists, users of AGs
participate in key comparisons led by the CIPM. These comparisons provide the
reference values of highest accuracy compared to the calibration against a
single AG. The construction of stationary, large scale atom interferometers
paves the way towards a new measurement standard in absolute gravimetry used as
a reference with a potential stability up to 1 nm/s$^2$ at 1 s integration
time. At the Leibniz University Hannover, we are currently building such a very
long baseline atom interferometer with a 10 m long interaction zone. The
knowledge of local gravity and its gradient along and around the baseline is
required to establish the instrument's uncertainty budget and enable transfers
of gravimetric measurements to nearby devices for comparison and calibration
purposes. We therefore established a control network for relative gravimeters
and repeatedly measured its connections during the construction of the atom
interferometer. We additionally developed a 3D model of the host building to
investigate the self-attraction effect and studied the impact of mass changes
due to groundwater hydrology on the gravity field around the reference
instrument. The gravitational effect from the building 3D model is in excellent
agreement with the latest gravimetric measurement campaign which opens the

models for the anomalous radii of hot Jupiters. In this work, we present
evolution models studying the re-inflation of gas giants to determine how
varying the depth and intensity of deposited heating affects both main-sequence
re-inflation of hot Jupiters and post-main-sequence re-inflation of warm

re-inflation decreases with increasing heating rate and depth. We find a strong
degeneracy between heating rate and depth, with either strong shallow heating
or weak deep heating providing an explanation for main-sequence re-inflation of
hot Jupiters. This degeneracy between heating rate and depth can be broken in
the case of post-main-sequence re-inflation of warm Jupiters, as the inflation
must be rapid to occur within post-main-sequence evolution timescales. We also
show that the dependence of heating rate on incident stellar flux inferred from
the sample of hot Jupiters can explain re-inflation of both warm and hot

vision applications, ranging from human activity recognition to object
detection. In particular, speed estimation algorithms may be relevant in
contexts such as street monitoring and environment surveillance. In most
realistic scenarios, the projection of a framed object of interest onto the
image plane is likely to be affected by dynamic changes mainly related to
perspectival transformations or periodic behaviours. Therefore, advanced speed
estimation techniques need to rely on robust algorithms for object detection
that are able to deal with potential geometrical modifications. The proposed
method is composed of a sequence of pre-processing operations, that aim to
reduce or neglect perspetival effects affecting the objects of interest,
followed by the estimation phase based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML)
principle, where the speed of the foreground objects is estimated. The ML
estimation method represents, indeed, a consolidated statistical tool that may
be exploited to obtain reliable results. The performance of the proposed
algorithm is evaluated on a set of real video recordings and compared with a
block-matching motion estimation algorithm. The obtained results indicate that
the proposed method shows good and robust performance.

analysis attempts to supplement the available studies and provide new
theoretical contribution toward their validation. In particular, we explicitly
discuss the behavior of the MIGSs in the momentum space as a function of the
local onsite energy deviation, that mimics random potential disorder at the
interface. It is found, that when the difference between the characteristic
electronic potentials in the insulator increases, the corresponding MIGSs
become more localized. This effect is associated with the increasing degree of
the potential disorder that was earlier observed to produce highly localized
MIGSs in the superconducting qubits. At the same time, the presented findings
show that the disorder-induced localization of the MIGSs can be related
directly to the decay characteristics of these states as well as to the bulk
electronic properties of the insulator. As a result, our study reinforces
plausibility of the previous corresponding investigations on the origin of the

precision observables due to its contribution to the running of the
fine-structure constant encoded in $\Delta\alpha^{(5)}_\text{had}$. We find
that with modern EW precision data, including the measurement of the Higgs
mass, the global fit alone provides a competitive, independent determination of
$\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_\text{had}\big|_\text{EW}=270.2(3.0)\times 10^{-4}$. This
value actually lies below the range derived from $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$

required if a change in HVP were to bring the SM prediction for $(g-2)_\mu$

step towards localization, UAV needs to receive sufficient number of
localization signals each having a signal to interference plus noise ratio
(SINR) greater than a threshold, which is defined as localizability. On the
other hand, three-dimensional mobility of UAVs, altitude dependent channel
characteristics between base stations (BSs) and UAVs, its line of sight and
non-line of sight conditions, and resulting interference from the neighboring
BSs pose challenges to receive usable signals from the required number of BSs.
In this paper, we utilize a tractable approach to calculate localizability,
probability of successfully receiving usable signals from a certain number of

overall localization performance regardless of the localization technique to be

dense, quiescent, molecular clouds is important to both the cloud chemistry and
gas cooling. Where water is in the gas phase, it's free to participate in the
network of ion-neutral reactions that lead to a host of oxygen-bearing
molecules, and its many ortho and para energy levels make it an effective
coolant for gas temperatures greater than 20K. Where water is abundant as ice
on grain surfaces, and unavailable to cool the gas, significant amounts of
oxygen are removed from the gas phase, suppressing the gas-phase chemical
reactions that lead to a number of oxygen-bearing species, including O2. Models
of FUV-illuminated clouds predict that the gas-phase water abundance peaks in
the range Av ~3 and 8mag of the cloud surface, depending on the gas density and
FUV field strength. Deeper within such clouds, water is predicted to exist
mainly as ice on grain surfaces. More broadly, these models are used to analyze
a variety of other regions, including outflow cavities associated with young
stellar objects and the surface layers of protoplanetary disks. In this paper,
we report the results of observational tests of FUV-illuminated cloud models

exists primarily within a few magnitudes of dense cloud surfaces, strengthening
the conclusions of an earlier study based on a much smaller data set, and
indirectly supports the prediction that water ice is quite abundant in dense

canonical typicality for a finite cluster of $2\times 2 \times 2$ unit cells

octagonal loops. We focus on thermodynamic properties (energy, specific heat
capacity, entropy, susceptibility, magnetisation) next to the static structure
factor. We find a pronounced maximum in the specific heat at $T = 0.57 J$,
which is stable across finite size clusters and converged in the series
expansion. This is well-separated from a residual amount of spectral weight of
$0.47 k_B \ln 2$ per spin which has not been released even at $T\approx0.25 J$,
the limit of convergence of our results. This is a large value compared to a
number of highly frustrated models and materials, such as spin ice or the
kagome $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We also find a non-monotonic
dependence on $T$ of the magnetisation at low magnetic fields, reflecting the
dominantly non-magnetic character of the low-energy spectral weight. A detailed
comparison of our results to measurements for the $S=1$ material

Recently, it has been shown that Hamiltonians derived using different gauges

truncated to a few low-lying energy eigenstates. This effect is particularly
prominent in the ultra-strong coupling regime. Such ambiguities arise because
transformations reshuffle the partition between light and matter degrees of
freedom and so level truncation is a gauge dependent approximation. To avoid
this gauge ambiguity, we redefine the electromagnetic fields in terms of
potentials for which the resulting canonical momenta and Hamiltonian are
explicitly unchanged by the gauge choice of this theory. Instead the
light/matter partition is assigned by the intuitive choice of separating an
electric field between displacement and polarisation contributions. This
approach is an attractive choice in typical cavity quantum electrodynamics
situations.

into the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code, which can be used for both modeling very
large (previously unfeasible) quantities of geometries and establishing
recursive boundary conditions. The reliability of egs_lattice, as well as
EGSnrc in general, is cross-validated and tested. Methods: New Bravais, cubic,
and hexagonal lattice geometries are defined in egs_lattice and their transport
algorithms are described. Simulations of cells and Gold NanoParticle (GNP)
containing cavities are implemented to compare to published Geant4-DNA and
PENELOPE results. Recursive boundary conditions, implemented through a cubic
lattice, are used to perform electron Fano cavity tests. Results: Lattices are
successfully implemented in EGSnrc. EGSnrc calculated doses to cell cytoplasm
and nucleus when irradiated by an internal electron source with a median
difference of 0.6% compared to Geant4-DNA. EGSnrc calculated the ratio of dose
to a microscopic cavity containing GNPs over dose to a cavity containing a
homogeneous mixture of gold, and results generally agree (within 1%) with
PENELOPE. The Fano test is passed (sub-0.1%) for all energies/ cells
considered. Additionally, the recursive boundary conditions used for the Fano
test provided a factor of over a million increase in efficiency in some cases.
Conclusions: The egs_lattice geometry library, currently available as a pull
request on the EGSnrc GitHub develop branch, is now freely accessible as
open-source code. Lattice geometry implementations cross-validated with
independent simulations in other MC codes and verified with the electron Fano
cavity test demonstrate not only the reliability of egs_lattice, but, by
extension, EGSnrc's ability to simulate transport in nanometer geometries and
score in microscopic cavities.

the late (viscous) stage of spreading for highly viscous drops with a diameter
below the capillary length. Moreover, it applies to the spreading of a drop on
a swellable polymer brush, where the complex interaction with the substrate
leads to a very slow spreading dynamics. The spherical cap geometry allows to
derive a closed ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the spreading if the
capillary number is a function of the contact angle as it is the case for
empirical contact angle models. The latter approach has been introduced by de
Gennes (Reviews of Modern Physics, 1985) for small contact angles. In the
present work, we generalize the method to arbitrary contact angles. The method
is applied to experimental data of spreading water-glycerol drops on a silicon

propensity to disclose personal information in an effort to achieve certain
gratifications, the problem of navigating the tradeoff between privacy and
utility attracted a lot of recent interest and generated a rich body of
research. A critical prerequisite to solving the problem is to appropriately
capture the privacy and the utility aspects in the problem formulation. Most of
the existing works' focus is on the notion of privacy, while utility loss is
often treated as the undesirable but necessary distortion of the true data,
introduced by the privacy mechanism. By contrast, we are interested in
modelling utility differently, by associating it with specific attributes of a
user, just like privacy is associated with specific private attributes in the
literature. Our model of utility facilitates a better and more precise privacy
mechanism, and achieves better privacy-utility tradeoffs. We further
incorporate into our problem formulation a practical constraint on acceptable
loss in utility per unit gain in privacy, which allows users to customize the
privacy mechanisms in order to account for the relative values that each user
associates with their own privacy and utility. This paper discusses the
intricacies of our utility model and the corresponding privacy-utility
tradeoff, and introduces a heuristic greedy algorithm to solve the problem.

model is only efficient for the symmetric and rate-independent hysteresis
description, the FONBW model is devoted to characterizing the asymmetric and
rate-dependent behaviors of the hysteresis in PEAs by adopting an Nth-order
polynomial input function and two fractional operators, respectively. Different
from the traditional modified BW models, the proposed FONBW model also
eliminates the redundancy of parameters in the CBW model via the normalization
processing. By this way, the developed FONBW model has a relatively simple
mathematic expression with fewer parameters to simultaneously characterize the
asymmetric and rate-dependent hysteresis behaviors of PEAs. Model parameters
are identified by the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. To
validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of model
verification and inverse-multiplicative-structure-based feedforward control
experiments are carried out on a PEA system. Results show that the proposed
model is superior to the CBW model and traditional modified BW model in
modeling accuracy and hysteresis compensation.

conducting compounds as electrolytes. However, the ionic conductivity of such
materials tends to be lower than their liquid counterparts, necessitating
research efforts into finding suitable alternatives. The process of electrolyte
screening is often based on a mixture of domain expertise and trial-and-error,
both of which are time and resource-intensive. Data-driven and machine learning
approaches have recently come to the fore to accelerate learnings towards
discovery. In this work, we present a simple machine-learning based approach to
predict the ionic conductivity of sodium and lithium-based SICON compounds.
Using primarily theoretical elemental feature descriptors derivable from
tabulated information on the unit cell and the atomic properties of the
components of a target compound on a limited dataset of 70 NASICON-examples, we
have designed a logistic regression-based model capable of distinguishing
between poor and good superionic conductors with a cross-validation accuracy of
over 82%. Moreover, we demonstrate how such a system is capable of cross-domain
classification on lithium-based examples at the same accuracy, despite being
introduced to zero lithium-based compounds during training. Through a
systematic permutation-based evaluation process, we reduced the number of
considered features from 47 to 7, reduction of over 83%, while simultaneously
improving model performance. The contributions of different electronic and
structural features to overall ionic conductivity is also discussed, and
contrasted with accepted theories in literature. Our results demonstrate the
utility of such a simple, yet interpretable tool provides opportunities for
initial screening of potential candidates as solid-state electrolytes through

electrical power systems and typically use droop-controlled grid-forming
inverters to interface distributed energy resources to the network and control
the voltage and frequency. Ensuring stability of such microgrids is a key
issue, which requires the use of appropriate models for analysis and control
system design. Full-order detailed models can be more difficult to analyze and
increase computational complexity, hence a number of reduced-order models have
been proposed in the literature which present various trade-offs between
accuracy and complexity. However, these simplifications present the risk of
failing to adequately capture important dynamics of the microgrid. Therefore,
there is a need for a comprehensive review and assessment of their relative
quality, which is something that has not been systematically carried out thus
far in the literature and we aim to address in this paper. In particular, we
review various inverter-based microgrid reduced-order models and investigate
the accuracy of their predictions for stability via a comparison with a
corresponding detailed average model. Our study shows that the simplifications
reduced order models rely upon can affect their accuracy in various regimes of
the line R/X ratios, and that inappropriate model choices can result in
substantially inaccurate stability results. Finally, we present recommendations
on the use of reduced order models for the stability analysis of microgrids.

insights of the IB method, and allows one to obtain arbitrary orders of

extensions of the inhomogeneous terms to any desired regularity. This is
combined with the highly accurate Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform for
interpolation operations to yield a fast and robust method. Numerical tests
confirm that the technique performs precisely as expected on one-dimensional
test problems. In higher dimensions, the performance is even better, in some
cases yielding sub-geometric convergence. We also demonstrate how this
technique can be applied to solving parabolic problems and for computing the
eigenvalues of elliptic operators on general domains, in the process

of particles' trajectories, our algorithm allows for an efficient tiling of a
cosmological volume, where the dynamics within each tile is computed
independently. As a consequence, the degree of parallelism is equal to the
number of tiles. We optimised the accuracy of sCOLA through the use of a buffer
region around tiles and of appropriate Dirichlet boundary conditions around
sCOLA boxes. As a result, we show that cosmological simulations at the degree
of accuracy required for the analysis of the next generation of surveys can be
run in drastically reduced wall-clock times and with very low memory
requirements. The perfect scalability of our algorithm unlocks profoundly new

Lindblad master equation, which, however, needs to solve the Kronecker products

because of a secular forcing of the innermost planet eccentricity by planets b

interatomic potential used to generate forces. The gold standard would be
first-principles quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, but these become
prohibitively expensive at large simulation scales. Machine learning (ML) based
potentials aim for faithful emulation of QM at drastically reduced
computational cost. The accuracy and robustness of an ML potential is primarily
limited by the quality and diversity of the training dataset. Using the
principles of active learning (AL), we present a highly automated approach to
dataset construction. The strategy is to use the ML potential under development
to sample new atomic configurations and, whenever a configuration is reached
for which the ML uncertainty is sufficiently large, collect new QM data. Here,
we seek to push the limits of automation, removing as much expert knowledge
from the AL process as possible. All sampling is performed using MD simulations
starting from an initially disordered configuration, and undergoing
non-equilibrium dynamics as driven by time-varying applied temperatures. We
demonstrate this approach by building an ML potential for aluminum (ANI-Al).
After many AL iterations, ANI-Al teaches itself to predict properties like the
radial distribution function in melt, liquid-solid coexistence curve, and
crystal properties such as defect energies and barriers. To demonstrate
transferability, we perform a 1.3M atom shock simulation, and show that ANI-Al
predictions agree very well with DFT calculations on local atomic environments
sampled from the nonequilibrium dynamics. Interestingly, the configurations
appearing in shock appear to have been well sampled in the AL training dataset,
in a way that we illustrate visually.

a hidden sector which does not thermalize with the Standard Model thermal bath,
its relativistic thermal decoupling can easily lead to the observed relic
density, even if the dark matter particle mass is many orders of magnitude
heavier than the usual $\sim$ eV hot relic mass scale. This straightforward
scenario simply requires that the temperature of the hidden sector thermal bath
is one to five orders of magnitude cooler than the temperature of the Standard

determined only by the dark matter mass scale and the ratio of the temperatures

(SVD) of very large matrices, randomized sketching algorithms have become a
leading approach. However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is
that the user does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are
from the exact ones. Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical
worst-case error bounds, which do not account for the unique structure of a
given problem. As a result, the lack of tools for error estimation often leads
to much more computation than is really necessary. To overcome these
challenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven bootstrap method that
numerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular vectors/values. In
particular, this allows the user to inspect the quality of a rough initial
sketched SVD, and then adaptively predict how much extra work is needed to
reach a given error tolerance. Furthermore, the method is computationally
inexpensive, because it operates only on sketched objects, and it requires no
passes over the full matrix being factored. Lastly, the method is supported by
theoretical guarantees and a very encouraging set of experimental results.

Firms seek to navigate the market optimally by modulating their SREC generation

where agents interact through the SREC price. We study this stochastic game by
solving the mean-field game (MFG) limit with sub-populations of heterogeneous

cost of generation, non-linear non-compliance costs, and generation
uncertainty. Moreover, we endogenize SREC price through market clearing. We

resolution to capture dynamics of such nonlinear waves accurately. However
collection of accurate mapping data is difficult, costly, and often a dangerous
affair. As an alternative, in this study we implement a variational data
assimilation scheme on the one-dimensional shallow water equations to improve
estimates of bathymetry, using a finite set of observations of surface wave
height to optimise predictions. We show necessary conditions on system
parameters for convergence, and implement a low-pass filter for increased
regularity of our reconstructed bathymetry. If our objective is to use this to
model tsunami propagation, we observe that a relatively higher error in the
optimal reconstruction of the bathymetry still yields a highly accurate
prediction of the surface wave, suggesting low sensitivity of surface waves to
small scale effects in the bathymetry. These conclusions are based on numerical
experiments for both Gaussian and sandbar profile bathymetry, and with
different observation operators.These extension of these results to realistic
models can potentially have a significant impact, as computational cost can be
minimised through a priori knowledge of sufficient error tolerances needed for

distribution consistent with a population that was 120-Myr-old. Here, we
explore the detailed chemical nature of this stellar stream. We carried out
high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of 42 Psc-Eri stars using McDonald
Observatory, and combined these data with information for 40 members observed
with the low-resolution LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Together, these data
enabled us to measure the abundance distribution of light/odd-Z (Li, Na, Al,
Sc, V), $\alpha$ (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), and
neutron capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) elements along the Psc-Eri stream.
We find that the stream is (1) near solar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.03~dex
and (2) has a metallicity spread of 0.07~dex (or 0.04 dex when outliers are
excluded). We also find that (3) the abundance of Li indicates that Psc-Eri is
$\sim$120 Myr old, consistent with its gyrochronology age. Additionally,
Psc-Eri has (4) [X/Fe] abundance spreads which are just larger than the typical
uncertainty in most elements, (5) it is a cylindrical-like system whose outer
edges rotate about the center and, (6) no significant abundance gradients along
its major axis except a potentially weak gradient in [Si/Fe]. These results
show that Psc-Eri is a uniquely close, young, chemically interesting laboratory
for testing our understanding of star and planet formation.

magnetic field is presented. The analysis is in the context of $\beta$-plane
MHD, with a special focus on the physics of momentum transport in the stably
stratified, quasi-2D solar tachocline. A physical picture of mean PV evolution
by vorticity advection and tilting of magnetic fields is proposed. In the case
of weak-field perturbations, quasi-linear theory predicts that the Reynolds and
magnetic stresses balance as turbulence Alfv\'enizes for a larger mean magnetic
field. Jet formation is explored quantitatively in the mean field-resistivity
parameter space. However, since even a modest mean magnetic field leads to
large magnetic perturbations for large magnetic Reynolds number, the physically
relevant case is that of a strong but disordered field. We show that numerical
calculations indicate that the Reynolds stress is modified well before
Alfv\'enization -- i.e. before fluid and magnetic energies balance. To
understand these trends, a double-average model of PV mixing in a stochastic
magnetic field is developed. Calculations indicate that mean-square fields
strongly modify Reynolds stress phase coherence and also induce a magnetic drag
on zonal flows. The physics of transport reduction by tangled fields is
elucidated and linked to the related quench of turbulent resistivity. We
propose a physical picture of the system as a resisto-elastic medium threaded
by a tangled magnetic network. Applications of the theory to momentum transport
in the tachocline and other systems are discussed in detail.

from the density distribution and, in particular, the inverse problem while
considering just a self-gravitating disc and the thin disc approximation. Our
first aim here is to reproduce the same analysis and expand it with various
ideas and examples. The main obstacles to building this numerical
implementation are certain singularities. We try to fix the instabilities using
different methods. Moreover, we add a final chapter extending the problem and
its method to a third dimension through the perpendicular to the galactic
plane.
  The dark halo (whose density is usually represented by a nearby spherical
distribution) is supposed to support the outer parts of the rotation curves of
spiral galaxies. Here, however, we work only with a self-gravitation disc. To
treat this topic we first calculate the disc density distribution from measured
rotation curve data of the Milky Way. We then compare this distribution with
the observed exponential stellar density, and the difference is attributed to a
dark disc. This representation of Feng & Gallo of the Galaxy with a dark disc
instead of a dark halo is controversial.
  When we analyse the effect of flares on rotation curves, the thin disc
approximation fails, and we need to introduce a vertical dimension to measure
and predict the effects of the flare through different heights. Just by
spreading the mass perpendicularly to the plane -- without adding any further
mass -- the flare provokes no severe changes on the rotation curve. The flare
mainly provokes a faster velocity decrease in the outer part of the Galaxy
($r\gtrsim 14$ kpc). But we also have obtained a slight velocity increase in
the first kiloparsecs after the starting point of the flare.

more critical in these cases. Motivated by this observation, in the second part

preview information on the disturbances, while maintaining computational
efficiency. Compared with the naive approach of constructing a higher

potential to learn complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, RL still
requires the robot to collect a large amount of real-world experience. To
address this problem, recent works have proposed learning from expert
demonstrations (LfD), particularly via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL),
given its ability to achieve robust performance with only a small number of
expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, deploying IRL on real robots is still
challenging due to the large number of robot experiences it requires. This
paper aims to address this scalability challenge with a robust,
sample-efficient, and general meta-IRL algorithm, SQUIRL, that performs a new
but related long-horizon task robustly given only a single video demonstration.
First, this algorithm bootstraps the learning of a task encoder and a
task-conditioned policy using behavioral cloning (BC). It then collects
real-robot experiences and bypasses reward learning by directly recovering a
Q-function from the combined robot and expert trajectories. Next, this
algorithm uses the Q-function to re-evaluate all cumulative experiences
collected by the robot to improve the policy quickly. In the end, the policy
performs more robustly (90%+ success) than BC on new tasks while requiring no
trial-and-errors at test time. Finally, our real-robot and simulated
experiments demonstrate our algorithm's generality across different state
spaces, action spaces, and vision-based manipulation tasks, e.g.,
pick-pour-place and pick-carry-drop.

integer times, to site $j+1$, provided site $j-1$ is occupied and site $j+1$ is

specified initial configuration on $\{0,1\}^{Z}$. When started with a Bernoulli
product measure at density $\rho$ the system approaches a stationary state,
with phase transitions at $\rho=1/2$ and $\rho=2/3$. We discuss various
properties of these states in the different density regimes $0<\rho<1/2$,
$1/2<\rho<2/3$, and $2/3<\rho<1$; for example, we show that the pair
correlation $g(j)=\langle\eta(i)\eta(i+j)\rangle$ satisfies, for all $n\in Z$,

ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.

turbulent molecular clouds on their structure, evolution and star formation
activity. In this paper we look into the role of the clouds' initial virial
ratios. Three different scenarios were examined: both clouds initially bound,
one cloud bound and one unbound, and both clouds initially unbound. Models in
which one or both clouds are bound generate filamentary structures aligned
along the collision axis and discernible in position-position and
position--velocity space. If neither cloud is bound, no filaments result.
Unlike in previous simulations of collisions between smooth clouds, owing to
the substructure created in the clouds by turbulence before the collisions,
dissipation of kinetic energy by the collision is very inefficient and in none
of our simulations is sufficient bulk kinetic energy lost to render the clouds
bound. Simulations where both clouds are bound created twice as much stellar
mass than the bound-unbound model, and both these scenarios produced much more
stellar mass than the simulation in which both clouds are unbound. Each
simulation was also compared with a control run in which the clouds do not
collide. We find the bound-bound collision increases the overall star formation
efficiency by a factor of approximately two relative to the control, but that
the bound-unbound collision produces a much smaller increase, and the collision
has very little effect on the unbound--unbound cloud collision.

not previously for any $s<0$. The scaling-critical value $s=-\frac12$ is
necessarily excluded here, since instantaneous norm inflation is known to occur
[11, 40, 48].
  We also prove (in a parallel fashion) well-posedness of the real- and
complex-valued modified Korteweg-de Vries equations in $H^s(\mathbb R)$ for any
$s>-\frac12$. The best regularity achieved previously was $s\geq \frac14$; see
[15, 24, 33, 39].
  To overcome the failure of uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map, we
employ the method of commuting flows introduced in [37]. In stark contrast with
our arguments in [37], an essential ingredient in this paper is the
demonstration of a local smoothing effect for both equations. Despite the
non-perturbative nature of the well-posedness, the gain of derivatives matches
that of the underlying linear equation. To compensate for the local nature of
the smoothing estimates, we also demonstrate tightness of orbits. The proofs of
both local smoothing and tightness rely on our discovery of a new one-parameter
family of coercive microscopic conservation laws that remain meaningful at this
low regularity.

Differential game theory provides an adequate framework to analyze possible
outcomes of the conflict without assuming particular behaviors by the opponent.
This article presents an organized introduction of pursuit-evasion differential
games with an overview of recent advances in the area. First, a summary of the
seminal work is outlined, highlighting important contributions. Next, more
recent results are described by employing a classification based on the number

fugitive ship differential game and the active target defense differential
game. These problems provide two important applications and, more importantly,
they give great insight into the realization of cooperation between friendly
agents in order to form a team and defeat the adversary.

Document similarity measures extracted from word embeddings, such as the soft

achieve state-of-the-art performance on semantic text similarity and text
classification.
  Despite the strong performance of the WMD on text classification and semantic
text similarity, its super-cubic average time complexity is impractical. The
SCM has quadratic worst-case time complexity, but its performance on text
classification has never been compared with the WMD. Recently, two word
embedding regularization techniques were shown to reduce storage and memory
costs, and to improve training speed, document processing speed, and task
performance on word analogy, word similarity, and semantic text similarity.
However, the effect of these techniques on text classification has not yet been
studied.
  In our work, we investigate the individual and joint effect of the two word
embedding regularization techniques on the document processing speed and the
task performance of the SCM and the WMD on text classification. For evaluation,
we use the $k$NN classifier and six standard datasets: BBCSPORT, TWITTER,

performance and low latency of ownership transfer under light or no contention.
However, they do not scale gracefully under high contention and do not provide
any admission order guarantees. Such concerns led to the development of
scalable queue-based locks, such as a recent Compact NUMA-aware (CNA) lock, a
variant of another popular queue-based MCS lock. CNA scales well under load and
provides certain admission guarantees, but has more complicated lock handover
operations than TS and incurs higher latencies at low contention. We propose
Fissile locks, which capture the most desirable properties of both TS and CNA.
A Fissile lock consists of two underlying locks: a TS lock, which serves as a
fast path, and a CNA lock, which serves as a slow path. The key feature of
Fissile locks is the ability of threads on the fast path to bypass threads
enqueued on the slow path, and acquire the lock with less overhead than CNA.
Bypass is bounded (by a tunable parameter) to avoid starvation and ensure
long-term fairness. The result is a highly scalable NUMA-aware lock with
progress guarantees that performs like TS at low contention and like CNA at
high contention.

calcium-hydrosilicate (hCHS) that possesses a potential for minimizing the
ratio C/S from above 3 in OPC down to 1, which significantly reduces the amount
of CO$_2$ released during processing. The reaction kinetics of hCHS differs
from that of classical clinker phases due to the presence of highly reactive
silicate species, which involve silanol groups instead of pure calcium
silicates and aluminates and aluminoferrites. In contrast to Portland cement,
no calcium hydroxide is formed during hydration, which otherwise regulates the
Ca concentration. Without the buffering role of Ca(OH)$_2$ the concentration of
the dissolved species c(Ca$^{2+}$) and c(SiO$_4^{4-}$) and the corresponding pH
must be controlled to ensure a reproducible reaction. Pure hCHS reacts
isochemically with water, resulting in a C-S-H phase with the same chemical
composition as a single hydration product, with a homogeneous distribution of
the main elements Ca and Si throughout the sample. Here we study via
nanoindentation the mechanical properties of two different types of hardened
pastes made out of Celitement (C/S=1.28), with varying amounts of hCHS and
variable water to cement ratio. We couple nanoindentation grids with Raman
mappings to link the nanoscale mechanical properties to individual
microstructural components, yielding in-depth insight into the mechanics of the
mineralogical phases constituting the hardened cement paste. We show that we
can identify in hardened Celitement paste both fresh C-S-H with varying

while simultaneously measuring their mechanical properties. Albeit not suitable
for phase identification, EDX measurements provide valuable information about

(generally an implicit model), which can learn the support of data with low
intrinsic dimension in a high dimensional space; and an energy function, to
refine the probability mass on the learned support. Both the energy function
and base jointly constitute the final model, unlike GANs, which retain only the
base distribution (the ""generator""). GEBMs are trained by alternating between
learning the energy and the base. We show that both training stages are
well-defined: the energy is learned by maximising a generalized likelihood, and
the resulting energy-based loss provides informative gradients for learning the
base. Samples from the posterior on the latent space of the trained model can
be obtained via MCMC, thus finding regions in this space that produce better
quality samples. Empirically, the GEBM samples on image-generation tasks are of
much better quality than those from the learned generator alone, indicating
that all else being equal, the GEBM will outperform a GAN of the same

clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to
analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19

over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study
includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results:
Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT

infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2%

enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and
visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume

This is a technical report version",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Complexities that arise from implementation of object-oriented concepts in
C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the
attention of attackers and defenders alike.
  Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class
inheritance tree of a given program.
  While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances
from the binary, they are oblivious to virtual inheritance. Conventional wisdom
among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or
support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for
virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true.
  Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual
inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance
can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10\% on Linux and 12.5\% on
Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and libstdc++. (2) we show
that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and
false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These false positves and negatives
either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce
CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed
for program understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a
solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a
maximum of 95\% and 95.5\% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5\% and 73.8\% (Clang
-O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance
tree.

planetary systems. Our numerical simulations find instabilities in $\sim20\%$
of the cases on a wide range of timescales (up to $5\times10^9$ orbits) and
over an unexpectedly wide range of initial dynamical spacings. To identify the
triggers of long-term instability in multi-planet systems, we investigated in
detail the five-planet Kepler-102 system. Despite having several near-resonant
period ratios, we find that mean motion resonances are unlikely to directly
cause instability for plausible planet masses in this system. Instead, we find
strong evidence that slow inward transfer of angular momentum deficit (AMD) via
secular chaos excites the eccentricity of the innermost planet, Kepler-102 b,
eventually leading to planet-planet collisions in $\sim80\%$ of Kepler-102
simulations. Kepler-102 b likely has a mass $>\sim0.1M_{\oplus}$, hence a bulk
density exceeding about half Earth's, in order to avoid dynamical instability.
To investigate the role of secular chaos in our wider set of simulations, we
characterize each planetary system's AMD evolution with a ""spectral fraction""
calculated from the power spectrum of short integrations ($\sim5\times10^6$
orbits). We find that small spectral fractions ($\lesssim0.01$) are strongly
associated with dynamical stability on long timescales ($5\times10^9$ orbits)
and that the median time to instability decreases with increasing spectral
fraction. Our results support the hypothesis that secular chaos is the driver
of instabilities in many non-resonant multi-planet systems, and also
demonstrate that the spectral analysis method is an efficient numerical tool to
diagnose long term (in)stability of multi-planet systems from short
simulations.

embedded particles have promising applications in cell patterning and composite
scaffolds. Extrusion-based additive manufacturing techniques such as fused
deposition modeling and direct ink writing can experience particle patterning
defects at corners which could hinder cell survival at corners and create
unintended property gradients. Here, we propose models which predict the
behavior of deposited lines at corners for moderate viscosity inks which are
impacted by both capillarity and viscous dissipation. Using direct ink writing
with acoustophoresis and a Carbopol-based support gel, we write polygons out of
dental resin-based composite inks containing a narrow distribution of
microparticles at the center of the filament. A Laplace pressure differential
between the inner and outer surfaces of the corner drives corner smoothing,
wherein the inner radius of the corner increases. Double deposition, or
printing on the same area twice, drives corner swelling, wherein excess ink is
diverted to the outer edge of the corner. Fast turns at corners produce
ringing, wherein vibrations in the stage manifest in oscillations in the print
path. Swelling and ringing effects are apparent in the particle distributions
at corners immediately after deposition, while smoothing effects are apparent
after the printed structure has had time to relax. When the nozzle returns to
write a neighboring line, it imposes shear stresses which mitigate
inconsistencies in microstructure at corners by erasing defects which appeared
during relaxation. Using a support bath instead of layer-by-layer support
suppresses microstructural corner defects.

disk-temperature structure characterized by the dust opacity produces a patch
of orbits in which the Titan-mass moons cease inward migration and even migrate
outward in a certain range of the disk viscosity. The patch assists moons
initially located in the outer orbits to remain in the disk, while those in the
inner orbits fall onto the planet. We demonstrate for the first time that

Additionally, the ability of the sinuous antenna to be implemented as a planar

penetrating radar. However, recent literature has shown the sinuous antenna to
suffer from resonances which degrade performance. Such resonances produce late
time ringing which is particularly troubling for pulsed close in sensing

arms, and a resonance due to the outer truncation of the sinuous antenna
geometry. A detailed investigation as to the correlation between the
log-periodic resonances and the sinuous antenna design parameters indicates the
resonances may be mitigated by selecting appropriate parameters. In addition,
the resonance due to truncation may be mitigated by moving the circular

observed in clinical practice; where a pathologist may screen slides using a
low power objective and only switch to a high power in cases where they are

city era is accompanied with the implementation of a monitoring tool, called
state estimation. For the case of the unbalanced residential distribution grid,
the state estimating operation which is conducted at a regional scale is
considered as an application of the edge computing-based Internet of Things
(IoT). While the outcome of the state estimation is important to the subsequent
control activities, its accuracy heavily depends on the data integrity of the
information collected from the scattered measurement devices. This fact exposes
the vulnerability of the state estimation module under the effect of
data-driven attacks. Among these, false data injection attack (FDI) is
attracting much attention due to its capability to interfere with the normal
operation of the network without being detected. This paper presents an attack
design scheme based on a nonlinear physical-constraint model that is able to
produce an FDI attack with theoretically stealthy characteristic. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme, simulations with
the IEEE 13-node test feeder and the WSCC 9-bus system are conducted. The
experimental results indicate that not only the false positive rate of the bad
data detection mechanism is 100 per cent but the physical consequence of the
attack is severe. These results pose a serious challenge for operators in
maintaining the integrity of measurement data.

scenarios where early growth, aging or disease trajectories are of key
importance, longitudinal atlases become necessary as references, most often
created from cross-sectional data. New opportunities will be offered by
creating longitudinal brain atlases from longitudinal subject-specific image
data, where explicit modeling of subject's variability in slope and intercept
leads to a more robust estimation of average trajectories but also to estimates
of confidence bounds. This work focuses on a framework to build a continuous 4D
atlas from longitudinal high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) where,
unlike atlases of derived scalar diffusion indices such as FA, statistics on
dODFs is preserved. Multi-scalar images obtained from DW images are used for
geometric alignment, and linear mixed-effects modeling from longitudinal
diffusion orientation distribution functions (dODF) leads to estimation of
continuous dODF changes. The proposed method is applied to a longitudinal
dataset of HARDI images from healthy developing infants in the age range of 3
to 36 months. Verification of mixed-effects modeling is obtained by voxel-wise
goodness of fit calculations. To demonstrate the potential of our method, we
display changes of longitudinal atlas using dODF and derived generalized
fractional anisotropy (GFA) of dODF. We also investigate white matter
maturation patterns in genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum. The
framework can be used to build an average dODF atlas from HARDI data and to
derive subject-specific and population-based longitudinal change trajectories.

that legacy datasets may only cover the image domain without providing

pixel-wise velocity information for human recognition. Our approach uses a
precise human model and reproduces a precise motion to generate realistic

evaluate our data by comparing with data generated under different conditions.

and has demonstrated great advantages of reducing the difficulties in
teleoperating a robot and increasing the task performance. One fundamental
question in shared control is how to effectively allocate the control power to
the human and robot. Researchers have been subjectively defining the arbitrate
policies following conflicting principles, which resulted in great
inconsistency in the policies. We attribute this inconsistency to the
inconsiderateness of the multi-resource uncertainty in the human-robot system.
To fill the gap, we developed a multi-source uncertainty model that was
applicable to various types of uncertainty in real world, and then a general
arbitration model was developed to comprehensively fuse the uncertainty and
regulate the arbitration weight assigned to the robotic agent. Beside
traditional macro performance metrics, we introduced objective and quantitative
metrics of robotic helpfulness and friendliness that evaluated the assistive
robot's cooperation at micro and macro levels. Results from simulations and
experiments showed the new arbitration model was more effective and friendly
over the existing policies and was robust to coping with multi-source
uncertainty. With this new arbitration model, we expect the increased adoption
of human-robot shared control in practical and complex teleoperation tasks.

non-asymptotic quantum field theories. We investigate the Landau pole issue in
two condensed matter systems whose long-wavelength physics is described by
appropriate quantum field theories: the critical quantum magnet and Dirac
fermions in graphene with long-range Coulomb interactions. The critical quantum
magnet provides a classic example of a quantum phase transition, and it is well
described by the $\phi^4$ theory. We find that the irrelevant but
symmetry-allowed couplings, such as the $\phi^6$ potential, can significantly
change the fate of the Landau pole in the $\phi^4$ theory. We obtain the
coupled beta functions of a $\phi^4 + \phi^6$ potential at both small and large
orders. Already from the 1-loop calculation, the Landau pole is replaced by an
ultraviolet fixed point. A Lipatov analysis at large orders reveals that the
inclusion of a $\phi^6$ term also has important repercussions for the
high-order expansion of the beta functions. We also investigate the role of the
Landau pole in 2+1 dimensional Dirac fermions with Coulomb interactions, e.g.,
graphene. Both the weak-coupling perturbation theory up to 2 loops and a
low-order large-N calculation show the absence of a Landau pole. Furthermore,
we calculate the asymptotic expansion coefficients of the beta function. We
find that the asymptotic coefficient is bounded by that of a $\phi^4$ theory,
so graphene is free from Landau poles if the $\phi^4$ theory does not manifest
a Landau pole. We briefly discuss possible experiments that could potentially
probe the existence of a Landau pole in these systems. Studying Landau poles in
suitable condensed matter systems is of considerable fundamental importance
since the relevant Landau pole energy scales in particle physics, whether it is
quantum electrodynamics or Higgs physics, are completely unattainable.

apply the FF scheme to the classical stochastic Carnot-like heat engine which
is driven by a Brownian particle coupled with a time-dependent harmonic
potential and working between the high ($T_h$)- and low ($T_c$)-temperature
heat reservoirs. Concentrating on the underdamped case where momentum degree of
freedom is included, we find the explicit expressions for the FF protocols
necessary to accelerate both the isothermal and thermally-adiabatic processes,
and obtain the reversible and irreversible works. The irreversible work is
shown to consist of two terms with one proportional to and the other inversely
proportional to the friction coefficient. The optimal value of efficiency
$\eta$ at the maximum power of this engine is found to be $\eta^*=\frac{1}{2}

strong and weak dissipation. The result is justified for a wide family of time
scaling functions, making the FF protocols very flexible. We also revealed that
the accelerated full cycle of the Carnot-like stochastic heat engine cannot be
conceivable within the framework of the overdamped case, and the power and
efficiency can be evaluated only when the momentum degree of freedom is taken
into consideration.

single-point predictions generated by a deterministic model that outputs a
continuous variable. This problem applies to any state-of-the-art physics or
engineering models that have a computational cost that does not readily allow
to run ensembles and to estimate the uncertainty associated to single-point
predictions. Essentially, we devise a method to easily transform a
deterministic prediction into a probabilistic one. We show that for doing so,
one has to compromise between the accuracy and the reliability (calibration) of
such a probabilistic model. Hence, we introduce a cost function that encodes
their trade-off. We use the Continuous Rank Probability Score to measure
accuracy and we derive an analytic formula for the reliability, in the case of
forecasts of continuous scalar variables expressed in terms of Gaussian
distributions. The new Accuracy-Reliability cost function is then used to
estimate the input-dependent variance, given a black-box mean function, by
solving a two-objective optimization problem. The simple philosophy behind this
strategy is that predictions based on the estimated variances should not only
be accurate, but also reliable (i.e. statistical consistent with observations).
Conversely, early works based on the minimization of classical cost functions,
such as the negative log probability density, cannot simultaneously enforce
both accuracy and reliability. We show several examples both with synthetic
data, where the underlying hidden noise can accurately be recovered, and with
large real-world datasets.

the asymmetrical shape of Lyman-$\alpha$ seen in this and other white dwarf

molecular potentials that were not adequate to follow the atomic interactions
with spectroscopic precision to the asymptotic limit of large separation. A new
set of potential energy curves and electronic dipole transition moments for the
lowest electronic states of the H--He system were developed to account
accurately for the behavior of the atomic interactions at all distances, from
the chemical regime within 1~\AA\/ out to where the radiating H atoms are not
significantly perturbed by their neighbors. We use a general unified theory of
collision-broadened atomic spectral lines to describe a rigorous treatment of
hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ with these potentials and present a new study of its
broadening by radiative collisions of hydrogen and neutral helium. These

evolutionary algorithm to evolve specialized networks from the supernet. Both
approaches are time consuming. Here our key idea for very efficient deployment
is, when searching the architecture space, constructing a table that stores the

the enterprise setting. Compared to traditional distributed databases,
blockchain platforms provide increased security guarantees but significantly
lower performance. Further, these platforms are quite expensive to run for the
low throughput they provide. The following are two ways to improve performance
and reduce cost: (1) make the system utilize allocated resources efficiently;
(2) allow rapid and dynamic scaling of allocated resources based on load. We
explore both of these in this work.
  We first investigate the reasons for the poor performance and scalability of
the dominant permissioned blockchain flavor called Execute-Order-Validate
(EOV). We do this by studying the scaling characteristics of Hyperledger
Fabric, a popular EOV platform, using vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.
We find that the transaction throughput scales very poorly with these
techniques. At least in the permissioned setting, the real bottleneck is
transaction processing, not the consensus protocol. With vertical scaling, the
allocated vCPUs go under-utilized. In contrast, with horizontal scaling, the
allocated resources get wasted due to redundant work across nodes within an
organization.
  To mitigate the above concerns, we first improve resource efficiency by (a)
improving CPU utilization with a pipelined execution of validation & commit
phases; (b) avoiding redundant work across nodes by introducing a new type of
peer node called sparse peer that selectively commits transactions. We further
propose a technique that enables the rapid scaling of resources. Our
implementation - SmartFabric, built on top of Hyperledger Fabric demonstrates
3x higher throughput, 12-26x faster scale-up time, and provides Fabric's
throughput at 50% to 87% lower cost.

this paper proposes a novel double-sided auction mechanism of emissions permits

warming for many (e.g., 150) years into the future and every auction would
provide price information for this time range. In addition, this paper proposes
a set of market rules and a bottom-up implementation path. A coalition of

The combination of the selected market rules and the proposed implementation

increasing the certainty of avoiding catastrophic warming. This design should

tip-extending robots that navigate their environment through growth are highly
effective in robotic search applications. Because the robot membrane extends
from the tip, these robots can lengthen without friction from the environment.
However, the flexibility of the membrane inhibits tip retraction. Two methods
have been proposed to resolve this issue; increasing the pressure of the
internal fluid to reinforce rigidity, and mounting an actuator at the tip. The
disadvantage of the former is that the increase is limited by the membrane
pressure resistance, while the second method adds to the robot complexity. In
this paper, we present a tip-retraction mechanism without bending motion that
takes advantage of the friction from the external environment. Water is used as
the internal fluid to increase ground pressure with the environment. We explore
the failure pattern of the retraction motion and propose plausible solutions by
using hydrostatic skeleton robot. Additionally, we develop a prototype robot
that successfully retracts by using the proposed methodology. Our solution can

  Height-driven Attention Networks","Accepted to CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper exploits the intrinsic features of urban-scene images and proposes
a general add-on module, called height-driven attention networks (HANet), for
improving semantic segmentation for urban-scene images. It emphasizes
informative features or classes selectively according to the vertical position
of a pixel. The pixel-wise class distributions are significantly different from
each other among horizontally segmented sections in the urban-scene images.
Likewise, urban-scene images have their own distinct characteristics, but most
semantic segmentation networks do not reflect such unique attributes in the
architecture. The proposed network architecture incorporates the capability
exploiting the attributes to handle the urban scene dataset effectively. We
validate the consistent performance (mIoU) increase of various semantic
segmentation models on two datasets when HANet is adopted. This extensive
quantitative analysis demonstrates that adding our module to existing models is
easy and cost-effective. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance
on the Cityscapes benchmark with a large margin among ResNet-101 based
segmentation models. Also, we show that the proposed model is coherent with the
facts observed in the urban scene by visualizing and interpreting the attention
map. Our code and trained models are publicly available at

large population of neurons. In recent years, many technologies are developed
for recording large numbers of neurons either sequentially or simultaneously.
An increase in computational power and algorithmic developments have enabled
advanced analyses of neuronal population parallel to the rapid growth of
quantity and complexity of the recorded neuronal activity. Recent studies made
use of dimensionality and model order reduction techniques to extract coherent
features which are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. It has been
observed that the neuronal activity evolves on low-dimensional subspaces. The
aim of model reduction of large-scale neuronal networks is an accurate and fast
prediction of patterns and their propagation in different areas of the brain.
Spatiotemporal features of the brain activity are identified on low dimensional
subspaces with methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD), discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) and
combined parameter and state reduction. In this paper, we give an overview of

complexity of individual halo assembly histories can be well described by a
small number of principal components (PCs), which, compared to formation times,
provide a more complete description of halo assembly histories and have a
stronger correlation with halo structural properties. Using decision trees
built with the random ensemble method, we find that about $60\%$, $10\%$, and
$20\%$ of the variances in halo concentration, axis ratio, and spin,
respectively, can be explained by combining four dominating predictors: the
first PC of the assembly history, halo mass, and two environment parameters.
Halo concentration is dominated by halo assembly. The local environment is
found to be important for the axis ratio and spin but is degenerate with halo
assembly. The small percentages of the variance in the axis ratio and spin that
are explained by known assembly and environmental factors suggest that the
variance is produced by many nuanced factors and should be modeled as such. The
relations between halo intrinsic properties and environment are weak compared
to their variances, with the anisotropy of the local tidal field having the
strongest correlation with halo properties. Our method of dimension reduction
and regression can help simplify the characterization of the halo population
and clarify the degeneracy among halo properties.

mathematical literature, also in presence of disorder. Roughly speaking, they
undergo a transition between a delocalized phase and a localized one. In
mathematical terms these models are obtained by modifying the distribution of a
discrete renewal process via a Boltzmann factor with an energy that contains
only one body potentials. For some more complex models, notably pinning models
based on higher dimensional renewals, it has been shown that other phases may
be present. We study a generalization of the one dimensional pinning model in
which the energy may depend in a nonlinear way on the contact fraction: this
class of models contains the circular DNA case considered in the bio-physics
literature. We give a full solution of this generalized pinning model in
absence of disorder and show that another transition appears. In fact the
systems may display up to three different regimes: delocalization, partial
localization and full localization. What happens in the partially localized
regime can be explained in terms of the ""big-jump"" phenomenon for sums of heavy
tail random variables under conditioning. We then show that disorder completely
smears this second transition and we are back to the delocalization versus
localization scenario. In fact we show that the disorder, even if arbitrarily
weak, is incompatible with the presence of a big-jump.

we propose a novel continuous-level learning framework using a Filter

for stable learning of FTN, we newly propose a method to initialize non-linear

the other hand, for a positively charged vacancy, the collapse of the lowest

(KQ), targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision
convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version without
significant performance loss. Unlike existing methods struggling with weight
bit-length, KQ has the potential in improving the compression ratio by
considering the convolution kernel as the quantization unit. Inspired by the
evolution from weight pruning to filter pruning, we propose to quantize in both
kernel and weight level. Instead of representing each weight parameter with a
low-bit index, we learn a kernel codebook and replace all kernels in the
convolution layer with corresponding low-bit indexes. Thus, KQ can represent
the weight tensor in the convolution layer with low-bit indexes and a kernel
codebook with limited size, which enables KQ to achieve significant compression
ratio. Then, we conduct a 6-bit parameter quantization on the kernel codebook
to further reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet
classification task prove that KQ needs 1.05 and 1.62 bits on average in VGG
and ResNet18, respectively, to represent each parameter in the convolution
layer and achieves the state-of-the-art compression ratio with little accuracy
loss.

the X-ray/infrared fluctuations. The flux peaks at z~17-30, consistent with

contribution to the infrared background fluctuations is only about 1%.
  Magnetic fields are an essential ingredient in the Bondi capture process, and
PBH can play a role in amplifying early seed fields and maintaining them until
the galactic dynamo processes set in. The contribution of the assumed PBH
population to the re-ionization history of the universe does not conflict with
the Planck ionization limits. X-ray heating from PBH can provide a contribution
to the entropy floor in groups of galaxies. The tantalizing EDGES redshifted

The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature
and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM,
a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to

application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications

observational constraints from 56Co decay lines, 44Ti decay lines, and Fe IR

in SN 1987A. For M_ZAMS=15-20 Msun progenitors exploding with ~1.5 *10^51 erg,
ejecta structures suitable to reproduce the observations involve a bulk
asymmetry of the 56Ni of at least ~400 km/s and a bulk velocity of at least
~1500 km/s. By adding constraints to reproduce the UVOIR bolometric light curve
of SN 1987A up to 600d, an ejecta mass around 14 Msun is favoured. We also
investigate whether observed decay lines can constrain the neutron star (NS)
kick velocity. The model grid provides a constraint V_NS > V_redshift, and
applying this to SN 1987A gives a NS kick of at least 500 km/s. For Cas A, our
single model provides a satisfactory fit to the NuSTAR observations and
reinforces the result that current neutrino-driven core-collapse SN models can
achieve enough bulk asymmetry in the explosive burning material. Finally, we
investigate the internal gamma-ray field and energy deposition, and compare the
3D models to 1D approximations.

powerful alternative to the Dirichlet process. Until this moment, no attention

In this paper, we propose the bessel regression based on the univariate N-IG
distribution, which is a robust alternative to the beta model. This robustness
is illustrated through simulated and real data applications. The estimation of
the parameters is done through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the
paper discusses how to perform inference. A useful and practical discrimination
procedure is proposed for model selection between bessel and beta regressions.
Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to verify the finite-sample

the performances of the regressions are evaluated under misspecification, which
is a critical point showing the robustness of the proposed model. Finally,
three empirical illustrations are explored to confront results from bessel and

  Updates over Mini-Batches",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many attempts took place to improve the adaptive filters that can also be
useful to improve backpropagation (BP). Normalized least mean squares (NLMS) is
one of the most successful algorithms derived from Least mean squares (LMS).
However, its extension to multi-layer neural networks has not happened before.
Here, we first show that it is possible to consider a multi-layer neural
network as a stack of adaptive filters. Additionally, we introduce more
comprehensible interpretations of NLMS than the complicated geometric
interpretation in affine projection algorithm (APA) for a single
fully-connected (FC) layer that can easily be generalized to, for instance,
convolutional neural networks and also works better with mini-batch training.
With this new viewpoint, we introduce a better algorithm by predicting then
emending the adverse consequences of the actions that take place in BP even
before they happen. Finally, the proposed method is compatible with stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and applicable to momentum-based derivatives such as
RMSProp, Adam, and NAG. Our experiments show the usefulness of our algorithm in
the training of deep neural networks.

the two- and d-parameter case is based on the approach via the
Arveson-Stinespring correspondence of a CP-map by Muhly and Solel (and limited
to von Neumann algebras), here we explore consequently the approach via
Paschke's GNS-correspondence of a CP-map by Bhat and Skeide. (A comparison is
postponed to Appendix A(iv).)
  The generalizations are multi-fold, the difficulties often enormous. In fact,
our only true if-and-only-if theorem, is the following: A Markov semigroup over
(the opposite of) an Ore monoid admits a full (strict or normal) dilation if
and only if its GNS-subproduct system embeds into a product system. Already
earlier, it has been observed that the GNS- (respectively, the
Arveson-Stinespring) correspondences form a subproduct system, and that the
main difficulty is to embed that into a product system. Here we add, that every
dilation comes along with a superproduct system (a product system if the
dilation is full). The latter may or may not contain the GNS-subproduct system;
it does, if the dilation is strong - but not only.
  Apart from the many positive results pushing forward the theory to large
extent, we provide plenty of counter examples for almost every desirable
statement we could not prove. Still, a small number of open problems remains.
The most prominent: Does there exist a CP-semigroup that admits a dilation, but
no strong dilation? Another one: Does there exist a Markov semigroup that
admits a (necessarily strong) dilation, but no full dilation?

implicit-deadline sporadic task systems on a homogenous multiprocessor
platform. Focusing on dual-criticality systems, algorithms based on the fluid
scheduling model have been proposed in the past. These algorithms use a
dual-rate execution model for each high-criticality task depending on the
system mode. Once the system switches to the high-criticality mode, the
execution rates of such tasks are increased to meet their increased demand.
Although these algorithms are speed-up optimal, they are unable to schedule
several feasible dual-criticality task systems. This is because a single fixed
execution rate for each high-criticality task after the mode switch is not
efficient to handle the high variability in demand during the transition period
immediately following the mode switch. This demand variability exists as long
as the carry-over jobs of high-criticality tasks, that is jobs released before
the mode switch, have not completed. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose a
multi-rate fluid execution model for dual-criticality task systems in this
paper. Under this model, high-criticality tasks are allocated varying execution
rates in the transition period after the mode switch to efficiently handle the
demand variability. We derive a sufficient schedulability test for the proposed
model and show its dominance over the dual-rate fluid execution model. Further,
we also present a speed-up optimal rate assignment strategy for the multi-rate
model, and experimentally show that the proposed model outperforms all the
existing MC scheduling algorithms with known speed-up bounds.

initially given only one side of the vertex set of a bipartite graph; the
vertices on the other side are revealed to the algorithm one by one, along with
its incident edges. The algorithm is required to maintain a matching in the
current graph, where the algorithm revises the matching after each vertex
arrival by reassigning vertices. Bernstein, Holm, and Rotenberg showed that an
online algorithm can maintain a matching of maximum cardinality by performing
amortized $O(\log^2 n)$ reassignments per arrival.
  In this paper, we propose to consider the general question of how requiring a
non-amortized hard budget $k$ on the number of reassignments affects the
algorithms' performances, under various models from the literature.
  We show that a simple, widely-used algorithm is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm for all these models. For the unweighted maximum-cardinality problem,
the algorithm is a $(1-\frac{2}{k+2})$-competitive algorithm, which is the best
possible for a deterministic algorithm both under vertex arrivals and edge
arrivals. Applied to the load balancing problem, this yields a bifactor online
algorithm. For the weighted problem, which is traditionally studied assuming
the triangle inequality, we show that the power of reassignment allows us to
lift this assumption and the algorithm becomes a $\frac{1}{2}$-competitive
algorithm for $k=4$, improving upon the $\frac{1}{3}$ of the previous algorithm
without reassignments. We show that this also is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm.

making the tail categories receive more discouraging gradients. Based on it, we
propose a simple but effective loss, named equalization loss, to tackle the

rare categories. The equalization loss protects the learning of rare categories
from being at a disadvantage during the network parameter updating. Thus the
model is capable of learning better discriminative features for objects of rare
classes. Without any bells and whistles, our method achieves AP gains of 4.1%

experiments The accelerated development of x-ray sources, as 3 rd generation
synchrotrons (and recent upgrades) or free-electron lasers, has opened new
opportunities to investigate new phenomena by means of photoelectron and Auger
spectroscopy, electron-ion coincidence techniques and x-ray emission. However,
several processes of high scientific interests are still hard to measure; some
of them require the measurement of photons with high efficiency, high
resolution and even sometimes in coincidence mode. This is the purpose of
MOSARIX development. As an example, we propose to revisit Resonance-Enhanced
X-ray Multiple Ionization (REXMI) 1 with a significant amelioration of the
detection of photons, i.e. measuring the photons not only with high efficiency
and high resolution but also in coincidence with ions or electrons. This will
allow accessing the involved intermediate states and obtaining a clearer image
of the dynamic of the multiple ionization process. MOSARIX can also be used for
the investigation of very low cross-section phenomena such as attosecond
electron dynamics 2 and High-Energy Resolution Off-Resonant Spectroscopy

neural network. Most previous works on parametric speech synthesis did not
account for losses in spectral details causing over smoothing and invariably,
an appreciable deviation of the converted speech from the targeted speaker. An
improved model that uses both linear predictive coding (LPC) and line spectral
frequency (LSF) coefficients to parametrize the source speech signal was
developed in this work to reveal the effect of over-smoothing. Non-linear
mapping ability of neural network was employed in mapping the source speech
vectors into the acoustic vector space of the target. Training LPC coefficients
with neural network yielded a poor result due to the instability of the LPC
filter poles. The LPC coefficients were converted to line spectral frequency
coefficients before been trained with a 3-layer neural network. The algorithm
was tested with noisy data with the result evaluated using Mel-Cepstral
Distance measurement. Cepstral distance evaluation shows a 35.7 percent
reduction in the spectral distance between the target and the converted speech.

encoding inference problems as programs. In order to solve these inference
problems, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) employ different inference
algorithms, such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC), or variational methods. Existing research on such algorithms mainly
concerns their implementation and efficiency, rather than the correctness of
the algorithms themselves when applied in the context of expressive PPLs. To
remedy this, we give a correctness proof for SMC methods in the context of an
expressive PPL calculus, representative of popular PPLs such as WebPPL,
Anglican, and Birch. Previous work have studied correctness of MCMC using an
operational semantics, and correctness of SMC and MCMC in a denotational
setting without term recursion. However, for SMC inference -- one of the most
commonly used algorithms in PPLs as of today -- no formal correctness proof
exists in an operational setting. In particular, an open question is if the
resample locations in a probabilistic program affects the correctness of SMC.
We solve this fundamental problem, and make four novel contributions: (i) we
extend an untyped PPL lambda calculus and operational semantics to include
explicit resample terms, expressing synchronization points in SMC inference;
(ii) we prove, for the first time, that subject to mild restrictions, any
placement of the explicit resample terms is valid for a generic form of SMC
inference; (iii) as a result of (ii), our calculus benefits from classic
results from the SMC literature: a law of large numbers and an unbiased
estimate of the model evidence; and (iv) we formalize the bootstrap particle
filter for the calculus and discuss how our results can be further extended to
other SMC algorithms.

related to total-reflection XRF, is a very powerful technique for the in-depth
analysis of many types of technologically relevant samples, e.g. nanoparticle
depositions, shallow dopant profiles, thin layered samples or even well-ordered
nanostructures. However, the GIXRF based determination of the depth-dependent
information about the sample is usually based on a modelling of the
experimental data. This requires profound knowledge of the geometrical
parameters of the setup employed, especially the incident beam profile as well
as the detector aperture parameters. Together they determine the incident angle
dependent so-called effective solid angle of detection which must be known in
order to model any experimental data set. In this work, we demonstrate how
these instrumental parameters, which are typically not known with sufficient
accuracy, can be determined using dedicated experiments with a well-known
calibration sample. In addition, this paves the way for a full calibration of
the setup, as also information about other parameters, e.g. the incident photon
flux is gained. Here, we are using a Bruker S4 T-STAR instrument for this
demonstration but the principle can also be applied for other GIXRF setups.

gluonic-excitation energy of about 1 GeV at long distances in the maximally
Abelian gauge. On the other hand, no Abelian dominance is observed for higher
gluonic-excitation energies even at long distances. This suggests that there is
some threshold between 1 and 2 GeV for the applicable excitation-energy region
of Abelian dominance. Also, we find that Abelian projection significantly
reduces the short-distance $1/r$-like behavior in gluonic-excitation energies.

questions about the interdependence among countries and how future changes in
the world economy are likely to affect the countries' positioning in global
value chains. We are approaching the structure and lengths of value chains from
a completely different perspective than has been available so far. By assigning
a random endogenous variable to a network linkage representing the number of
intermediate sales/purchases before absorption (final use or value added), the
discrete-time absorbing Markov chains proposed here shed new light on the world
input/output networks. The variance of this variable can help assess the risk
when shaping the chain length and optimize the level of production. Contrary to
what might be expected simply on the basis of comparative advantage, the
results reveal that both the input and output chains exhibit the same
quasi-stationary product distribution. Put differently, the expected proportion
of time spent in a state before absorption is invariant to changes of the
network type. Finally, the several global metrics proposed here, including the
probability distribution of global value added/final output, provide guidance
for policy makers when estimating the resilience of world trading system and
forecasting the macroeconomic developments.

Specialised codecs that rely on explicitly stored segmentations excel in this

the segmentation to arbitrary reconstruction operators for the segment content.
In spite of its conceptual simplicity, our framework can outperform previous

this context are: (1) whether the results extend to the Fiat-Shamir

$O(q^2)$ loss in security is optimal.
  Firstly, we answer question (1) in the affirmative. As a byproduct of solving
a technical difficulty in proving this result, we slightly improve the result
of Don et al., equipping it with a cleaner bound and an even simpler proof. We
apply our result to digital signature schemes showing that it can be used to
prove strong security for schemes like MQDSS in the QROM. As another
application we prove QROM-security of a non-interactive OR proof by Liu, Wei

  As for question (2), we show via a Grover-search based attack that Don et
al.'s quadratic security loss for the Fiat-Shamir transformation of
$\Sigma$-protocols is optimal up to a small constant factor. This extends to
our new multi-round result, proving it tight up to a factor that depends on the
number of rounds only, i.e. is constant for any constant-round interactive

monoidal categories in which the unitors and associator are not required to be
natural isomorphisms, but merely natural transformations in a particular
direction. We present a sequent calculus for skew monoidal categories, building
on the recent formulation by one of the authors of a sequent calculus for the
Tamari order (skew semigroup categories). In this calculus, antecedents consist
of a stoup (an optional formula) followed by a context, and the connectives
behave like in the standard monoidal sequent calculus except that the left
rules may only be applied in stoup position. We prove that this calculus is
sound and complete with respect to existence of maps in the free skew monoidal
category, and moreover that it captures equality of maps once a suitable
equivalence relation is imposed on derivations. We then identify a subsystem of
focused derivations and establish that it contains exactly one canonical
representative from each equivalence class. This coherence theorem leads
directly to simple procedures for deciding equality of maps in the free skew
monoidal category and for enumerating any homset without duplicates. Finally,
and in the spirit of Lambek's work, we describe the close connection between
this proof-theoretic analysis and Bourke and Lack's recent characterization of
skew monoidal categories as left representable skew multicategories. We have
formalized this development in the dependently typed programming language Agda.

linear bogie model that is able to capture the most relevant dynamic behaviour
allows for the set-up of a very efficient Kalman-based monitoring strategy. The
behaviour of the designed filter is assessed through the use of a detailed
multibody model of an in-service vehicle running on a straight track with
realistic irregularities. The model output is used to generate virtual
measurements that are subsequently used to run the filter and validate the

negotiable teleoperated mobile rescue and service robot. 3 Survivor is an
improved version of two previously studied surveillance robots named Sigma 3
and Alpha N. In 3 Survivor, a modified double tracked with caterpillar
mechanism is incorporated in the body design. A passive adjustment established
in the body balance enables the front and rear body to operate in excellent
synchronization. Instead of using an actuator, a re configurable dynamic method
is constructed with a 6 DOF arm. This dynamic method is configured with the
planer, spatial mechanism, rotation matrix, motion control of rotation using
inverse kinematics and controlling power consumption of the manipulator using
angular momentum. The robot is remotely controlled using a handheld Radio
Frequency RF transmitter. 3 Survivor is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 12 MP
camera which is used for livestreaming of robot operations. Object detection
algorithms are run on the live video stream. The object detection method is
built using a Faster RCNN with VGGNet16 architecture of CNN. The entire
operations of the robot are monitored through a web control window. Therefore,
the control portal provides a brief scenario of the environment to run, control
and steer the robot for more precise operation. A very impressive 88.25 percent
accuracy is acquired from this module in a rescue operation. Along with the
ODM, the sensor system of the robot provides information on the hazardous
terrain. The feasibility of the 3 Survivor is tested and presented by different
experiments throughout the paper.

We investigate the formation of small scales and the dissipation of MHD
wave energy through non-linear interactions of counter-propagating, phase-mixed
Alfvenic waves in a complex magnetic field. Methods. We conducted fully 3-D,
non-ideal MHD simulations of transverse waves in complex magnetic fields.
Continuous wave drivers were imposed on the foot points of magnetic field lines
and the system was evolved for several Alfven travel times. Phase-mixed waves
were allowed to reflect off the upper boundary and the interactions between the
resultant counter-streaming wave packets were analysed. Results. The complex
nature of the background magnetic field encourages the development of phase
mixing, leading to a growth in currents and vorticities. Counter-propagating
phase-mixed waves induce a cascade of energy to small scales and result in more
efficient energy dissipation. This effect is enhanced in simulations with more
complex magnetic fields. High-frequency drivers excite localised field line
resonances and produce efficient wave heating. However, this relies on the
formation of large amplitude oscillations on resonant field lines. Drivers with
smaller frequencies than the fundamental frequencies of field lines are not
able to excite resonances and thus do not inject sufficient Poynting flux to
power coronal heating. Even in the case of high-frequency oscillations, the
rate of dissipation is likely too slow to balance coronal energy losses, even
within the quiet Sun. Conclusions. For the generalised phase-mixing presented
here, complex background field structures enhance the rate of wave energy
dissipation. However, it remains difficult for realistic wave drivers to inject
sufficient Poynting flux to heat the corona. Indeed, significant heating only
occurs in cases which exhibit amplitudes that are much larger than those
currently observed in the solar atmosphere.

behavior: Below SF, there are two spin carriers with opposite magnetic moments,
with the carriers polarized along the field forming a majority magnon band.
Above SF, the low-energy, ferromagnetic-like mode has magnetic moment opposite
the field. This results in a sign change of the SSE across SF, which agrees

conductances as a single constant fitting parameter, we reproduce the field
dependence of the experimental data and partially the temperature dependence of

and their properties using a graph data model, e.g., the Resource Description
Framework (RDF). An RDF graph comprises entities of the same type connected to
objects or other entities using labeled edges annotated with properties. RDF
graphs usually contain entities that share the same objects in a certain group
of properties, i.e., they match star patterns composed of these properties and
objects. In case the number of these entities or properties in these star
patterns is large, the size of the RDF graph and query processing are
negatively impacted; we refer these star patterns as frequent star patterns. We
address the problem of identifying frequent star patterns in RDF graphs and
devise the concept of factorized RDF graphs, which denote compact
representations of RDF graphs where the number of frequent star patterns is
minimized. We also develop computational methods to identify frequent star
patterns and generate a factorized RDF graph, where compact RDF molecules
replace frequent star patterns. A compact RDF molecule of a frequent star
pattern denotes an RDF subgraph that instantiates the corresponding star
pattern. Instead of having all the entities matching the original frequent star
pattern, a surrogate entity is added and related to the properties of the
frequent star pattern; it is linked to the entities that originally match the
frequent star pattern. We evaluate the performance of our factorization
techniques on several RDF graph benchmarks and compare with a baseline built on
top of gSpan, a state-of-the-art algorithm to detect frequent patterns. The
outcomes evidence the efficiency of proposed approach and show that our
techniques are able to reduce execution time of the baseline approach in at
least three orders of magnitude reducing the RDF graph size by up to 66.56%.

integrated unitary operations of an HRE quantum memory, prove the learning
procedure, and evaluate the achievable output signal-to-noise ratio values. We
prove that the local unitaries of an HRE quantum memory achieve the
optimization of the readout procedure in an unsupervised manner without the use
of any labeled data or training sequences. We show that the readout procedure
of an HRE quantum memory is realized in a completely blind manner without any

particularly convenient for gate-model quantum computers and the near-term
quantum devices of the quantum Internet.

properties of quantum repeaters and theory of entanglement rate maximization in

entails that all incoming density matrices can be swapped with a target density
matrix. The strong stability of a quantum repeater implies stable entanglement
swapping with the boundness of stored density matrices in the quantum memory
and the boundness of delays. Here, a theoretical framework of noise-scaled
stability analysis and entanglement rate maximization is conceived for the

the status of quantum memory of a quantum repeater with the stored density

the entanglement rate of the quantum repeaters at the different entanglement
swapping sets as function of the noise of the local memory and local

based on conceptualizations introduced by the Functional Requirements for
Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System

comparative analysis, the dataset comprises a thesaurus (Eurovoc), a subject
headings system (LCSH) and a classification scheme (DDC). These are compared
with an ontology (CIDOC-CRM) by focusing on how they define and handle concepts
and relations. It was observed that LCSH and DDC focus on the formalism of
character strings (nomens) rather than on the modelling of semantics; their
definition of what constitutes a concept is quite fuzzy, and they comprise a
large number of complex concepts. By contrast, thesauri have a coherent
definition of what constitutes a concept, and apply a systematic approach to
the modelling of relations. Ontologies explicitly define diverse types of
relations, and are by their nature machine-processable. The paper concludes
that the potential of both the expressiveness and machine processability of
each KOS is extensively regulated by its structural rules. It is harder to
represent subject headings and classification schemes as semantic networks with
nodes and arcs, while thesauri are more suitable for such a representation. In
addition, a paradigm shift is revealed which focuses on the modelling of
relations between concepts, rather than the concepts themselves.

expect to probe primordial physics beyond the overall shape and amplitude of
the main, smooth and slowly-changing part of the inflaton potential. Using the

nine fiducial power spectra that contain suppression and wiggles at different
cosmological scales, using the Wiggly Whipped Inflation (WWI) framework to
generate these features in the primordial spectrum. We include both Euclid
cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, with a conservative cut-off for non-linear
scales. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, we obtain an improvement in
constraints in the WWI potential, as well an improvement for the background

identify oscillations in the primordial spectrum that are present within

observe that the several events of time dilation that the particle undergoes
exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions. However, the structure of the

coordinate transformations. This occurs because the singularities are closely
related to the chaotic saddle. We then demonstrate using a Cantor-like set

anonymity in the data itself, as well as schemes that 'mix' the data to prevent
tracing the data back to the source by using network identifiers. This mixing
is usually implemented by utilizing special mix networks in the data collection
framework. In this paper we focus on schemes for mixing the data where the
participants do not need to trust the mix network or the data collector with
hiding the source of the data so that we can evaluate the efficacy of peer to
peer mixing strategies in the real world. To achieve this, we present a simple
opportunistic multi-party shuffling scheme to mix the data and effectively
obfuscate the source of the data. We successfully simulate 3 cases with

horizontal surface and near-surface solar flows (L\""optien at al. 2018). We are
interested in understanding why only the sectoral modes are seen in the
observations and also in modelling the radial structure of the observed modes.
To do so, we characterise here the radial eigenfunctions of r modes for
slowly-rotating polytropes in uniform rotation. We find that for free-surface
boundary conditions on a spheroid of non-vanishing surface density, r modes can
only exist for $\ell=m$ spherical harmonics in the inviscid case, and we
compute their depth dependence and frequencies to leading order. For
quasi-adiabatic stratification the sectoral modes with no radial nodes are the
only modes which are almost toroidal and the depth dependence of the
corresponding horizontal motion scales as $r^m$. For all r modes except the
zero radial order sectoral ones, non-adiabatic stratification plays a crucial
role in the radial force balance. The lack of quasi-toroidal solutions when
stratification is close to neutral, except for the sectoral modes without nodes
in radius, follows from the statement that the system needs to be in both
horizontal and radial force balance. In the absence of super- or subadiabatic
stratification and viscosity, both the horizontal and radial force balances
independently determine the pressure perturbation. The only quasi-toroidal
cases in which the two determinations of the pressure perturbation are
consistent are the special cases where $\ell=m$, and the horizontal
displacement scales with $r^m$.

in the inequalities of Brunn-Minkowski type, such as the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski
conjecture of B\""or\""oczky, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang, and the Dimensional
Brunn-Minkowski conjecture of Gardner and Zvavitch, in a unified framework. We
obtain several new results for these conjectures.
  We show that when $K\subset L,$ the multiplicative form of the
$L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture holds for Lebesgue measure for $p\geq
1-Cn^{-0.75}$, which improves upon the estimate of Kolesnikov and Milman in the
partial case when one body is contained in the other.
  We also show that the multiplicative version of the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski
conjecture for the standard Gaussian measure holds in the case of sets
containing sufficiently large ball (whose radius depends on $p$). In
particular, the Gaussian Log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture holds when $K$ and $L$
contain $\sqrt{0.5 (n+1)}B_2^n.$
  We formulate an a-priori stronger conjecture for log-concave measures,
extending both the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture and the Dimensional one,
and verify it in the case when the sets are dilates and the measure is
Gaussian. We also show that the Log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture, if verified,
would yield this more general family of inequalities.
  Our results build up on the methods developed by Kolesnikov and Milman as
well as Colesanti, Livshyts, Marsiglietti. We furthermore verify that the local

facilely synthesized from resol oligomers in the presence of ZnCl2 and
poloxamers. The gradient nanostructures are formed by stacking phenolic
nanoparticles with gradually enlarged diameters as the distance from the upper
surface increases. The use of poloxamers for creating gelation surroundings is
of great significance for controlling the growth of phenolic nanoparticles,
which in turn dictates the performance of the phenolic membranes thus-produced.
Hence, a study of the effects of poloxamers species on the preparation of the
phenolic membranes is highly demanded since such robust membranes have much
potential to be scale up for mass production. Herein, the poloxamer Pluronic
F127 (EO106-PO70-EO106; EO = ethyleneoxide, PO = propyleneoxide) was introduced
in the membrane-forming formulations. As opposed to P123 (EO20-PO70-EO20) that
we used previously, F127 possessing extended PEO chains can delay the gelation
during membrane formation. Hence, the phenolic nucleates are able to grow for
longer durations, leading to the generation of more distinct gradient
nanostructures in the phenolic membranes. Enhanced permeance can then be
realized with F127-derived phenolic membranes. We also demonstrate that L31
(EO1-PO22-EO1) with merely single terminal EO units at the ends of the PPO
block could be used to prepare gradient phenolic membranes. This work is not
only much helpful to deeply understand the design of the structural gradient in
phenolic membranes, but capable of sheding light on the development of such
intriguing structures for water purification.

over a long wavelength when compared to their parent cubic structures. From an
ab initio simulation perspective, this requires accurate calculations including
many thousands of atoms; a task well beyond the remit of traditional plane
wave-based density functional theory (DFT). We suggest that this void can be
filled using the methodology implemented in the large-scale DFT code, CONQUEST,
using a local pseudoatomic orbital (PAO) basis. Whilst this basis has been
tested before for some structural and energetic properties, none have treated
the most fundamental quantity to the theory, the charge density $n(\mathbf{r})$
itself. An accurate description of $n(\mathbf{r})$ is vital to the perovskite
oxides due to the crucial role played by short-range restoring forces
(characterised by bond covalency) and long range coulomb forces as suggested by
the soft-mode theory of Cochran and Anderson. We find that modestly sized basis
sets of PAOs can reproduce the plane-wave charge density to a total integrated
error of better than 0.5% and provide Bader partitioned ionic charges, volumes
and average charge densities to similar degree of accuracy. Further, the
multi-mode antiferroelectric distortion of PbZrO$_3$ and its associated
energetics are reproduced by better than 99% when compared to plane-waves. This

compact basis sets of pseudoatomic orbitals can achieve the same accuracy as
high cutoff energy plane-wave calculations. When paired with the CONQUEST code,
calculations with high electronic and structural accuracy can now be performed
on many thousands of atoms, even on systems as delicate as the perovskite

Joint Species Distribution models (JSDMs) explain spatial variation in
community composition by contributions of the environment, biotic associations,
and possibly spatially structured residual covariance. They show great promise
as a general analytical framework for community ecology and macroecology, but
current JSDMs, even when approximated by latent variables, scale poorly on
large datasets, limiting their usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g.,
metabarcoding and metagenomics) community datasets. 2. Here, we present a
novel, more scalable JSDM (sjSDM) that circumvents the need to use latent
variables by using a Monte-Carlo integration of the joint JSDM likelihood and
allows flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We
implemented sjSDM in PyTorch, a modern machine learning framework that can make
use of CPU and GPU calculations. Using simulated communities with known
species-species associations and different number of species and sites, we
compare sjSDM with state-of-the-art JSDM implementations to determine
computational runtimes and accuracy of the inferred species-species and
species-environmental associations. 3. We find that sjSDM is orders of
magnitude faster than existing JSDM algorithms (even when run on the CPU) and
can be scaled to very large datasets. Despite the dramatically improved speed,
sjSDM produces more accurate estimates of species association structures than
alternative JSDM implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of sjSDM to
big community data using eDNA case study with thousands of fungi operational
taxonomic units (OTU). 4. Our sjSDM approach makes the analysis of JSDMs to
large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible,
substantially extending the applicability of JSDMs in ecology. We provide our
method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for practical data
analysis.

a single task, rather than slowly over a family of tasks. Crucially, our
meta-critic framework is designed for off-policy based learners, which

possess a hydrodynamically stable stellar atmosphere where a magnetic field can

we focus on additional contributions to the invisible decay width of $Z$ boson
as well as the leptonic $\tau$ decay width in the presence of a neutrino
coupling to a relatively light scalar. For invisible $Z$ decays we derive a
complete set of constraints by considering both three-body bremsstrahlung as

regarded to give rather weak limits we find that through the interference with
the Standard Model diagram it actually yields a competitive constraint. As far
as leptonic decays of $\tau$ are concerned, we derive a first limit on neutrino
self-interactions that is valid across the whole mass range of a light scalar
mediator. Our bounds on the neutrino self-interaction are leading for $m_\phi
\gtrsim 300$ MeV and interactions that prefer $\nu_\tau$. Bounds on such
$\nu$-philic scalar are particularly relevant in light of the recently proposed
alleviation of the Hubble tension in the presence of such couplings.

both cases when the field exhibits short and long memory, i.e. integrable and
non-integrable temporal covariance. It turns out that the limiting distribution
is not universal, depending both on the memory parameters and the threshold. In
particular, in the long memory case a form of Berry's cancellation phenomenon
occurs at zero-level, inducing phase transitions for both variance rates and

PGO and show that our proposed methods are guaranteed to converge to
first-order critical points under mild conditions. Furthermore, since our
proposed methods rely a proximal operator of distributed PGO, the convergence
rate can be significantly accelerated with Nesterov's method, and more
importantly, the acceleration induces no compromise of theoretical guarantees.
In addition, we also present accelerated majorization minimization methods to
the distributed chordal initialization that have a quadratic convergence, which
can be used to compute an initial guess for distributed PGO. The efficacy of
this work is validated through applications on a number of 2D and 3D SLAM

indicates that our proposed methods have faster convergence and result in
better solutions to distributed PGO.

generate synthetic transmission and emission spectra and assess their potential
observability with the future James Webb Space Telescope and ARIEL. Our results
suggest that HCN is a strong indicator of a high C/O ratio, which is similar to
what is found for H-dominated atmospheres. We find that these worlds are likely
to possess C/O > 1.0, and that HCN, CN, CO should be the primary molecules to
be searched for in thermal emission. For lower temperatures (T < 1500 K), we
additionally find NH3 in high N/O ratio cases, and C2H4, CH4 in low N/O ratio

make CN, CO and NO exceptionally prominent molecules to look for in the 0.6 -

unsuitability for such application as properties of traffic flow do not meet

each traffic flow measurement behaves as a separate subject which did not go
through all the lower levels of intensity (did not ""age""). An alternative
method is proposed. It fits the resulting cumulative frequency of breakdowns
with respect to the traffic flow intensity leading to the breakdown instead of
directly estimating the underlying probability distribution of capacity.
Analyses of accuracy and sensitivity to data quantity and censoring rate of the
new method are provided along with comparison to the PLM. The results prove
unsuitability of the PLM and MLE methods in general. The new method is then
used in a case study which compares capacity of a work-zone with and without a

However, past research has shown that the reported issue types often do not
match the description of the issue.
  Objective: We want to understand the overall maturity of the state of the art
of issue type prediction with the goal to predict if issues are bugs and
evaluate if we can improve existing models by incorporating manually specified
knowledge about issues.
  Method: We train different models for the title and description of the issue
to account for the difference in structure between these fields, e.g., the
length. Moreover, we manually detect issues whose description contains a null
pointer exception, as these are strong indicators that issues are bugs.
  Results: Our approach performs best overall, but not significantly different
from an approach from the literature based on the fastText classifier from
Facebook AI Research. The small improvements in prediction performance are due
to structural information about the issues we used. We found that using
information about the content of issues in form of null pointer exceptions is
not useful. We demonstrate the usefulness of issue type prediction through the
example of labelling bugfixing commits.
  Conclusions: Issue type prediction can be a useful tool if the use case
allows either for a certain amount of missed bug reports or the prediction of
too many issues as bug is acceptable.

study the communication patterns and local solvers and their effect on the

reflect the varying levels of violence in the dynamical evolution of planetary
systems. Previous work suggested that the relative violence of the dynamical
evolution of planetary systems with similar orbital architectures can be
compared through the computation of their angular momentum deficit (AMD). We
investigated the possibility of using a more general metric to perform
analogous comparisons between planetary systems with different orbital
architectures. We considered a modified version of the AMD, the normalized
angular momentum deficit (NAMD), and used it to study a sample of 99
multi-planet systems containing both the currently best-characterized
extrasolar systems and the solar system, that is, planetary systems with both
compact and wide orbital architectures. We verified that the NAMD allows us to
compare the violence of the dynamical histories of multi-planet systems with
different orbital architectures. We identified an anticorrelation between the
NAMD and the multiplicity of the planetary systems, of which the previously
observed eccentricity-multiplicity anticorrelation is a reflection. Our results
seem to indicate that phases of dynamical instabilities and chaotic evolution
are not uncommon among planetary systems. They also suggest that the efficiency
of the planetary formation process in producing high-multiplicity systems is
likely to be higher than that suggested by their currently known population.

based on renewable energy, and energy storage devices has deeply modified power
systems. As a consequence, demand response, the ability of customers to respond
to regulating signals, has moved from large high-voltage and medium-voltage
end-users to small, low-voltage, customers. In order to be effective, the
participation to demand response of such small players must be gathered by
aggregators. The role and the business models of these new entities have been
studied in literature from a variety of viewpoints. Demand response can be
clearly applied by sending a dedicated price signal to customers, but this
methodology cannot obtain a diverse, punctual, predictable, and reliable
response. These characteristics can be achieved by directly controlling the
loads units. This approach involves communication problems and technological
readiness. This paper proposes a fully decentralized mixed integer linear
programming approach for demand response. In this framework, each load unit
performs an optimization, subject to technical and user-based constraints, and
gives to the aggregator a desired profile along with a reserve, which is
guaranteed to comply with the constraints. In this way, the aggregator can
trade the reserve coming from several load units, being the only interface to
the market. Upon request, then, the aggregator communicates to the load units
the modifications to their desired profiles without either knowing or caring
how this modification would be accomplished. The effectiveness is simulated on
200 realistic load units.

recently proposed. The common denominator of these algorithms is to discard low
critical tasks whenever high critical tasks are in lack of computation
resources. This is achieved upon a switch of the scheduling mode from Normal to
Critical. We distinguish two main categories of the algorithms: system-level
mode switch and task-level mode switch. System-level mode algorithms allow low
criticality (LC) tasks to execute only in normal mode. Task-level mode switch
algorithms enable to switch the mode of an individual high criticality task
(HC), from low (LO) to high (HI), to obtain priority over all LC tasks. This
paper investigates an online scheduling algorithm for mixed-criticality systems
that supports dynamic mode switches for both task level and system level. When
a HC task job overruns its LC budget, then only that particular job is switched
to HI mode. If the job cannot be accommodated, then the system switches to
Critical mode. To accommodate for resource availability of the HC jobs, the LC
tasks are degraded by stretching their periods until the Critical mode
exhibiting job complete its execution. The stretching will be carried out until
the resource availability is met. We have mechanized and implemented the
proposed algorithm using Uppaal. To study the efficiency of our scheduling
algorithm, we examine a case study and compare our results to the state of the

known that the solution $u(t,s)$ converges locally uniformly to 1 and our aim
here is to understand how fast this invasion process occur. When $f$ is a
Fisher-KPP type nonlinearity and $s \in (0,1)$, it is known that the level set

nonlinearities $f$ and any $s\in (0,1)$ we derive generic estimates on the
position of the level sets of the solution $u(t,x)$ which then enable us to
describe more precisely the behaviour of this invasion process. In particular,
we obtain a algebraic generic upper bound on the ""speed"" of level set
highlighting the delicate interplay of $s$ and $f$ in the existence of an
exponential acceleration process. When $s\in\left (0,\frac{1}{2}\right]$ and
$f$ is of ignition type, we also complete the known description of the
behaviour of $u$ and give a precise asymptotic of the speed of the level set in
this context. Notably, we prove that the level sets accelerate when
$s\in\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ and that in the critical case $s=\frac{1}{2}$
although no travelling front can exist, the level sets still move
asymptotically at a constant speed. These new results are in sharp contrast
with the bistable situation where no such acceleration may occur, highlighting
therefore the qualitative difference between the two type of nonlinearities.

SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the
existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the

applications of these results to the problem of robustness of control policies

sufficient conditions presented in the literature for discounted-cost problems
are in general not sufficient to ensure robustness for average-cost problems.
However, we show that the average optimal cost is continuous in the
convergences of controlled transition kernel models where convergence of models
entails (i) continuous weak convergence in state and actions, and (ii)
continuous setwise convergence in the actions for every fixed state variable,
in addition to either uniform ergodicity or some regularity conditions. We
establish that the mismatch error due to the application of a control policy
designed for an incorrectly estimated model to the true model decreases to zero
as the incorrect model approaches the true model under the stated convergence
criteria. Our findings significantly relax related studies in the literature
which have primarily considered the more restrictive total variation
convergence criteria. Applications to robustness to models estimated through
empirical data (where almost sure weak convergence criterion typically holds,
but stronger criteria do not) are studied and conditions for asymptotic
robustness to data-driven learning are established.

proposed method operates directly on raw sensor signals without requiring such
preprocessing. Though there also exist methods applicable to raw sensor signals
called track-before-detect, the proposed method has significant advantages over
them. First, it is general without any restrictions on observation/process
noise statistics (e.g., Gaussian) or the functional form of each target's
contribution to the sensors (e.g., linear, separable, binary). Especially, it
includes Salmond et al.'s track-before-detect particle filter for a single

theory of fractional-dimension spaces and its applications to Newtonian
gravity. In particular, Gauss's law for gravity as well as other fundamental
classical laws are extended to a $D$-dimensional metric space, where $D$ can be
a non-integer dimension.
  We show a possible connection between this Newtonian Fractional-Dimension
Gravity (NFDG) and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), a leading alternative
gravity model which accounts for the observed properties of galaxies and other
astrophysical structures without requiring the dark matter hypothesis. The MOND
acceleration constant $a_{0} \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{ -10}\mbox{m}\thinspace
\mbox{s}^{ -2}$ can be related to a natural scale length $l_{0}$ in NFDG, i.e.,
$a_{0} \approx GM/l_{0}^{2}$, for astrophysical structures of mass $M$, and the
deep-MOND regime is present in regions of space where the dimension is reduced
to $D \approx 2$.
  For several fundamental spherically-symmetric structures, we compare MOND
results, such as the empirical Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), circular
speed plots, and logarithmic plots of the observed radial acceleration
$g_{obs}$ vs. the baryonic radial acceleration $g_{bar}$, with NFDG results. We
show that our model is capable of reproducing these results using a variable
local dimension $D\left (w\right )$, where $w =r/l_{0}$ is a dimensionless
radial coordinate. At the moment, we are unable to derive explicitly this
dimension function $D\left (w\right )$ from first principles, but it can be
obtained empirically in each case from the general RAR.
  Additional work on the subject, including studies of axially-symmetric
structures, detailed galactic rotation curves fitting, and a possible
relativistic extension, will be needed to establish NFDG as a viable
alternative model of gravity.

comprised of three components: (i) an automated technique for the

technique based on fuzzy graphs that allows for capturing the imprecision of
value dependencies, and (iii) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that
takes into account user preferences and value dependencies identified from

significant progress in the recent decade. Unlike the realistic visual images,

images result the caricature-visual face recognition is a cross-modal problem.
In this paper, we propose a method to conduct caricature-visual face

learning with fixed weights of tasks, this work proposes an approach to learn
the weights of tasks according to the importance of tasks. The proposed
multi-task learning with dynamic tasks weights enables to appropriately train
the hard task and easy task instead of being stuck in the over-training easy

effectiveness of the proposed dynamic multi-task learning for cross-modal

the effect of a daily PEMF-exposure on osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs
seeded onto nanostructured $TiO_{2}$ (with clusters under 100 nm of dimension)
was investigated. $TiO_{2}$-seeded cells were exposed to PEMF (magnetic field
intensity: 2 mT; intensity of induced electric field: 5 mV; frequency: 75 Hz)
and examined in terms of cell physiology modifications and osteogenic
differentiation. Results showed that PEMF exposure affected $TiO_{2}$-seeded
cells osteogenesis by interfering with selective calcium-related osteogenic
pathways, and greatly enhanced hBM-MSCs osteogenic features such as the
expression of early/late osteogenic genes and protein production (e.g., ALP,
COL-I, osteocalcin and osteopontin) and ALP activity. Finally, PEMF-treated
cells resulted to secrete into conditioned media higher amounts of BMP-2, DCN
and COL-I than untreated cell cultures. These findings confirm once more the
osteoinductive potential of PEMF, suggesting that its combination with
$TiO_{2}$ nanostructured surface might be a great option in bone tissue

mandible segmentation from CT images. First, 202 images of Head and Neck cancer
patients were collected from our clinical database, where the organs-at-risk
were annotated by one of 12 planning dosimetrists. The mandibles were roughly
annotated as the planning avoiding structure. Then, mandible labels were
checked and corrected by a physician to get clean annotations. At last, by
varying the ratios of noisy labels in the training data, deep learning-based
segmentation models were trained, one for each ratio. In general, a deep
network trained with noisy labels had worse segmentation results than that
trained with clean labels, and fewer noisy labels led to better segmentation.
When using 20% or less noisy cases for training, no significant difference was
found on the prediction performance between the models trained by noisy or
clean. This study suggests that deep learning-based medical image segmentation
is robust to noisy annotations to some extent. It also highlights the
importance of labeling quality in deep learning

massive amount of building sensing data by the equipped sensors. Indeed,
building sensing data provides a promising way to enrich a series of
data-demanding and cost-expensive urban mobile applications. In this paper, we
study how to reuse building sensing data to predict traffic volume on nearby
roads. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to achieve accurate prediction on such
cross-domain data with two major challenges. First, relationships between
building sensing data and traffic data are not unknown as prior, and the
spatio-temporal complexities impose more difficulties to uncover the underlying
reasons behind the above relationships. Second, it is even more daunting to
accurately predict traffic volume with dynamic building-traffic correlations,
which are cross-domain, non-linear, and time-varying. To address the above
challenges, we design and implement BuildSenSys, a first-of-its-kind system for
nearby traffic volume prediction by reusing building sensing data. First, we
conduct a comprehensive building-traffic analysis based on multi-source
datasets, disclosing how and why building sensing data is correlated with
nearby traffic volume. Second, we propose a novel recurrent neural network for
traffic volume prediction based on cross-domain learning with two attention
mechanisms. Specifically, a cross-domain attention mechanism captures the
building-traffic correlations and adaptively extracts the most relevant
building sensing data at each predicting step. Then, a temporal attention
mechanism is employed to model the temporal dependencies of data across
historical time intervals. The extensive experimental studies demonstrate that
BuildSenSys outperforms all baseline methods with up to 65.3% accuracy
improvement (e.g., 2.2% MAPE) in predicting nearby traffic volume.

of primes by recent work of Dawsey, Sweeting and Woo, and Kural et al. This
would give us several new analogues. In particular, we get that if $(k,
\ell)=1$, then $$-\sum_{\begin{smallmatrix}n\geq 2\\ p(n)\equiv \ell
(\operatorname{mod} k) \end{smallmatrix}} \frac{\mu(n)}{\varphi(n)} =
\frac1{\varphi(k)},$$ where $p(n)$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$, and
$\varphi(n)$ is Euler's totient function. This refines one of Hardy's formulas
in 1921. At the end, we give some examples for the $\varphi(n)$ replaced by
functions ""near $n$"", which include the sum-of-divisors function.

individual patients. In some settings, this data is difficult to obtain due to
privacy restrictions. In Germany, for example, it is not possible to pool
routine data from different hospitals for research purposes without the consent
of the patients. The DataSHIELD software provides an infrastructure and a set
of statistical methods for joint analyses of distributed data. The contained
algorithms are reformulated to work with aggregated data from the participating
sites instead of the individual data. If a desired algorithm is not implemented
in DataSHIELD or cannot be reformulated in such a way, using artificial data is
an alternative. We present a methodology together with a software
implementation that builds on DataSHIELD to create artificial data that
preserve complex patterns from distributed individual patient data. Such data
sets of artificial patients, which are not linked to real patients, can then be
used for joint analyses. We use deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) as generative
models for capturing the distribution of data. For the implementation, we
employ the package ""BoltzmannMachines"" from the Julia programming language and
wrap it for use with DataSHIELD, which is based on R. As an exemplary
application, we conduct a distributed analysis with DBMs on a synthetic data
set, which simulates genetic variant data. Patterns from the original data can
be recovered in the artificial data using hierarchical clustering of the
virtual patients, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. Our
implementation adds to DataSHIELD the ability to generate artificial data that
can be used for various analyses, e. g. for pattern recognition with deep

extended with advanced algorithms from languages other than R.

These budgets are primarily used as guidance to determine when the scheduler

in this paper we propose a dynamic MC scheduling model under which
low-criticality budgets for individual high-criticality applications are
determined at runtime as opposed to being fixed offline. To ensure sufficient
budget for high-criticality applications at all times, we use offline
schedulability analysis to determine a system-wide total low-criticality budget
allocation for all the high-criticality applications combined. This total
budget is used as guidance in our model to determine the need for a
mode-switch. The runtime strategy then distributes this total budget among the
various applications depending on their execution requirement and with the
objective of postponing mode-switch as much as possible. We show that this
runtime strategy is able to postpone mode-switches for a longer time than any
strategy that uses a fixed low-criticality budget allocation for each
application. Finally, since we are able to control the total budget allocation
for high-criticality applications before mode-switch, we also propose
techniques to determine these budgets considering system-wide objectives such
as schedulability and service guarantee for low-criticality applications.

performance in semantic image segmentation. However, state-of-the-art
DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods usually suffer from high computational
complexity due to the use of complex network architectures. This greatly limits
their applications in the real-world scenarios that require real-time
processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based
method for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves
a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight
Baseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used
as our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the
Distinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the
different sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive
semantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales.
Meanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional
layers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the
detailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion
Network (FFN) is used to effectively combine both shallow and deep features
from the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively.
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively
achieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
with the inference speed of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes

demonstrates that the proposed method offers excellent performance at the
real-time speed for semantic segmentation of urban street scenes.

place at resonance, where the effective photon mass is equal to the axion mass.
This requirement fixes the axion mass at 200 eV. An axion at this mass scale
reproduces the cold dark matter scenario. If our interpretation prevails, with
the help of axions we can establish an axion tomography of the Earth.

perception based autonomy tasks like image segmentation, object detection,

with multimodal factors like weather conditions, time-of-day, traffic-density,
etc. The LECs learn from these factors during training, and while testing if
there is variation in any of these factors, the components get confused
resulting in low confidence predictions. The images with factors not seen
during training is commonly referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). For safe
autonomy it is important to identify the OOD images, so that a suitable
mitigation strategy can be performed. Classical one-class classifiers like SVM
and SVDD are used to perform OOD detection. However, the multiple labels
attached to the images in these datasets, restricts the direct application of
these techniques. We address this problem using the latent space of the
$\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE). We use the fact that compact
latent space generated by an appropriately selected $\beta$-VAE will encode the
information about these factors in a few latent variables, and that can be used
for computationally inexpensive detection. We evaluate our approach on the
nuScenes dataset, and our results shows the latent space of $\beta$-VAE is
sensitive to encode changes in the values of the generative factor.

dipoles (i.e. two gravitational charges of the same magnitude but opposite

creates a halo of the polarized quantum vacuum around itself, which acts as an
additional source of gravity. There is a maximal magnitude g_qvmax, of the
gravitational acceleration that can be caused by the polarized quantum vacuum;
the small size of this magnitude is the reason why in some cases (for instance
within the Solar System) the quantum vacuum can be neglected. Advanced

(premises) when proving new goals over large formal libraries. Unlike previous
methods that choose sets of facts independently of each other by their rank,
the new method uses the notion of \emph{state} that is updated each time a
choice of a fact is made. Our stateful architecture is based on recurrent
neural networks which have been recently very successful in stateful tasks such
as language translation. The new method is combined with data augmentation
techniques, evaluated in several ways on a standard large-theory benchmark, and
compared to state-of-the-art premise approach based on gradient boosted trees.
It is shown to perform significantly better and to solve many new problems.
