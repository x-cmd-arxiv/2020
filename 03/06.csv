train the network such that it can denoise as well as the best sliding window
denoiser for any given underlying clean source data. Our algorithm, dubbed as
Generalized CUDE (Gen-CUDE), enjoys several desirable properties; it can be
trained in an unsupervised manner (solely based on the noisy observation data),
has much smaller computational complexity compared to the previously developed
universal denoiser for the same setting, and has much tighter upper bound on
the denoising performance, which is obtained by a theoretical analysis. In our

showing that Gen-CUDE achieves much better denoising results compared to other
strong baselines for both synthetic and real underlying clean sequences.

victim model ${\mathcal M}$ by following the gradient of some attack objective
functions, either explicitly or implicitly. To confuse and detect such attacks,
we take the proactive approach that modifies those functions with the goal of
misleading the attacks to some local minimals, or to some designated regions
that can be easily picked up by an analyzer. To achieve this goal, we propose
adding a large number of artifacts, which we called $attractors$, onto the
otherwise smooth function. An attractor is a point in the input space, where
samples in its neighborhood have gradient pointing toward it. We observe that
decoders of watermarking schemes exhibit properties of attractors and give a
generic method that injects attractors from a watermark decoder into the victim
model ${\mathcal M}$. This principled approach allows us to leverage on known
watermarking schemes for scalability and robustness and provides explainability
of the outcomes. Experimental studies show that our method has competitive
performance. For instance, for un-targeted attacks on CIFAR-10 dataset, we can
reduce the overall attack success rate of DeepFool to 1.9%, whereas known
defense LID, FS and MagNet can reduce the rate to 90.8%, 98.5% and 78.5%

to be a promising and competitive tool for constraining mass profiles and
cosmological parameters in an accelerating universe. However, the observed
line-of-sight escape profile is known to be suppressed compared to the
underlying 3D radial (or tangential) escape profile. Past work has suggested
that velocity anisotropy in the phase-space data is the root cause. Instead, we
find that the observed suppression is from the statistical undersampling of the
phase spaces and that the 3D radial escape edge can be accurately inferred from
projected data. We build an analytical model for this suppression that only
requires the number of observed galaxies $N$ in the phase-space data within the
sky-projected range $0.3 \le r_\perp/R_{200, \text{critical}} \le 1$. The
radially averaged suppression function is an inverse power law $\langle
Z_\text{v} \rangle = 1 + (N_0/N)^\lambda$ with $N_0 = 17.818$ and $\lambda=
0.362$. We test our model with $N$-body simulations, using dark matter
particles, subhalos, and semianalytic galaxies as the phase-space tracers, and
find excellent agreement. We also assess the model for systematic biases from
cosmology ($\Omega_{\Lambda}$, $H_0$), cluster mass ($M_{200,
\text{critical}}$), and velocity anisotropy ($\beta$). We find that varying
these parameters over large ranges can impart a maximal additional fractional
change in $\langle Z_\text{v} \rangle$ of $2.7\%$. These systematics are highly
subdominant (by at least a factor of 13.7) to the suppression from $N$.

logarithmic growth of one's account value, involves optimization of the
so-called betting fraction $K$. In this Letter, we extend the classical
formulation to allow for temporal correlation among bets. To demonstrate the
potential of this new paradigm, for simplicity of exposition, we mainly address
the case of a coin-flipping game with even-money payoff. To this end, we solve
a problem with memory depth $m$. By this, we mean that the outcomes of coin
flips are no longer assumed to be i.i.d.random variables. Instead, the
probability of heads on flip $k$ depends on previous flips $k-1,k-2,...,k-m$.
For the simplest case of $n$ flips, with $m = 1$, we obtain a closed form
solution $K_n$ for the optimal betting fraction. This generalizes the classical
result for the memoryless case. That is, instead of fraction $K^* = 2p-1$ which
pervades the literature for a coin with probability of heads $p\geq 1/2$, our
new fraction $K_n$ depends on both $n$ and the parameters associated with the
temporal correlation. Generalizations of these results for $m > 1$ and
numerical simulations are also included. Finally, we indicate how the theory
extends to time-varying feedback and alternative payoff distributions.

fundamentally limited by its accessibility of the channel gradient. To overcome
this major burden, the idea of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that
learn to mimic the actual channel behavior has been recently proposed in the
literature. Contrarily to handcrafted classical channel modeling, which can
never fully capture the real world, GANs promise, in principle, the ability to
learn any physical impairment, enabled by the data-driven learning algorithm.
In this work, we verify the concept of GAN-based autoencoder training in actual
over-the-air (OTA) measurements. To improve training stability, we first extend
the concept to conditional Wasserstein GANs and embed it into a
state-of-the-art autoencoder-architecture, including bitwise estimates and an
outer channel code. Further, in the same framework, we compare the existing
three different training approaches: model-based pre-training with receiver
finetuning, reinforcement learning (RL) and GAN-based channel modeling. For
this, we show advantages and limitations of GAN-based end-to-end training. In
particular, for non-linear effects, it turns out that learning the whole
exploration space becomes prohibitively complex. Finally, we show that the
training strategy benefits from a simpler (training) data acquisition when
compared to RL-based training, which requires continuous transmitter weight
updates. This becomes an important practical bottleneck due to limited
bandwidth and latency between transmitter and training algorithm that may even
operate at physically different locations.

provide bubble nucleation rates in a wide temperature range. Seeding has been
successfully applied to investigate the nucleation of crystals in supercooled

""Co-teaching+"" claim that the ""disagreement"" strategy is crucial for
alleviating the problem of learning with noisy labels. In this paper, we start
from a different perspective and propose a robust learning paradigm called
JoCoR, which aims to reduce the diversity of two networks during training.
Specifically, we first use two networks to make predictions on the same
mini-batch data and calculate a joint loss with Co-Regularization for each
training example. Then we select small-loss examples to update the parameters
of both two networks simultaneously. Trained by the joint loss, these two
networks would be more and more similar due to the effect of Co-Regularization.
Extensive experimental results on corrupted data from benchmark datasets
including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M demonstrate that JoCoR is
superior to many state-of-the-art approaches for learning with noisy labels.

faced major obstacles. In this article, we lay out the foundations of a
framework -- built upon notions from algebraic combinatorics and discrete
geometry -- that allows a deeper understanding of geometric realizations of
subword complexes of Coxeter groups. Namely, we describe explicitly a family of
chirotopes that encapsulate the necessary information to obtain geometric
realizations of subword complexes. Further, we show that the space of geometric
realizations of this family covers that of subword complexes, making this
combinatorially defined family into a natural object to study.
  The family of chirotopes is described through certain parameter matrices.
That is, given a finite Coxeter group, we present matrices where certain minors
have prescribed signs. Parameter matrices are universal: The existence of these
matrices combined with conditions in terms of Schur functions is equivalent to
the realizability of all subword complexes of this Coxeter group as chirotopes.
Finally, parameter matrices provide extensions of combinatorial identities; for
instance, the Vandermonde determinant and the dual Cauchy identity are
recovered through suitable choices of parameters.

with which ice homogeneously nucleates in supercooled water. Such rate is often
measured in drops to avoid the presence of impurities. At large supercooling
small (nanoscopic) drops must be used to prevent simultaneous nucleation
events. The pressure inside such drops is larger than the atmospheric one by
virtue of the Laplace equation. In this work, we take into account such
pressure raise in order to predict the nucleation rate in droplets using the
TIP4P/Ice water model. We start from a recent estimate of the maximum drop size
that can be used at each supercooling avoiding simultaneous nucleation events
[Espinosa et al. J. Chem. Phys., 2016]. We then evaluate the pressure inside
the drops with the Laplace equation. Finally, we obtain the rate as a function
of the supercooling by interpolating our previous results for 1 and 2000 bar
[Espinosa et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2016] using the Classical Nucleation Theory
expression for the rate. This requires, in turn, interpolating the ice-water
interfacial free energy and chemical potential difference. The TIP4P/Ice rate
curve thus obtained is in good agreement with most droplet-based experiments.
In particular, we find a good agreement with measurements performed using
nanoscopic drops, that are currently under debate. The successful comparison
between model and experiments suggests that TIP4P/Ice is a reliable model to
study the water-to-ice transition and that Classical Nucleation Theory is a
good framework to understand it.

has been recently proposed for motion planning problems of autonomous vehicles
to deal with constraints such as obstacle avoidance and reference tracking.
However, the previous work considers either deterministic trajectories or
persistent prediction for target dynamical obstacles. The other drawback is
lack of generality - it requires manual weight tuning for different scenarios.
In this paper, two significant improvements are achieved. Firstly, a two-stage
uncertainty-aware prediction is proposed. The short-term prediction with safety
guarantee based on reachability analysis is responsible for dealing with
extreme maneuvers conducted by target vehicles. The long-term prediction
leveraging an adaptive least square filter preserves the long-term optimality
of the planned trajectory since using reachability only for long-term
prediction is too pessimistic and makes the planner over-conservative.
Secondly, to allow a wider coverage over different scenarios and to avoid
tedious parameter tuning case by case, this paper designs a scenario-based
analytical function taking the states from the ego vehicle and the target
vehicle as input, and carrying weights of a cost function as output. It allows
the ego vehicle to execute multiple behaviors (such as lane-keeping and
overtaking) under a single planner. We demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and
real-time performance of the proposed planner in simulations.

proposed governing PDE system also contains the effect of heat conduction and
can be shown to be symmetric and thermodynamically compatible.
  In this paper we extend the GPR model to the simulation of nonlinear dynamic
rupture processes and material fatigue effects, by adding a new scalar variable
to the governing PDE system. This extra parameter describes the material damage
and is governed by an advection-reaction equation, where the stiff and highly
nonlinear reaction mechanisms depend on the ratio of the local von Mises stress
to the yield stress of the material. The stiff reaction mechanisms are
integrated in time via an efficient exponential time integrator. Due to the
multiple space-time scales, the model is solved on space-time adaptive
Cartesian meshes using high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes
with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiting.
  A key feature of our new model is the use of a twofold diffuse interface
approach that allows the cracks to form anywhere and at any time, independently
of the chosen computational grid, without requiring that the geometry of the
rupture fault be known a priori. We furthermore make use of a scalar volume
fraction function that indicates whether a given point is inside the solid or
outside, allowing the description of solids of arbitrarily complex shape.

include goals and obstacles. The backward flow provides precious background
information to the agent's behavior, viz., inferences coming from the future
determine the agent's actions. Probability tensors are layered in time in both
directions in a manner similar to convolutional neural networks. The discussion
is carried out with reference to a set of simulated grids where, despite the
apparent task complexity, a solution, if feasible, is always found. The
original model proposed by Attias has been extended to include non-absorbing
obstacles, multiple goals and multiple agents. The emerging behaviors are very
realistic and demonstrate great potentials of the application of this framework
to real environments.

aim to investigate the differences in solar cycle memory obtained from
advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated kinematic solar dynamo models.
Specifically, we explore whether the inclusion of Parker's mean-field $\alpha$
effect, in addition to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism, has any impact on the
memory of the solar cycle. We used a kinematic flux transport solar dynamo
model where poloidal field generation takes place due to both the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the mean-field $\alpha$ effect. We additionally
considered stochastic fluctuations in this model and explored cycle-to-cycle
correlations between the polar field at the minima and toroidal field at cycle
maxima. Solar dynamo memory is always limited to only one cycle in
diffusion-dominated dynamo regimes while in advection-dominated regimes the
memory is distributed over a few solar cycles. However, the addition of a
mean-field alpha effect reduces the memory of the solar dynamo to within one
cycle in the advection-dominated dynamo regime when there are no fluctuations
in the mean-field $\alpha$ effect. When fluctuations are introduced in the
mean-field poloidal source a more complex scenario is evident, with very weak
but significant correlations emerging across a few cycles. Our results imply
that inclusion of a mean-field alpha effect in the framework of a flux
transport Babcock-Leighton dynamo model leads to additional complexities that
may impact memory and predictability of predictive dynamo models of the solar
cycle.

detectors can comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter. Mass and spin
measurements from coalescences can be used to distinguish between an
astrophysical or a primordial origin of the binary black holes. In standard
scenarios the spin of primordial black holes is very small at formation.
However, the mass and spin can evolve through the cosmic history due to
accretion. We show that the mass and spin of primordial black holes are
correlated in a redshift-dependent fashion, in particular primordial black
holes with masses below ${\cal O}(30)M_\odot$ are likely non-spinning at any
redshift, whereas heavier black holes can be nearly extremal up to redshift
$z\sim10$. The dependence of the mass and spin distributions on the redshift
can be probed with future detectors such as the Einstein Telescope. The mass
and spin evolution affect the gravitational waveform parameters, in particular
the distribution of the final mass and spin of the merger remnant, and that of
the effective spin of the binary. We argue that, compared to the
astrophysical-formation scenario, a primordial origin of black hole binaries
might better explain the spin distribution of merger events detected by
LIGO-Virgo, in which the effective spin parameter of the binary is compatible
to zero except possibly for few high-mass events. Upcoming results from

challenging. The dense outflows increase the effective photospheric radius,
precluding direct observation of the Keplerian motion; instead the observables
are broad lines emitted over large radii in the stellar wind. Our analysis
reveals strong, systematic discrepancies between the radial velocities
extracted from different spectral lines: the more extended a line's emission
region, the greater the departure from the true orbital motion. To overcome
these challenges, we formulate a novel semi-analytical model which encapsulates
both the star's orbital motion and the propagation of the wind. The model
encodes the integrated velocity field of the out-flowing gas in terms of a
convolution of past motion due to the finite flow speed of the wind. We test
this model on two binary systems. (1), for the extreme case $\eta$ Carinae, in
which the effects are most prominent, we are able to fit the model to 10 Balmer
lines from H-alpha to H-kappa concurrently with a single set of orbital
parameters: time of periastron $T_{0}=2454848$ (JD), eccentricity $e=0.91$,
semi-amplitude $k=69$ km/s and longitude of periastron $\omega=241^\circ$. (2)
for a more typical case, the Wolf-Rayet star in RMC 140, we demonstrate that
for commonly used lines, such as He II and N III/IV/V, we expect deviations
between the Keplerian orbit and the predicted radial velocities. Our study
indicates that corrective modelling, such as presented here, is necessary in

denser environments than pairs and slightly less dense environments than
groups. When considering the position within the cosmic web we found that pairs

groups are more likely to reside in void walls. In agreement with these
results, the system-galaxy cross-correlation function shows that pairs inhabit
environments of lesser density compared to triplets and groups, and on small

the properties of neighbour galaxies of small systems we found that the
neighbours of groups present a lower fractions of star forming, young stellar

occur within a short period of time. Due to their spike-based computational
model, SNNs can process output from event-based, asynchronous sensors without
any pre-processing at extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural
networks. This is possible due to specialized neuromorphic hardware that
implements the highly-parallelizable concept of SNNs in silicon. Yet, SNNs have
not enjoyed the same rise of popularity as artificial neural networks. This not
only stems from the fact that their input format is rather unconventional but
also due to the challenges in training spiking networks. Despite their temporal
nature and recent algorithmic advances, they have been mostly evaluated on
classification problems. We propose, for the first time, a temporal regression
problem of numerical values given events from an event camera. We specifically
investigate the prediction of the 3-DOF angular velocity of a rotating event
camera with an SNN. The difficulty of this problem arises from the prediction
of angular velocities continuously in time directly from irregular,
asynchronous event-based input. Directly utilising the output of event cameras
without any pre-processing ensures that we inherit all the benefits that they
provide over conventional cameras. That is high-temporal resolution,
high-dynamic range and no motion blur. To assess the performance of SNNs on
this task, we introduce a synthetic event camera dataset generated from
real-world panoramic images and show that we can successfully train an SNN to

Many approaches have been developed to study the microstructure in granular

fields like percolation theory, complex networks and persistent homology.
However, we do not fully understand the role of microstructure in the
mechanical behaviour of simple and commonplace packings like a pile of sand or
box of grains. Here, by characterizing the spatial variation of local
microstructure, we uncover intriguing large-scale spatial patterns in particle
packings deposited under the influence of gravity. We detail the emergence of
these patterns, and provide a unified fundamental explanation of classic and
puzzling mechanical behaviours of granular materials like central stress
minimum and Janssen effect. Further, we show the striking dependence of spatial

  Networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern deep networks have millions to billions of parameters, which leads to
high memory and energy requirements during training as well as during inference
on resource-constrained edge devices. Consequently, pruning techniques have
been proposed that remove less significant weights in deep networks, thereby
reducing their memory and computational requirements. Pruning is usually
performed after training the original network, and is followed by further
retraining to compensate for the accuracy loss incurred during pruning. The
prune-and-retrain procedure is repeated iteratively until an optimum tradeoff
between accuracy and efficiency is reached. However, such iterative retraining
adds to the overall training complexity of the network. In this work, we
propose a dynamic pruning-while-training procedure, wherein we prune filters of
the convolutional layers of a deep network during training itself, thereby
precluding the need for separate retraining. We evaluate our dynamic
pruning-while-training approach with three different pre-existing pruning
strategies, viz. mean activation-based pruning, random pruning, and L1
normalization-based pruning. Our results for VGG-16 trained on CIFAR10 shows
that L1 normalization provides the best performance among all the techniques
explored in this work with less than 1% drop in accuracy after pruning 80% of
the filters compared to the original network. We further evaluated the L1
normalization based pruning mechanism on CIFAR100. Results indicate that
pruning while training yields a compressed network with almost no accuracy loss
after pruning 50% of the filters compared to the original network and ~5% loss
for high pruning rates (>80%). The proposed pruning methodology yields 41%
reduction in the number of computations and memory accesses during training for
CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet compared to training with retraining for 10
epochs .

crel=1 in the RNRM model, which results in a smooth and continuous shape of
fissioning nucleus. This modified shape of RNRM model has been used to analyse
experimental data of mass variances for symmetric mass distributions of 27
systems leading to understanding of scission shape dynamics in a wide region of
fissility 0.7-0.95. The neck radius is an important parameter of the RNRM model
and this has been varied to fit the experimental mass variances data. The
systematics of resulting neck radii are studied of as a function fissility and
nuclear potential through {\gamma}o, the surface energy coefficient. Further
average total kinetic energies of fission fragments <TKE> are studied of as a
function of fissility and {\gamma}o parameter. It is observed that the neck
radii that fit the experimentally observed variances of the mass distributions
fall into two groups and these groups are related to two groups of

allows one to simultaneously unleash the full power of the geometric
vectorfield method for both the wave- and transport- parts of the flow on
compact regions. In particular, the integral identities yield localized control
over one additional derivative of the vorticity and entropy compared to
standard results, assuming that the initial data enjoy the same gain. Similar
results hold for the solution's higher derivatives. We derive the identities in
detail for two classes of spacetime regions that frequently arise in PDE
applications: i) compact spacetime regions that are globally hyperbolic with

double-acoustically null foliations. Our results have implications for the

mode structure of the vacuum. In waveguide quantum-electrodynamics based on
photonic crystals, this modification is exploited to engineer atom-photon
interactions near a band edge, but the physics of coupling to an entire band
has not yet been explored in experiments. Using ultracold atoms in an optical
lattice, we study the decay dynamics of matter-wave quantum emitters coupled to
a single band of an effective photonic crystal waveguide structure with tunable
characteristics. Depending on the ratio between vacuum coupling and bandwidth,
we observe a transition from irreversible decay to fully oscillatory dynamics
linked to the interplay of matter-wave bound states near the band edges, whose
spatial structure we characterize. Our results shed light on the emergence of
coherence in an open quantum system in a controllable environment, and are of
relevance for the understanding of vacuum-induced decay phenomena in photonic
systems.

(SGD) avoids saddle points and converges to local minima in nonconvex problems.
However, similar guarantees are lacking for distributed first-order algorithms.
The paper studies distributed stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD)--a simple
network-based implementation of SGD. Conditions under which D-SGD avoids saddle
points and converges to local minima are studied. First, we consider the
problem of computing critical points. Assuming loss functions are nonconvex and
possibly nonsmooth, it is shown that, for each fixed initialization, D-SGD
converges to critical points of the loss with probability one. Next, we
consider the problem of avoiding saddle points. In this case, we again assume
that loss functions may be nonconvex and nonsmooth, but are smooth in a
neighborhood of a saddle point. It is shown that, for any fixed initialization,
D-SGD avoids such saddle points with probability one. Results are proved by
studying the underlying (distributed) gradient flow, using the ordinary
differential equation (ODE) method of stochastic approximation, and extending
classical techniques from dynamical systems theory such as stable manifolds.
Results are proved in the general context of subspace-constrained optimization,
of which D-SGD is a special case.

Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) emerged to provide cloud computing capabilities in the

MEC network with numerous mobile users that send their tasks to MEC servers.
Each task has a maximum acceptable response time. Non-uniform distribution of
users makes some MEC servers hotspots that cannot take more. A solution is to
relocate the tasks among MEC servers, called Workload Migration. We formulate
this problem of task scheduling as a mixed-integer non-linear optimization
problem to minimize the number of Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations.
Since solving this optimization problem has high computational complexity, we
introduce a greedy algorithm called MESA, Migration Enabled Scheduling
Algorithm, which reaches a near-optimal solution quickly. Our experiments show
that in the term of SLA violation, MESA is only 8% and 11% far from the optimal
choice on the average and the worst-case, respectively. Moreover, the migration
enabled solution can reduce SLA violations by about 30% compare to assigning

conventional techniques (the so-called curse of dimensionality) for accurate
analysis of hyperspectral images. Feature extraction, as a vibrant field of
research in the hyperspectral community, evolved through decades of research to
address this issue and extract informative features suitable for data

inspired by two fields of research, including the popularization of image and

the size distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within

emission spectra of 308 PAH molecules of varying sizes, symmetries, and
compactness, generated in a range of radiation fields. We show that the
intensity ratio of the solo CH out-of-plane bending mode in PAH cations and
anions (referred to as the 11.0 $\mu$m band, falling in the 11.0-11.3 $\mu$m
region for cations and anions) to their 3.3 $\mu$m emission, scales with PAH
size, similarly to the scaling of the 11.2/3.3 ratio with the number of carbon
atoms (N$_{\mathrm{C}}$) for neutral molecules. Among the different PAH
emission bands, it is the 3.3 $\mu$m band intensity which has the strongest
correlation with N$_{\mathrm{C}}$, and drives the reported PAH intensity ratio
correlations with N$_{\mathrm{C}}$ for both neutral and ionized PAHs. The
6.2/7.7 intensity ratio, previously adopted to track PAH size, shows no evident
scaling with N$_{\mathrm{C}}$ in our large sample. We define a new diagnostic
grid space to probe PAH charge and size, using the (11.2+11.0)/7.7 and
(11.2+11.0)/3.3 PAH intensity ratios respectively. We demonstrate the

of quantum scars, i.e. initial states that fail to thermalize. The suppression
of thermalization is achieved in two complementary ways: by adding local
perturbations or by adjusting the driving Rabi frequency according to the local
connectivity of the lattice. We demonstrate that these mechanisms allow to
realize robust quantum scars in various two-dimensional lattices, including
decorated lattices with non-constant connectivity. In particular, we show that
a small decrease of the Rabi frequency at the corners of the lattice is crucial
for mitigating the strong boundary effects in two-dimensional systems. Our
results identify synchronization as an important tool for future experiments on
two-dimensional quantum scars.

commonly solved by various label propagation methods that work iteratively

compatibilities between classes, these methods crucially depend on knowing the
compatibility matrix that must be provided by either domain experts or
heuristics. Can we instead directly estimate the correct compatibilities from a
sparsely labeled graph in a principled and scalable way? We answer this
question affirmatively and suggest a method called distant compatibility
estimation that works even on extremely sparsely labeled graphs (e.g., 1 in
10,000 nodes is labeled) in a fraction of the time it later takes to label the
remaining nodes. Our approach first creates multiple factorized graph
representations (with size independent of the graph) and then performs
estimation on these smaller graph sketches. We define algebraic amplification
as the more general idea of leveraging algebraic properties of an algorithm's
update equations to amplify sparse signals. We show that our estimator is by
orders of magnitude faster than an alternative approach and that the end-to-end
classification accuracy is comparable to using gold standard compatibilities.
This makes it a cheap preprocessing step for any existing label propagation
method and removes the current dependence on heuristics.

galaxy-wide scale (e.g. the Kennicutt-Schmidt law). However, there is still no
understanding on how to connect global to local star formation scales and
whether this connection is at all possible. Here we analyze spatially resolved
kinematics and the star formation rate density $\Sigma_{SFR}$ for a combined
sample of 17 nearby spiral galaxies obtained using our own optical observations
in H$\alpha$ for 9 galaxies and neutral hydrogen radio observations combined
with a multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution analysis for 8 galaxies
from the THINGS project. We show that the azimuthally averaged normalized star
formation rate density in spiral galaxies on a scale of a few hundred parsecs
is proportional to the kinetic energy of giant molecular cloud collisions due
to differential rotation of the galactic disc. This energy is calculated from
the rotation curve using the two Oort parameters A and B as $\log (\Sigma_{SFR}
/ SFR_{tot}) \propto \log[2 A^2+ 5 B^2]$. The total kinetic energy of collision
is defined by the shear velocity that is proportional to A and the rotational
energy of a cloud proportional to the vorticity B. Hence, shear does not act as
a stabilizing factor for the cloud collapse thus reducing star formation but
rather increases it by boosting the kinetic energy of collisions. This result
can be a tool through which one can predict a radial distribution of star

replaces the Josephson potential by the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian of
the nanowire junction, projected onto the relevant low-energy subgap subspace.
This allows to fully incorporate the coherent dynamics of subgap levels in the
junction. The combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman energy in the
nanowires forming the junction triggers a topological transition, where the
subgap levels evolve from finite-energy Andreev bound states into near-zero

scales governing the nanowire junction (the Josephson energy, the Majorana
coupling and the Majorana energy splitting), with the charging energy of the
superconducting island, gives rise to a great variety of physical regimes.
Based on this interplay of different energy scales, we fully characterize the
microwave response of the junction, from the Cooper pair box to the transmon
regimes, and show how the presence of Majoranas can be detected through
distinct spectroscopic features. In split-junction geometries, the plasma mode
couples to the phase-dispersing subgap levels resulting from Majorana

critical temperatures, at which the minima are degenerate. PhaseTracer is
constructed with modularity, flexibility and practicality in mind. It is fast
and stable, and can receive potentials provided by other packages such as
FlexibleSUSY. PhaseTracer can be useful analysing cosmological phase
transitions which played an important role in the very early evolution of the
Universe. If they were first order they could generate detectable gravitational
waves and/or trigger electroweak baryogenesis to generate the observed matter
anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe. The code can be obtained from

availability of gas and the position of a region with respect to the spatially
resolved main sequence (MS) relation. Following the procedure presented in
Paper I we obtain 500pc scales estimates of stellar mass and star formation
rate surface densities ($\Sigma_{\star}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$). Our sample
consists of five face-on, grand design spiral galaxies located on the MS.
Thanks to HI 21cm and $^{12}$CO(2-1) maps, we connect the gas surface densities
and gas fractions to the observed star formation properties of each region. We
find that the spatially resolved MS ($\sigma=0.23$ dex) is the combination of
two relations: the Kennicutt-Schmidt law ($\sigma=0.19$ dex) and the molecular
gas MS (MGMS, $\sigma=0.22$ dex); $\Sigma_{\star}$, $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ and the
surface density of the molecular gas, $\Sigma_{\rm{H_2}}$, define a 3D relation
as proposed by \citet{2019ApJ...884L..33L}. We find that $\Sigma_{\rm{H_2}}$
steadily increases along the MS relation, varies little towards higher
$\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ at fixed stellar surface densities (not enough to sustain
the change in SFR), and it is almost constant perpendicular to the relation.
The surface density of neutral gas ($\Sigma_{\rm{HI}}$) is constant along the
MS, and increases in its upper envelop. $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ can be expressed as
a function of $\Sigma_{\star}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{HI}}$, following the Equation:
$\log\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ = 0.97$\log\Sigma_{\star}$ + 1.99$\log\Sigma_{\rm{HI}}$
- 11.11. Finally, we show that f$_{\rm{gas}}$ increases significantly towards
the starburst region in the $\log\Sigma_{\star}$ - $\log\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$
plane, accompanied by a slight increase in SFE.

marginal deformation of the $\sigma $-model on AdS$_3$ that yields a string
background that interpolates between AdS$_3$ and a flat linear dilaton

consider it in the presence of a boundary. In a previous paper, we computed
different correlation functions of this theory on the disk, including the bulk

the ultraviolet divergences of the conformal integrals. Here, we extend the

observables on the sphere. We prove that the renormalization of the vertex

strictly causal models are not adequate to describe the system and it is
necessary to consider models with dynamics that include direct feedthrough

in the network (false negative). However, for a class of triangle-free networks

coefficients controls the lossiness: an 8 by 8 quantization table (Q-table)
decides both the quality of the encoded image and the compression ratio. While
a long history of work has sought better Q-tables, existing work either seeks
to minimize image distortion or to optimize for models of the human visual

specific vision networks and can offer better quality--size trade-offs than
ones designed for human perception or minimal distortion. We reconstruct an
ImageNet test set with higher resolution to explore the effect of JPEG
compression under novel Q-tables. We attempt several approaches to tune a
Q-table for a vision task. We find that a simple sorted random sampling method
can exceed the performance of the standard JPEG Q-table. We also use
hyper-parameter tuning techniques including bounded random search, Bayesian
optimization, and composite heuristic optimization methods. The new Q-tables we
obtained can improve the compression rate by 10% to 200% when the accuracy is

behaviors under emotional stress. This research analyzes the role of the body
force in the original SFM. We focused on the parameter associated with the body
stiffness (kn) and its impact on the pedestrian dynamics for two different
geometries: bottlenecks and corridors. Increasing kn produces opposite effects
on the crowd dynamics for each geometry: an increase of the crowd velocity for
bottlenecks, and a decrease for corridors. The former reflects the fact that an
increase in the stiffness reduces the overlap between pedestrians and, as a
consequence, the sliding friction is diminished. This phenomenon reduces the
number of blocking clusters close to the exit door. In the case of the
corridor, instead, due to the confining walls, the pedestrians get tight into a
lattice-like configuration due to space limitations. The friction interaction
with the walls determines the velocity of the whole crowd along the corridor.
Additionally, the corridor geometry generates a flux slowing down for very
crowded environments, as observed in many real-life situations. We also
explored the dimensionless parameters that arose from the reduced-in-units
equation of motion and tuned them to reproduce the qualitative behavior of the
empirical fundamental diagram.

consumer IoT devices. However, determining what the whitelisted behavior of an

on manufacturers and trusted parties to provide whitelists, but these proposals
require manufacturer involvement or placing trust in an additional stakeholder.
Alternatively, locally monitoring devices can allow building whitelists of
observed behavior, but devices may not exhaust their functionality set during
the observation period, or the behavior may change following a software update
which requires re-training. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system for
determining whether an IoT device is behaving like other devices of the same
type. Our system (SERENIoT, pronounced Serenity) overcomes the challenge of
initially determining the correct behavior for a device. Nodes in the SERENIoT
public blockchain submit summaries of the network behavior observed for
connected IoT devices and build whitelists of behavior observed by the majority
of nodes. Changes in behavior through software updates are automatically
whitelisted once the update is broadly deployed. Through a proof-of-concept
implementation of SERENIoT on a small Raspberry Pi IoT network and a
large-scale Amazon EC2 simulation, we evaluate the security, scalability, and

Wasserstein distributionally robust value function. We extend the result to
linear value function approximation for large state spaces. Our approach

that can solve complex supervised classification tasks. While powerful, it is
also internally complex, computationally expensive to evaluate, and not
suitable for neuromorphic hardware. Here we aim to understand whether it is
possible to simplify the MST model, while retaining its ability to learn and to
process information. To this end, we introduce a family of Generalised Neuron
Models (GNM) which are a special case of the Spike Response Model and much
simpler and cheaper to simulate than the MST. We find that over a wide range of
parameters the GNM can learn at least as well as the MST. We identify the
temporal autocorrelation of the membrane potential as the single most important
ingredient of the GNM which enables it to classify multiple spatio-temporal
patterns. We also interpret the GNM as a chemical system, thus conceptually
bridging computation by neural networks with molecular information processing.
We conclude the paper by proposing alternative training approaches for the GNM
including error trace learning and error backpropagation.

interacting agents by means of a generalized version of the model introduced in
PRE E 101, 012101 (2020) for the dynamics of voting intention. Each agent has a
propensity $p$ in $[0,1]$ to vote for one of two political candidates. In an
iteration step, two agents $i$ and $j$ with respective propensities $p_i$ and
$p_j$ interact, and then $p_i$ either increases by an amount $h>0$ with a
probability that is a nonlinear function of $p_i$ and $p_j$ or decreases by $h$
with the complementary probability. We study the behavior of the system under
variations of a parameter $q \ge 0$ that measures the nonlinearity of the
propensity update rule. We focus on the stability properties of the two
distinct stationary states: mono-polarization in which all agents share the
same extreme propensity ($0$ or $1$), and bi-polarization where the population
is divided into two groups with opposite and extreme propensities. We find that
the bi-polarized state is stable for $q<q_c$, while the mono-polarized state is
stable for $q>q_c$, where $q_c$ is a transition value that decreases as $h$
decreases. We develop a rate equation approach whose stability analysis reveals
that $q_c$ vanishes when $h$ becomes infinitesimally small. This result is
supported by the analysis of a transport equation derived in the continuum $h
\to 0$ limit. We also show by Monte Carlo simulations that the mean time $\tau$
to reach mono-polarization in a system of size $N$ scales as $\tau \sim
N^{\alpha}$ at $q_c$ , where $\alpha(h)$ is a non-universal exponent.

chromospheric evaporation, a process where plasma heated to high temperatures
by energy deposition at the flare footpoints is driven upwards into the corona.
Despite several decades of study, a number of open questions remain, including
the relationship between plasma produced during this process and observations
of earlier ""superhot"" plasma. Hinode/EIS has a wide slot often used as a flare
trigger in the He II emission line band. Once the intensity passes a threshold
level, the study switches to one focussed on the flaring region. However, when
the intensity is not high enough to reach the flare trigger threshold, these
datasets are available during the entire flare period and provide high-cadence
spectroscopic observations over a large field of view. We use one-minute
cadence data from two such studies of a C4.7 flare and a C1.6 flare to probe
the relationship between hot Fe XXIV plasma and plasmas observed by RHESSI and
XRT to track where the emission comes from, and when it begins. Although the
spatial and spectral information are merged in the wide-slot data, it is still
possible to extract when the hot plasma appears using the Fe XXIV spectral
image. It is also possible to derive spectrally pure Fe XXIV light curves from
the EIS data, and compare them with those derived from hard X-rays, enabling a
full exploration of the evolution of hot emission. The Fe XXIV emission peaks
just after the peak in the hard X-ray lightcurve; consistent with an origin in
the evaporation of heated plasma following the transfer of energy to the lower
atmosphere. A peak was also found for the C4.7 flare in the RHESSI peak
temperature, which occurred before the hard X-rays peaked. This suggests that
the first peak in hot-plasma emission is likely directly related to the
energy-release process.

domain to an image of another domain, called Image-to-image translation. For
example, style transfer, object transfiguration, visually altering the
appearance of weather conditions in an image, changing the appearance of a day
image into a night image or vice versa, photo enhancement, to name a few. In
this paper, we propose two machine learning techniques to solve the embroidery
image-to-image translation. Our goal is to generate a preview image which looks
similar to an embroidered image, from a user-uploaded image. Our techniques are
modifications of two existing techniques, neural style transfer, and
cycle-consistent generative-adversarial network. Neural style transfer renders
the semantic content of an image from one domain in the style of a different
image in another domain, whereas a cycle-consistent generative adversarial
network learns the mapping from an input image to output image without any
paired training data, and also learn a loss function to train this mapping.
Furthermore, the techniques we propose are independent of any embroidery
attributes, such as elevation of the image, light-source, start, and endpoints
of a stitch, type of stitch used, fabric type, etc. Given the user image, our
techniques can generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered
image. We train and test our propose techniques on an embroidery dataset which
consist of simple 2D images. To do so, we prepare an unpaired embroidery
dataset with more than 8000 user-uploaded images along with embroidered images.
Empirical results show that these techniques successfully generate an
approximate preview of an embroidered version of a user image, which can help

progress in many areas, due to the advent of novel, pretrained contextual

called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which
enables researchers to obtain state-of-the art performance on numerous NLP
tasks by fine-tuning the representations on their data set and task, without
the need for developing and training highly-specific architectures. The authors
also released multilingual BERT (mBERT), a model trained on a corpus of 104
languages, which can serve as a universal language model. This model obtained
impressive results on a zero-shot cross-lingual natural inference task. Driven
by the potential of BERT models, the NLP community has started to investigate
and generate an abundant number of BERT models that are trained on a particular
language, and tested on a specific data domain and task. This allows us to
evaluate the true potential of mBERT as a universal language model, by
comparing it to the performance of these more specific models. This paper
presents the current state of the art in language-specific BERT models,
providing an overall picture with respect to different dimensions (i.e.
architectures, data domains, and tasks). Our aim is to provide an immediate and

possible tuning of the anchoring strength by the salt concentration in the

This effect is driven by the competing energetic-torque couplings between

better described through flexible approaches such as neural networks, but this
results in less interpretable models and potential overfitting. Alternatively,
specific parametric nonlinear functions can be used, but the specification of
such functions is in general complicated. In this paper, we introduce a
flexible approach for the construction and selection of highly flexible
nonlinear parametric regression models. Nonlinear features are generated
hierarchically, similarly to deep learning, but have additional flexibility on
the possible types of features to be considered. This flexibility, combined
with variable selection, allows us to find a small set of important features
and thereby more interpretable models. Within the space of possible functions,
a Bayesian approach, introducing priors for functions based on their
complexity, is considered. A genetically modified mode jumping Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm is adopted to perform Bayesian inference and estimate
posterior probabilities for model averaging. In various applications, we
illustrate how our approach is used to obtain meaningful nonlinear models.
Additionally, we compare its predictive performance with several machine

protein expression data is to determine whether cellular expressions are
remodeled post infection by a pathogen. One natural approach for detecting such
changes is to use non-parametric two-sample statistical tests. However, in
single-cell studies, direct application of these tests is often inadequate
because single-cell level expression data from uninfected populations often
contains attributes of several latent sub-populations with highly heterogeneous
characteristics. As a result, viruses often infect these different
sub-populations at different rates in which case the traditional nonparametric
two-sample tests for checking similarity in distributions are no longer
conservative. We propose a new nonparametric method for Testing Remodeling
Under Heterogeneity (TRUH) that can accurately detect changes in the infected
samples compared to possibly heterogeneous uninfected samples. Our testing
framework is based on composite nulls and is designed to allow the null model
to encompass the possibility that the infected samples, though unaltered by the
virus, might be dominantly arising from under-represented sub-populations in
the baseline data. The TRUH statistic, which uses nearest neighbor projections
of the infected samples into the baseline uninfected population, is calibrated
using a novel bootstrap algorithm. We demonstrate the non-asymptotic
performance of the test via simulation experiments and derive the large sample
limit of the test statistic, which provides theoretical support towards
consistent asymptotic calibration of the test. We use the TRUH statistic for
studying remodeling in tonsillar T cells under different types of HIV infection
and find that unlike traditional tests, TRUH based statistical inference
conforms to the biologically validated immunological theories on HIV infection.

Contrarily to what occurs in either bulk BiFeO$_{3}$ or BiCoO$_{3}$, the ${\cal
T}$ phase is stabilized over the ${\cal R}$ by increasing temperature due to
its higher vibrational entropy. This extraordinary $T$-induced ${\cal R} \to
{\cal T}$ phase transition is originated by polar phonon modes involving
concerted displacements of transition-metal and oxygen ions.

systems for many years, but their generalizations for 3D pose have only
recently been considered. This includes 2.5D volumetric heatmaps, whose X and Y
axes correspond to image space and the Z axis to metric depth around the
subject. To obtain metric-scale predictions, these methods must include a
separate, explicit post-processing step to resolve scale ambiguity. Further,
they cannot encode body joint positions outside of the image boundaries,
leading to incomplete pose estimates in case of image truncation. We address
these limitations by proposing metric-scale truncation-robust (MeTRo)
volumetric heatmaps, whose dimensions are defined in metric 3D space near the
subject, instead of being aligned with image space. We train a
fully-convolutional network to estimate such heatmaps from monocular RGB in an
end-to-end manner. This reinterpretation of the heatmap dimensions allows us to
estimate complete metric-scale poses without test-time knowledge of the focal
length or person distance and without relying on anthropometric heuristics in
post-processing. Furthermore, as the image space is decoupled from the heatmap
space, the network can learn to reason about joints beyond the image boundary.
Using ResNet-50 without any additional learned layers, we obtain
state-of-the-art results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks. As our
method is simple and fast, it can become a useful component for real-time
top-down multi-person pose estimation systems. We make our code publicly

requires the construction of a smooth and periodic structure gauge for the
Bloch states. Here, we illustrate a general approach for such a structure-gauge
construction for topologically trivial systems. Furthermore, we investigate the
SBEs in the length and velocity gauges, and discuss their respective advantages
and shortcomings for the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process. We find that
in cases where we require dephasing or separation of the currents into
interband and intraband contributions, the length gauge SBEs are
computationally more efficient. In calculations without dephasing and where
only the total current is needed, the velocity gauge SBEs are structure-gauge
independent and are computationally more efficient. We employ two systems as
numerical examples to highlight our findings: an 1D model of ZnO and the 2D
monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The omittance of Berry connections or

First, we thoroughly describe the chains morphology exploring the statistics of
two characteristic distances, the radius of gyration and the end-to-end
distance. Moreover, we examine the dependence of mean characteristic distances
with the number of steps (N). Despite the simplicity of our procedure, we
obtain universal critical exponents, which are in very good agreement with
previous values reported in the literature. Moreover, studying the balance
between the monomer-monomer interaction and the bending energy, we find that
initially, the chains develop by multiple doubling, forming a cluster and
increasing its energy. After reaching a given number of steps, the chains
stretch and flee from the cluster, which results in a reduction of its
interaction energy. However, the behaviour of the bending energy reveals that
the chains follow the same folding pathway in both regimes. Additionally, we
also characterize the energy of the obtained chains, combining the local
interaction energy with its corresponding bending energy but in a discrete
version. This analysis is relevant because it allows differentiating between
chains of equal interaction energy but with different structures.

and high-dimensional datasets. Traditionally, similarity search has focused on
discovering very similar pairs, for which a variety of efficient algorithms are
known. However, recent work highlights the importance of finding pairs of sets
with relatively small intersection sizes. For example, in a recommender system,
two users may be alike even though their interests only overlap on a small
percentage of items. In such systems, some dimensions are often highly skewed
because they are very popular. Together these two properties render previous
approaches infeasible for large input sizes. To address this problem, we
present a new distributed algorithm, LSF-Join, for approximate all-pairs set
similarity. The core of our algorithm is a randomized selection procedure based
on Locality Sensitive Filtering. Our method deviates from prior approximate
algorithms, which are based on Locality Sensitive Hashing. Theoretically, we
show that LSF-Join efficiently finds most close pairs, even for small
similarity thresholds and for skewed input sets. We prove guarantees on the
communication, work, and maximum load of LSF-Join, and we also experimentally
demonstrate its accuracy on multiple graphs.

in fact inspired by metallurgy, where the temperature of a material determines
its behavior in thermodynamics. Likewise, in simulated annealing, the actions
that the algorithm takes depend entirely on the value of a variable which
captures the notion of temperature. Typically, simulated annealing starts with
a high temperature, which makes the algorithm pretty unpredictable, and
gradually cools the temperature down to become more stable.
  A key component that plays a crucial role in the performance of simulated
annealing is the criteria under which the temperature changes namely, the
cooling schedule. Motivated by this, we study the following question in this
work: ""Given enough samples to the instances of a specific class of
optimization problems, can we design optimal (or approximately optimal) cooling
schedules that minimize the runtime or maximize the success rate of the
algorithm on average when the underlying problem is drawn uniformly at random
from the same class?""
  We provide positive results both in terms of sample complexity and simulation
complexity. For sample complexity, we show that $\tilde O(\sqrt{m})$ samples
suffice to find an approximately optimal cooling schedule of length $m$. We
complement this result by giving a lower bound of $\tilde \Omega(m^{1/3})$ on
the sample complexity of any learning algorithm that provides an almost optimal
cooling schedule. These results are general and rely on no assumption. For
simulation complexity, however, we make additional assumptions to measure the
success rate of an algorithm. To this end, we introduce the monotone stationary
graph that models the performance of simulated annealing. Based on this model,
we present polynomial time algorithms with provable guarantees for the learning
problem.

is affected by scattering, such that for optically thick disks the emission
decreases with respect to the pure absorption case and the spectral indices can
reach values below 2. The latter can also be obtained with temperature
gradients. Using simple analytical models of radiative transfer in thin slabs,
we quantify the effect of scattering, vertical temperature gradients, and dust
settling on the emission and spectral indices of geometrically thin face-on
accretion disks around young stars. We find that in vertically isothermal disks
with large albedo ($\omega_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.6$), the emergent intensity can
increase at optical depths between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}$. We show that dust
settling has important effects on the spectral indices in the optically thick
regime, since the disk emission mainly traces small dust grains in the upper
layers of the disk. The $\lambda = 870 \ \mu$m emission of these small grains
can hide large grains at the disk mid plane when the dust surface density is
larger than $\sim$ 3.21 g cm$^{-2}$. Finally, because of the change of the
shape of the spectral energy distribution, optically thick disks at 1.3 mm and
grains with sizes between 300 $\mu$m $< a_{\rm max} <$ 1 mm have a 7 mm flux
$\sim 60$\% higher than the extrapolation from higher millimeter frequencies,
assumed when scattering is neglected. This effect could provide an explanation
to the excess emission at $\lambda = 7$ mm reported in several disks.

however, clouds the experimental assessment of the $\alpha_R$ and leads to the
prevailing belief that it can be tuned freely with electric field--a central
tenant of spintronics. Here, we report direct theory of $\alpha_R$ leading to
atomistic calculations of the spin band structure of InAs nanowires upon
application of electric field-- a direct method that does not require a theory
of spin relaxation. Surprisingly, we find an {\it upper bound} to the electric
field tunable Rashba spin splitting and the ensuing $\alpha_R$; for InAs
nanowires, $\alpha_R$ is pinned at about 170 meV{\AA} irrespective of the
applied field strength. We find that this pinning is due to the quantum
confined stark effect, that reduces continuously the nanowire band gap with
applied electric field, leading eventually to band gap closure and a
considerable increase in the density of free carriers. This results in turn in
a strong screening that prevents the applied electric field inside the nanowire
from increasing further beyond around 200 kV/cm for InAs nanowires. Therefore,
further increase in the gate voltage will not increase $\alpha_R$. This finding
clarifies the physical trends to be expected in nanowire Rashba SOC and the

control is challenging due to the complex aerodynamic interaction effects

Conventional methods often fail to properly capture these interaction effects,
resulting in controllers that must maintain large safety distances between
vehicles, and thus are not capable of close-proximity flight. Our approach
combines a nominal dynamics model with a regularized permutation-invariant Deep
Neural Network (DNN) that accurately learns the high-order multi-vehicle
interactions. We design a stable nonlinear tracking controller using the
learned model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller
significantly outperforms a baseline nonlinear tracking controller with up to
four times smaller worst-case height tracking errors. We also empirically
demonstrate the ability of our learned model to generalize to larger swarm

weak shocks that accounts for both in situ acceleration and re-acceleration
through diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). In the former case, a small
fraction of incoming electrons are assumed to be reflected at the shock ramp
and pre-accelerated to the so-called injection momentum, $p_{\rm inj}$, above
which particles can diffuse across the shock transition and participate in the
DSA process. This leads to the DSA power-law distribution extending from the
smallest momentum of reflected electrons, $p_{\rm ref}$, all the way to the
cutoff momentum, $p_{\rm eq}$, constrained by radiative cooling. In the later
case, fossil electrons, specified by a power-law spectrum with a cutoff, are
assumed to be re-accelerated also from $p_{\rm ref}$ up to $p_{\rm eq}$ via
DSA. We then show that, in the in situ acceleration model, the amplitude of
radio synchrotron emission depends strongly on the shock Mach number, whereas
it varies rather weakly in the re-acceleration model. Considering rather
turbulent nature of shocks in the intracluster medium, such extreme dependence
for the in situ acceleration might not be compatible with relatively smooth
surface brightness of observed radio relics.

fragmentation schemes. One way to improve this sort of robustness is to ensure
the energy obeys a variational principle; i.e., that the active orbitals and
active space wave functions minimize the electronic energy in a certain ansatz
for the molecular wave function. We extended the theory of the localized active
space self-consistent field, LASSCF, method (JCTC 2019, 15, 972) to fully
minimize the energy with respect to all orbital rotations, rendering it truly
variational. The new method, called vLASSCF, substantially improves the
robustness and reproducibility of the LAS wave function compared to LASSCF. We
analyze the storage and operation cost scaling of vLASSCF compared to orbital
optimization using a standard CASSCF approach and we show results of vLASSCF
calculations on some simple test systems. We show that vLASSCF is energetically
equivalent to CASSCF in the limit of one active subspace, and that vLASSCF
significantly improves upon the reliability of LASSCF energy differences,
allowing for more meaningful and subtle analysis of potential energy curves of
dissociating molecules. We also show that all forms of LASSCF have a lower
operation cost scaling than the orbital-optimization part of CASSCF.

nanoparticles (SPIONs) in a rotating magnetic field, combining two
well-explored chain-forming systems: larger micron-scale beads in a rotating
magnetic field, and SPIONs in a static field. This simple combination is
interesting because it features self-assembly that occurs both far from
equilibrium and at a finite temperature, with the better-explored systems
constituting respectively its zero temperature and near-equilibrium limits.
Theories applicable to either of the two limits qualitatively predict the chain
length distributions, except that chains in our experiments are shorter, which
we attribute to the simultaneous presence of thermal fluctuations and fluid
shear forces that work in concert to break chains apart. Our most striking
result is that the disorder in the SPION chains gradually dissipates over a
timescale of tens of minutes, about two orders of magnitude slower than the
characteristic chain assembly time. The disorder dissipation can be sped up by
increasing particle concentration and solution ionic strength, both of which
increase the speed of chain assembly. This strongly suggests that the
improvement in chain order with time is not due to thermal fluctuations but
rather to energy imparted by the self-assembly process, which continually
causes chains to grow and break apart, even when a steady state distribution
has obtained. More generally, our results indicate that self-assembly away from
equilibrium may sometimes lead to better ordered assemblies than under
near-equilibrium conditions.

training, particularly in clusters with limited network bandwidths. To mitigate
the drawbacks of distributed communications, researchers have proposed various
optimization strategies. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of
communication strategies from both an algorithm viewpoint and a computer
network perspective. Algorithm optimizations focus on reducing the
communication volumes used in distributed training, while network optimizations
focus on accelerating the communications between distributed devices. At the
algorithm level, we describe how to reduce the number of communication rounds
and transmitted bits per round. In addition, we elucidate how to overlap
computation and communication. At the network level, we discuss the effects
caused by network infrastructures, including logical communication schemes and
network protocols. Finally, we extrapolate the potential future challenges and
new research directions to accelerate communications for distributed deep
neural network training.

magnetopause reconnection site when the inter-spacecraft separation exceeded
the upstream ion inertial length. Classical signatures of the ion diffusion
region (IDR), including a sub-ion-Alfv\'enic de-magnetized ion exhaust, a
super-ion-Alfv\'enic magnetized electron exhaust, and Hall electromagnetic
fields, are identified. The opening angle between the magnetopause and
magnetospheric separatrix is $30^\circ\pm5^\circ$. The exhaust preferentially
expands sunward, displacing the magnetosheath. Intense pileup of reconnected
magnetic flux occurs between the magnetosheath separatrix and the magnetopause
in a narrow channel intermediate between the ion and electron scales. The
strength of the pileup (normalized values of 0.3-0.5) is consistent with the
large angle at which the magnetopause is inclined relative to the overall
reconnection coordinates. MMS-4, which was two ion inertial lengths closer to
the X-line than the other three spacecraft, observed intense electron-dominated
currents and kinetic-to-electromagnetic-field energy conversion within the
pileup. MMS-1, 2, and 3 did not observe the intense currents nor the
particle-to-field energy conversion but did observe the pileup, indicating that
the edge of the generation region was contained within the tetrahedron.
Comparisons with particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the electron currents
and large inclination angle of the magnetopause are interconnected features of
the asymmetric Hall effect. Between the separatrix and the magnetopause,
high-density inflowing magnetosheath electrons brake and turn into the outflow
direction, imparting energy to the normal magnetic field and generating the
pileup. The findings indicate that electron dynamics are likely an important
influence on the magnetic field structure within the ion diffusion region.

the discrete Fourier transform of rank-1 tensors on a classical computer. We
also explain why such a structure can take advantage of an important quantum

symmetry in distinct domains of opposite polar orientation. Polarization
reversal is mediated by field-induced domain wall movement, making this phase
ferroelectric, a 3D uniaxial nematic having a spontaneous, reorientable,
polarization locally parallel to the director. This polarization density
saturates at a low temperature value of ~ 6 microcoulombs/cm-sqd, the largest
ever measured for an organic material or for any fluid. This polarization is
comparable to that of solid state ferroelectrics, and is close to the average
value obtained by assuming perfect, polar alignment of molecular long axes in
the nematic. We find a host of spectacular optical and hydrodynamic effects
driven by ultra-low applied field (E~1V/cm), produced by the coupling of the
large polarization to nematic birefringence and flow. Electrostatic
self-interaction of the polarization charge renders the transition from the

simulation reveals short-range polar molecular interactions that favor

monitor cracks of structural surfaces, techniques for reliable and effective
data compression are essential to ensure a stable and energy efficient crack
images transmission in wireless devices, e.g., drones and robots with high
definition cameras installed. Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing
technique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much
smaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. The conventional
CS method is based on the principle that, through a regularized optimization,
the sparsity property of the original signals in some domain can be exploited
to get the exact reconstruction with a high probability. However, the strong
assumption of the signals being highly sparse in an invertible space is
relatively hard for real crack images. In this paper, we present a new approach
of CS that replaces the sparsity regularization with a generative model that is
able to effectively capture a low dimension representation of targeted images.
We develop a recovery framework for automatic crack segmentation of compressed
crack images based on this new CS method and demonstrate the remarkable
performance of the method taking advantage of the strong capability of
generative models to capture the necessary features required in the crack
segmentation task even the backgrounds of the generated images are not well
reconstructed. The superior performance of our recovery framework is
illustrated by comparing with three existing CS algorithms. Furthermore, we
show that our framework is extensible to other common problems in automatic
crack segmentation, such as defect recovery from motion blurring and occlusion.

backdoor triggers in DNNs by poisoning training data. A backdoored model
behaves normally on clean test images, yet consistently predicts a particular
target class for any test examples that contain the trigger pattern. As such,
backdoor attacks are hard to detect, and have raised severe security concerns
in real-world applications. Thus far, backdoor research has mostly been
conducted in the image domain with image classification models. In this paper,
we show that existing image backdoor attacks are far less effective on videos,
and outline 4 strict conditions where existing attacks are likely to fail: 1)
scenarios with more input dimensions (eg. videos), 2) scenarios with high
resolution, 3) scenarios with a large number of classes and few examples per
class (a ""sparse dataset""), and 4) attacks with access to correct labels (eg.
clean-label attacks). We propose the use of a universal adversarial trigger as
the backdoor trigger to attack video recognition models, a situation where
backdoor attacks are likely to be challenged by the above 4 strict conditions.
We show on benchmark video datasets that our proposed backdoor attack can
manipulate state-of-the-art video models with high success rates by poisoning
only a small proportion of training data (without changing the labels). We also
show that our proposed backdoor attack is resistant to state-of-the-art
backdoor defense/detection methods, and can even be applied to improve image
backdoor attacks. Our proposed video backdoor attack not only serves as a
strong baseline for improving the robustness of video models, but also provides
a new perspective for more understanding more powerful backdoor attacks.

adjust driving behavior according to time, location and traffic conditions,
which further affects when and where the driver will leave away from the
expressway traffic. Spontaneous exit choices by drivers are hard to observe and
thus it is a challenge to model intercity expressway traffic sufficiently. In
this paper, we developed a Spontaneous Quantum Traffic Model (SQTM), which
models the stochastic traffic fluctuation caused by spontaneous exit choices
and the residual regularity fluctuation with Quantum Walk and Autoregressive
Moving Average model (ARMA), respectively. SQTM considers the spontaneous exit
choice of a driver as a quantum stochastic process with a dynamical probability
function varies according to time, location and traffic conditions. A quantum
walk is applied to update the probability function, which simulates when and
where a driver will leave the traffic affected by spontaneous exit choices. We
validate our model with hourly traffic data from 7 exits from the
Nanjing-Changzhou expressway in Eastern China. For the 7 exits, the
coefficients of determination of SQTM ranged from 0.5 to 0.85. Compared with
classical random walk and ARMA model, the coefficients of determination were
increased by 21.28% to 104.98%, and relative mean square error decreased by
11.61% to 32.92%. We conclude that SQTM provides new potential for modeling

system from an initial Gaussian distribution to a final distribution in a
game-theoretic setting. One of the two players strives to minimize a quadratic
payoff, while at the same time tries to meet a given mean and covariance
constraint at the final time-step. The other player maximizes the same payoff,
but it is assumed to be indifferent to the terminal constraint. At first, the
unconstrained version of the game is examined, and the necessary conditions for
the existence of a saddle point are obtained. We then show that obtaining a
solution for the one-sided constrained dynamic game is not guaranteed, and
subsequently the players' best responses are analyzed. Finally, we propose to
numerically solve the problem of steering the distribution under adversarial
scenarios using the Jacobi iteration method. The problem of guiding a missile
during the endgame is chosen to analyze the proposed approach. A numerical
simulation corresponding to the case where the terminal distribution is not
achieved is also included, and discuss the necessary conditions to meet the

for large scale quantum algorithms is very high. Despite several attempts at
alternative schemes, magic state distillation remains one of the most efficient
schemes for simulating non-Clifford gates in a fault-tolerant way. However,
since magic state distillation circuits are not fault-tolerant, all Clifford
operations must be encoded in a large distance code in order to have comparable
failure rates with the magic states being distilled. In this work, we introduce
a new concept which we call redundant ancilla encoding. The latter combined
with flag qubits allows for circuits to both measure stabilizer generators of
some code, while also being able to measure global operators to
fault-tolerantly prepare magic states, all using nearest neighbor interactions.
In particular, we apply such schemes to a planar architecture of the triangular
color code family. In addition to our scheme being suitable for experimental
implementations, we show that for physical error rates near $10^{-4}$ and under
a full circuit-level noise model, our scheme can produce magic states using an
order of magnitude fewer qubits and space-time overhead compared to the most
competitive magic state distillation schemes. Further, we can take advantage of
the fault-tolerance of our circuits to produce magic states with very low
logical failure rates using encoded Clifford gates with noise rates comparable
to the magic states being injected. Thus, stabilizer operations are not
required to be encoded in a very large distance code. Consequently, we believe
our scheme to be suitable for implementing fault-tolerant universal quantum
computation with hardware currently under development.

hard; (ii) the practicality principle in financial markets requires controlling
both transaction and risk costs. Most existing methods adopt handcraft features
and/or consider no constraints for the costs, which may make them perform
unsatisfactorily and fail to control both costs in practice. In this paper, we
propose a cost-sensitive portfolio selection method with deep reinforcement
learning. Specifically, a novel two-stream portfolio policy network is devised
to extract both price series patterns and asset correlations, while a new
cost-sensitive reward function is developed to maximize the accumulated return

the near-optimality of the proposed reward, which shows that the growth rate of

Although the disc instability model is widely accepted as the
explanation for dwarf nova outbursts, it is still necessary to confront its
predictions to observations because much of the constraints on angular momentum
transport in accretion discs are derived from the application of this model to
real systems.
  Aims. We test the predictions of the model concerning the multicolour time
evolution of outbursts for two well--observed systems, SS Cyg and VW Hyi.
  Methods. We calculate the multicolour evolution of dwarf nova outbursts using
the disc instability model and taking into account the contribution from the
irradiated secondary, the white dwarf and the hot spot.
  Results. Observations definitely show the existence of a hysteresis in the
optical colour-magnitude diagram during the evolution of dwarf nova outbursts.
We find that the disc instability model naturally explains the existence and
the orientation of this hysteresis. For the specific cases of SS Cyg and VW
Hyi, the colour and magnitude ranges covered during the evolution of the system
are in reasonable agreement with observations. However, the observed colours
are bluer than observed near the peak of the outbursts -- as in steady systems,
and the amplitude of the hysteresis cycle is smaller than observed. The
predicted colours significantly depend on the assumptions made for calculating
the disc spectrum during rise, and on the magnitude of the secondary
irradiation for the decaying part of the outburst.
  Conclusions. Improvements of the spectral disc models are strongly needed if
one wishes to address the system evolution in the UV.

  These bounds improve exponentially over the state-of-the-art poly-logarithmic

nearly-additive bounds for the APSP problem in sub-polynomial time. Our
approach is based on distinguishing between short and long distances based on
some distance threshold $t = O(\frac{\beta}{\epsilon})$ where
$\beta=O(\frac{\log\log n}{\epsilon})^{\log\log n}$. Handling the long

[Censor-Hillel et al., PODC19]. By exploiting the fact that this tool-kit
should be applied only on local balls of radius $t$, their round complexities
get improved from $poly(\log n)$ to $poly(\log t)$.

(ASV) with considerable performance in anti-spoofing are proposed in the
ASVspoof 2019 challenge. However, previous work has shown that countermeasure
models are vulnerable to adversarial examples indistinguishable from natural
data. A good countermeasure model should not only be robust against spoofing
audio, including synthetic, converted, and replayed audios; but counteract
deliberately generated examples by malicious adversaries. In this work, we
introduce a passive defense method, spatial smoothing, and a proactive defense
method, adversarial training, to mitigate the vulnerability of ASV spoofing
countermeasure models against adversarial examples. This paper is among the
first to use defense methods to improve the robustness of ASV spoofing
countermeasure models under adversarial attacks. The experimental results show
that these two defense methods positively help spoofing countermeasure models
counter adversarial examples.

the broad class of direct-search methods of directional type. It introduces an
algorithm designed to optimize differentiable objective functions $f$ whose
values can only be computed through a stochastically noisy blackbox. The
proposed stochastic directional direct-search (SDDS) algorithm accepts new
iterates by imposing a sufficient decrease condition on so called probabilistic
estimates of the corresponding unavailable objective function values. The
accuracy of such estimates is required to hold with a sufficiently large but
fixed probability $\beta$. The analysis of this method utilizes an existing
supermartingale-based framework proposed for the convergence rates analysis of
stochastic optimization methods that use adaptive step sizes. It aims to show
that the expected number of iterations required to drive the norm of the
gradient of $f$ below a given threshold $\epsilon$ is bounded in
$\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{\frac{-p}{\min(p-1,1)}}/(2\beta-1)\right)$ with
$p>1$. Unlike prior analysis using the same aforementioned framework such as
those of stochastic trust-region methods and stochastic line search methods,
SDDS does not use any gradient information to find descent directions. However,
its convergence rate is similar to those of both latter methods with a
dependence on $\epsilon$ that also matches that of the broad class of
deterministic directional direct-search methods which accept new iterates by
imposing a sufficient decrease condition.

lumbar lordosis angle (LLA) during repetitive activities such as walking or
running. This pilot study therefore aimed at exploring possible NSCLBP-related
alterations in LLAs during walking and running by focusing on discrete
parameters as well as continuous data. Thirteen patients with NSCLBP and 20
healthy pain-free controls were enrolled and underwent a full-body movement
analysis involving various everyday living activities such as standing, walking
and running. LLAs were derived from markers placed on the spinous processes of
the vertebrae L1-L5 and S1. Possible group differences in discrete (average and
range of motion (ROM)) and continuous LLAs were analyzed descriptively using
mean differences with confidence intervals ranging from 95% to 75%. Patients
with NSCLBP indicated reduced average LLAs during standing, walking and running
and a tendency for lower LLA-ROM during walking. Analyses of continuous data
indicated the largest group differences occurring around 25% and 70% of the
walking and 25% and 75% of the running cycle. Furthermore, patients indicated a
reversed movement pattern during running, with increasing instead of a
decreasing LLAs after foot strike. This study provides preliminary evidence
that NSCLBP might affect LLAs during walking and running. These results can be
used as a basis for future large-scale investigations involving hypothesis
testing.

probable transition path of a diffusion process with non-vanishing noise.
However, it suffers from a notorious issue that the functional is unbounded
below when the specified transition time $T$ goes to infinity. This hinders the
interpretation of the results obtained by minimizing the OM functional. We
provide a new perspective on this issue. Under mild conditions, we show that
although the infimum of the OM functional becomes unbounded when $T$ goes to
infinity, the sequence of minimizers does contain convergent subsequences on
the space of curves. The graph limit of this minimizing subsequence is an
extremal of the abbreviated action functional, which is related to the OM
functional via the Maupertuis principle with an optimal energy. We further
propose an energy-climbing geometric minimization algorithm (EGMA) which
identifies the optimal energy and the graph limit of the transition path
simultaneously. This algorithm is successfully applied to several typical
examples in rare event studies. Some interesting comparisons with the
Freidlin-Wentzell action functional are also made.

accumulate an adiabatic geometric phase (AGP) if the nonlinear coefficient of
the crystal is modulated in a proper manner along the nonlinear crystal. This
concept was studied so far only for the case in which the pump wave is much
stronger than the two other waves, hence can be assumed to be constant. Here we
extend this analysis for the fully nonlinear process, in which all three waves
can be depleted and we show that the sign and magnitude of the AGP can be
controlled by the period, phase and duty cycle of the nonlinear modulation
pattern. In this fully nonlinear interaction, all the states of the system can
be mapped onto a closed surface. Specifically, we study a process in which the
eigenstate of the system follows a circular rotation on the surface. Our
analysis reveals that the AGP equals to the difference between the total phase
accumulated along the circular trajectory and that along its vertical
projection, which is universal for the undepleted (linear) and depleted
(nonlinear) cases. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the AGPs in the
processes of sum-frequency generation and difference-frequency generation have
opposite chirality. Finally, we utilize the AGP in the fully nonlinear case for
splitting the beam into different diffraction orders in the far field.

the mass-to-flux ratio rises toward the critical value for collapse, and during
this time the angular momentum of the cloud core is reduced significantly by
magnetic braking. Once a protostar is formed in the core, the accretion phase
is characterized by the presence of a small amount of angular momentum but a
large amount of magnetic flux in the near-protostellar environment. The low
angular momentum leads to a very small (or even nonexistent) disk and weak
outflow, while the large magnetic flux can lead to an interchange instability
that rapidly removes flux from the central region. The effective magnetic
braking in the early collapse phase can even lead to a counter-rotating disk
and outflow, in which the rotation direction of the disk and outflow is
opposite to that of the infalling envelope. The solutions with a
counter-rotating disk, tiny disk, or nonexistent disk (direct collapse) are
unique outcomes that are realized in collapse from magnetically-dominated

propose the CPQ-aware path index CPQx, the first path index tailored to the

reduce index size and index construction overhead while accelerating query
evaluation for queries of interest. We demonstrate through extensive

describe interactions dynamics of four bacterial strains: one fully sensitive
to the drug, one with mutational resistance only, one with plasmidic resistance
only and one with both resistances. By dening thresholds numbers (i.e. each
strain's eective reproduction and each strain's transition thresholds numbers),
we rst express conditions for the existence of non trivial stationary states.
We nd that these thresholds mainly depend on bacteria quantitative traits such
as nutrient consumption ability, growth conversion factor, death rate, mutation

plasmid-bearing strains). Next, with respect to the order in the set of
strain's eective reproduction thresholds numbers, we show that the qualitative
dynamics of the model range from the extinction of all strains, coexistence of
sensitive and mutational resistance strains to the coexistence of all strains
at equilibrium. Finally, we go through some applications of our general

Caputo derivatives. Firstly, based on a family of operators generated by
strongly continuous semigroups and on a probability density function, we
provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the exponential stability of
the considered class of systems. Then, by assuming that the system dynamics is
symmetric and uniformly elliptic and by using the properties of the
Mittag-Leffler function, we provide sufficient conditions that ensure strong
stability. Finally, we characterize an explicit feedback control that
guarantees the strong stabilization of a controlled Caputo time fractional
linear system through a decomposition approach. Some examples are presented
that illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

in broadcast and mobile scenarios where the bit rate supported by the channel
may differ across receivers, and may vary quickly over time. Unlike the
conventional designs that force the source to use a single bit rate according
to the receiver with the worst channel quality, soft video delivery schemes
transmit the video such that the video quality at each receiver is commensurate
with its specific instantaneous channel quality. In this paper, we present a
soft video multicasting system using an adaptive block-based compressed sensing
(BCS) method. The proposed system consists of an encoder, a transmission
system, and a decoder. At the encoder side, each block in each frame of the
input video is adaptively sampled with a rate that depends on the texture
complexity and visual saliency of the block. The obtained BCS samples are then
placed into several packets, and the packets are transmitted via a
channel-aware OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) transmission
system with a number of subchannels. At the decoder side, the received BCS
samples are first used to build an initial approximation of the transmitted
frame. To further improve the reconstruction quality, an iterative BCS
reconstruction algorithm is then proposed that uses an adaptive transform and
an adaptive soft-thresholding operator, which exploits the temporal similarity
between adjacent frames to achieve better reconstruction quality. The extensive
objective and subjective experimental results indicate the superiority of the
proposed system over the state-of-the-art soft video multicasting systems.

keep up with the rampant inflation of new malware. However, it is well-known
that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs).
Previous works have shown that ML malware classifiers are fragile to the
white-box adversarial attacks. However, ML models used in commercial antivirus
products are usually not available to attackers and only return hard
classification labels. Therefore, it is more practical to evaluate the
robustness of ML models and real-world AVs in a pure black-box manner. We
propose a black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework to generate AEs
for PE malware classifiers and AV engines. It regards the adversarial attack
problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, which finds an optimal balance between
exploiting the successful patterns and exploring more varieties. Compared to
other frameworks, our improvements lie in three points. 1) Limiting the
exploration space by modeling the generation process as a stateless process to
avoid combination explosions. 2) Due to the critical role of payload in AE
generation, we design to reuse the successful payload in modeling. 3)
Minimizing the changes on AE samples to correctly assign the rewards in RL
learning. It also helps identify the root cause of evasions. As a result, our
framework has much higher black-box evasion rates than other off-the-shelf
frameworks. Results show it has over 74\%--97\% evasion rate for two
state-of-the-art ML detectors and over 32\%--48\% evasion rate for commercial
AVs in a pure black-box setting. We also demonstrate that the transferability
of adversarial attacks among ML-based classifiers is higher than the attack
transferability between purely ML-based and commercial AVs.

we show that the blockade is lifted if the two dots experience distinct
effective magnetic fields caused by site-dependent g-tensors $g_L$ and $g_R$

the leakage current due to the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) via spin-flip
tunneling and the hyperfine interaction (HFI) of the electron spin with the
host nuclear spins. Using analytical results obtained in special parameter
regimes, we show that information about both the out-of-plane and in-plane

magneto-transport curve. For a symmetric DQD, we predict a pronounced maximum
in the leakage current at the characteristic out-of-plane magnetic field $B^* =

unrelated, classes of iterative methods, namely: the linearization methods, the
relaxation methods (finite difference methods), and the shooting methods. It
has recently been demonstrated that using finite differences to discretize the
sequence of linear problems obtained by quasi-linearization, Picard
linearization, or constant-slope linearization, leads to the usual iteration
formula of the respective relaxation method. Thus, the linearization methods
can be used as a basis to derive the relaxation methods. In this work we
demonstrate that the shooting methods can be derived from the linearization
methods, too. We show that relaxing a shooting trajectory, i.e. an initial
value problem solution, is in fact a projection transformation. The obtained
function, called projection trajectory, can be used to correct the initial
condition. Using the new initial condition, we can find a new shooting
trajectory, and so on. The described procedure is called shooting-projection
iteration (SPI). We show that using the quasi-linearization equation to relax
(project) the shooting trajectory leads to the usual shooting by Newton method,
the constant-slope linearization leads to the usual shooting by constant-slope
method, while the Picard linearization leads to the recently proposed
shooting-projection method. Therefore, the latter method can rightfully be
called shooting by Picard method. A possible application of the new theoretical

benefits, but at the cost of endangering personal data privacy. Anonymisation

exploitation for different purposes while preserving the privacy of
individuals. Over the years, a lot of automatic anonymisation systems have been
proposed; however, depending on the type of data, the target language or the
availability of training documents, the task remains challenging still. The
emergence of novel deep-learning models during the last two years has brought
large improvements to the state of the art in the field of Natural Language
Processing. These advancements have been most noticeably led by BERT, a model
proposed by Google in 2018, and the shared language models pre-trained on
millions of documents. In this paper, we use a BERT-based sequence labelling
model to conduct a series of anonymisation experiments on several clinical
datasets in Spanish. We also compare BERT to other algorithms. The experiments
show that a simple BERT-based model with general-domain pre-training obtains
highly competitive results without any domain specific feature engineering.

learning a mapping from visual features to natural language. However, editing
existing captions can be easier than generating new ones from scratch.
Intuitively, when editing captions, a model is not required to learn
information that is already present in the caption (i.e. sentence structure),
enabling it to focus on fixing details (e.g. replacing repetitive words). This
paper proposes a novel approach to image captioning based on iterative adaptive
refinement of an existing caption. Specifically, our caption-editing model
consisting of two sub-modules: (1) EditNet, a language module with an adaptive
copy mechanism (Copy-LSTM) and a Selective Copy Memory Attention mechanism
(SCMA), and (2) DCNet, an LSTM-based denoising auto-encoder. These components
enable our model to directly copy from and modify existing captions.
Experiments demonstrate that our new approach achieves state-of-art performance
on the MS COCO dataset both with and without sequence-level training.

remained elusive. In bulk solution, membrane-forming molecules such as
phospholipids, single-tailed surfactants, and block copolymers typically
self-assemble into multilamellar, onion-like structures. So although
self-assembly processes can form nanoscale unilamellar vesicles, scaffolding by
droplets or surfaces is required to create GUVs. Here we show that
surprisingly, it is possible to bulk self-assemble cell-sized GUVs with almost
complete selectivity over other vesicle topologies. The seemingly paradoxical
pair of features that enables this appears to be having very dynamic molecules
at the nanoscale, that create unusually rigid membranes. The resultant
self-assembly pathway enables encapsulation of molecules and colloids, and can
also generate model primitive cells that can grow and divide.

particles entering the Earth's atmosphere comes from Jupiter-family comets
(JFCs). This paper relies on our understanding of key properties of the
zodiacal cloud and of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, extensively studied by
the Rosetta mission to a JFC. The interpretation, through numerical and
experimental simulations of zodiacal light local polarimetric phase curves, has
recently allowed us to establish that interplanetary dust is rich in absorbing
organics and consists of fluffy particles. The ground-truth provided by Rosetta
presently establishes that the cometary dust particles are rich in organic
compounds and consist of quite fluffy and irregular aggregates. Our aims are as
follows: (1) to make links, back in time, between peculiar micrometeorites,
tiny meteoroids, interplanetary dust particles, cometary dust particles, and
the early evolution of the Solar System, and (2) to show how detailed studies
of such meteoroids and of cometary dust particles can improve the
interpretation of observations of dust in protoplanetary and debris disks.
Future modeling of dust in such disks should favor irregular porous particles
instead of more conventional compact spherical particles.

life of electric vehicles (EVs). However, the conflict of interests between
wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and EVs is difficult to resolve. In the
day-ahead electricity market, considering the revenue of WCLs caused by the
deviation between actual electricity sales and pre-purchased electricity, as
well as endurance and traveling experience of EVs, this paper proposes a
charging scheduling algorithm based on a double-layer game model. In lower
layer, the potential game is used to model the multi-vehicle game of vehicle
charging planning. A shortest path algorithm based on the three-way greedy
strategy is designed to solve in dynamic charging sequence problem, and the
improved particle swarm optimization algorithm are used to solve the variable
ordered potential game. In the upper layer, the reverse Stackelberg game is
adopted to harmonize the cost of wireless charging lanes and electric vehicles.
As the leader, WCLs stimulate EVs to carry out reasonable charing action by
electricity price regulation. As the follower, EVs make the best charging
decisions for a given electricity price. An iteration algorithm is designed to
ensure the Nash equilibrium convergence of this game. The simulation results
show that the double-layer game model proposed in this paper can effectively
suppress the deviation between the actual electricity sales and the pre-sale of
the charging lane caused by the disorderly charging behavior of the vehicle,

the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message
passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional
information by transforming messages based on the angle between them.
Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to
construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve
better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis
representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these
innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network
(DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76% on MD17 and by
31% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.

by different embedding vectors which allows the same two functions to be used

or long term back-propagation, as is commonly done in similar systems, we
motivate and study a different objective: That of remembering past snippets of

training and other forms of learning. We train for this objective using short
term back-propagation and analyze the performance as a function of both the
different network types and the difficulty of the problem. We find that this

also discuss how such system could form a natural substrate for addressing
topics such as episodic memories, meta-learning and auxiliary objectives.

possibly attribute to the interplay of hippocampus-dependent memory system and

the two memory systems develop specialized mechanisms to consolidate

specific representation of the data distributions in a generator, or
generalized knowledge of solving tasks in a discriminator and a classifier,
with implementing appropriate brain-inspired algorithms to alleviate

  edge elimination",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is customary to identify sparse matrices with the corresponding adjacency
or incidence graph. For the solution of linear systems of equations using
Gaussian elimination, the representation by its adjacency graph allows a
symbolic computation that can be used to predict memory footprints and enables
the determination of near-optimal elimination orderings based on heuristics.
The Hermitian eigenvalue problem on the other hand seems to evade such
treatment at first glance due to its inherent iterative nature. In this paper
we prove this assertion wrong by showing the equivalence of the Hermitian
eigenvalue problem with a symbolic edge elimination procedure. A symbolic
calculation based on the incidence graph of the matrix can be used in analogy
to the symbolic phase of Gaussian elimination to develop heuristics which
reduce memory footprint and computations. Yet, we also show that the question
of an optimal elimination strategy remains NP-hard, in analogy to the linear
systems case.

relationship between an entity and a set of entities. In KBs, this information
is often represented in two formats: (i) via counting predicates such as
numberOfChildren and staffSize, that store aggregated integers, and (ii) via
enumerating predicates such as parentOf and worksFor, that store individual set
memberships. Both formats are typically complementary: unlike enumerating
predicates, counting predicates do not give away individuals, but are more
likely informative towards the true set size, thus this coexistence could
enable interesting applications in question answering and KB curation.
  In this paper we aim at uncovering this hidden knowledge. We proceed in two
steps. (i) We identify set-valued predicates from a given KB predicates via
statistical and embedding-based features. (ii) We link counting predicates and
enumerating predicates by a combination of co-occurrence, correlation and

by tuning the THF/water relative content, which has a striking effect on the
kinetics of self-assembly as well as on the resulting equilibrium structures.

Such events can be observed at Earth, for example, using neutron monitors, and
also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of

difference using theoretical modeling approaches and suggest that it is related
to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route
from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening

crossover phenomenon in strongly confined and mildly supercooled water in

study the properties of bulk water, we are interested in the dynamical
transitions for strongly confined water in the absence of any bulk-like water.
The influence of the physicochemical nature of the graphene oxide surface on
the dynamical transitions is investigated by varying the extent of
hydrophobicity on the confining surfaces placed at an inter-surface separation
of 10 \AA\,. All dynamical quantities show a typical slowing down as the
temperature is lowered from 298 to 200 K; however, the nature of the transition
is a distinct function of the surface type. Water confined between surfaces
consisting of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions exhibit a
strong-to-strong dynamical transition in the diffusion coefficients and
rotational relaxation times at a crossover temperature of 237 K and show a
fragile-to-strong transition in the $\alpha$-relaxation time at 238 K. The
observed crossover temperature is much higher than the freezing point of the
SPC/E water model used in this study, indicating that these dynamical
transitions can occur with mild supercooling under strong confinement in the
absence of bulk-like water. In contrast, water confined in hydrophilic pore
shows a single Arrhenius energy barrier over the entire temperature range. Our
results indicate that in addition to confinement, the nature of the surface can
play a critical role in determining the dynamical transitions for water upon
supercooling.

a decent ZT, its conductive nature (semi-metal or semiconductor) is not yet
clarified especially at low temperature. In this paper, we focus our DFT
calculations on the effect of temperature on the bandgap of Fe2VAl. In contrast
to what is usually observed, we show that both the temperature increase and the
formation of thermally-activated Al/V inversion defects (observed
experimentally), open the bandgap. Such an unusual behavior is the key for
reconciling all bandgap measurements performed on the Fe2VAl compound using a

target selection, feature extraction, feature matching, and transform
computation for the alignment. The accuracy of the result depends on multiple
factors, the most significant are the quantity of input data, the presence of
noise, outliers and occlusions, the quality of the extracted features,
real-time requirements and the type of transformation, especially those ones
defined by multiple parameters, like non-rigid deformations. Recent
advancements in machine learning could be a turning point in these issues,
particularly with the development of deep learning (DL) techniques, which are
helping to improve multiple computer vision problems through an abstract

framework extracted from the traditional registration pipeline to analyse the
new learning-based proposal strengths. Deep Registration Networks (DRNs) try to
solve the alignment task either replacing part of the traditional pipeline with
a network or fully solving the registration problem. The main conclusions
extracted are, on the one hand, 1) learning-based registration techniques
cannot always be clearly classified in the traditional pipeline. 2) These
approaches allow more complex inputs like conceptual models as well as the
traditional 3D datasets. 3) In spite of the generality of learning, the current
proposals are still ad hoc solutions. Finally, 4) this is a young topic that
still requires a large effort to reach general solutions able to cope with the

reinforcement learning with local optimization to foster and synthesize the
best of the two methodologies. The policy-based reinforcement learning
algorithm provides an initial solution and guiding reference for the
post-optimization. Therefore, the optimizer only has to compute a single

the state-history during reinforcement learning, it can be used for constraint

  recursion",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When designing languages for functional reactive programming (FRP) the main
challenge is to provide the user with a simple, flexible interface for writing
programs on a high level of abstraction while ensuring that all programs can be
implemented efficiently in a low-level language. To meet this challenge, a new
family of modal FRP languages has been proposed, in which variants of Nakano's
guarded fixed point operator are used for writing recursive programs
guaranteeing properties such as causality and productivity. As an apparent
extension to this it has also been suggested to use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
as a language for reactive programming through the Curry-Howard isomorphism,
allowing properties such as termination, liveness and fairness to be encoded in
types. However, these two ideas are in conflict with each other, since the
fixed point operator introduces non-termination into the inductive types that
are supposed to provide termination guarantees.
  In this paper we show that by regarding the modal time step operator of LTL a
submodality of the one used for guarded recursion (rather than equating them),
one can obtain a modal type system capable of expressing liveness properties
while retaining the power of the guarded fixed point operator. We introduce the
language Lively RaTT, a modal FRP language with a guarded fixed point operator
and an `until' type constructor as in LTL, and show how to program with events
and fair streams. Using a step-indexed Kripke logical relation we prove
operational properties of Lively RaTT including productivity and causality as
well as the termination and liveness properties expected of types from LTL.
Finally, we prove that the type system of Lively RaTT guarantees the absence of
implicit space leaks.

has a changing behavior with respect to spatial correlation, where at low SNR,
the MI is Schur-convex, i.e. showing increasing performance as correlation
increases. However, this behavior changes at high SNR, since MI is
Schur-concave at high SNR, hence it decreases as the spatial correlation
increases. Moreover, we investigate the conditions for spatially uncorrelated
MIMO radar. According to these conditions, as the operating frequency increases
with respect to the target location and dimensions, the received paths become
more uncorrelated. Hence, the setup with lower operating frequency (more
correlated) performs better compared to the higher frequency setup at low SNR.
However at high SNR, this behavior is reversed.

solve real-world tasks is to leverage multimodal data. Unfortunately,
annotation of multimodal data is challenging and expensive. Recently,
self-supervised multimodal methods that combine vision and language were
proposed to learn multimodal representations without annotation. However, these
methods often choose to ignore the presence of high levels of noise and thus
yield sub-optimal results. In this work, we show that the problem of noise
estimation for multimodal data can be reduced to a multimodal density
estimation task. Using multimodal density estimation, we propose a noise
estimation building block for multimodal representation learning that is based
strictly on the inherent correlation between different modalities. We
demonstrate how our noise estimation can be broadly integrated and achieves
comparable results to state-of-the-art performance on five different benchmark
datasets for two challenging multimodal tasks: Video Question Answering and
Text-To-Video Retrieval. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical probabilistic

analysis, cost minimization, and adjustments to machine efficiency. Methods
such as volume or force-impact have been used to measure mass flow; however,
these methods are limited in application and accuracy. In this work, we use
deep learning to develop and test a vision system that can accurately estimate
the mass of sugarcane while running in real-time on a sugarcane harvester
during operation. The deep learning algorithm that is used to estimate mass
flow is trained using very sparsely annotated images (semi-supervised) using

deep neural network (DNN) succeeds in capturing the mass of sugarcane
accurately and surpasses older volumetric-based methods, despite highly varying

an evaluation metric called Neuroscore, for evaluating the performance of GANs,

The gravastar consists of three regions, viz., (I) Interior region, (II)
Intermediate shell region, and (III) Exterior region. The pressure within the
interior core region is assumed to be equal to the constant negative
matter-energy density which provides a constant repulsive force over the thin
shell region. The shell is assumed to be made up of fluid of ultrarelativistic
plasma and following the Zel'dovich's conjecture of stiff fluid [Zeldovich
(1972)] it is also assumed that the pressure which is directly proportional to
the matter-energy density according to Zel'dovich's conjecture, does cancel the
repulsive force exerted by the interior region. The exterior region is
completely vacuum and it can be described by the Schwarzschild solution. Under
all these specifications we find out a set of exact and singularity-free

which complicates the understanding of an application's overall control flow.
  In this paper, we present PlumbDroid: a technique to automatically detect and

find execution traces that may leak a resource. The information built for
detection also undergirds automatically building a fix -- consisting of release
operations performed at appropriate locations -- that removes the leak and does
not otherwise affect the application's usage of the resource.
  An empirical evaluation on resource leaks from the DroidLeaks curated
collection demonstrates that PlumbDroid's approach is scalable, precise, and
produces correct fixes for a variety of resource leak bugs: PlumbDroid
automatically found and repaired 50 leaks that affect 9 widely used resources
of the Android system, including all those collected by DroidLeaks for those
resources; on average, it took just 2 minutes to detect and repair a leak.
PlumbDroid also compares favorably to Relda2/RelFix -- the only other fully
automated approach to repair Android resource leaks -- since it usually detects
more leaks with higher precision and producing smaller fixes. These results
indicate that PlumbDroid can provide valuable support to enhance the quality of

different facial regions with state-of-the-art VSR models, including the mouth,

imagine alternatives. In this work we turn to Japanese Shinto narratives as a
way to defamiliarise voice assistants, inspired by the similarities between how
assistants appear to 'inhabit' objects similarly to kami. Describing an
alternate future where assistant presences live inside objects, this approach
foregrounds some of the phenomenological quirks that can otherwise easily
become lost. Divorced from the reality of daily life, this approach allows us
to reevaluate some of the common interactions and design patterns that are
common in the virtual assistants of the present.

  Understanding","ECCV 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent trajectory forecasting in autonomous driving requires an agent to
accurately anticipate the behaviors of the surrounding vehicles and
pedestrians, for safe and reliable decision-making. Due to partial
observability in these dynamical scenes, directly obtaining the posterior
distribution over future agent trajectories remains a challenging problem. In
realistic embodied environments, each agent's future trajectories should be
both diverse since multiple plausible sequences of actions can be used to reach
its intended goals, and admissible since they must obey physical constraints
and stay in drivable areas. In this paper, we propose a model that synthesizes
multiple input signals from the multimodal world|the environment's scene
context and interactions between multiple surrounding agents|to best model all
diverse and admissible trajectories. We compare our model with strong baselines
and ablations across two public datasets and show a significant performance
improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we offer new
metrics incorporating admissibility criteria to further study and evaluate the
diversity of predictions. Codes are at: https://github.com/kami93/CMU-DATF.

the anisotropy axis, the magnetic texture develops a component parallel to the
spin accumulation for sufficiently large spin bias. The emergence of this
parallel component gives rise to threshold behavior in the spin Hall

design novel spintronic and magnonic devices that can be operated without

particle radiation of stars drive thermal, chemical and physical alteration of
planetary atmospheres, including escape. Many known extrasolar planets
experience vastly different stellar environments than those in our Solar
system: it is crucial to understand the broad range of processes that lead to
atmospheric escape and evolution under a wide range of conditions if we are to
assess the habitability of worlds around other stars. One problem encountered
between the planetary and the astrophysics communities is a lack of common
language for describing escape processes. Each community has customary
approximations that may be questioned by the other, such as the hypothesis of
H-dominated thermosphere for astrophysicists, or the Sun-like nature of the
stars for planetary scientists. Since exoplanets are becoming one of the main
targets for the detection of life, a common set of definitions and hypotheses
are required. We review the different escape mechanisms proposed for the
evolution of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. We propose a common
definition for the different escape mechanisms, and we show the important
parameters to take into account when evaluating the escape at a planet in time.
We show that the paradigm of the magnetic field as an atmospheric shield should

requires intensive manual labor and often domain-specific knowledge. Yet
strategies for annotating QA datasets in a cost-effective manner are scarce. To
provide a remedy for practitioners, our objective is to develop heuristic rules
for annotating a subset of questions, so that the annotation cost is reduced
while maintaining both in- and out-of-domain performance. For this, we conduct
a large-scale analysis in order to derive practical recommendations. First, we
demonstrate experimentally that more training samples contribute often only to
a higher in-domain test-set performance, but do not help the model in
generalizing to unseen datasets. Second, we develop a model-guided annotation
strategy: it makes a recommendation with regard to which subset of samples
should be annotated. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in a case study based on
domain customization of QA to a clinical setting. Here, remarkably, annotating
a stratified subset with only 1.2% of the original training set achieves 97.7%
of the performance as if the complete dataset was annotated. Hence, the
labeling effort can be reduced immensely. Altogether, our work fulfills a
demand in practice when labeling budgets are limited and where thus
recommendations are needed for annotating QA datasets more cost-effectively.

critical role in the reliability of such methods. This is important for
inspecting high value assets or assets with a high consequence of failure, such
as aerospace and nuclear components. Recent advances in convolution neural
networks can support and automate these inspection efforts. This paper proposes
using residual neural networks (ResNets) for real-time detection of corrosion,
including iron oxide discoloration, pitting and stress corrosion cracking, in
dry storage stainless steel canisters housing used nuclear fuel. The proposed
approach crops nuclear canister images into smaller tiles, trains a ResNet on
these tiles, and classifies images as corroded or intact using the per-image
count of tiles predicted as corroded by the ResNet. The results demonstrate
that such a deep learning approach allows to detect the locus of corrosion via
smaller tiles, and at the same time to infer with high accuracy whether an
image comes from a corroded canister. Thereby, the proposed approach holds
promise to automate and speed up nuclear fuel canister inspections, to minimize
inspection costs, and to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections,
thus reducing radiation doses to personnel.

increasing attention, owing to their peculiar properties stemming from
real-space topological properties. At the same time, the properties of magnetic
Weyl semimetals with complex $k$-space topology are moving into the focus of
research in spintronics. We consider the Hall transport properties and orbital
magnetism of skyrmion lattices imprinted in topological semimetals, by
employing a minimal model of a 2D mixed Weyl semimetal which, as a function of
the magnetization direction, exhibits two Chern insulator phases separated by a
Weyl state for an an in-plane magnetization direction. We find that while the
orbital magnetization is topologically robust and Hall transport properties are
very sensitive to the details of the spin distribution in accordance to the
behavior expected from the recently discovered chiral Hall effect[1], their
behavior in the region of the Chern insulator gap is largely determined by the
properties of the so-called mixed topology ring states, emerging in domain
walls that separate the skyrmion core from the ferromagnetic background. In
particular, we show that these localized ring states possess a given orbital
chirality which reverses sign as a function of the skyrmion radius, thereby
mediating a smooth switching dynamics of the orbital magnetization of the
skyrmion lattice. We speculate that while the emergent ring states can possibly
play a role in the physics of Majorana states, probing their properties
experimentally can provide insights into the details of skyrmionic spin
structures.

a challenge that has been approached from different angles, among which two
techniques emerged at the turn of the century: protocol complexes, and directed
algebraic topology. In both cases, the considered computational model generally
assumes communication via shared objects, typically a shared memory consisting
of a collection of read-write registers. Our paper is concerned with network
computing, where the processes are located at the nodes of a network, and
communicate by exchanging messages along the edges of that network. Applying
the topological approach for verification in network computing is a
considerable challenge, mainly because the presence of identifiers assigned to
the nodes yields protocol complexes whose size grows exponentially with the
size of the underlying network. However, many of the problems studied in this
context are of local nature, and their definitions do not depend on the
identifiers or on the size of the network. We leverage this independence in
order to meet the above challenge, and present $\textit{local}$ protocol
complexes, whose sizes do not depend on the size of the network. As an
application of the design of ""compact"" protocol complexes, we reformulate the
celebrated lower bound of $\Omega(\log^*n)$ rounds for 3-coloring the $n$-node

theory. The opposite problem, i.e. the maximum crossing number, is receiving
growing attention. Here we consider a complementary problem of the distribution
of the number of edge crossings, namely the variance of the number of
crossings, when embedding the vertices of an arbitrary graph in some space at
random. In his pioneering research, Moon derived that variance on random linear
arrangements of complete unipartite and bipartite graphs. Given the need of
efficient algorithms to support this sort of research and given also the
growing interest of the number of edge crossings in spatial networks, networks
where vertices are embedded in some space, here we derive algorithms to
calculate the variance in arbitrary graphs in $o(nm^2)$-time, and in forests in
$O(n)$-time. These algorithms work on a wide range of random layouts (not only
on Moon's) and are based on novel arithmetic expressions for the calculation of
the variance that we develop from previous theoretical work. This paves the way
for many applications that rely on a fast but exact calculation of the
variance.

may act as allosteric agonists of NTS1. Additionally, we used surface plasmon

the series in an acute pain model (tail-flick test) by measuring tail
withdrawal latencies to a thermal nociceptive stimulus, following intrathecal

in a tonic pain model (formalin test), as well as in neuropathic (Chronic
Constriction Injury) and inflammatory (Complete Freund's Adjuvant) chronic pain

  Videos","Comments: 25 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tracking people in a video sequence is a challenging task that has been
approached from many perspectives. This task becomes even more complicated when
the person to track is a player in a broadcasted sport event, the reasons being
the existence of difficulties such as frequent camera movements or switches,
total and partial occlusions between players, and blurry frames due to the
codification algorithm of the video. This paper introduces a player tracking
solution which is both fast and accurate. This allows to track a player
precisely in real-time. The approach combines several models that are executed
concurrently in a relatively modest hardware, and whose accuracy has been
validated against hand-labeled broadcast video sequences. Regarding the
accuracy, the tests show that the area under curve (AUC) of our approach is
around 0.6, which is similar to generic state of the art solutions. As for
performance, our proposal can process high definition videos (1920x1080 px) at
80 fps.

simultaneously constrained. Using the time-delay cosmography from strong
lensing combined with the stellar kinematics of the deflector lens, we
demonstrate the Hubble constant and post-Newtonian parameter are incorporated
in two distance ratios which reflect the lensing mass and dynamical mass,
respectively. Through the reanalysis of the four publicly released lenses
distance posteriors from the H0LiCOW collaboration, the simultaneous

results suggests no deviation from the General Relativity,

made of 6H-SiC and doped Si, respectively supporting surface phonon-polaritons
(SPhPs) and surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) in the infrared, separated by a
150-nm-thick vacuum gap spacing maintained via SiO2 nanopillars. For purpose of
comparison, measurements are also performed between two doped Si surfaces. The
measured radiative flux is in good agreement with theoretical predictions based
on fluctuational electrodynamics. A flux enhancement beyond the blackbody limit
of ~ 8.2 is obtained for the SiC-Si sample, which is smaller than the
enhancement for the Si-Si sample (~ 12.5) owing to the spectral mismatch of the
SiC and Si light lines, and SPhP and SPP resonances. However, due to lower
losses in SiC than Si and weaker SPhP-SPP coupling than SPP coupling, the
near-field enhancement for the SiC-Si sample exhibits a more pronounced
monochromatic behavior with a resonant flux that is ~ 5 times larger than the
resonant flux for the Si-Si sample. This work demonstrates that it is possible
to modulate NFRHT via surface polariton coupling, and will accelerate the
development of energy conversion and thermal management devices capitalizing on
the near-field effects of thermal radiation between dissimilar materials.

to revisit and test the accuracy of the lunar chronology using data from recent
lunar missions (e.g., Hiesinger et al., 2000, 2012, 2015; Rajmon and Spudis,

region based on spectral characteristics, topography, and albedo maps, which
shows several mare units adjacent to the lunar module. Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter Camera (LROC) images were used to measure new CSFDs and derive the
cumulative number of craters with diameters greater than or equal to 1 km or
N(1) for the Apollo 11 landing site. The newly derived N(1) values are
consistent with the presence of only one surficial unit at the landing site:
the Group A, High-K (high potassium) young mare basalt (Meyer, 2012). We
reviewed the radiometric ages for Apollo 11 samples that have been determined
since the calibration of the lunar cratering chronology, used our new
geological map to reinterpret their provenance, and correlated them with the
new N(1) values. These are plotted and compared with the lunar chronology of
Neukum et al. (1983). Our calibration point for the Apollo 11 landing site is
consistent with the earlier values, thus, confirming Neukum's (1983) lunar

degree of coherence has been established for classical and single-particle
quantum states [JOSA B {\bf 36}, 2765 (2019)]. Using the same mathematical
construction, in this article, we define the intrinsic degree of coherence of
two-qubit states and demonstrate its usefulness in quantifying two-particle
quantum correlations and entanglement. In this context, first of all, we show
that the intrinsic degree of coherence of a two-qubit state puts an upper bound
on the violations of Bell inequalities that can be achieved with the state and
that a two-qubit state with intrinsic degree of coherence less than
$1/\sqrt{3}$ cannot violate Bell inequalities. We then show that the quantum
discord of a two-qubit state, which quantifies the amount of quantum
correlations available in the two-qubit state for certain tasks, is bounded
from above by the intrinsic degree of coherence of the state. Next, in the
context of two-particle entanglement, we show that the range of values that the
concurrence of a two-qubit state can take is decided by the intrinsic degree of
coherence of the two-qubit state together with that of the individual qubits.
Finally, for the polarization two-qubit states generated by parametric
down-conversion of a pump photon, we propose an experimental scheme for
measuring the intrinsic degree of coherence of two-qubit states. We also
present our theoretical study showing how the intrinsic degree of coherence of
a pump photon dictates the maximum intrinsic degree of coherence of the
generated two-qubit state.

cohomology rings of the manifolds. Previously, the author demonstrated
construction of fold maps in various cases : key methods are surgery operations
to manifolds and maps and in this paper, we present more useful surgery
operations and by them we construct new fold maps. More precisely, fold maps
with singular value sets with crossings: the singular value set of a smooth map
is the image of the set of all singular points and note that for fold maps, the
set of all singular points are closed submanifolds without boundaries and the

nodes communicate over error-free orthogonal communication links, we assume
that transmissions are prone to additive noise and interference.We first
consider a point-to-point (P2P) transmission strategy, termed the OAC-P2P
scheme, in which the node pairs are scheduled in an orthogonal fashion to
minimize interference. Since in the DSGD framework, each node requires a linear
combination of the neighboring models at the consensus step, we then propose
the OAC-MAC scheme, which utilizes the signal superposition property of the
wireless medium to achieve over-the-air computation (OAC). For both schemes, we
cast the scheduling problem as a graph coloring problem. We numerically
evaluate the performance of these two schemes for the MNIST image
classification task under various network conditions. We show that the OAC-MAC
scheme attains better convergence performance with a fewer communication
rounds.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to solve a wide range of problems.
Probabilistic computations, often considered too slow on conventional
processors, can be accelerated with specialized hardware by exploiting
parallelism and optimizing the design using various approximation techniques.
Current methodologies for evaluating correctness of probabilistic accelerators
are often incomplete, mostly focusing only on end-point result quality

beyond end-point ""accuracy"" and be aware of the hardware optimizations impact
on other statistical properties.
  This work takes a first step towards defining metrics and a methodology for
quantitatively evaluating correctness of probabilistic accelerators beyond
end-point result quality. We propose three pillars of statistical robustness:
1) sampling quality, 2) convergence diagnostic, and 3) goodness of fit. We
apply our framework to a representative MCMC accelerator and surface design
issues that cannot be exposed using only application end-point result quality.
Applying the framework to guide design space exploration shows that statistical
robustness comparable to floating-point software can be achieved by slightly
increasing the bit representation, without floating-point hardware

of the characteristic roots in the pseudospectra and, therefore, they are for
instance important from a robust stability point of view. In this paper we
present a numerical method for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa

sets of an appropriately defined complex function. These connections lead us to
a bisection algorithm for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa, where
each step relies on checking the presence of imaginary axis eigenvalues of an
appropriately defined operator. Because this operator is infinite-dimensional a
predictor-corrector approach is taken. In the predictor step the bisection
algorithm is applied where the operator is discretized into a matrix, yielding
approximations for the pseudospectral abscissa. The effect of the
discretization is fully characterized in the paper. In the corrector step, the
approximate pseudospectral abscissa are corrected to any given accuracy, by
solving a set of nonlinear equations that characterize extreme points in the

speed. Solar wind that has a strong geoeffectiveness requires solar wind
dynamic pressure $>$3 nPa or solar wind density $>3$ nPa$/V_{sw}^2$. Large and

for a deep neural network, there exist trainable sub-networks performing
equally or better than the original model with commensurate training steps.
While this discovery is insightful, finding proper sub-networks requires
iterative training and pruning. The high cost incurred limits the applications
of the lottery ticket hypothesis. We show there exists a subset of the
aforementioned sub-networks that converge significantly faster during the
training process and thus can mitigate the cost issue. We conduct extensive
experiments to show such sub-networks consistently exist across various model
structures for a restrictive setting of hyperparameters ($e.g.$, carefully
selected learning rate, pruning ratio, and model capacity). As a practical
application of our findings, we demonstrate that such sub-networks can help in
cutting down the total time of adversarial training, a standard approach to
improve robustness, by up to 49\% on CIFAR-10 to achieve the state-of-the-art
robustness.

  Localization Using CSI","18 pages, 11 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT), Location based Services (LBS)
are gaining significant attention over the past years. Location information is
one of the important ingredients for many LBS where the system requires to
localize multiple targets in indoor setting. As an emerging technique,
device-free localization (DFL) is promising to localize the target without
attaching any transceivers. In this paper, we propose CoMuTe, the first
convolutional neural network (CNN) based device free multiple target
localization leveraging the Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple
wireless links. The system represents the CSIs as Multi-link Time-Frequency
(MLTF) image by organizing them as time-frequency matrices and utilize these
MLTF images as the input feature for CNN network. The CoMuTe models multi
target localization as a multi label spot classification approach under the
assumption that each MLTF image is associated with multiple labels/spots. The
localization is performed with a training stage and a localization stage. In
the training stage, the CSI based MLTF images are constructed with single
target at each location. The constructed images are used to train the CNN via a
gradient based optimization algorithm. In the localization stage, the test MLTF
image obtained for targets at multiple spots is fed to the CNN network and
locations of the targets are calculated using sigmoid activation function in
the output layer under the multi label classification framework. Extensive
experiments are conducted to select appropriate parameters for the CNN
architecture as well as for the system design. The experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of CoMuTe over existing multi target
localization approaches.

experimentally by Benjamin and Feir (1967), Stokes waves on deep water are
unstable under a sideband modulation. The plane-wave solution of the NLS
equation, which represents the fundamental component of the Stokes wave,
experiences a similar modulational instability under the linear perturbation
theory. A nonlinear extension for this perturbed wave is given by the family of
Soliton on Finite Background (SFB), where an exact expression is available and
can be derived analytically by several techniques. We discuss the
characteristics of the SFB family as a prime candidate for freak wave events.
The corresponding physical wave field exhibits intriguing phenomena of
wavefront dislocation and phase singularity.

driving behavior, including driver's drowsiness level. Analysis of these data
points will help in prediction of crashes and road infrastructure improvements

finding the effective mechanical response of a periodic heterogeneous solid.
Previous works apply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in combination with
various fixed-point methods to solve the problem on the periodic unit cell.
These have proven extremely powerful in a range of problems ranging from
image-based modeling to dislocation plasticity. However, the fixed-point
iterations can converge very slowly, or not at all, if the elastic properties
have high contrast, such as in the case of voids. The paper examines the
reasons for slow, or lack of convergence, in terms of a variational
perspective. In particular, when the material contains regions with zero or
very small stiffness, there is lack of uniqueness, and the energy landscape has
flat or shallow directions. Therefore, in this work, the fixed-point iteration
is replaced by the RPM iteration. The RPM uses the fixed-point iteration to
adaptively identify the subspace on which fixed-point iterations are unstable,
and performs Newton iterations only on the unstable subspace, while fixed-point
iterations are performed on the complementary stable subspace. This combination
of efficient fixed-point iterations where possible, and expensive but
well-convergent Newton iterations where required, is shown to lead to robust
and efficient convergence of the method. In particular, RPM-FFT converges well
for a wide range of choices of the reference medium, while usual fixed-point
iterations are usually sensitive to this choice.

States has stagnated and begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite
images and street view images prior work has demonstrated associations of the
built environment with income, education, access to care and health factors
such as obesity. However, assessment of learned image feature relationships
with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been
lacking.
  Objective: Investigate prediction of county-level mortality rates in the U.S.
using satellite images.
  Design: Satellite images were extracted with the Google Static Maps
application programming interface for 430 counties representing approximately
68.9% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using
crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned
image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations,
clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors.
  Main Outcomes and Measures: County mortality was predicted using satellite
images.
  Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of
counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson
r=0.72). Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters
that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race and age.
  Conclusion and Relevance: The application of deep learning techniques to
remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful
predictor of mortality in the United States. Tools that are able to identify
image features associated with health-related outcomes can inform targeted
public health interventions.

of memory organisation targeting energy-efficient digital accelerators have
been investigated in the past, however, they do not completely encapsulate the
energy costs at a system level. To address this shortcoming and to account for
various overheads, we synthesize the controller and memory for different
encoding schemes and extract the energy costs from these synthesized blocks.
Additionally, we introduce functional encoding for structured connectivity such
as the connectivity in convolutional layers. Functional encoding offers a 58%
reduction in the energy to implement a backward pass and weight update in such
layers compared to existing index-based solutions. We show that for a 2 layer
spiking neural network trained to retain a spatio-temporal pattern, bitmap
(PB-BMP) based organization can encode the sparser networks more efficiently.
This form of encoding delivers a 1.37x improvement in energy efficiency coming
at the cost of a 4% degradation in network retention accuracy as measured by
the van Rossum distance.
