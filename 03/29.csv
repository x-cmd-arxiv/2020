  interfacial superconductor",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coulomb drag refers to the phenomenon that a charge current in one electronic
circuit induces a responsive current in a neighboring circuit solely through
Coulomb interactions. For conventional interactions between fermionic particles
such as electrons, the as-induced drag current in the passive layer is orders
of magnitude weaker than the active current due to strong dielectric screening
effect between the two. Here we propose a 'super' Coulomb drag effect between
an active normal conductor and a passive superconductor of Josephson junction
arrays, whereby the passive current can greatly exceed the active. The drag
force originates from the interactions between the substantially enhanced
dynamical quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phases in the passive
layer and the normal electrons in the active layer. We demonstrate this effect
in the devices composed of monolayer graphene and LaAlO3/SrTiO3
heterointerface, an inherently non-uniform superconductor described by
Josephson junction arrays. Remarkable drag signal is observed in the
superconducting transition regime of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, with its sign
independent of the carrier type in the graphene layer. The estimated
passive-to-active ratio can reach about 0.3 at the optimal gate voltage and the
temperature dependence follows that of the typical Josephson energy between
superconducting puddles. Strikingly, the ratio ought to be as large as 10^5 at
zero temperature by theoretical extrapolation. From engineering perspective,
our device may work as current or voltage transformers, and the drag mechanism
lays the foundation for synchronizing Josephson-junction-array-based terahertz
radiators.

molecules. Laser light can induce in a controlled manner new conical
intersections, called light-induced conical intersections, which lead to strong
nonadiabatic effects similar to those of the natural conical intersections.
These effects are, however, controllable and may even compete with those of the
natural intersections. In this work we show that the standard low-energy
vibrational spectrum of the electronic ground state can change dramatically by
inducing nonadiabaticity via a light-induced conical intersection. This generic

a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach (a variant of DeepQ-Learning) to triage

clinical vignettes, was created by medical doctors to represent real-life

that this approach is on a par with human performance, yielding safe triage

trained agent learns when to stop asking questions, acquires optimized decision
policies requiring less evidence than supervised approaches, and adapts to the
novelty of a situation by asking for more information. Overall, we demonstrate
that a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach can learn effective medical triage
policies directly from expert decisions, without requiring expert knowledge

As in previous studies, without repulsive vector interaction, an unphysical
region of negative entropy density is found near the first order chiral phase
transition. We explore the connection between this unphysical region and the
chiral critical region, especially the first order line and spinodal lines,
using also different values for vector interactions. The effect of finite
vector interactions in the critical region is explored. We find that the
unphysical negative entropy density region appears because the $s=0$ isentropic
line, near the critical region, is displaced from its $T=0$ location. For
certain values of vector interactions this region is pushed to lower
temperatures and high chemical potentials in such way that the negative entropy
density region on the phase diagram of the model can even disapear. In the case

non-trivial behaviour in the $T-\mu_B$ plane, which differs from that in

$G$ with cosmic time using gravitational-wave (GW) observations of merging
binary neutron stars. The method essentially relies on the fact that the
maximum and minimum allowed masses of neutron stars at a particular cosmic
epoch has a simple dependence on the value of $G$ at that epoch. GWs carry an
imprint of the value of $G$ at the time of the merger. Thus, if the value of
$G$ at merger is significantly different from its current value, the masses of
the neutron stars inferred from the GW observations will be inconsistent with
the theoretically allowed range. This enables us to place bounds on the
variation of $G$ between the merger epoch and the present epoch. Using the
observation of the binary neutron star system GW170817, we constrain the
fractional difference in $G$ between the merger and the current epoch to be in
the range $-1 \lesssim \Delta G/G \lesssim 8$. Assuming a monotonic variation
in $G$, this corresponds to a bound on the average rate of change of $-7 \times
10^{-9}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1} \le \dot{G}/G \le 5 \times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
between these epochs. Future observations will put tight constraints on the

convergence to the neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium is achieved. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through numerical

enough to overcome a pinning potential that results from intrinsic exchange
forces and extrinsic surface effects. The Bloch point can be driven by the
external field reversibly, in a direction opposing the field, and it remains
stable up to moderate field strengths. At a critical field strength the Bloch
point escapes through one of the surfaces, leaving behind a collinear
magnetization configuration, and upon removing the field a new Bloch point is
formed. These findings highlight the topological diversity in nanostructures

show that model complexity is a critical factor when only a few samples per
class are available. Differently from the literature, we show that in some
configurations, the state of the art can be improved using low complexity
models. For instance, in problems with scarce training samples and without data
augmentation, low-complexity convolutional neural networks perform comparably
well or better than state-of-the-art architectures. Moreover, we show that even
standard data augmentation can boost recognition performance by large margins.
This result suggests the development of more complex data
generation/augmentation pipelines for cases when data is limited. Finally, we
show that dropout, a widely used regularization technique, maintains its role
as a good regularizer even when data is scarce. Our findings are empirically
validated on the sub-sampled versions of popular CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST and,
SVHN benchmarks.

to characterize the joint health effects attributable to exposure mixtures.
However, the underlying dose-response relationship between toxicants and health
outcomes of interest may be highly nonlinear, with possible nonlinear
interaction effects. Existing penalized regression methods that account for
exposure interactions either cannot accommodate nonlinear interactions while
maintaining strong heredity or are computationally unstable in applications
with limited sample size. In this paper, we propose a general shrinkage and
selection framework to identify noteworthy nonlinear main and interaction
effects among a set of exposures. We design hierarchical integrative group
LASSO (HiGLASSO) to (a) impose strong heredity constraints on two-way
interaction effects (hierarchical), (b) incorporate adaptive weights without
necessitating initial coefficient estimates (integrative), and (c) induce
sparsity for variable selection while respecting group structure (group LASSO).
We prove sparsistency of the proposed method and apply HiGLASSO to an
environmental toxicants dataset from the LIFECODES birth cohort, where the
investigators are interested in understanding the joint effects of 21 urinary
toxicant biomarkers on urinary 8-isoprostane, a measure of oxidative stress. An

a dynamic task migration scheme based on cooperative improved Q-learning is
proposed, which can effectively reduce delay and alleviate congestion. Thirdly,
for minimizing delay and energy consumption for resources allocation in a

feature alignment of source and target domain is hard to be realized. To
mitigate these problems, we propose a Graph-induced Prototype Alignment (GPA)
framework to seek for category-level domain alignment via elaborate prototype
representations. In the nutshell, more precise instance-level features are
obtained through graph-based information propagation among region proposals,
and, on such basis, the prototype representation of each class is derived for
category-level domain alignment. In addition, in order to alleviate the
negative effect of class-imbalance on domain adaptation, we design a
Class-reweighted Contrastive Loss to harmonize the adaptation training process.
Combining with Faster R-CNN, the proposed framework conducts feature alignment
in a two-stage manner. Comprehensive results on various cross-domain detection
tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods with a

problem, involving the dichotomous categories of signal and background. In
distribution fits for particle masses or couplings, however, signal events are
not all equivalent, as the signal differential cross section has different
sensitivities to the measured parameter in different regions of phase space. In
this paper, I describe a mathematical framework for the evaluation and
optimization of HEP parameter fits, where this sensitivity is defined on an
event-by-event basis, and for MC events it is modeled in terms of their MC
weight derivatives with respect to the measured parameter. Minimising the
statistical error on a measurement implies the need to resolve (i.e. separate)
events with different sensitivities, which ultimately represents a
non-dichotomous classification problem. Since MC weight derivatives are not
available for real data, the practical strategy I suggest consists in training
a regressor of weight derivatives against MC events, and then using it as an
optimal partitioning variable for 1-dimensional fits of data events. This
CHEP2019 paper is an extension of the study presented at CHEP2018: in
particular, event-by-event sensitivities allow the exact computation of the
""FIP"" ratio between the Fisher information obtained from an analysis and the
maximum information that could possibly be obtained with an ideal detector.
Using this expression, I discuss the relationship between FIP and two metrics
commonly used in Meteorology (Brier score and MSE), and the importance of
""sharpness"" both in HEP and in that domain. I finally point out that HEP
distribution fits should be optimized and evaluated using probabilistic metrics
(like FIP or MSE), whereas ranking metrics (like AUC) or threshold metrics
(like accuracy) are of limited relevance for these specific problems.

constructive proof for the existence of efficient position is given for

No time bounds can be deduced.
  We note that the algorithm presented in this thesis and the algorithm
suggested by a careful reading of [Takarajima,2000] coincide in the case of
closed surfaces. However, this thesis constitutes more than a time-complexity
analysis of Takarajima's constructive proof. Firstly, we are more general as we
allow surfaces with boundary, whereas Takarajima only considers closed
surfaces. Secondly, our combinatorial set-up uses arcs and curves with
transverse self-intersection, whereas the barycentric subdivision of
complementary regions carried out in [Takarajima,2000] forces non-transverse
self-intersection even for curves which are initially embedded. Thirdly, the
algorithm in this thesis is formulated purely in terms of local homotopies,
whereas [Takarajima,2000] requires semi-local arguments. Thus, we can, and do,
give pseudocode for our algorithm as well as prove its correctness.

We find that the fundamental non-centrosymmetric structure T_d is fully

pressure of p_cr = 1.2 GPa. This is strong evidence for a pressure induced
quantum phase transition (QPT) between topological to a trivial electronic

is interesting that the superconducting critical temperature T_c, the
superfluid density, and the SC gap all change smoothly and continuously across
p_cr and no sudden effects are seen concomitantly with the suppression of the

unaffected by the topological QPT. However, the QPT requires the change in the

downstream tasks faster or for better accuracy. However, gaining robustness
from pretraining is left unexplored. We introduce adversarial training into
self-supervision, to provide general-purpose robust pre-trained models for the
first time. We find these robust pre-trained models can benefit the subsequent
fine-tuning in two ways: i) boosting final model robustness; ii) saving the
computation cost, if proceeding towards adversarial fine-tuning. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves large
performance margins (eg, 3.83% on robust accuracy and 1.3% on standard
accuracy, on the CIFAR-10 dataset), compared with the conventional end-to-end
adversarial training baseline. Moreover, we find that different self-supervised
pre-trained models have a diverse adversarial vulnerability. It inspires us to
ensemble several pretraining tasks, which boosts robustness more. Our ensemble
strategy contributes to a further improvement of 3.59% on robust accuracy,
while maintaining a slightly higher standard accuracy on CIFAR-10. Our codes

plasma is well accounted for by a thick-target model of accelerated electrons
collisionally thermalizing within the loop, akin to the ""coronal thick target""
behavior occasionally observed in larger flares. This is the first positive
detection of non-thermal hard X-rays from the Sun using a direct imager (as
opposed to indirectly imaging instruments). The accelerated electron
distribution has a spectral index of 6.3 +/- 0.7, extends down to at least 6.5
keV, and deposits energy at a rate of ~2x1027 erg/s, heating the flare loop to
at least 10 MK. The existence of dominant non-thermal emission in X-rays down
to <5 keV means that RHESSI emission is almost entirely non-thermal, contrary
to what is usually assumed in RHESSI spectroscopy. The ratio of non-thermal to
thermal energies is similar to that of large flares, in contrast to what has
been found in previous studies of small RHESSI flares. We suggest that a
coronal thick target may be a common property of many small microflares based
on the average electron energy and collisional mean free path. Future
observations of this kind will enable understanding of how flare particle
acceleration changes across energy scales, and will aid the push toward the
observational regime of nanoflares, which are a possible source of significant
coronal heating.

different ENSO phases. Without this coupling, the El Nino region is in a normal

coupling changes to be strong between the El Nino region and the Southern

leading to a La Nina event. Moreover, the coupling between the El Nino region
and the second principal mode is found to be strong in normal or La Nina phases

temporal evolutions of these couplings for the first and second principal modes
are controlled by the meridional and zonal ocean-atmospheric circulations

scheme that rapidly adapts the weights of the model to shift the output's

inherit from the distribution of both generic human faces and the one-shot

other downstream tasks. Such setting is appealing as it requires labeling very
few, or even one example, in the target domain, which is often the case of
real-world face manipulations that result from a variety of unknown and unique

our one-shot approach for detecting face manipulations and compare it with

connection between geometric distances at low redshift and Type Ia supernovae

period--luminosity relation or the luminosity of the Tip of the Red Giant
Branch (TRGB) feature of the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Any potential
solution to the Hubble tension that works by altering the distance ladder must
produce consistency of both the Cepheid and TRGB $H_0$ calibrations with the

reduction in inferred $H_0$ requires that the stars that calibrate the
luminosity---currently in the LMC---are on average less screened than those
that calibrate the supernova magnitude. We show that even under pessimistic
assumptions for the extinction to the LMC, full consistency with Planck can be
achieved for a fifth force strength in unscreened RGB stars $\sim$0.2 that of

decisions in real-time. For example, a mobile health (mHealth) application
designed to increase physical activity must make contextually relevant
suggestions to motivate users. While machine learning offers solutions for
certain stylized settings, such as when batch data can be processed offline,
there is a dearth of approaches which can deliver high-quality solutions under
the specific constraints of mHealth. We propose an algorithm which provides
users with contextualized and personalized physical activity suggestions. This
algorithm is able to overcome a challenge critical to mHealth that complex
models be trained efficiently. We propose a tractable streamlined empirical
Bayes procedure which fits linear mixed effects models in large-data settings.
Our procedure takes advantage of sparsity introduced by hierarchical random
effects to efficiently learn the posterior distribution of a linear mixed
effects model. A key contribution of this work is that we provide explicit
updates in order to learn both fixed effects, random effects and
hyper-parameter values. We demonstrate the success of this approach in a mobile
health (mHealth) reinforcement learning application, a domain in which fast
computations are crucial for real time interventions. Not only is our approach
computationally efficient, it is also easily implemented with closed form
matrix algebraic updates and we show improvements over state of the art
approaches both in speed and accuracy of up to 99% and 56% respectively.

residual migration can be utilized for the case that a prestack time or depth
migration has been performed for a seismic survey and a new depth is available:
The concept of residual migration is introduced by determining travel times of
reflected events for individual traces from aplanatic curves. These events are
migrated in suitable configurations for the new velocity model for which a
raytracing set as required for a Kirchhoff prestack depth migration is
available. The resulting transformations can be utilized in various ways to
estimate important parameters such as the positional bias of migrated events
with respect to the corresponding zero offset position and the residual moveout
for the new depth model ; finally a new approach is suggested to estimate the
aperture width over the Fresnel zone for the first prestack migration. Various
mapped prestack migrations can be estimated, including a prestack time
migration with eliminated positional bias. The necessity of a new prestack
depth migration can be assessed from the aperture width over the first order
Fresnel zone and from the positional bias at a particular offset. Additional
kinematic parameters can be acquired for a residual prestack migration, in
particular the curves over which the residual summation has to be performed.
The approach is applicable to isotropic and anisotropic PSTM and PSDM.
Computational costs of the implementation are low when compared to a full PSDM.
  In the appendix a formula is derived for the migration velocities for a
prestack time migration for small to intermediate source receiver offsets. The
velocities can be determined either from an inhomogeneous anisotropic depth
model or from residual moveout analyses of a previous migration.

the information on dependence structure in data from their marginal
distributions. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the

RESOLVE survey, a volume-limited census of galaxies in the local universe, to
probe whether this population contains any residual ``blue nuggets,'' a class
of intensely star-forming compact galaxies first identified at high redshift
$z$. Our 50 low-$z$ CDS galaxies are defined by dwarf masses (stellar mass $M_*
< 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), compact bulged-disk or spheroid-dominated
morphologies (using a quantitative criterion, $\mu_\Delta > 8.6$), and specific
star formation rates above the defining threshold for high-$z$ blue nuggets
($\log$ SSFR [Gyr$^{-1}] > -0.5$). Across redshifts, blue nuggets exhibit three
defining properties: compactness relative to contemporaneous galaxies, abundant
cold gas, and formation via compaction in mergers or colliding streams. Those
with halo mass below $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{11.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ may in theory
evade permanent quenching and cyclically refuel until the present day. Selected
only for compactness and starburst activity, our CDS galaxies generally have
$M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and gas-to-stellar mass ratio
$\gtrsim$1. Moreover, analysis of archival DECaLS photometry and new 3D
spectroscopic observations for CDS galaxies reveals a high rate of photometric
and kinematic disturbances suggestive of dwarf mergers. The SSFRs, surface mass
densities, and number counts of CDS galaxies are compatible with theoretical
and observational expectations for redshift evolution in blue nuggets. We argue
that CDS galaxies represent a maximally-starbursting subset of traditional
compact dwarf classes such as blue compact dwarfs and blue E/S0s. We conclude
that CDS galaxies represent a low-$z$ tail of the blue nugget phenomenon formed
via a moderated compaction channel that leaves open the possibility of disk
regrowth and evolution into normal disk galaxies.

between splay and polar order becomes sufficiently strong, the uniform nematic

re-examine this theory in terms of a new approach to liquid crystal elasticity,
which shows that pure splay deformation is double splay rather than planar
single splay. Following that reasoning, we propose a structure with a 2D splay
modulation of the director field, accompanied by a 2D modulation of polar
order, and show that the 2D structure generally has a lower free energy than

Magnetic resonances with narrow linewidth are generated experimentally using a
rubidium vapor cell with octade-cyltrichlorosilane (OTS) antirelaxation coating
on inner walls. We studied the effect of light ellipticity on the amplitudes
and widths of magnetic resonances by matching the light modulation frequency
with 2 {\Omega}_L (alignment) and {\Omega}_L(orientation) in a Bell-Bloom
interaction geometry, where {\Omega}_L corresponds to the Larmor frequency.
Both 2 {\Omega}_L and \OmegaL resonance amplitudes showed a strong dependence
on the light ellipticity. In addition, we showed that the duty cycle of light
modulation changes the slope of amplitude variations in 2{\Omega}_L and
{\Omega}_L resonances with light ellipticity. As a potential application, we
showed that the difference between 2{\Omega}_Land {\Omega}_Lresonance
amplitudes can be used for in situ measurement of light ellipticity. We also
studied the dependence of 2{\Omega}_L and {\Omega}_L resonance amplitudes on
the polarization angle of linearly polarized light. These amplitudes oscillate
periodically with the polarization angle. We found this oscillatory behavior to
be sensitive to the tilt in magnetic field direction from the polarization
plane. Such a property could be used to realize a vector magnetometer. A
density matrix based theoretical model is developed to simulate the magnetic
resonance spectrum for different light polarizations. Our theoretical model
accurately reproduces the above mentioned experimental observations.

is on the one hand due to the closed ecosystem putting obstacles in the way of
reverse engineers and on the other hand due to the complexity of reverse
engineering and analyzing app binaries. Reliably lifting accurate call graphs,
control flows, and data dependence graphs from binary code, as well as
reconstructing object-oriented high-level concepts is a non-trivial task and
the choice of the lifted target representation determines the analysis
capabilities. None of the various existing intermediate representations is a
perfect fit for all types of analysis, while the detection of vulnerabilities
requires techniques ranging from simple pattern matching to complex
inter-procedural data flow analyses. We address this gap by introducing liOS, a
binary lifting and analysis framework for iOS applications that extracts lifted
information from several frontends and unifies them in a ""supergraph""
representation that tolerates missing parts and is further extended and
interlinked by liOS ""passes"". A static analysis of the binary is then realized
in the form of graph traversal queries, which can be considered as an
advancement of classic program query languages. We illustrate this approach by
means of a typical JavaScript/Objective-C bridge, which can lead to remote code
execution in iOS applications.

by Bjorken x, $h(x,t)\equiv xq_V(x,t)$, we observe that $h(x,t)$ at the peak
should become a one parameter function; $h(x_p,t)=\Phi(x_p(t))$, where $x_p$ is
the position of the peak and $t= \log{Q^2}$. This observation is used to derive
a new model independent relation which connects the partial derivative of the
valence parton distribution functions (PDFs) in $x_p$ to the QCD evolution
equation through the $x_p$-derivative of the logarithm of the function
$\Phi(x_p(t))$. A numerical analysis of this relation using empirical PDFs
results in a observation of the exponential form of the $\Phi(x_p(t)) =
h(x_p,t) = Ce^{D x_p(t)}$ for leading to next-to-next leading order
approximations of PDFs for the all $Q^2$ range covering four orders in
magnitude. The exponent, $D$, of the observed ""height-position"" correlation
function converges with the increase of the order of approximation. This result
holds for all PDF sets considered. A similar relation is observed also for pion
valence quark distribution, indicating that the obtained relation may be
universal for any non-singlet partonic distribution. The observed ""height -
position"" correlation is used also to indicate that no finite number exchanges
can describe the analytic behavior of the valence quark distribution at the
position of the peak at fixed $Q^2$.

resonance (FMR) assisted Spin Transfer Torque (STT) switching of perpendicular
MTJ (p-MTJ) with inhomogeneities using micromagnetic simulations that include
the effect of thermal noise. With suitable frequency excitation, the SAW can
induce ferromagnetic resonance in magnetostrictive materials, and the
magnetization can precesses in a cone with high deflection from the
perpendicular direction. With incorporation of inhomogeneity via lateral
anisotropy variation as well as room temperature thermal noise, the
magnetization precession in different gains can be significantly incoherent.
Interestingly, the precession in different grains are found to be in phase,
even though the precession amplitude (angle of deflection from the
perpendicular direction) vary across grains of different anisotropy.
Nevertheless, the high mean deflection angle can complement the STT switching
by reducing the STT current significantly; even though the applied stress
induced change in anisotropy is much lower than the total anisotropy barrier.
This work indicates that SAW assisted switching can improve energy efficiency
while being scalable to very small dimensions, which is technologically
important for STT-RAM and elucidates the physical mechanism for the potential
robustness of this paradigm in realistic scenarios with thermal noise and

Network slicing is a promising technology for creating virtual networks that

Provisioning network slices requires end-to-end resource orchestration which is
challenging. In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration
system named EdgeSlice for dynamic end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice
introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning (D-DRL) method to
efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a
performance coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance
coordinator manages the resource orchestration policies in all the
orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA) of network
slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices
and orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the
performance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing
resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic
configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a
prototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with
OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform.
The performance of EdgeSlice is evaluated through both experiments and
trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that EdgeSlice achieves
much improvement as compared to baseline in terms of performance, scalability,
compatibility.

that rigid foldability is affected by the mountain-valley crease (M-V)
assignment of an origami pattern. In this paper, we investigate the rigid
foldability of the square-twist origami pattern with diverse M-V assignments by
a kinematic method based on the motion transmission path. Four types of
square-twist origami patterns are analyzed, among which two are found rigidly
foldable, while the other two are not. The explicit kinematic equations of the
rigid cases are derived based on the kinematic equivalence between the rigid
origami pattern and the closed-loop network of spherical 4R linkages. We also
propose a crease-addition method to convert the rigid foldability of the
non-rigid patterns. The motion compatibility conditions of the modified
patterns are checked, which verify the rigid foldability of the modified
patterns. The kinematic analysis reveals the bifurcation behaviour of the
modified patterns. This work not only helps to deepen our understanding on the
rigid foldability of origami patterns and its relationship with the M-V

  Stochastic Gradient Descent",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel approach called Optimized Directed Roadmap Graph (ODRM).
It is a method to build a directed roadmap graph that allows for collision
avoidance in multi-robot navigation. This is a highly relevant problem, for
example for industrial autonomous guided vehicles. The core idea of ODRM is,
that a directed roadmap can encode inherent properties of the environment which
are useful when agents have to avoid each other in that same environment. Like
Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs), ODRM's first step is generating samples from
C-space. In a second step, ODRM optimizes vertex positions and edge directions
by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This leads to emergent properties like
edges parallel to walls and patterns similar to two-lane streets or
roundabouts. Agents can then navigate on this graph by searching their path
independently and solving occurring agent-agent collisions at run-time. Using
the graphs generated by ODRM compared to a non-optimized graph significantly
fewer agent-agent collisions happen. We evaluate our roadmap with both,
centralized and decentralized planners. Our experiments show that with ODRM
even a simple centralized planner can solve problems with high numbers of
agents that other multi-agent planners can not solve. Additionally, we use
simulated robots with decentralized planners and online collision avoidance to
show how agents are a lot faster on our roadmap than on standard grid maps.

frequency-tagging, to investigate the aftereffect of tACS in healthy human
subjects. Seven blocks of 64-channel electroencephalogram were recorded before

several blocks of SSVEP tasks. We characterized the physiological properties of

setting of a single source domain, where all the labeled source data come from
the same distribution. However, in practice the labeled data can come from
multiple source domains with different distributions. In such scenarios, the
single source domain adaptation methods can fail due to the existence of domain
shifts across different source domains and multi-source domain adaptation
methods need to be designed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source
domain adaptation method, Mutual Learning Network for Multiple Source Domain
Adaptation (ML-MSDA). Under the framework of mutual learning, the proposed
method pairs the target domain with each single source domain to train a
conditional adversarial domain adaptation network as a branch network, while
taking the pair of the combined multi-source domain and target domain to train
a conditional adversarial adaptive network as the guidance network. The
multiple branch networks are aligned with the guidance network to achieve
mutual learning by enforcing JS-divergence regularization over their prediction
probability distributions on the corresponding target data. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple multi-source domain adaptation benchmark

channel parameters to develop optimum receiver processing techniques. However,
even before signal processing, antenna structure and radiation parameters
affect the beamforming performance primarily. For example, in contrast to
common belief, narrow beamwidth (bmW) may result in degraded beamforming
performance. In order to address the impairments such as beam misalignments,
outage loss, tracking inability, blockage, etc., an optimum value of the bmW
must be determined. In this paper, assuming a communication system that creates
a beam per cluster, we theoretically investigate the bmW and received power
relation in the cluster level mmWave channels. We adopt ULA structure and
formulate its antenna gain with respect to the bmW. Two beam models are
considered for the main lobe of the array pattern, rectangular and triangular.
We derive bmW-dependent extracted power expressions for two intra-cluster
channel models, 802.11ad and our previous work, RT-ICM. Combining antenna and
channel gains, in case of a beam misalignment, we find that the optimum bmW
that maximizes the received power is larger than the alignment error when the
error itself is larger than the standard deviation of the cluster power-angle
spectrum. Once the alignment error is smaller than the standard deviation, we
confirm that the optimum bmW converges zero. Performing asymptotic analysis of
the received power, we give the formulation and insights that the practical
nonzero bmW values can be achieved although sacrificing subtle from the maximum
received power. Our analysis shows that to reach 95% of the maximum power for
an indoor mmWave cluster, a practical bmW of 7-10 degrees is enough, which can
be created with 18-20 antenna elements. In the simulation section, we show that
the expressions given by the analysis match to the simulated results.

To alleviate the demand for manual annotations, in this paper, we propose a
novel self-supervised hybrid model (DAE-GAN) that learns how to reenact face
naturally given large amounts of unlabeled videos. Our approach combines two
deforming autoencoders with the latest advances in the conditional generation.
On the one hand, we adopt the deforming autoencoder to disentangle identity and
pose representations. A strong prior in talking face videos is that each frame
can be encoded as two parts: one for video-specific identity and the other for
various poses. Inspired by that, we utilize a multi-frame deforming autoencoder
to learn a pose-invariant embedded face for each video. Meanwhile, a
multi-scale deforming autoencoder is proposed to extract pose-related
information for each frame. On the other hand, the conditional generator allows
for enhancing fine details and overall reality. It leverages the disentangled
features to generate photo-realistic and pose-alike face images. We evaluate
our model on VoxCeleb1 and RaFD dataset. Experiment results demonstrate the
superior quality of reenacted images and the flexibility of transferring facial

distribution of relationships. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a Graph
Property Sensing Network (GPS-Net) that fully explores these three properties
for SGG. First, we propose a novel message passing module that augments the
node feature with node-specific contextual information and encodes the edge
direction information via a tri-linear model. Second, we introduce a node
priority sensitive loss to reflect the difference in priority between nodes
during training. This is achieved by designing a mapping function that adjusts
the focusing parameter in the focal loss. Third, since the frequency of
relationships is affected by the long-tailed distribution problem, we mitigate
this issue by first softening the distribution and then enabling it to be
adjusted for each subject-object pair according to their visual appearance.
Systematic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
techniques. Moreover, GPS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
popular databases: VG, OI, and VRD by significant gains under various settings
and metrics. The code and models are available at

mobile agents receive rewards by sampling from a collection of spatially

decentralized policy for each agent, in order to maximize the total cumulative
reward over all agents, subject to option availability and inter-agent
communication constraints. The problem formulation is motivated by applications
in which a team of autonomous mobile robots cooperates to accomplish an
exploration and exploitation task in an uncertain environment. Bandit locations
are represented by vertices of the spatial graph. At any time, an agent's
option consist of sampling the bandit at its current location, or traveling
along an edge of the spatial graph to a new bandit location. Communication
constraints are described by a directed, non-stationary, stochastic
communication graph. At any time, agents may receive data only from their
communication graph in-neighbors. For the case of a single agent on a fully
connected spatial graph, it is known that the expected regret for any optimal
policy is necessarily bounded below by a function that grows as the logarithm
of time. A class of policies called upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms
asymptotically achieve logarithmic regret for the classical MAB problem. In
this paper, we propose a UCB-based decentralized motion and option selection
policy and a non-stationary stochastic communication protocol that guarantee
logarithmic regret. To our knowledge, this is the first such decentralized
policy for non-fully connected spatial graphs with communication constraints.
When the spatial graph is fully connected and the communication graph is
stationary, our decentralized algorithm matches or exceeds the best reported
prior results from the literature.

  Learning of 3D Point Clouds","Accepted to CVPR2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local and global patterns of an object are closely related. Although each
part of an object is incomplete, the underlying attributes about the object are
shared among all parts, which makes reasoning the whole object from a single
part possible. We hypothesize that a powerful representation of a 3D object
should model the attributes that are shared between parts and the whole object,
and distinguishable from other objects. Based on this hypothesis, we propose to
learn point cloud representation by bidirectional reasoning between the local
structures at different abstraction hierarchies and the global shape without
human supervision. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets
demonstrate the unsupervisedly learned representation is even better than
supervised representation in discriminative power, generalization ability, and
robustness. We show that unsupervisedly trained point cloud models can
outperform their supervised counterparts on downstream classification tasks.
Most notably, by simply increasing the channel width of an SSG PointNet++, our
unsupervised model surpasses the state-of-the-art supervised methods on both

two-sided infinite particle configuration has been studied, by encoding the
particle configuration to a certain discrete path on Z and defining the dynamic
of the BBS in terms of the path. In this paper, we extend some results of the

an encoding of the \k{appa}-color particles configuration to a discrete path in

invariant in distribution under the dynamics of the multicolor BBS. Finally, we
introduce a continuous version of the multicolor BBS, which is defined for
continuous paths on R in \k{appa}-dimensional Euclidean space, and show that
\k{appa}-dimensional Brownian motion with a proper drift is invariant under the
dynamics of the continuous version of the multicolor BBS.

drones and also serve as communication links. The presence of more than one
interconnected drone provides enough degrees of freedom to navigate in a
cluttered area. The leader drone in the formation must reach a given point of
interest, while the followers must move accordingly, avoiding interference with
the obstacles. The challenges are the uncertainty in the environment, with
obstacles of unknown shape and position, the use of LiDAR (Light Detection And

each drone, and the presence of the tethers, which must not impact with the
obstacles and pose additional constraints to how the drones can move. To cope
with these problems, a novel real-time planning algorithm based on numerical
optimization is proposed: the reference position of each drone is chosen in a
centralized way via a convex program, where the LiDAR scans are used to
approximate the free space and the drones are moved towards suitably defined
intermediate goals in order to eventually reach the point of interest. The
approach is successfully tested in numerical simulations with a realistic model

metric of character distributions induced by the two-state symmetric Markov
substitution process on each tree. Infinitesimally, the metric is proportional
to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, or equivalently, as we show, any to f
-divergence. The second geometry is obtained analogously but using a related
continuous-valued Gaussian process on each tree, and it can be viewed as the
trace metric of the affine-invariant metric for covariance matrices. We derive
a gradient descent algorithm to project from the ambient space of covariance
matrices to wald space. For both geometries we derive computational methods to
compute geodesics in polynomial time and show numerically that the two
information geometries (discrete and continuous) are very similar. In
particular geodesics are approximated extrinsically. Comparison with the BHV
geometry shows that our canonical and biologically motivated space is
substantially different.

system by a plane wave, hence perfect absorption of this wave requires an
infinitely extended planar structure. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that a

different possible fracture geometries (radial, elliptical, tilted or not) and
estimate model error. The imaging is repeated every 4 seconds and provide a
quantitative measurement of the growth of these low velocity fractures. We test
the proposed method on two experiments performed in two different rocks (marble

results of the inversion indicate a radial geometry evolving slightly into an

a desirable feature for MVS in real scenarios. Towards this end, this paper
presents a Fast-MVSNet, a novel sparse-to-dense coarse-to-fine framework, for
fast and accurate depth estimation in MVS. Specifically, in our Fast-MVSNet, we
first construct a sparse cost volume for learning a sparse and high-resolution
depth map. Then we leverage a small-scale convolutional neural network to
encode the depth dependencies for pixels within a local region to densify the
sparse high-resolution depth map. At last, a simple but efficient Gauss-Newton
layer is proposed to further optimize the depth map. On one hand, the
high-resolution depth map, the data-adaptive propagation method and the
Gauss-Newton layer jointly guarantee the effectiveness of our method. On the
other hand, all modules in our Fast-MVSNet are lightweight and thus guarantee
the efficiency of our approach. Besides, our approach is also memory-friendly
because of the sparse depth representation. Extensive experimental results show
that our method is 5$\times$ and 14$\times$ faster than Point-MVSNet and

large amount of fully labeled data. Using advanced depth sensors, collection of

producing point-level label on the large scale dataset is time and
labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised approach to
predict point-level results using weak labels on 3D point clouds. We introduce
our multi-path region mining module to generate pseudo point-level label from a
classification network trained with weak labels. It mines the localization cues
for each class from various aspects of the network feature using different
attention modules. Then, we use the point-level pseudo labels to train a point
cloud segmentation network in a fully supervised manner. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first method that uses cloud-level weak labels on raw 3D
space to train a point cloud semantic segmentation network. In our setting, the
3D weak labels only indicate the classes that appeared in our input sample. We
discuss both scene- and subcloud-level weakly labels on raw 3D point cloud data
and perform in-depth experiments on them. On ScanNet dataset, our result
trained with subcloud-level labels is compatible with some fully supervised
methods.

is a key research goal at the intersection between physics and biology. Recent
studies have particularly focused on multiplex networks given that multiple
social domains are interrelated and cannot be represented by single-layer
networks. However, the role of network multiplexity is not fully understood
when combined with another important network characteristic: network dynamics.
In the present study, we investigated evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games
played on dynamic two-layer multiplex networks in which the payoff combined
across the two layers determined strategy evolution. In addition, we introduced
network dynamics where agents can sever links with defecting neighbors and
construct new links. Our simulation showed that link updating enhances
cooperation but the resultant states are far from those of full cooperation.
This modest enhancement in cooperation was related to symmetry breaking whereby
the cooperation frequency in one layer disproportionately increased while that
in the other layer remained the same or even diminished. However, this broken
symmetry disappeared with sufficiently fast link updating. Our results show
that the introduction of network dynamics enhances cooperation in the
prisoner's dilemma as previously reported, but this enhancement is accompanied
by significant asymmetry once network multiplexity is considered.

the same amount in $\alpha$ results in a transformation of a semi-amorphous

  High Level Synthesis tools improve the accessibility to FPGAs, but the

large-scale antenna array, execute, using the same frequency range, both
communication with mobile users and radar surveillance of the surrounding
environment, relying on the ability of the massive MIMO array to synthesize
multiple narrow beams. Based on an OFDM signaling format for both communication
and surveillance tasks, a lower bound to the system achievable downlink rate is
provided, along with a GLRT detection rule that does not require any knowledge
about the target parameters. Then, a power allocation strategy is proposed,
aimed at maximizing the fairness across the mobile users, while guaranteeing a
minimum signal to interference ratio threshold value for the radar system.
Numerical results show that the system performs effectively, and that the power
control procedure helps in improving the system fairness.

  Light",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, the nature of light is accounted for by one of the jewels of physics,
quantum electrodynamics (QED), the fundamental theory of light and matter. Yet
owing to its infinite complexity, scientists still debate how its central
concept, the photon, can be reconciled with the perceived existence of light
waves, emerging 200 years ago in the wake of Young's double slit diffraction
experiment. Ever since, the phenomenon of diffraction has been viewed to embody
the wave nature of light, leading to the schizophrenic wave-particle duality.
The latter does not exist in QED which is photon based without the existence of
waves. Here we introduce the new paradigm that diffraction images directly
reflect the fundamental quantum states of light. This is revealed by analysis
of the evolution of modern versions of Young's experiment performed with
differently modified laser light and photon-based detection. In conventional
quantum mechanics, corresponding to first order QED, the fundamental photon
nature of light remains hidden since different quantum states produce only two
basic types of diffraction patterns that may also be explained by coherent and
incoherent wave superposition. The true photon based substructure of light is
shown to clearly emerge through characteristic diffraction images in second
order QED. The degeneracy of the first order images is lifted, the
wave-particle equivalence breaks down, and the patterns directly reveal the
true quantum substructure of light. This allows the replacement of the
conventional concept of wave coherence by a precise order-dependent degree of
coherence that quantifies the interference and diffraction behavior of all
quantum states of light.

virtual resources allocation scheme based on the radio access network (RAN)
slicing for uplink communications to ensure the quality-of-service (QoS). To
maximum the weighted-sum transmission rate performance under delay constraint,
formulate a joint optimization problem of subchannel allocation and power
control as an infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision
process (CMDP) problem. Based on the equivalent Bellman equation, the optimal
control policy is first derived by the value iteration algorithm. However, the
optimal policy suffers from the widely known curse-of-dimensionality problem.
To address this problem, the linear value function approximation (approximate
dynamic programming) is adopted. Then, the subchannel allocation Q-factor is
decomposed into the per-slice Q-factor. Furthermore, the Q-factor and
Lagrangian multipliers are updated by the use of an online stochastic learning
algorithm. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can

quantization errors of the numbers of subcarriers. To tackle this problem, we
propose a cascaded structure of NNs, where the first NN approximates the

Considering that the distribution of wireless channels and the types of

learning to update NNs in non-stationary wireless networks. Simulation results
validate that the cascaded NNs outperform the fully connected NN in terms of

connection to Pauli-Villars regularization is established which gives the
anomalous term a new interpretation as arising from quantum fluctuations by
many-body correlations at short distances. This is exemplified by using an
effective many-body quantum potential which realizes quantum Slater sums by
classical calculations. It is shown that these quantum potentials avoid the
quantum anomaly but approaches the same anomalous result by many-body
correlations. A measure for the quality of quantum potentials is suggested to
describe these quantum fluctuations in the mean energy. Consequently quantum
anomalies might be a short-cut way of single-particle field theory to account
for many-body effects. This conjecture is also supported since the chiral

preprocessing and segmentation, the need for task-oriented classifiers, and
also the use of specific constraints related to the string length. A robust
experimental protocol based on several numeral string datasets, including one
composed of historical documents, has shown that the proposed method is a
feasible end-to-end solution for numeral string recognition. Besides, it
reduces the complexity of the string recognition task considerably since it
drops out classical steps, in special preprocessing, segmentation, and a set of
classifiers devoted to strings with a specific length.

(COVID-19) as a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Before this and in late
January, more specifically on January 27th, while the majority of the infection
cases were still reported in China and a few cruise ships, we began crawling
social media user postings using the Twitter search API. Our goal was to
leverage machine learning and linguistic tools to better understand the impact
of the outbreak in China. Unlike our initial expectation to monitor a local
outbreak, COVID-19 rapidly spread across the globe. In this short article we
report the preliminary results of our study on automatically detecting the
positive reports of COVID-19 from social media user postings using
state-of-the-art machine learning models.
