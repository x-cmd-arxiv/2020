without shape approximation for an arbitrary periodic charge distribution,
whose solution is known as the Yukawa potential or the screened Coulomb
potential. The method is an extension of Weinert's pseudo-charge method [M.
Weinert, J. Math. Phys. 22, 2433 (1981)] for solving the Poisson equation for
the same class of charge density distributions. The inherent differences
between the Poisson and the modified Helmholtz equation are in their respective
radial solutions. These are polynomial functions, for the Poisson equation, and
modified spherical Bessel functions, for the modified Helmholtz equation. This
leads to a definition of a modified pseudo-charge density and modified
multipole moments. We have shown that Weinert's convergence analysis of an
absolutely and uniformly convergent Fourier series of the pseudo-charge density
is transferred to the modified pseudo-charge density. We conclude by
illustrating the algorithmic changes necessary to turn an available
implementation of the Poisson solver into a solver for the modified Helmholtz
equation.

software variants during development phase in order to collect data from the
field of application. While currently this practice is used on a daily basis on
web-based systems, technical difficulties challenge its adoption in fields
where computational resources are constrained, e.g., cyber-physical systems and
the automotive industry. Objective: This paper aims at providing an overview of
the engagement on the Continuous Experimentation practice in the context of
cyber-physical systems. %To provide an understanding of what is the
state-of-the-art of the Continuous Experimentation practice in the context of
cyber-physical systems, and what is the practitioners' feedback about this
practice. Method: A systematic literature review has been conducted to
investigate the link between the practice and the field of application.
Additionally, an industrial multiple case study is reported. Results: The study
presents the current state-of-the-art regarding Continuous Experimentation in
the field of cyber-physical systems. The current perspective of Continuous
Experimentation in industry is also reported. Conclusions: The field has not
reached maturity yet. More conceptual analyses are found than solution
proposals and the state-of-practice is yet to be achieved. However it is
expected that in time an increasing number of solutions will be proposed and

high-resolution (HR) images from corresponding low-resolution (LR) inputs. In
previous approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training
objective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the
super-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to
blurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an
alternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating
realistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present an algorithm
addressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration),
which generates high-resolution, realistic images at resolutions previously
unseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an entirely self-supervised
fashion and is not confined to a specific degradation operator used during
training, unlike previous methods (which require supervised training on
databases of LR-HR image pairs). Instead of starting with the LR image and
slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution natural image
manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR image. This is
formalized through the ""downscaling loss,"" which guides exploration through the
latent space of a generative model. By leveraging properties of
high-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to guarantee realistic
outputs. PULSE thereby generates super-resolved images that both are realistic
and downscale correctly. We show proof of concept of our approach in the domain
of face super-resolution (i.e., face hallucination). We also present a
discussion of the limitations and biases of the method as currently implemented
with an accompanying model card with relevant metrics. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher resolutions and scale
factors than previously possible.

stochastic growth of an interface of height $h(x,t)$ on the positive half line,
equivalently the free energy of the continuum directed polymer in a half space
with a wall at $x=0$. The boundary condition $\partial_x h(x,t)|_{x=0}=A$
corresponds to an attractive wall for $A<0$, and leads to the binding of the
polymer to the wall below the critical value $A=-1/2$. Here we choose the
initial condition $h(x,0)$ to be a Brownian motion in $x>0$ with drift
$-(B+1/2)$. When $A+B \to -1$, the solution is stationary, i.e. $h(\cdot,t)$
remains at all times a Brownian motion with the same drift, up to a global
height shift $h(0,t)$. We show that the distribution of this height shift is
invariant under the exchange of parameters $A$ and $B$. For any $A,B > - 1/2$,
we provide an exact formula characterizing the distribution of $h(0,t)$ at any
time $t$, using two methods: the replica Bethe ansatz and a discretization
called the log-gamma polymer, for which moment formulae were obtained. We
analyze its large time asymptotics for various ranges of parameters $A,B$. In
particular, when $(A, B) \to (-1/2, -1/2)$, the critical stationary case, the
fluctuations of the interface are governed by a universal distribution akin to
the Baik-Rains distribution arising in stationary growth on the full-line. It
can be expressed in terms of a simple Fredholm determinant, or equivalently in
terms of the Painlev\'e II transcendent. This provides an analog for the KPZ
equation, of some of the results recently obtained by Betea-Ferrari-Occelli in
the context of stationary half-space last-passage-percolation. From
universality, we expect that limiting distributions found in both models can be
shown to coincide.

In the

interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders
can offer flash loans, i.e., loans that are only valid within one transaction

finding the attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the

electron-induced ionization is a function of electron temperature and could
also depend on electron density (important for plasma stratification). The ion

tomographic reconstruction is solved with help of a statistical prior
distribution which encodes the possible internal structures by assigning
probabilities for smoothness and edge distribution of the object. We compare
Gaussian random field priors, that favour smoothness, to non-Gaussian total
variation, Besov, and Cauchy priors which promote sharp edges and high-contrast
and low-contrast areas in the object. We also present computational schemes for
solving the resulting high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem with
100,000-1,000,000 unknowns. In particular, we study the applicability of a
no-U-turn variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods and of a more classical
adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for this purpose. These methods also
enable full uncertainty quantification of the reconstructions. For faster
computations, we use maximum a posteriori estimates with limited-memory BFGS
optimisation algorithm. As the first industrial application, we consider
sawmill industry X-ray log tomography. The logs have knots, rotten parts, and
even possibly metallic pieces, making them good examples for non-Gaussian
priors. Secondly, we study drill-core rock sample tomography, an example from
oil and gas industry. We show that Cauchy priors produce smaller number of
artefacts than other choices, especially with sparse high-noise measurements,

Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation. We perform a perturbative approach to
phenomenologically construct such a viable DBI inflation model that involves
the nonoscillating stage and the oscillating stage, with a type of specific
forms of the warp factor and the potential. We show that the continuous but
nonsmooth conjunction of sound speed between two stages does not yield manifest
effects on the phenomenology of SSR, and thus, our model gives rise to the same
PBH mass spectrum as the original predictions of SSR. Additionally, we also
demonstrate that the violation of adiabaticity of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation
does not affect the comoving curvature perturbation after Hubble crossing in
the nonresonant region. Making use of observational data, we derive various
cosmological constraints on the parameter space. Our analyses show that the
predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio is typically small, while the amplitude of
primordial non-Gaussianity can meet with cosmic microwave background bounds,
and additionally, the consistency relation for single-field slow-roll inflation
is softly violated in our case due to the small sound speed variations.

  Scans by Augmenting with Adversarial Attacks","Published on IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting malignant pulmonary nodules at an early stage can allow medical
interventions which may increase the survival rate of lung cancer patients.
Using computer vision techniques to detect nodules can improve the sensitivity
and the speed of interpreting chest CT for lung cancer screening. Many studies
have used CNNs to detect nodule candidates. Though such approaches have been
shown to outperform the conventional image processing based methods regarding
the detection accuracy, CNNs are also known to be limited to generalize on
under-represented samples in the training set and prone to imperceptible noise
perturbations. Such limitations can not be easily addressed by scaling up the
dataset or the models. In this work, we propose to add adversarial synthetic
nodules and adversarial attack samples to the training data to improve the
generalization and the robustness of the lung nodule detection systems. To
generate hard examples of nodules from a differentiable nodule synthesizer, we
use projected gradient descent (PGD) to search the latent code within a bounded
neighbourhood that would generate nodules to decrease the detector response. To
make the network more robust to unanticipated noise perturbations, we use PGD
to search for noise patterns that can trigger the network to give
over-confident mistakes. By evaluating on two different benchmark datasets
containing consensus annotations from three radiologists, we show that the
proposed techniques can improve the detection performance on real CT data. To
understand the limitations of both the conventional networks and the proposed
augmented networks, we also perform stress-tests on the false positive
reduction networks by feeding different types of artificially produced patches.
We show that the augmented networks are more robust to both under-represented
nodules as well as resistant to noise perturbations.

$\rho_{\tau\mu}$. The search for $h \to \tau\mu$ constrains $\rho_{\tau\mu}
\cos\gamma$, where $\cos\gamma$ is the $h$--$H$ mixing angle of $h$ with the
exotic $CP$-even scalar $H$. For $\tau \to \mu\gamma$, we define the
""BSM-benchmark"" by setting the extra top Yukawa coupling $\rho_{tt} = 1\ (\cong
\lambda_t)$ in two-loop diagrams, and $\cos\gamma = 0$ to decouple $h$. We show
that this leading effect due to $H$ and $CP$-odd scalar $A$ can be readily
probed by Belle~II, even for the conservative value of $\rho_{\tau\mu} =
0.7\lambda_\tau$. We define the subleading ""$h$-benchmark"" by setting
$\rho_{tt} = 0$ in two-loop diagrams, and take the conservative maximal value
of $\cos\gamma = 0.2$. We show that it falls beyond Belle~II reach, but can
interfere with the BSM-benchmark effect, which in principle probes the phase of
$\rho_{tt}$. We further show that the one-loop $H$, $A$ effect, proportional to
$\rho_{\tau\mu}\rho_{\tau\tau}$ in amplitude, is beyond the sensitivity of
Belle~II to probe, even for $\rho_{\tau\tau}$ as large as $3\lambda_\tau$. With
the working assumption that $\rho_{32}^f, \rho_{33}^f = {\cal O}(\lambda_3^f)$

$C_0(K_{\mathcal A})$ for a locally compact Hausdorff space $K_{\mathcal A}$

  We construct an uncountable, almost disjoint family ${\mathcal A}$ such that
the Banach algebra of all bounded linear operators on $C_0(K_{\mathcal A})$ is
as small as possible in the sense that every bounded linear operator on
$C_0(K_{\mathcal A})$ is the sum of a scalar multiple of the identity and an
operator that factors through $c_0$ (which in this case is equivalent to having
separable range). This implies that $C_0(K_{\mathcal A})$ has the fewest
possible decompositions: whenever $C_0(K_{\mathcal A})=X\oplus Y$ with
$dim({X})=\infty$, $dim({Y})=\infty$, either ${X}$ is isomorphic to
$C_0(K_{\mathcal A})$ and ${Y}$ to $c_0$, or vice versa. These results improve
previous work of the first named author in which an extra set-theoretic

the algebra of all bounded linear operators on our Banach space
$C_0(K_{\mathcal A})$ concerning the lattice of closed ideals, characters and
automatic continuity of homomorphisms.
  To exploit the perfect set property for Borel sets as in the classical
construction of an almost disjoint family of Mr\'owka we need to deal with
$\mathbb N \times \mathbb N$-matrices rather than with the usual partitioners.

applications to image compression were also discussed. The idea of ``near

we focus on well-rounded nearly orthogonal lattices in~$\mathbb R^n$ and
investigate their geometric and optimization properties. Specifically, we prove
that the sphere packing density function on the space of well-rounded lattices
in dimension $n\geq 3$ does not have any local maxima on the nearly orthogonal
set and has only one local minimum there: at the integer lattice~$\mathbb Z^n$.
Further, we show that the nearly orthogonal set cannot contain any perfect
lattices for~$n \geq 3$, although it contains multiple eutactic (and even
strongly eutactic) lattices in every dimension. This implies that eutactic
lattices, while always critical points of the packing density function, are not
necessarily local maxima or minima even among the well-rounded lattices. We
also prove that a (weakly) nearly orthogonal lattice in~$\mathbb R^n$ contains
no more than~$4n-2$ minimal vectors (with any smaller even number possible) and
establish some bounds on coherence of these lattices.

an ever-increasing demand for sophisticated and cost-effective software
testing. To meet such a demand, there is a need for a highly-skilled software
testing work-force (test engineers) in the industry. To address that need, many
university educators worldwide have included software-testing education in
their software engineering (SE) or computer science (CS) programs. Objective:
Our objective in this paper is to summarize the body of experience and
knowledge in the area of software-testing education to benefit the readers
(both educators and researchers) in designing and delivering software testing
courses in university settings, and to also conduct further education research
in this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted a systematic
literature mapping (SLM) to synthesize what the community of educators have
published on this topic. After compiling a candidate pool of 307 papers, and
applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 204
papers published between 1992 and 2019. Results: The topic of software-testing
education is becoming more active, as we can see by the increasing number of
papers. Many pedagogical approaches (how to best teach testing), course-ware,
and specific tools for testing education have been proposed. Many challenges in
testing education and insights on how to overcome those challenges have been
proposed. Conclusion: This paper provides educators and researchers with a
classification of existing studies within software-testing education. We
further synthesize challenges and insights reported when teaching software
testing. The paper also provides a reference (""index"") to the vast body of

scientific disciplines, and due to the manual work of experts, often become
important reference works. Features such as provenance tracking, archiving, and
data citation are widely regarded as important features for curated databases,
but implementing such features is challenging, and small database projects
often lack the resources to do so. A scientific database application is not
just the database itself, but also an ecosystem of web applications to display
the data, and applications supporting data curation. Supporting advanced
curation features requires changing all of these components, and there is
currently no way to provide such capabilities in a reusable way. Cross-tier
programming languages have been proposed to simplify the creation of web
applications, where developers write an application in a single, uniform
language. Consequently, database queries and updates can be written in the same
language as the rest of the program, and at least in principle, it should be
possible to provide curation features reusably via program transformations. As
a first step, it is important to establish that realistic curated databases can
be implemented in a cross-tier programming language. In this paper, we describe
such a case study: reimplementing the web frontend of a real-world scientific
database, the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (GtoPdb), in the Links
programming language. We show how features such as language-integrated query
simplify the development process, and rule out common errors. We show that the
Links implementation performs fewer database queries, while the time needed to
handle the queries is comparable to the Java version. While there is some
overhead to using Links because of its comparative immaturity compared to Java,
the Links version is viable as a proof-of-concept case study.

superfluid reaches sound velocity, the normal density becomes total mass
density $\rho$, which indicates that the system losses superfluidity. At the
same time, the Landau's critical velocity also becomes zero. The existence of
the non-zero normal density is attributed to the coupling between the motion of
superflow and density fluctuation in transverse directions. With Josephson
relation, the superfluid density $\rho_s$ is also calculated and the identity
$\rho_s+\rho_n=\rho$ holds. Further more, we find that the finite normal
density also results in a quantized moment of inertia in a moving superfluid
trapped by a ring. The normal density and moment of inertia at zero temperature
could be verified experimentally by measuring the angular momentum of a moving
superfluid in a ring trap.

  Assessment","14 pages",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The research in image quality assessment (IQA) has a long history, and
significant progress has been made by leveraging recent advances in deep neural
networks (DNNs). Despite high correlation numbers on existing IQA datasets,
DNN-based models may be easily falsified in the group maximum differentiation
(gMAD) competition with strong counterexamples being identified. Here we show
that gMAD examples can be used to improve blind IQA (BIQA) methods.
Specifically, we first pre-train a DNN-based BIQA model using multiple noisy
annotators, and fine-tune it on multiple subject-rated databases of
synthetically distorted images, resulting in a top-performing baseline model.
We then seek pairs of images by comparing the baseline model with a set of
full-reference IQA methods in gMAD. The resulting gMAD examples are most likely
to reveal the relative weaknesses of the baseline, and suggest potential ways
for refinement. We query ground truth quality annotations for the selected
images in a well controlled laboratory environment, and further fine-tune the
baseline on the combination of human-rated images from gMAD and existing
databases. This process may be iterated, enabling active and progressive
fine-tuning from gMAD examples for BIQA. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
active learning scheme on a large-scale unlabeled image set, and show that the
fine-tuned method achieves improved generalizability in gMAD, without
destroying performance on previously trained databases.

  Side Channel Attacks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Side channel attacks steal secret keys by cleverly leveraging information
leakages and can, therefore, break encryption. Thus, detection and mitigation
of side channel attacks is a very important problem, but the solutions proposed
in the literature have limitations in that they do not work in a real-world
multi-tenancy setting on servers, have high false positives, or have high
overheads. In this work, we demonstrate a compiler guided scheduler, Biscuit,
that detects cache-based side channel attacks for processes scheduled on
multi-tenancy server farms. A key element of this solution involves the use of
a cache-miss model which is inserted by the compiler at the entrances of loop
nests to predict the cache misses of the corresponding loop. Such inserted
library calls, or beacons, convey the cache miss information to the scheduler
at run time, which uses it to co-schedule processes such that their combined
cache footprint does not exceed the maximum capacity of the last level cache.
The scheduled processes are then monitored for actual vs predicted cache
misses, and when an anomaly is detected, the scheduler performs a search to
isolate the attacker. We show that Biscuit is able to detect and mitigate
Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, and Flush+Flush attacks on OpenSSL cryptography
algorithms with an F-score of 1, and also to detect and mitigate degradation of
service on a vision application suite with an F-score of 0.9375. Under a
no-attack scenario, the scheme poses low overheads (up to a maximum of 6
percent). In the case of an attack, the scheme ends up with less than 11
percent overhead and is able to reduce the degradation of service in some cases
by 40 percent. With these many desirable features such as an ability to deal
with multi-tenancy, its ability to detect attacks early, its ability to
mitigate those attacks, and low runtime overheads, Biscuit is a practical
solution.

S}_n)\}^{-1/2}\, {\mathbf S}_n \{\operatorname{diag}({\mathbf S}_n)\}^{-1/2}$.
This paper finds the limiting distributions of the eigenvalues of ${\mathbf
R}_n$ when both the dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ grow to infinity such
that $p/n\to \gamma \in (0,\infty)$. The family of limiting distributions
$\{H_{\alpha,\gamma}\}$ is new and depends on the two parameters $\alpha$ and
$\gamma$. The moments of $H_{\alpha,\gamma}$ are fully identified as sum of two
contributions: the first from the classical Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law and a
second due to heavy tails. Moreover, the family $\{H_{\alpha,\gamma}\}$ has
continuous extensions at the boundaries $\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=0$ leading to
the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law and a modified Poisson distribution, respectively.
  Our proofs use the method of moments, the path-shortening algorithm developed
in [18] and some novel graph counting combinatorics. As a consequence, the
moments of $H_{\alpha,\gamma}$ are expressed in terms of combinatorial objects
such as Stirling numbers of the second kind. A simulation study on these
limiting distributions $H_{\alpha,\gamma}$ is also provided for comparison with
the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law.

higher penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR), e.g., wind and solar
photovoltaic (PV). A major challenge in dynamic modeling and analysis is that
unlike synchronous generators, whose analytical models are well studied and
known to system planners, inverter models are proprietary information with
black box models provided to utilities. Thus, measurement based
characterization of IBR is a popular approach to find frequency-domain response
of an IBR. The resulting admittances are essentially small-signal
current/voltage relationship in frequency domain. Integrating admittances for
grid dynamic modeling and analysis requires a new framework, namely modular
small-signal analysis framework. In this visionary paper, we examine the
current state-of-the-art of dynamic modeling and analysis of power grids with
IBR, including inverter admittance characterization, the procedure of component
assembling and aggregation, and stability assessment. We push forward a
computing efficient modular modeling and analysis framework via four visions:
(i) efficient and accurate admittance model characterization via model building
and time-domain responses, (ii) accurate assembling of components, (iii)
efficient aggregation, and (iv) stability assessment relying on network
admittance matrices. Challenges of admittance-based modular analysis are
demonstrated using examples and techniques to tackle those challenges are
pointed out in this visionary paper.

$\mathbb{N}^n$ that is compatible with the additive structure. If $\Bbbk$ is a
field, and $I$ is a \emph{binomial ideal} in $\Bbbk[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ (that is,
an ideal generated by polynomials with at most two terms), then $I$ induces a
congruence on $\mathbb{N}^n$ by declaring $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ to be
equivalent if there is a linear combination with nonzero coefficients of
$\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{u}}$ and $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{v}}$ that belongs to $I$.
While every congruence on $\mathbb{N}^n$ arises this way, this is not a
one-to-one correspondence, as many binomial ideals may induce the same
congruence. Nevertheless, the link between a binomial ideal and its
corresponding congruence is strong, and one may think of congruences as the
underlying combinatorial structures of binomial ideals. In the current

are developed separately. The aim of this survey paper is to provide a detailed

large noisy dataset with commonly occurring structured errors, and a much
smaller dataset with more accurate annotations, ECN is able to substantially
improve the prediction of fine-grained annotations compared to standard

unnatural evaluation of strategies with deadlocks. Secondly, the semantic

accuracy, even though only a small subspace of the full many-body Hilbert space
is sampled, thus saving orders of magnitudes in computational resources.
Important advantages of this method are that the convergence is controlled by a
single parameter, the threshold, and that ground and excited states can be
treated on an equal footing. We demonstrate the extreme efficiency of the
method by numerical studies of complexes composed of up to 13 excitons, which
requires filling of states up to the fourth electronic shell. We find that the
method generally converges fast as a function of the threshold, profiting from
a significant enhancement due to the perturbative corrections. The role of the
choice of single-particle basis states is discussed. It is found that the
algorithm converges faster in the Hartree-Fock basis only for highly charged
systems, where Coulomb repulsion dominates. Finally, based on the observation
that second order perturbative energy corrections only depend on off-diagonal
elements of the many-body Hamiltonian, we present a way to accurately calculate

decision making is a process which happens over time, it can be well modeled by
dynamical systems. Often, decisions are made on the basis of perceived values
of the underlying options and the desired outcome is to select the option with
the highest value. This can be encoded as a bifurcation which produces a stable
equilibrium corresponding to the high-value option. When some options have
identical values, it is natural to design the decision-making model to be
indifferent among the equally-valued options, leading to symmetries in the
underlying dynamical system. For example, when all $N$ options have identical
values, the dynamical system should have $S_N$ symmetry. Unfortunately,
constructing a dynamical system that unfolds the $S_N$-symmetric pitchfork
bifurcation is non-trivial. In this paper, we develop a method to construct an
unfolding of the pitchfork bifurcation with a symmetry group that is a
significant subgroup of $S_N$. The construction begins by parsing the decision
among $N$ options into a hierarchical set of $N-1$ binary decisions encoded in
a binary tree. By associating the unfolding of a standard $S_2$-symmetric
pitchfork bifurcation with each of these binary decisions, we develop an
unfolding of the pitchfork bifurcation with symmetries corresponding to
isomorphisms of the underlying binary tree.

works that aim to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem by introducing
regularization in the parameter space or image space, FoCL imposes
regularization in the feature space. We show in our experiments that FoCL has
faster adaptation to distributional changes in sequentially arriving tasks, and
achieves the state-of-the-art performance for generative models in task
incremental learning. We discuss choices of combined regularization spaces
towards different use case scenarios for boosted performance, e.g., tasks that
have high variability in the background. Finally, we introduce a forgetfulness
measure that fairly evaluates the degree to which a model suffers from
forgetting. Interestingly, the analysis of our proposed forgetfulness score
also implies that FoCL tends to have a mitigated forgetting for future tasks.

Meanwhile, many simple and cheap regularization methods have been developed to
enhance the generalization of classifiers. Such regularization methods have

understanding of natural and artificial systems. Unfortunately, the hypothesis
tests that are used to determine statistically significant directed or
multivariate relationships from time-series data often yield spurious
associations (Type I errors) or omit causal relationships (Type II errors).
This is due to the autocorrelation present in the analysed time series -- a
property that is ubiquitous across diverse applications, from brain dynamics to
climate change. Here we show that, for limited data, this issue cannot be
mediated by fitting a time-series model alone (e.g., in Granger causality or
prewhitening approaches), and instead that the degrees of freedom in
statistical tests should be altered to account for the effective sample size
induced by cross-correlations in the observations. This insight enabled us to
derive modified hypothesis tests for any multivariate correlation-based
measures of linear dependence between covariance-stationary time series,
including Granger causality and mutual information with Gaussian marginals. We
use both numerical simulations (generated by autoregressive models and digital
filtering) as well as recorded fMRI-neuroimaging data to show that our tests
are unbiased for a variety of stationary time series. Our experiments
demonstrate that the commonly used $F$- and $\chi^2$-tests can induce
significant false-positive rates of up to $100\%$ for both measures, with and
without prewhitening of the signals. These findings suggest that many
dependencies reported in the scientific literature may have been, and may
continue to be, spuriously reported or missed if modified hypothesis tests are

resistive magnetised thick accretion disc in the vicinity of external gravity
and intrinsic dipolar magnetic field of a slowly rotating black hole. The
plasma is described by the equations of fully general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) along with the Ohm's law and in the absence of the
effects of radiation fields. We try to solve these two-dimensional MHD
equations analytically as much as possible. However, we sometimes inevitably
refer to numerical methods as well. To fully understand the relativistic
geometrically thick accretion disc structure, we consider all three components
of the fluid velocity to be non-zero. This implies that the magnetofluid can
flow in all three directions surrounding the central black hole. As we get
radially closer to the hole, the fluid flows faster in all those directions.
However, as we move towards the equator along the meridional direction, the
radial inflow becomes stronger from both the speed and the mass accretion rate
points of view. Nonetheless, the vertical (meridional) speed and the rotation
of the plasma disc become slower in that direction. Due to the presence of
pressure gradient forces, a sub-Keplerian angular momentum distribution
throughout the thick disc is expected as well. To get a concise analytical form
of the rate of accretion, we assume that the radial dependency of radial and
meridional fluid velocities is the same. This simplifying assumption leads to
radial independency of mass accretion rate. The motion of the accreting plasma
produces an azimuthal current whose strength is specified based on the strength
of the external dipolar magnetic field. This current generates a poloidal
magnetic field in the disc which is continuous across the disc boundary surface
due to the presence of the finite resistivity for the plasma.

knowledge is continually learned over time whilst existing knowledge is
retained. On the other hand, deep learning networks are ill-equipped for
incremental learning. When a well-trained network is adapted to new categories,
its performance on the old categories will dramatically degrade. To address
this problem, incremental learning methods have been explored which preserve
the old knowledge of deep learning models. However, the state-of-the-art
incremental object detector employs an external fixed region proposal method
that increases overall computation time and reduces accuracy comparing to
Region Proposal Network (RPN) based object detectors such as Faster RCNN. The
purpose of this paper is to design an efficient end-to-end incremental object
detector using knowledge distillation. We first evaluate and analyze the
performance of the RPN-based detector with classic distillation on incremental
detection tasks. Then, we introduce multi-network adaptive distillation that
properly retains knowledge from the old categories when fine-tuning the model
for new task. Experiments on the benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and COCO,
demonstrate that the proposed incremental detector based on Faster RCNN is more
accurate as well as being 13 times faster than the baseline detector.

lightweight cascaded structure for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
efficiently leverage context information. On the other hand, for runtime
efficiency, state-of-the-art methods will quickly decrease the spatial size of

  Based on Multi-scale Spatial Attention",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting the singular point accurately and efficiently is one of the most
important tasks for fingerprint recognition. In recent years, deep learning has
been gradually used in the fingerprint singular point detection. However,
current deep learning-based singular point detection methods are either
two-stage or multi-stage, which makes them time-consuming. More importantly,
their detection accuracy is yet unsatisfactory, especially in the case of the
low-quality fingerprint. In this paper, we make a Real One-Stage Effort to
detect fingerprint singular points more accurately and efficiently, and
therefore we name the proposed algorithm ROSE for short, in which the
multi-scale spatial attention, the Gaussian heatmap and the variant of focal
loss are applied together to achieve a higher detection rate. Experimental
results on the datasets FVC2002 DB1 and NIST SD4 show that our ROSE outperforms
the state-of-art algorithms in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate and
detection speed.

on the application of deep representation learning on dynamic graphs. These
methods predict the structure of the graph by reasoning over the interactions

to incorporate the information from dynamic knowledge graphs for time series

predict the time series with improved accuracy. Our framework, DArtNet, learns
a static embedding for every node in the graph as well as a dynamic embedding
which is dependent on the dynamic attribute value (time-series). Then it
captures the information from the neighborhood by taking a relation specific
mean and encodes the history information using RNN. We jointly train the model
link prediction and attribute prediction. We evaluate our method on five
specially curated datasets for this problem and show a consistent improvement

spin liquid phases of matter which are not predicted by classical physics. The
complexity of the exotic phenomena on display in spin liquids has led to a
great deal of theoretical and experimental interest. However, understanding the
fundamental nature of the excitations in these systems remains challenging. In
this work, we consider the Lifshitz quantum critical point in a two-dimensional
frustrated $XY$ antiferromagnet. At this point, quantum fluctuations destroy
long range order, leading to the formation of an algebraic Lifshitz spin
liquid. We demonstrate that the bosonic magnon excitations are long-lived and
well-defined in the Lifshitz spin liquid phase, though paradoxically, the
dynamic structure factor has a broad non-Lorentzian frequency distribution with
no single-particle weight. We resolve this apparent contradiction by showing
that the Lifshitz spin liquid suffers from an infrared catastrophe: An external
physical probe always excites an infinite number of arbitrarily low energy
quasiparticles, which leads to significant radiative broadening of the
spectrum.

analysis. Segmenting the pancreas from abdominal CT images is a challenging
task because of its high anatomical variability in shape, size and location.
What's more, the pancreas only occupies a small portion in abdomen, and the
organ border is very fuzzy. All these factors make the segmentation methods of
other organs less suitable for the pancreas segmentation. In this report, we
propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling guided convolutional neural
network (CNN) approach, in order to handle such difficulties in morphological
and photometric variabilities. Specifically, the proposed method mainly
contains three steps: First, registration is carried out to mitigate the body
weight and location variability. Then, an MCMC sampling is employed to guide
the sampling of 3D patches, which are fed to the CNN for training. At the same
time, the pancreas distribution is also learned for the subsequent
segmentation. Third, sampled from the learned distribution, an MCMC process
guides the segmentation process. Lastly, the patches based segmentation is
fused using a Bayesian voting scheme. This method is evaluated on the NIH
pancreatic datasets which contains 82 abdominal contrast-enhanced CT volumes.
Finally, we achieved a competitive result of 78.13% Dice Similarity Coefficient
value and 82.65% Recall value in testing data.

nanoscale dimensions, which requires the inclusion of nanoscale effects into
the modeling. While a few previous studies investigated the effect of
dispersion forces, the effect of structural forces has never been considered in
the thin film condensation modeling on fin-groove systems. The present study
utilizes a disjoining pressure model which considers both dispersion and
structural forces. The results reveal that structural forces are able to

Based on analytical results of the life-span of the solution, rigorous error

$O(\varepsilon^{-p})$. We pay particular attention to how error bounds depend
explicitly on the mesh size $h$ and time step $\tau$ as well as the small
parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$, which indicate that, in order to obtain
`correct' numerical solutions up to the time at $O(\varepsilon^{-p})$, the

classical second order central difference methods. By a rescaling in time, it
is equivalent to an oscillatory NKGE whose solution propagates waves with

metric automatically from data. Most existing studies on metric learning for
tree-structured data have adopted the approach of learning the tree edit
distance. However, the edit distance is not amenable for big data analysis
because it incurs high computation cost. In this paper, we propose a new metric
learning approach for tree-structured data with pq-grams. The pq-gram distance
is a distance for ordered labeled trees, and has much lower computation cost
than the tree edit distance. In order to perform metric learning based on
pq-grams, we propose a new differentiable parameterized distance, weighted
pq-gram distance. We also propose a way to learn the proposed distance based on
Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN), which is a well-studied and practical
metric learning scheme. We formulate the metric learning problem as an
optimization problem and use the gradient descent technique to perform metric
learning. We empirically show that the proposed approach not only achieves
competitive results with the state-of-the-art edit distance-based methods in
various classification problems, but also solves the classification problems
much more rapidly than the edit distance-based methods.

performance significantly. On the contrary, our BiDet fully utilizes the
representational capacity of the binary neural networks for object detection by
redundancy removal, through which the detection precision is enhanced with
alleviated false positives. Specifically, we generalize the information
bottleneck (IB) principle to object detection, where the amount of information
in the high-level feature maps is constrained and the mutual information
between the feature maps and object detection is maximized. Meanwhile, we learn
sparse object priors so that the posteriors are concentrated on informative

both their states and controls, and we focus on situations in which a generic
agent tries to adjust her speed (control) to an average speed (the average is
made in a neighborhood in the state space). In such cases, the monotonicity
assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not
hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems
of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are
supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular
Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the
underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with
numerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the
finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the
systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines
a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like
solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make
experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of
the model vary. The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at
studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as
the number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents
are indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game,
and that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities
depending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other
agents. MFGs have been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry and
P-L. Lions [17, 18, 19]. Independently and at approximately the same time, the
notion of mean field games arose in the engineering literature, see the works
of M.Y. Huang, P.E. Caines and R.Malham{\'e} [14, 15]. The present work deals
with numerical approximations of mean field games in which the agents interact
through both their states and controls; it follows a more theoretical work by
the second author, [16], which is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the
related systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. There is not much
literature on MFGs in which the agents also interact through their controls,
see [13, 12, 8, 10, 7, 16]. To stress the fact that the latter situation is
considered, we will sometimes use the terminology mean field games of control
and the acronym MFGC.

objects, accounts for a great proportion of the system abnormalities. The route
planning and corresponding controller are established in order to avoid the
collision, whereas, in the presence of uncertainties, it is possible that the
unmanned system would deviate from the predetermined route and collide with the
obstacles. Therefore, for the safety of unmanned systems, collision probability
estimation and further safety decision are very important. To estimate the
collision probability, the Monte Carlo method could be applied, however, it is
generally rather slow. This paper introduces a fast collision probability
estimation method based on finite-dimensional distribution, whose main idea is
to filter out the sampling points needed and generate the states directly by
samples of finite-dimensional distribution, reducing the estimation time
significantly. Besides, further techniques including the probabilistic
equidistance sampling and dimension reduction, also serve to reduce the
estimation time. The simulation shows that the proposed method reduces over 99%

compare with unchirped results. When phonon interactions with the dot are
disregarded - thus corresponding to the limit of atomic cavity systems -
chirped pulses generate photon number distributions that change their shape
drastically in the course of time. Phonons have a strong and qualitative impact
on the photon statistics. The asymmetry between phonon absorption and emission
destroys the symmetry of the photon distributions obtained for positive and
negative chirps. While for negative chirps transient distributions resembling
thermal ones are observed, for positive chirps the photon number distribution
still resembles its phonon-free counterpart but with overall smoother shapes.
In sharp contrast, using unchirped pulses of the same pulse area and duration
wave-packets are found that move up and down the Jaynes-Cummings ladder with a
bell-shape that changes little in time. For shorter pulses and lower driving
strength Rabi-like oscillations occur between low photon number states. For all
considered excitation conditions transitions between sub- and super-Poissonian
statistics are found at certain times. For resonant driving with low intensity
the Mandel parameter oscillates and is mostly negative, which indicates a
non-classical state in the cavity field. Finally, we show that it is possible

mining user behaviors, i.e., collaborative filtering, along with the general
information which describes users or items, e.g., textual attributes,
categorical demographics, product images, and so on. Price, an important factor
in marketing --- which determines whether a user will make the final purchase
decision on an item --- surprisingly, has received relatively little scrutiny.
  In this work, we aim at developing an effective method to predict user
purchase intention with the focus on the price factor in recommender systems.
The main difficulties are two-fold: 1) the preference and sensitivity of a user
on item price are unknown, which are only implicitly reflected in the items
that the user has purchased, and 2) how the item price affects a user's
intention depends largely on the product category, that is, the perception and
affordability of a user on item price could vary significantly across
categories. Towards the first difficulty, we propose to model the transitive
relationship between user-to-item and item-to-price, taking the inspiration
from the recently developed Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). The key idea is
to propagate the influence of price on users with items as the bridge, so as to
make the learned user representations be price-aware. For the second
difficulty, we further integrate item categories into the propagation progress
and model the possible pairwise interactions for predicting user-item
interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our GCN-based method in learning the
price-aware preference of users. Further analysis reveals that modeling the
price awareness is particularly useful for predicting user preference on items

data provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamic
Observatory to study the dynamics on this bridge. We found that a pair of blue
and red Doppler shift patches at two ends of this bridge, this pattern appears
to be the convective motion directed by the horizontal component of the
magnetic field aligned with the spine of this bridge. Paired upward and
downward motions implies that the light bridge could have a two-legged or
undulate magnetic field. Significant four minute oscillations in the emission
intensity of the $1700\unit{\AA}$ bandpass were detected at two ends, which had
overlap with the paired blue and red shift patches. The oscillatory signals at
the light bridge and the penumbra were highly correlated with each other.
Although they are separated in space at the photosphere, the periodicity seems
to have a common origin from the underneath. Therefore, we infer that the light

In this paper, through detailed experiments that not only corroborate the
generalization properties of wide minima, we also provide empirical evidence
for a new hypothesis that the density of wide minima is likely lower than the
density of narrow minima. Further, motivated by this hypothesis, we design a
novel explore-exploit learning rate schedule. On a variety of image and natural
language datasets, compared to their original hand-tuned learning rate
baselines, we show that our explore-exploit schedule can result in either up to
0.84% higher absolute accuracy using the original training budget or up to 57%
reduced training time while achieving the original reported accuracy. For
example, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy for IWSLT'14 (DE-EN)
dataset by just modifying the learning rate schedule of a high performing
model.

demonstrated that NBT structure is stable in the 001 A-site configuration,

moment of $5{\mu}B$ emerges in DyNBT system, while NBT is known to be
non-magnetic. Dysprosium in NBT matrix seems to form an ionic bonding with
oxygen atoms whereas Bi-O forms covalent bonding which is responsible for the
decrease of the polarization value from 42.3 ${\mu}C/cm^{2}$ for NBT to 22.08

observed a decrease in the transition temperature as a function of dysprosium

always suffers from two problems: the exposure bias resulted from the strategy
of ""teacher-forcing"", and the inconsistency between the discriminative
optimization target (usually the cross-entropy loss) and the final evaluation
metric (usually the character/word error rate). In this paper, we propose a
novel pseudo-convolutional policy gradient (PCPG) based method to address these
two problems. On the one hand, we introduce the evaluation metric (refers to
the character error rate in this paper) as a form of reward to optimize the
model together with the original discriminative target. On the other hand,
inspired by the local perception property of convolutional operation, we
perform a pseudo-convolutional operation on the reward and loss dimension, so
as to take more context around each time step into account to generate a robust
reward and loss for the whole optimization. Finally, we perform a thorough
comparison and evaluation on both the word-level and sentence-level benchmarks.
The results show a significant improvement over other related methods, and
report either a new state-of-the-art performance or a competitive accuracy on
all these challenging benchmarks, which clearly proves the advantages of our
approach.

various degrees of entanglement. The qubit systems consist of coherent states
of 1-d harmonic oscillators with irrational frequencies. In weakly entangled
states chaos is manifested through the sudden jumps of the Bohmian trajectories
between successive Lissajous-like figures. These jumps are succesfully
interpreted by the `nodal point-X-point complex' mechanism. In strongly
entangled states, the chaotic form of the Bohmian trajectories is manifested
after a short time. We then study the mixing properties of ensembles of Bohmian
trajectories with initial conditions satisfying Born's rule. The trajectory
points are initially distributed in two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ with disjoint
supports but they exhibit, over the course of time, abrupt mixing whenever they
encounter the nodal points of the wavefunction. Then a substantial fraction of
trajectory points is exchanged between $S_1$ and $S_2$, without violating
Born's rule. Finally, we provide strong numerical indications that, in this
system, the main effect of the entanglement is the establishment of ergodicity
in the individual Bohmian trajectories as $t\to\infty$: different initial
conditions result to the same limiting distribution of trajectory points.

$v_*$, acting on the whole $\partial\Omega$ or just on a portion $\Gamma$ of
$\partial\Omega$, to generate a self-propelled motion of ${\mathcal S}$ with a
target velocity $V(x):=\xi+\omega \times x$ and to minimize the drag about
${\mathcal S}$. Firstly, an appropriate drag functional is derived from the
energy equation of the fluid and the problem is formulated as an optimal
boundary control problem. Then the minimization problem is solved for localized
controls, such that supp $v_*\subset \Gamma$, and for tangential controls, i.e,
$v_*\cdot n|_{\partial \Omega}=0$, where $n$ is the outward unit normal to
$\partial \Omega$. We prove the existence of optimal solutions, justify the
G\^ateaux derivative of the control-to-state map, establish the well-posedness
of the corresponding adjoint equations and, finally, derive the first order
optimality conditions. The results are obtained under smallness restrictions on

state by using the microscopic quasi-classical Eilenberger equation. The Pauli
paramagnetic effects and the orbital depairing effects due to vortices are
treated in an equal footing for three dimensional spherical Fermi surface model
and $s$-wave pairing. The field evolution of the LO state is studied in detail,
such as the $H$-$T$ phase diagram, spatial structures of the order parameter,
the paramagnetic moment, and the internal filed. Field-dependences of various
thermodynamic quantities: the paramagnetic moment, entropy, and the zero-energy
density of states are calculated. Those quantities are shown to start quickly
growing upon entering the LO state. We also evaluate the wave length of the LO
modulation, the flux line lattice form factors for small angle neutron
scattering, and the NMR spectra to facilitate the identification of the LO
state. Two cases of strong and intermediate Pauli paramagnetic effect are
studied comparatively. The possibility of the LO phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$,
CeCoIn$_5$, CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, and the organic superconductors is critically
examined and crucial experiments to identify it are proposed.

  time-domain enhancement network","5 pages, to appear in ICASSP2020",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of deep learning, research on noise-robust automatic speech
recognition (ASR) has progressed rapidly. However, ASR performance in noisy
conditions of single-channel systems remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, most
single-channel speech enhancement (SE) methods (denoising) have brought only
limited performance gains over state-of-the-art ASR back-end trained on
multi-condition training data. Recently, there has been much research on neural
network-based SE methods working in the time-domain showing levels of
performance never attained before. However, it has not been established whether
the high enhancement performance achieved by such time-domain approaches could
be translated into ASR. In this paper, we show that a single-channel
time-domain denoising approach can significantly improve ASR performance,
providing more than 30 % relative word error reduction over a strong ASR
back-end on the real evaluation data of the single-channel track of the CHiME-4
dataset. These positive results demonstrate that single-channel noise reduction
can still improve ASR performance, which should open the door to more research
in that direction.

and are believed to represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information
across spatial and temporal scales. In a series of recent experiments in vitro
it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency
stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling among theta and gamma
rhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings
of these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able
to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In
this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma
oscillations: the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the
interneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of
theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal
theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms display
always phase amplitude coupling. However 2 different types of nested
oscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking
between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic
behaviour; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is
quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked
states are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments,
we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range
[1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing one and which
are clearly modulated by the theta phase. At variance with experimental
findings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by
increasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in or model, only

the semantic segmentation. There are two primary issues in this field, i.e.,
what and how to transfer domain knowledge across two domains. Existing methods
mainly focus on adapting domain-invariant features (what to transfer) through
adversarial learning (how to transfer). Context dependency is essential for
semantic segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well
understood. Furthermore, how to transfer contextual information across two
domains remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention
mechanism based on self-attention to capture context dependencies between two
domains and adapt transferable context. To achieve this goal, we design two
cross-domain attention modules to adapt context dependencies from both spatial
and channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention module captures local
feature dependencies between each position in the source and target image. The
channel attention module models semantic dependencies between each pair of
cross-domain channel maps. To adapt context dependencies, we further
selectively aggregate the context information from two domains. The superiority
of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods is empirically proved on
""GTA5 to Cityscapes"" and ""SYNTHIA to Cityscapes"".

milestones in structural graph theory and have been diversified in several
directions. In the present paper, we consider ""local"" versions of such
statements. In 1966, for instance, D. W. Barnette proved that a $3$-connected
planar graph contains a spanning tree of maximum degree at most $3$. A local
translation of this statement is that if $G$ is a planar graph, $X$ is a subset
of specified vertices of $G$ such that $X$ cannot be separated in $G$ by
removing $2$ or fewer vertices of $G$, then $G$ has a tree of maximum degree at
most $3$ containing all vertices of $X$.
  Our results constitute a general machinery for strengthening statements about
$k$-connected graphs (for $1 \leq k \leq 4$) to locally spanning versions, i.e.
subgraphs containing a set $X\subseteq V(G)$ of a (not necessarily planar)
graph $G$ in which only $X$ has high connectedness. Given a graph $G$ and
$X\subseteq V(G)$, we say $M$ is a minor of $G$ rooted at $X$, if $M$ is a
minor of $G$ such that each bag of $M$ contains at most one vertex of $X$ and
$X$ is a subset of the union of all bags. We show that $G$ has a highly
connected minor rooted at $X$ if $X\subseteq V(G)$ cannot be separated in $G$
by removing a few vertices of $G$.
  Combining these investigations and the theory of Tutte paths in the planar
case yields to locally spanning versions of six well-known results about
degree-bounded trees, hamiltonian paths and cycles, and $2$-connected subgraphs
of graphs.

observation was of the strong natural radio source Cas A, taken overnight on
18-19 August 2013, and exhibited moderately strong scattering effects in
dynamic spectra of intensity received across an observing bandwidth of
10-80MHz. Delay-Doppler spectra (the 2-D FFT of the dynamic spectrum) from the
first hour of observation showed two discrete parabolic arcs, one with a steep
curvature and the other shallow, which can be used to provide estimates of the
distance to, and velocity of, the scattering plasma. A cross-correlation
analysis of data received by the dense array of stations in the LOFAR ""core""
reveals two different velocities in the scintillation pattern: a primary
velocity of ~30m/s with a north-west to south-east direction, associated with
the steep parabolic arc and a scattering altitude in the F-region or higher,
and a secondary velocity of ~110m/s with a north-east to south-west direction,
associated with the shallow arc and a scattering altitude in the D-region.
Geomagnetic activity was low in the mid-latitudes at the time, but a weak
sub-storm at high latitudes reached its peak at the start of the observation.
An analysis of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and ionosonde data
from the time reveals a larger-scale travelling ionospheric disturbance (TID),
possibly the result of the high-latitude activity, travelling in the north-west
to south-east direction, and, simultaneously, a smaller--scale TID travelling
in a north-east to south-west direction, which could be associated with
atmospheric gravity wave activity. The LOFAR observation shows scattering from
both TIDs, at different altitudes and propagating in different directions. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a phenomenon has
been reported.

We first investigate the stability of the Lieb-lattice structure, and then
construct a multiorbital Hubbard model based on first-principles calculation.
By applying the fluctuation-exchange approximation to the model and solving the
linearized Eliashberg equation, we show that $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairings
closely compete with each other, and, more interestingly, that the
intra-orbital and inter-orbital pairings coexist. We further show that, if the
energy of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ band is raised to make it ""incipient"" with the
lower edge of the band close to the Fermi level within a realistic band filling
regime, $s\pm$-wave superconductivity is strongly enhanced. We reveal an
intriguing relation between the Lieb model and the two-orbital model for the
usual K$_2$NiF$_4$ structure where a close competition between $s-$ and

role in the dynamics of the solar wind acceleration. Electrons are normally
modelled with three components, the core, the halo, and the strahl. We
investigate how well the fast strahl electrons in the inner heliosphere
preserve the information about the coronal electron temperature at their
origin. We analysed the data obtained by two missions, Helios spanning the
distances between 65 and 215 R$_S$, and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) reaching down
to 35 R$_S$ during its first two orbits around the Sun. The electron strahl was
characterised with two parameters, pitch-angle width (PAW), and the strahl
parallel temperature (T$_{s\parallel}$). PSP observations confirm the already
reported dependence of strahl PAW on core parallel plasma beta
($\beta_{ec\parallel}$)\citep{Bercic2019}. Most of the strahl measured by PSP
appear narrow with PAW reaching down to 30$^o$. The portion of the strahl
velocity distribution function aligned with the magnetic field is for the
measured energy range well described by a Maxwellian distribution function.
T$_{s\parallel}$ was found to be anti-correlated with the solar wind velocity,
and independent of radial distance. These observations imply that
T$_{s\parallel}$ carries the information about the coronal electron
temperature. The obtained values are in agreement with coronal temperatures
measured using spectroscopy (David et al. 2998), and the inferred solar wind
source regions during the first orbit of PSP agree with the predictions using a
PFSS model (Bale et al. 2019, Badman et al. 2019).

to resolve instrumental biases through calibration. One common technique used
in high contrast imaging is angular differential imaging, which calibrates the
point spread function and flux leakage using a rotation in the focal plane.
  Our aim is to experimentally demonstrate and validate the efficacy of an
angular differential kernel-phase approach, a new method for self-calibrating
interferometric observables that operates similarly to angular differential
imaging, while retaining their statistical properties.
  We used linear algebra to construct new observables that evolve outside of
the subspace spanned by static biases. On-sky observations of a binary star
with the SCExAO instrument at the Subaru telescope were used to demonstrate the
practicality of this technique. We used a classical approach on the same data
to compare the effectiveness of this method.
  The proposed method shows smaller and more Gaussian residuals compared to
classical calibration methods, while retaining compatibility with the
statistical tools available. We also provide a measurement of the stability of
the SCExAO instrument that is relevant to the application of the technique.
  Angular differential kernel phases provide a reliable method for calibrating
biased observables. Although the sensitivity at small separations is reduced
for small field rotations, the calibration is effectively improved and the
number of subjective choices is reduced.

existence question. In particular, we select classes of graphs according to
their number of vertices and their domination number and encode the conjecture
as an ideal/polynomial pair such that the polynomial is non-negative on the
variety associated with the ideal if and only if the conjecture is true for
this graph class. Using semidefinite programming we obtain numeric
sum-of-squares certificates, which we then manage to transform into symbolic
certificates confirming non-negativity of our polynomials. Specifically, we
obtain exact low-degree sparse sum-of-squares certificates for particular

the particle-hole symmetric Andreev states that form in the junction are
detached from the continuum above the superconducting gap in the leads, while a

stochastic model that accounts for non-adiabatic processes, which change the
occupations of the Andreev states. This model allows calculating the current
noise spectrum and determining the Fano factor. Analyzing the finite-frequency

branch (AGB). Their pulsation period is related to the luminosity and mass-loss
rate of the star. The long-period variables (LPVs) and Mira variables are the
most prominent of all types of variability of evolved stars. The reddest, most
obscured AGB stars are too faint in the optical and have eluded large
variability surveys. Selection criteria are derived based on colour-colour and
colour-magnitude diagrams from the combination of VISTA Magellanic Cloud (VMC)
survey, Spitzer IRAC and AllWISE data. After eliminating LPVs with known
periods shorter than 450 days, a sample of 1299 candidate obscured AGB stars is
selected. K-band LCs are constructed combining the epoch photometry available
in the VMC survey with literature data, analysed for variability and fitted
with a single period sine curve to derive mean magnitudes, amplitudes and
periods. A subset of 254 stars are either new variables, or known variables
where the period we find is better determined than the literature value, or
longer than 1000 days. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these stars
are fitted to a large number of templates. For this purpose the SEDs and
Spitzer IRS spectra of some non-AGB stars are also fitted to have templates of
the most likely contaminants in the sample. A sample of 217 likely LPVs is
found. Thirty-four stars have periods longer than 1000 days although some of
them have alternative shorter periods. Mass-loss rates and luminosities are
estimated from the template fitting. Period-luminosity relations are presented
for C- and O-rich Miras that appear to be extensions of relations derived in
the literature for shorter periods. The fit for the C-stars is particularly
well defined (with 182 objects) and reads Mbol = (-2.27 \pm 0.20) log P + (1.45

the set of compared models. This distribution is often observed to concentrate
on a single model even when other measures of model fit or forecasting ability
indicate no strong preference. Furthermore, a moderate change in the data
sample can easily shift the posterior model probabilities to concentrate on
another model. We document overconfidence in two high-profile applications in
economics and neuroscience. To shed more light on the sources of overconfidence
we derive the sampling variance of the Bayes factor in univariate and
multivariate linear regression. The results show that overconfidence is likely
to happen when i) the compared models give very different approximations of the
data-generating process, ii) the models are very flexible with large degrees of

segmentation task. In this article, we propose a novel architecture called the
dense dilated convolutions' merging network (DDCM-Net) to address this task.
The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated image convolutions merged with
varying dilation rates. This effectively utilizes rich combinations of dilated
convolutions that enlarge the network's receptive fields with fewer parameters
and features compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in the remote
sensing domain. Importantly, DDCM-Net obtains fused local- and global-context

multiscale and complex-shaped objects with similar color and textures in very
high-resolution aerial imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness,
and flexibility of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS
Potsdam and Vaihingen data sets, as well as the DeepGlobe land cover data set.
Our single model, trained on three-band Potsdam and Vaihingen data sets,

parameters including full width at half maximum and global PSF shape through
the kurtosis parameter of a Moffat function. The PSFR algorithm is publicly

complex real-world distributions. In GANs, the training of the generator
usually stops when the discriminator can no longer distinguish the generator's
output from the set of training examples. A central question of GANs is that
when the training stops, whether the generated distribution is actually close
to the target distribution, and how the training process reaches to such
configurations efficiently? In this paper, we established a theoretical results
towards understanding this generator-discriminator training process. We
empirically observe that during the earlier stage of the GANs training, the
discriminator is trying to force the generator to match the low degree moments
between the generator's output and the target distribution. Moreover, only by
matching these empirical moments over polynomially many training examples, we
prove that the generator can already learn notable class of distributions,

various encryption methods have been proposed. However, for symmetric
encryption methods, the well-known encryption techniques still rely on the key
space to guarantee security and suffer from frequent key updating. Aiming to
solve those problems, this paper proposes a novel text encryption method based
on deep learning called TEDL, where the secret key includes hyperparameters in
deep learning model and the core step of encryption is transforming input data
into weights trained under hyperparameters. Firstly, both communication parties
establish a word vector table by training a deep learning model according to
specified hyperparameters. Then, a self-update codebook is constructed on the
word vector table with the SHA-256 function and other tricks. When
communication starts, encryption and decryption are equivalent to indexing and
inverted indexing on the codebook, respectively, thus achieving the
transformation between plaintext and ciphertext. Results of experiments and
relevant analyses show that TEDL performs well for security, efficiency,
generality, and has a lower demand for the frequency of key redistribution.
Especially, as a supplement to current encryption methods, the time-consuming
process of constructing a codebook increases the difficulty of brute-force
attacks while not degrade the communication efficiency.

$\epsilon$-expansion. Generalization of the problem to non-integer dimensions,
necessary to control the $\epsilon$-expansion, is achieved by dimensional
continuation of a well-known effective theory describing out-of-plane
fluctuations coupled to phonon-mediated interactions via a scalar composite
field, equivalent for small deformations to the local Gaussian curvature. The
effective theory, which will be referred to as Gaussian curvature interaction
(GCI) model, is equivalent to theories of elastic $D$-dimensional manifolds
fluctuating in a $(D + d_{c})$-dimensional embedding space in the physical case
$D = 2$ for arbitrary $d_{c}$. For $D\neq 2$, instead, the GCI model is not
equivalent to a direct dimensional continuation of elastic membrane theory and
it defines an alternative generalization to generic internal dimension $D$. We
calculate explicitly RG functions at two-loop order and determine the exponent
$\eta$ characterizing the long-wavelength scaling of correlation functions to
order $\epsilon^{2}$ in an $\epsilon=(4-D)$-expansion. The self-consistent
screening approximation (SCSA) for the GCI model is shown to be exact to
O($\epsilon^{2}$). For $d_{c} = 1$, the O($\epsilon^{2}$) correction is
suppressed by a small numerical prefactor. As a result, despite the large value
of $\epsilon = 2$, extrapolation of the first and second order results to $D =
2$ leads to very close numbers, $\eta = 0.8$ and $\eta \simeq 0.795$. The
calculated exponent values are close to earlier reference results obtained by
non-perturbative RG, the SCSA and numerical simulations. These indications
suggest that a perturbative analysis of the GCI model could provide an useful
framework for accurate quantitative predictions of the scaling exponent even at
$D = 2$.

at fixed mass $\mu(\mathbb{R}^3)=\nu$, when $\mu$ is proportional to a delta.
In this paper we investigate the conjecture that the same holds for the Dirac

best constant in a new scaling-invariant Hardy-type inequality. Our main result
is that for all $0\leq\nu<\nu_1$, there exists an optimal measure $\mu\geq0$

driven by shapes to perform visual recognition tasks, recent evidence suggests
that texture bias in CNNs provides higher performing models when learning on
large labeled training datasets. This contrasts with the perceptual bias in the
human visual cortex, which has a stronger preference towards shape components.
Perceptual differences may explain why CNNs achieve human-level performance
when large labeled datasets are available, but their performance significantly
degrades in lowlabeled data scenarios, such as few-shot semantic segmentation.
To remove the texture bias in the context of few-shot learning, we propose a
novel architecture that integrates a set of Difference of Gaussians (DoG) to
attenuate high-frequency local components in the feature space. This produces a
set of modified feature maps, whose high-frequency components are diminished at
different standard deviation values of the Gaussian distribution in the spatial

straightforward way and can accommodate any even number of MBSs. Moreover, the
MBSs in the networks allow defining qubits whose states can be initialized and
read out by measuring Josephson currents flowing between SOTS islands. Our

clarify the physics behind the edge current density behaviour of a hot plasma
entering in contact with a resistive conductor. When a plasma enters in contact
with a highly resistive wall, large current densities appear at the edge of the
plasma. The model shows that this edge current originates from the plasma
response, which attempts to conserve the poloidal magnetic flux ($\Psi$) when
the outer current is being lost. The loss of outer current is caused by the
high resistance of the outer current path compared to the plasma core
resistance. The resistance of the outer path may be given by plasma contact
with a very resistive structure or by a sudden decrease of the outer plasma
temperature (e.g. due to a partial thermal quench or due to a cold front
penetration caused by massive gas injection). For general plasma geometries and
current density profiles the model shows that given a small change of minor
radius ($\delta a$) the plasma current is conserved to first order ($\delta I_p
= 0 + \mathcal{O}(\delta a^2)$). This conservation comes from the fact that
total inductance remains constant ($\delta L = 0$) due to an exact compensation
of the change of external inductance with the change of internal inductance
($\delta L_\text{ext}+\delta L_\text{int} = 0$). As the total current is
conserved and the plasma volume is reduced, the edge safety factor drops
according to $q_a \propto a^2/I_p$. Finally the consistency of the resulting
analytical predictions is checked with the help of free-boundary MHD
simulations.

of the segmented parts and the collision avoidance between the gripper and the
subassemblies, applicable gripper types and parameters can be filtered from the

optimize number of grippers for performing the assembly task, by exploring the
gripper that is able to handle multiple assembly components during the

example, the total mass of GCs in a system scales linearly with the dark matter

significant parameter of a trie is its height $H$ which equals the length of
the longest common prefix of any two string in the set $A$ over which the trie
is built. Analytical investigations of random tries suggest that ${\bf E}(H)\in
O(\log(\|A\|))$, although $H$ is unbounded in the worst case. Moreover, sharp
results on the distribution function of $H$ are known for many different random
string sources. But because of the inherent weakness of the modeling behind
average-case analysis---analyses being dominated by random data---these results
can utterly explain the fact that in many practical situations the trie height
is logarithmic. We propose a new semi-random string model and perform a
smoothed analysis in order to give a mathematically more rigorous explanation
for the practical findings. The perturbation functions which we consider are
based on probabilistic finite automata (PFA) and we show that the transition
probabilities of the representing PFA completely characterize the asymptotic
growth of the smoothed trie height. Our main result is of dichotomous
nature---logarithmic or unbounded---and is certainly not surprising at first
glance, but we also give quantitative upper and lower bounds, which are derived
using multivariate generating function in order to express the computations of
the perturbing PFA. A direct consequence is the logarithmic trie height for
edit perturbations(i.e., random insertions, deletions and substitutions).

quasi-instantaneous adaptation of prediction models upon traffic disruption. In
a nutshell, QTIP performs real-time simulations of the affected road for

radius $\rho$ in the plane becomes equidistributed as $\rho\to\infty$. We
consider the following sparse version of this phenomenon. Starting from a
sequence of radii $\left\{ \rho_{n}\right\} _{n=1}^{\infty}$ which diverges to
$\infty$ and an angle $\omega\in\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z},$ we consider the
projection to $\mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ of the $n$'th roots of unity
rotated by angle $\omega$ and dilated by a factor of $\rho_{n}$. We prove that
if $\rho_{n}$ is bounded polynomially in $n$, then the image of these sparse
collections becomes equidistributed, and moreover, if $\rho_{n}$ grows
arbitrarily fast, then we show that equidistribution holds for almost all
$\omega$. Interestingly, we found that for any angle there is a sequence of
radii growing to $\infty$ faster then any polynomial for which equidistribution
fails dramatically. In greater generality, we prove this type of results for
dilations of varying analytic curves in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. A novel component of
the proof is the use of the theory of o-minimal structures to control
exponential sums.

film in composite THz slabs significantly enhances the transmission of the

low-frequency resonance mode originates from the symmetric plasmonic mode and
the high-frequency resonance mode is induced by the hybrid mode of plasmonic

further demonstrate that by tuning the metallic grating width, the plasmonic
bandgap can be manipulated. These results suggest that this composite plasmonic

serving as a fundamental language and play indispensable roles widely.
Conventional studies related to Mie scattering largely focus on local
properties such as differential cross sections and angular polarization
distributions. Though spatially integrated features of total cross sections in
terms of both scattering and absorption are routine for investigations, they
are intrinsically dependent on the specific morphologies of both the scattering
bodies and the incident waves, consequently manifesting no sign of global
invariance. Here we propose global Mie scattering theory to explore topological
invariants for characterizations of scatterings by any obstacles of arbitrarily
structured or polarized coherent light. It is revealed that, independent of
distributions and interactions among the scattering bodies of arbitrary
geometric and optical parameters, in the far field inevitably there are
directions where the scatterings are either zero or circularly polarized.
Furthermore, for each such singular direction we can assign a half-integer
index and the index sum of all those directions are bounded to be a global
topological invariant of $2$. The global Mie theory we propose, which is
mathematically simple but conceptually penetrating, can render new perspectives
for light scattering and topological photonics in both linear and nonlinear
regimes, and would potentially shed new light on the scattering of acoustic and
matter waves of various forms.

$\approx\frac{5}{3}$ and $\approx\frac{8}{3}$ above and below $10^{13.5}
M_{\odot}$, deviating from the self-similarity increasingly to low masses.
$T_X-M_{500}$ is self-similar above this mass, and slightly shallower below it.
Comparing Simba to observed $T_X$ scalings, we find that $L_X$, $L_X$-weighted
[Fe/H], and entropies at $0.1 R_{200}$ ($S_{0.1}$) and $R_{500}$ ($S_{500}$)
all match reasonably well. $S_{500}-T_X$ is consistent with self-similar
expectations, but $S_{0.1}-T_X$ is shallower at lower $T_X$, suggesting the
dominant form of heating moves from gravitational shocks in the outskirts to
non-gravitational feedback in the cores of smaller groups. Simba matches
observations of $L_X$ versus central galaxy stellar mass $M_*$, predicting the
additional trend that star-forming galaxies have higher $L_X(M_*)$. The
electron density profiles for $M_{500}>10^{14}M_\odot$ halos show a $\sim
0.1R_{200}$ core, but at lower masses the profiles are flat at all radii. $T_X$
profiles are flat for $M_{500}<10^{13}M_{\odot}$, and increasingly centrally
peaked with mass. The resulting entropy profiles are centrally depressed for
the highest and lowest mass halos but flatter for intermediate-mass halos, with
$S_{\rm core}\approx200-400$ keV cm$^2$. Simba's [Fe/H] profile matches
observations in the core but over-predicts at larger radii, suggesting overly
widespread metal distribution. We show that Simba's bipolar jet AGN feedback is
most responsible for increasingly evacuating lower-mass halos, thereby
suppressing core densities and raising core entropies to improve agreement with
X-ray scaling relations.

to synthesize very thin and at the same time large nanosheets. Electrical
transport measurements show that these nanosheets can function as field-effect

dependency of the charge transport reveals that defects in the crystal are
responsible for the formation of holes as majority carriers. During
illumination with circularly polarized light, these crystals generate a
helicity dependent photocurrent at zero-volt bias, since their symmetry is
broken by asymmetric interfaces (substrate and vacuum). Further, the observed
circular photogalvanic effect shows a pronounced in-plane anisotropy, with a
higher photocurrent along the armchair direction, originating from the higher

of tin sulfide for new functionalities in electronics and optoelectronics, for

continuous and a proper lower semicontinuous (possibly nonconvex) function, and
the denominator is weakly convex over the constraint set. This model problem
includes the composite optimization problems studied extensively lately, and
encompasses many important modern fractional optimization problems arising from
diverse areas such as the recently proposed scale invariant sparse signal
reconstruction problem in signal processing. We propose a proximal subgradient
algorithm with extrapolations for solving this optimization model and show that
the iterated sequence generated by the algorithm is bounded and any of its
limit points is a stationary point of the model problem. The choice of our
extrapolation parameter is flexible and includes the popular extrapolation
parameter adopted in the restarted Fast Iterative Shrinking-Threshold Algorithm
(FISTA). By providing a unified analysis framework of descent methods, we
establish the convergence of the full sequence under the assumption that a
suitable merit function satisfies the Kurdyka--{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property. In
particular, our algorithm exhibits linear convergence for the scale invariant
sparse signal reconstruction problem and the Rayleigh quotient problem over
spherical constraint. In the case where the denominator is the maximum of
finitely many continuously differentiable weakly convex functions, we also
propose an enhanced extrapolated proximal subgradient algorithm with guaranteed
convergence to a stronger notion of stationary points of the model problem.
Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods by both analytical and simulated
numerical examples.

Image-Instance Full Alignment Networks (iFAN) to tackle this problem by
precisely aligning feature distributions on both image and instance levels: 1)
Image-level alignment: multi-scale features are roughly aligned by training
adversarial domain classifiers in a hierarchically-nested fashion. 2) Full
instance-level alignment: deep semantic information and elaborate instance

  Network","accepted by AAAI-20",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate temporal action proposals play an important role in detecting
actions from untrimmed videos. The existing approaches have difficulties in
capturing global contextual information and simultaneously localizing actions
with different durations. To this end, we propose a Relation-aware pyramid
Network (RapNet) to generate highly accurate temporal action proposals. In
RapNet, a novel relation-aware module is introduced to exploit bi-directional
long-range relations between local features for context distilling. This
embedded module enhances the RapNet in terms of its multi-granularity temporal
proposal generation ability, given predefined anchor boxes. We further
introduce a two-stage adjustment scheme to refine the proposal boundaries and
measure their confidence in containing an action with snippet-level actionness.
Extensive experiments on the challenging ActivityNet and THUMOS14 benchmarks
demonstrate our RapNet generates superior accurate proposals over the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

KAIROS utilizes precise synchronized clocks to implement self-invalidating

  Experiments show that inter-transaction caching alone provides 2.35x the
throughput of a baseline system with only intra-transaction caching; adding
sharded validation further improves the throughput by a factor of 3.1 over

training set can be widely different to the test set as their classes are
disjoint. This distribution shift often results in poor generalization.
Manifold smoothing has been shown to address the distribution shift problem by
extending the decision boundaries and reducing the noise of the class
representations. Moreover, manifold smoothness is a key factor for
semi-supervised learning and transductive learning algorithms. In this work, we
propose to use embedding propagation as an unsupervised non-parametric
regularizer for manifold smoothing in few-shot classification. Embedding
propagation leverages interpolations between the extracted features of a neural
network based on a similarity graph. We empirically show that embedding
propagation yields a smoother embedding manifold. We also show that applying
embedding propagation to a transductive classifier achieves new
state-of-the-art results in mini-Imagenet, tiered-Imagenet, Imagenet-FS, and
CUB. Furthermore, we show that embedding propagation consistently improves the
accuracy of the models in multiple semi-supervised learning scenarios by up to
16\% points. The proposed embedding propagation operation can be easily
integrated as a non-parametric layer into a neural network. We provide the
training code and usage examples at

motivates the need for a formalized approach to the computational modeling of
human mobility - in particular how and when individuals change their place of

underlying computational modeling of residence inference, focusing on migration
patterns themselves. As a result, to our knowledge, all prior work has employed
heuristics to compute something like residence histories. Here, we formalize
the residence assignment problem, which seeks, under constraints associated
with the minimum length-of-stay at a residence, the most parsimonious sequence
of residence periods and places that explains the movement history of an
individual. Here we provide an exact solution for this problem and establish
its algorithmic complexity. Because the calculation of optimal residence
histories (under the assumptions of the model) is tractable, we believe that
this method will be a valuable tool for future work on this topic.

scattering at small Bjorken $x_{Bj}$ corresponding to kinematic regions
accessible by the future experiments at electron-ion colliders. The nuclear
shadowing is treated within the color dipole formalism based on the rigorous
Green function technique. This allows incorporating naturally color
transparency and coherence length effects, which are not consistently and
properly included in present calculations. For the lowest $|q\bar q\rangle$
Fock component of the photon, our calculations are based on an exact numerical
solution of the evolution equation for the Green function. Here the magnitude
of shadowing is tested using a realistic form for the nuclear density function,
as well as various phenomenological models for the dipole cross section. The
corresponding variation of the transverse size of the $q\bar q$ photon
fluctuations is important for $x_{Bj}\gtrsim 10^{-4}$, on the contrary with the
most of other models, which use frequently only the eikonal approximation with
the ""frozen"" transverse size. At $x_{Bj}\lesssim 0.01$ we calculate within the
same formalism also a shadowing correction for the higher Fock component of the
photon containing gluons. The corresponding magnitudes of gluon shadowing
correction are compared adopting different phenomenological dipole models. Our
results are tested by available data from the E665 and NMC collaborations.
Finally, the magnitude of nuclear shadowing is predicted for various kinematic
regions that should be scanned by the future experiments at electron-ion
colliders.

neutrino masses introduced in arXiv:1308.3655 are examined both in general and,
using the model T1-3-B ($\alpha = 0$) as a representative, in more detail. In
the process, it is both shown how such models are built and a numerical
analysis tool chain is established, automating as many steps as possible from
the very beginning (deriving the Lagrangian from a given field content) to the
very end (calculating observables such as the dark matter relic density, the
direct detection cross section and the neutrino masses and mixing matrices).
  As an important result in laying out the mathematical groundwork, a
convention for representations of SU(2) is established which, in this form, is
not found in previous works. Another major result is the development of the
program minimal-lagrangians, whose capabilities are described in the thesis. It
is of great use both for the construction of Lagrangians for new models as well
their verification or quick surveys. minimal-lagrangians can be applied to any
model within the class it is designed to handle, extending its utility far
beyond a one-time result that is only obtained for a single model.
  Finally, the first steps in the analysis of the model T1-3-B ($\alpha = 0$)
are taken. It is shown that the model can reproduce both the singlet-doublet
fermion dark matter model and the inert triplet model in the appropriate
limits. Moreover, the neutrino mass matrix is found and it is demonstrated that
the model can accommodate current constraints on the neutrino masses. Lastly,
the behavior of the dark matter relic density as it depends on the parameter
responsible for the generation of neutrino masses is investigated.
  Further in-depth study of the model T1-3-B ($\alpha = 0$) was performed in a
separate publication (arXiv:1812.11133).

approach allows exploiting the correlations amongst all the measurements. A
sliding window of the most recent system states is estimated by minimizing a
cost function that includes visual re-projection errors, relative inertial
errors, and global positional residuals. We use IMU preintegration to formulate
the inertial residuals and leverage the outcome of such algorithm to
efficiently compute the global position residuals. The experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves accurate and globally consistent
estimates, with negligible increase of the optimization computational cost. Our
method consistently outperforms the loosely-coupled fusion approach. The mean
position error is reduced up to 50% with respect to the loosely-coupled
approach in outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights, where the global
position information is given by noisy GPS measurements. To the best of our

rigorously prove that the estimator, which can be built up from different

demonstrate that our method is applicable to high-dimensional data and can
provide coarse-grained EP for Markov systems with unobservable states.

require precise positioning of the calibration target relative to the FPP

SV methods generally do not achieve the same accuracy level. However, the
calibration is more flexible in that the calibration target can be arbitrarily

the SV calibration approach using a PCM method to achieve higher accuracy. The
method has the flexibility of SV methods, is robust to lens distortions, and
has a simple relation between the recovered phase and the metric coordinates.
Experimental results show that the proposed Hybrid method outperforms the SV

centralised source. It is expected to play an important role in the
decarbonisation of the energy sector in the coming years. In district heating,
heat is traditionally generated through fossil fuels, often with combined heat
and power (CHP) units. However, increasingly, waste heat is being used as a low
carbon alternative, either directly or, for low temperature sources, via a heat
pump. The design of district heating often has competing objectives: the need
for inexpensive energy and meeting low carbon targets. In addition, the
planning of district heating schemes is subject to multiple sources of
uncertainty such as variability in heat demand and energy prices. This paper
proposes a decision support tool to analyse and compare system designs for
district heating under uncertainty using stochastic ordering (dominance).
Contrary to traditional uncertainty metrics that provide statistical summaries
and impose total ordering, stochastic ordering is a partial ordering and
operates with full probability distributions. In our analysis, we apply the
orderings in the mean and dispersion to the waste heat recovery problem in
Brunswick, Germany.

With respect to its noise model, quantum states have a robust decomposition
into a sequence of operations that each extend the state by one qubit without
spreading errors between qubits. This enables universal quantum sampling of
states with an efficient representation in this robust form and observables
with low quantum weight that can be sampled from general measurements on a few
qubits and computational basis measurements on the remaining qubits. These

modes associated with two-resonant-mode interference in two-dimensional
duct-cavity structures are calculated by the feedback-loop closure principle,
which allows us to analyse the travelling modes that construct the trapped
modes. The exact two coexisting resonant modes that underpin an embedded
trapped mode in a cavity open to two semi-infinite ducts are numerically
demonstrated. At the interface between the cavity segment and a duct, total
reflection can occur for a particular combination of two propagative guided
waves in the cavity. With a particular cavity length and a particular
frequency, total reflection also happens for the two reflected waves at the
opposite end of the cavity. In this way, the two coexisting standing waves
underpin a trapped mode. It is found that the two standing waves are not two
closed-cavity modes. Thus, this work presents a new understanding of such
embedded trapped modes as a product of total reflection of two guided waves at
the interface between two waveguides, rather than interference between two
eigenmodes of a closed cavity. For quasi-trapped modes, the Fano scattering
phenomenon owing to the effects of two acoustic channels is also shown.

inputs in the form of categorical sequences should address the following
challenges: (1) non-differentiability of the target function, (2) constraints
on transformations of initial sequences, and (3) diversity of possible

The first approach adopts a Monte-Carlo method and allows usage in any

of sporadically active devices wish to communicate with a base station (BS)
equipped with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. Each
device is preassigned a unique signature sequence, and the BS identifies the
active devices by detecting which sequences are transmitted. This device
activity detection problem can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) problem for which the sample covariance matrix of the received signal is
a sufficient statistic. The goal of this paper is to characterize the feasible
set of problem parameters under which this covariance based approach is able to
successfully recover the device activities in the massive MIMO regime. Through
an analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of MLE via its associated Fisher
information matrix, this paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition on
the Fisher information matrix to ensure a vanishing probability of detection
error as the number of antennas goes to infinity, based on which a numerical
phase transition analysis is obtained. This condition is also examined from a
perspective of covariance matching, which relates the phase transition analysis
to a recently derived scaling law. Further, we provide a characterization of
the distribution of the estimation error in MLE, based on which the error
probabilities in device activity detection can be accurately predicted.
Finally, this paper studies a random access scheme with joint device activity
and data detection and analyzes its performance in a similar way.

and continuous alphabets is a challenging task. It requires optimizing the
directed information (DI) rate over all channel input distributions. The
objective is a multi-letter expression, whose analytic solution is only known
for a few specific cases. When no analytic solution is present or the channel
model is unknown, there is no unified framework for calculating or even
approximating capacity. This work proposes a novel capacity estimation
algorithm that treats the channel as a `black-box', both when feedback is or is
not present. The algorithm has two main ingredients: (i) a neural distribution
transformer (NDT) model that shapes a noise variable into the channel input
distribution, which we are able to sample, and (ii) the DI neural estimator
(DINE) that estimates the communication rate of the current NDT model. These
models are trained by an alternating maximization procedure to both estimate
the channel capacity and obtain an NDT for the optimal input distribution. The
method is demonstrated on the moving average additive Gaussian noise channel,
where it is shown that both the capacity and feedback capacity are estimated
without knowledge of the channel transition kernel. The proposed estimation
framework opens the door to a myriad of capacity approximation results for
continuous alphabet channels that were inaccessible until now.

  Transportation Systems (ITSC2020)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On-board 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles often relies on geometry
information captured by LiDAR devices. Albeit image features are typically
preferred for detection, numerous approaches take only spatial data as input.
Exploiting this information in inference usually involves the use of compact
representations such as the Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection, which entails a
loss of information and thus hinders the joint inference of all the parameters
of the objects' 3D boxes. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end 3D
object detection framework that can infer oriented 3D boxes solely from BEV
images by using a two-stage object detector and ad-hoc regression branches,
eliminating the need for a post-processing stage. The method outperforms its
predecessor (BirdNet) by a large margin and obtains state-of-the-art results on
the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark for all the categories in evaluation.

importance and impact since it provides chemical composition maps crucial for
several scientific investigations. There are continuous requirements for
larger, faster and highly resolved acquisitions in order to study complex
structures. Among the scientific applications that benefit from it, some of
them, such as wide scale brain imaging, are prohibitively difficult due to time
constraints. However, typically the overall XRF imaging performance is
improving through technological progress on XRF detectors and X-ray sources.
This paper suggests an additional approach where XRF scanning is performed in a
sparse way by skipping specific points or by varying dynamically acquisition
time or other scan settings in a conditional manner. This paves the way for
Compressive Sensing in XRF scans where data are acquired in a reduced manner
allowing for challenging experiments, currently not feasible with the
traditional scanning strategies. A series of different compressive sensing

unmixing estimator, that is based on simultaneous diagonalization of the
covariance matrix and an autocovariance matrix with lag $\tau$. Our main
contribution is that our asymptotic results can be applied to a large class of
processes. In related literature, the processes are typically assumed to have
weak correlations. We extend this class and consider the unmixing estimator
under stronger dependency structures. In particular, we analyze the asymptotic
behavior of the unmixing estimator under both, long- and short-range dependent
complex-valued processes. Consequently, our theory covers unmixing estimators
that converge slower than the usual $\sqrt{T}$ and unmixing estimators that
produce non-Gaussian asymptotic distributions. The presented methodology is a
powerful prepossessing tool and highly applicable in several fields of
statistics. Complex-valued processes are frequently encountered in, for
example, biomedical applications and signal processing. In addition, our
approach can be applied to model real-valued problems that involve temporally

We consider two models: plain crosslinking, which results in a flexible

the central attraction leads to collapsed MF conformations. Structures that
initially exhibit spherical symmetry evolve into cylindrically symmetric ones,
with growing magnetic field strength. Plain crosslinking also allows for
conformational bistability. MFs with constrained crosslinking tend to, instead,
unravel in field. In both crosslinking scenarios, central attraction is able to
hinder low-field magnetic response of MFs, albeit the bistability of plainly
crosslinked MFs manifests itself also in the high-field region.

learning provides effective results with an agent learning from a stand-alone

the environments considered herein, calls for a large number of learning trials
to learn about the environment through Reinforcement Learning. Imitation
Learning (IL) offers a promising solution for those challenges using a teacher.
In IL, the learning process can take advantage of human-sourced assistance
and/or control over the agent and environment. A human teacher and an agent
learner are considered in this study. The teacher takes part in the agent
training towards dealing with the environment, tackling a specific objective,
and achieving a predefined goal. Within that paradigm, however, existing IL
approaches have the drawback of expecting extensive demonstration information

leverage the teacher feedback, be it direct binary or indirect detailed for the

complexity of many natural ecosystems. The so-called stability-diversity debate
ensued, and the discussion about the factors making an ecosystem stable or
unstable continues to this day. We show in this work that dispersal can be a
destabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work
on pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach. We demonstrate how a
stable equilibrium in a complex ecosystem with two trophic levels can become
unstable with the introduction of dispersal in space. Conversely, we show that
Turing instabilities can occur more easily in complex ecosystems with many
species than in the case of only a few species. Our work shows that adding more

monitoring station during the quarters of 2019 and the significance of the
differences with the concentration of the quarters of previous years is
analysed. These periods include the activation of Madrid Central, which is a
major initiative for reducing motor traffic and the associated pollution at the
city centre. These periods correspond to the initialisation of, 2019Q1; and to
tree fully-operational quarters of Madrid Central, 2019Q2, 2019Q3 and 2019Q4.
Escuelas Aguirre monitoring station is not inside Madrid Central but 2 km away.
The analysis of the PM2.5 concentration at this station allows discerning the
rise of negative effects due to an increment of the motor traffic around the
traffic restricted area. The analysis is based on the Binomial Sign Test for a
Single Sample. The sample of signs is generated by subtracting the daily mean
concentration of PM2.5 for the measurements of the period of two years: 20xx
and 2019. Samples for the pair-wise comparisons for the year 2019 versus the
years of the periods from 2010 to 2018 are evaluated. An excess of positive or
negative sign indicates that the differences between the measurements of
concentrations in the comparison of two years are significant. Conversely, a
balanced number of positive and negative signs points to no impact of the
action. Since wind is an efficient pollution remover, the Binomial Sign Test is
also applied to its intensity in the two-periods comparison. This allows
discerning if the pollution reduction could be associated to a larger number of
windy days in the 2019 quarter under comparison.

find a well-connected cluster near a set of seed nodes. Recent results have
revealed that incorporating higher order information significantly enhances the
results of graph clustering techniques. The majority of existing research in
this area focuses on spectral graph theory-based techniques. However, an
alternative perspective on local graph clustering arises from using max-flow
and min-cut on the objectives, which offer distinctly different guarantees. For
instance, a new method called capacity releasing diffusion (CRD) was recently
proposed and shown to preserve local structure around the seeds better than
spectral methods. The method was also the first local clustering technique that
is not subject to the quadratic Cheeger inequality by assuming a good cluster
near the seed nodes. In this paper, we propose a local hypergraph clustering
technique called hypergraph CRD (HG-CRD) by extending the CRD process to
cluster based on higher order patterns, encoded as hyperedges of a hypergraph.
Moreover, we theoretically show that HG-CRD gives results about a quantity
called motif conductance, rather than a biased version used in previous
experiments. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real world graphs
show that HG-CRD enhances the clustering quality.

transformed into an RGB image using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF).
Many such EEG epochs are transformed into GASF images for the normal and focal

classification problems are used here to detect the focal GASF images. Three
pre-trained DNN such as the AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19 are validated for
epilepsy detection based on the transfer learning approach. Furthermore, the
textural features are extracted from GASF images, and prominent features are
selected for a multilayer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. Lastly, a
Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three CNN layers, Batch
Normalization, Max-pooling layer, and Dense layers, is proposed for epilepsy

Moreover, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of the Receiver Operating

artificially increase the size of the training datasets. Training with image

  We present TorchIO, an open-source Python library to enable efficient
loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images
for deep learning. TorchIO follows the style of PyTorch and integrates standard
medical image processing libraries to efficiently process images during
training of neural networks. TorchIO transforms can be composed, reproduced,
traced and extended. We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation
operations as well as simulation of MRI-specific artifacts.
  Source code, comprehensive tutorials and extensive documentation for TorchIO
can be found at https://torchio.rtfd.io/. The package can be installed from the
Python Package Index running 'pip install torchio'. It includes a command-line
interface which allows users to apply transforms to image files without using
Python. Additionally, we provide a graphical interface within a TorchIO
extension in 3D Slicer to visualize the effects of transforms.
  TorchIO was developed to help researchers standardize medical image
processing pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments.
It encourages open science, as it supports reproducibility and is version
controlled so that the software can be cited precisely. Due to its modularity,
the library is compatible with other frameworks for deep learning with medical
images.

knowledge-driven methods are two classical techniques in the pursuit of such
machine sense-making capability. However, while data-driven methods seek to
model the statistical regularities of events by making observations in the
real-world, they remain difficult to interpret and they lack mechanisms for
naturally incorporating external knowledge. Conversely, knowledge-driven
methods, combine structured knowledge bases, perform symbolic reasoning based
on axiomatic principles, and are more interpretable in their inferential
processing; however, they often lack the ability to estimate the statistical
salience of an inference. To combat these issues, we propose the use of hybrid
AI methodology as a general framework for combining the strengths of both
approaches. Specifically, we inherit the concept of neuro-symbolism as a way of
using knowledge-bases to guide the learning progress of deep neural networks.
We further ground our discussion in two applications of neuro-symbolism and, in
both cases, show that our systems maintain interpretability while achieving
comparable performance, relative to the state-of-the-art.

Objective: In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to measure the
level of maintenance activity of GitHub projects. Our goal is to alert users
about the risks of using unmaintained projects and possibly motivate other
developers to assume the maintenance of such projects. Method: We train machine
learning models to define a metric to express the level of maintenance activity

projects in the time frame of one year. Results: From 2,927 active projects,
16% become unmaintained in the interval of one year. We also found that
Objective-C projects tend to have lower maintenance activity than projects
implemented in other languages. Finally, software tools---such as compilers and

  Math",,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $G$ be a finite group of Lie type. In order to determine the character
table of $G$, Lusztig developed the theory of character sheaves. In this
framework, one has to find the transformation between two bases for the space
of class functions on $G$, one of them being the irreducible characters of $G$,
the other one consisting of characteristic functions associated to character
sheaves. In principle, this has been achieved by Lusztig and Shoji, but the
underlying process involves some scalars which are still unknown in many cases.
The problem of specifying these scalars can be reduced to considering cuspidal
character sheaves. We will deal with the latter for the specific case where
$G=E_7(q)$, and $q$ is a power of the bad prime $p=2$ for $E_7$.

  Parkinson's disease","17 pages, 8 figures, article",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, there are many research cases for the diagnosis of
Parkinson's disease (PD) with the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by
utilizing the traditional unsupervised machine learning methods and the
supervised deep learning models. However, unsupervised learning methods are not
good at extracting accurate features among MRIs and it is difficult to collect
enough data in the field of PD to satisfy the need of training deep learning
models. Moreover, most of the existing studies are based on single-view MRI
data, of which data characteristics are not sufficient enough. In this paper,
therefore, in order to tackle the drawbacks mentioned above, we propose a novel
semi-supervised learning framework called Semi-supervised Multi-view learning
Clustering architecture technology (SMC). The model firstly introduces the
sliding window method to grasp different features, and then uses the
dimensionality reduction algorithms of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to
process the data with different features. Finally, the traditional single-view
clustering and multi-view clustering methods are employed on multiple feature
views to obtain the results. Experiments show that our proposed method is
superior to the state-of-art unsupervised learning models on the clustering
effect. As a result, it may be noted that, our work could contribute to
improving the effectiveness of identifying PD by previous labeled and
subsequent unlabeled medical MRI data in the realistic medical environment.

of a splitting which leads to an exact projection method; the application of
the divergence operator to the discrete motion equation exhibits, without any

Applications such as cell imaging and injection benefit from pitch-rotational
manipulation. Generation of such motion in single beam optical tweezers has
remained elusive due to complicacies of generating high enough ellipticity
perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Further, trapping an extended
object at two locations can only generate partial pitch motion by moving one of
the foci in the axial direction. Here, we use hexagonal-shaped upconverting
particles and single cells trapped close to a gold-coated glass cover slip in a
sample chamber to generate complete 360 degree and continuous pitch motion even
with a single optical tweezers beam. The tweezers beam passing through the gold
surface is partially absorbed and generates a hot-spot to produce circulatory
convective flows in the vicinity which rotates the objects. The rotation rate
can be controlled by the intensity of the laser light and the thickness of the
gold layer. Thus such a simple configuration can turn the particle in the pitch
sense. The circulatory flows in this technique have a diameter of about 5

provide assistance to surgeons with visual information of the breast as a
result of a surgery simulation. The process of finding the model parameters
requires numeric inputs, either based in medical imaging techniques, or other
measures. Inputs can be processed by iterative methods (inverse elasticity
solvers). Such solvers are highly robust and provide solutions within the
required degree of accuracy. However, their computational complexity is costly.
On the other hand, machine learning based approaches provide outputs in
real-time. Although high accuracy rates can be achieved, these methods are not
exempt from producing solutions outside the required degree of accuracy. In the
context of real life situations, a non accurate solution might present
complications to the patient.
  We present an hybrid parameter estimation method to take advantage of the
positive features of each of the aforementioned approaches. Our method
preserves both the real-time performance of deep-learning methods, and the
reliability of inverse elasticity solvers. The underlying reasoning behind our
proposal is the fact that deep-learning methods, such as neural networks, can
provide accurate results in the majority of cases and they just need a
fail-safe system to ensure its reliability. Hence, we propose using a
Multilayer Neural Networks (MNN) to get an estimation which is in turn
validated by a iterative solver. In case the MNN provides an estimation not
within the required accuracy range, the solver refines the estimation until the
required accuracy is achieved. Based on our results we can conclude that the

active area of research in recent years. The main goals of this research is to
develop reliable automatic methods for detecting and diagnosing different types
of BRCA from diagnostic images. In this paper, we present a review of the state
of the art CAD methods applied to magnetic resonance (MRI) and mammography
images of BRCA patients. The review aims to provide an extensive introduction
to different features extracted from BRCA images through texture and
statistical analysis and to categorize deep learning frameworks and data
structures capable of using metadata to aggregate relevant information to
assist oncologists and radiologists. We divide the existing literature
according to the imaging modality and into radiomics, machine learning, or
combination of both. We also emphasize the difference between each modality and
methods strengths and weaknesses and analyze their performance in detecting
BRCA through a quantitative comparison. We compare the results of various
approaches for implementing CAD systems for the detection of BRCA. Each
approachs standard workflow components are reviewed and summary tables
provided. We present an extensive literature review of radiomics feature
extraction techniques and machine learning methods applied in BRCA diagnosis
and detection, focusing on data preparation, data structures, pre processing
and post processing strategies available in the literature. There is a growing
interest on radiomic feature extraction and machine learning methods for BRCA
detection through histopathological images, MRI and mammography images.
However, there isnt a CAD method able to combine distinct data types to provide
the best diagnostic results. Employing data fusion techniques to medical images
and patient data could lead to improved detection and classification results.

  Humans develop biases in employing available information on facial features
to discriminate across faces. Studies show these biases are influenced both by
neurological development and by each individual's social experience. In recent
years the computer vision community has achieved human-level performance in
many face processing tasks with deep neural network-based models. These face
processing systems are also subject to systematic biases due to model
architectural choices and training data distribution.

  HIV Patients",,,,,"stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying a patient's key problems over time is a common task for providers
at the point care, yet a complex and time-consuming activity given current
electric health records. To enable a problem-oriented summarizer to identify a
patient's comprehensive list of problems and their salience, we propose an
unsupervised phenotyping approach that jointly learns a large number of
phenotypes/problems across structured and unstructured data. To identify the
appropriate granularity of the learned phenotypes, the model is trained on a
target patient population of the same clinic. To enable the content
organization of a problem-oriented summarizer, the model identifies phenotype
relatedness as well. The model leverages a correlated-mixed membership approach
with variational inference applied to heterogenous clinical data. In this
paper, we focus our experiments on assessing the learned phenotypes and their
relatedness as learned from a specific patient population. We ground our
experiments in phenotyping patients from an HIV clinic in a large urban care
institution (n=7,523), where patients have voluminous, longitudinal
documentation, and where providers would benefit from summaries of these
patient's medical histories, whether about their HIV or any comorbidities. We
find that the learned phenotypes and their relatedness are clinically valid
when assessed qualitatively by clinical experts, and that the model surpasses
baseline in inferring phenotype-relatedness when comparing to existing
expert-curated condition groupings.

Crystallization rates are also considered to be useful probes of glass-forming

classical crystal nucleation and growth theories, yet in general solid
formation is a far more complex process. In particular, the observation of
apparently different crystal growth regimes in many binary liquid mixtures
greatly challenges our understanding of crystallization. Here, we study by

explicitly accounting for the non-ideality of the mixtures. Our results
highlight the importance of thermodynamic aspects in describing the crystal

theory of crystal growth.

Here, based on a widely accepted radical pair model of a biocompass, we propose
a microscopic mechanism that allows the biocompass to operate without a finite
magnetization of the magnetic protein in a biological environment. With the
structure of the magnetic protein, we show that the magnetic fluctuation,
rather than the permanent magnetism, of the magnetic protein can enable
geomagnetic field sensing. An analysis of the quantum dynamics of our
microscopic model reveals the necessary conditions for optimal sensitivity. Our
work clarifies the mechanism by which magnetic protein enables a biocompass.

activity of neurons. Patients affected by this disease can be treated with the
help of medicines or surgical procedures. However, both of these methods are
not quite useful. The only method to treat epilepsy patients effectively is to
predict the seizure before its onset. It has been observed that abnormal
activity in the brain signals starts before the occurrence of seizure known as
the preictal state. Many researchers have proposed machine learning models for
prediction of epileptic seizures by detecting the start of preictal state.
However, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification remains a great
challenge in the prediction of preictal state. Therefore, we propose a model
that uses common spatial pattern filtering and wavelet transform for
preprocessing, principal component analysis for feature extraction and support
vector machines for detecting preictal state. We have applied our model on 23
subjects and an average sensitivity of 93.1% has been observed for 84 seizures.

reduction in the performance. Our system reaches an accuracy of 97.9% on MNIST
