the construction of the related spherically symmetric thin-shell traversable
wormholes within the context of standard general relativity. All of the really
unusual physics is encoded in one simple parameter $a$ which characterizes the
scale of the bounce. Keeping the discussion as close as possible to standard
general relativity is the theorist's version of only adjusting one feature of
the model at a time. We shall modify the standard thin-shell traversable
wormhole construction, each bulk region now being a black-bounce spacetime, and
with the physics of the thin shell being (as much as possible) derivable from
the Einstein equations. Furthermore, we shall apply a dynamical analysis to the
throat by considering linearized radial perturbations around static solutions,
and demonstrate that the stability of the wormhole is equivalent to choosing
suitable properties for the exotic material residing on the wormhole throat.
The construction is sufficiently novel to be interesting, and sufficiently
straightforward to be tractable.

building reconstruction, with studies reporting success in typical buildings.
However, the reconstruction of curved buildings remains an open research
problem. To this end, we propose a new framework for curved building
reconstruction via assembling and deforming geometric primitives. The input
LiDAR point cloud are first converted into contours where individual buildings
are identified. After recognizing geometric units (primitives) from building
contours, we get initial models by matching basic geometric primitives to these
primitives. To polish assembly models, we employ a warping field for model
refinements. Specifically, an embedded deformation (ED) graph is constructed
via downsampling the initial model. Then, the point-to-model displacements are
minimized by adjusting node parameters in the ED graph based on our objective
function. The presented framework is validated on several highly curved
buildings collected by various LiDAR in different cities. The experimental
results, as well as accuracy comparison, demonstrate the advantage and
effectiveness of our method. {The new insight attributes to an efficient
reconstruction manner.} Moreover, we prove that the primitive-based framework
significantly reduces the data storage to 10-20 percent of classical mesh
models.

construct topological edge solitons that either propagate in different

always interpenetrate each other without noticeable radiative losses; however,
they exhibit a spatial shift that depends on the initial phase difference.

layers, they display competition between FM and AFM orders and even lead to the

incorporated into this rule with a minor correction from the free carrier

the elements needed to ray trace diffracted beams within bent Laue crystals for
the purpose of incorporation into other powerful ray tracing applications such
as SHADOW. Specifically, we address the condition in a bent Laue crystal where
a cylindrically bent Laue crystal will focus all the polychromatic diffracted
beams at a single location when a specific asymmetry angle condition is met for
a target x-ray energy - the so-called ""magic condition"". The focal size of the

energy-dispersive properties. The conceptual and mathematical aspects of this
interesting focusing and energy dispersive phenomenon is discussed.

the lattice may adopt to induce such a transition. We show that limited
exposure to sub-bandgap light caused a permanent transition from an insulator
state to a conductor state in the insulating oxide Ga2O3 with 9-orders of
magnitude increase in electronic conduction. Photoexcitation modifies the
charge state of an O-vacancy and the redistribution of the localized electrons,
leading to a massive structural distortion in the lattice that is shown to be
the underlying mechanism. It modifies density of states and introduces new
stable states with shallower energy levels, leading to this intriguing
behavior. We suggest that this mechanism may occur in other wide bandgap metal
oxides leading to drastic modification in their electronic properties.

a minor term that can be determined iteratively, the voltage is given in terms
of a single mode of the Fourier transforms of the bunch forms, namely the mode

Kochen-Specker theorem. Furthermore, SPE is robust under decoherence phenomena.
Here, we show that single-particle entangled states of single photons can be

from a statistical point of view, are indistinguishable from those generated by
a single photon source. This has important consequences, since it demonstrates
that cheap, compact, and low power entangled photon sources can be used for a
range of quantum technology applications.

mechanism revealed by atomistic study offers a better way to understand
hardening mechanism to build a stronger material. In this work, nanoindentation
in Al-Cu alloys are studied using atomistic simulations to investigate the
effects of loading direction, alloying percentages of Cu via dislocation-driven
mechanisms. Also, a low-fidelity finite element (FE) model has been developed
for nanoindentation simulations where nanoscale materials properties are used
from atomistic simulations. Material properties, such as hardness and reduced
modulus, are computed from both the FE and MD simulations and then compared.
Considering the fundamental difference between these two numerical approaches,
the FE results obtained from the present study conform fairly with those from
MD simulations. This paves a way into finding material properties of alloys
with reduced simulation time and cost by using FE where high-fidelity results
are not required. The results have been presented as load-displacement
analysis, dislocation density, dislocation loops nucleation and propagation,
von-Mises stress distribution and surface imprints. The techniques adopted in
this paper to incorporate atomistic data into FE simulations can be further
extended for finding other mechanical and fracture properties for complex alloy
materials.

introduced to improve QoS for commuting users inside public transport because
the QoS is deteriorated due to vehicular penetration losses. Furthermore, the
users inside fast moving public transport also exert excessive load on the core
network due to large group handovers. To this end, mobile cells will play a
crucial role in reducing overall handover count and will help in alleviating

regularization induces a coupling effect among quantiles creating a single

the regularization model is capable to improve the performance of MQR

approach, combining belief propagation (BP) and mean-field (MF) approximation,

graph corresponding to a factorization of the joint probability distribution
function (PDF) of the latent variables and a choice for a separation of this
factorization into BP region and MF region, the posterior PDFs of continuous
latent variables including target kinematic state, target visibility state, and
ionospheric height, are approximated by MF due to its simple MP update rules

association which contains one-to-one frame (hard) constraints, its PDF is
approximated by loopy BP. Finally, the approximated posterior PDFs are updated
iteratively in a closed-loop manner, which is effective for dealing with the

the second one, though a markedly different implementation employing a
population of distinct molecular species and semi-permeable membranes, is
informationally and thermodynamically equivalent to an ideal gas of the
single-molecule engines. Since it is a gas of noninteracting particles one
concludes, following Boyd and Crutchfield, that (i) it reduces to a chaotic
dynamical system---called the Szilard Map, a composite of three piecewise
linear maps that implement the thermodynamic transformations of measurement,
control, and erasure; (ii) its transitory functioning as an engine that
converts disorganized heat energy to work is governed by the Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy rate; (iii) the demon's minimum necessary ""intelligence"" for optimal
functioning is given by the engine's statistical complexity, and (iv) its
functioning saturates thermodynamic bounds and so it is a minimal, optimal
implementation. We show that Szilard's third model is rather different and
addresses the fundamental issue, raised by the first two, of measurement in and
by thermodynamic systems and entropy generation. Taken together, Szilard's
suite of constructions lays out a range of possible realizations of Maxwellian
demons that anticipated by almost two decades Shannon's and Wiener's concept of

modelling of the magnetospheric and ionospheric convection arising from the

auroral radio powers are traditionally estimated using empirical or

relates radio power to the magnetic or kinetic energy dissipated in the stellar
wind-planet interaction. Such methods risk an oversimplification of the
magnetospheric electrodynamics giving rise to radio emission. As the next step
toward a self-consistent picture, we model the stellar
wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents using a 3D MHD model. We
compute electron-cyclotron maser instability-driven emission from the
calculated ionospheric field-aligned current density. We show that the auroral
radio power is highly sensitive to interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
strength, and that the emission is saturated for plausible hot Jupiter Pedersen
conductances, indicating that radio power may be largely independent of
ionospheric conductance. We estimate peak radio powers of $10^{14}$ W from a
planet exposed to an IMF strength of $10^3$ nT, implying flux densities at a
distance of 15 pc from Earth potentially detectable with current and future
radio telescopes. We also find a relation between radio power and planetary
orbital distance that is broadly consistent with results from previous analytic
models of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at hot Jupiters, and indicates that
the RBL likely overestimates the radio powers by up to two orders of magnitude

desingularization is a $5$-dimensional p.p. abelian variety. Let $\frak j:
\mathcal X \to \mathcal A_5$ be the period map sending $X$ to $J(X)$, in the
paper we study $\frak j$ and its relation to $\frak p$. As is well known the
degree of $\frak p$ is $27$ and its monodromy group endows any smooth fibre $F$
of $\frak p$ with the incidence configuration of $27$ lines of a cubic surface.
Then the same monodromy defines a map $ \mathfrak j': \mathcal D_6 \to \mathcal
A_5$ of degree $36$, with fibre the configuration of $36$ 'double-six' sets of
lines of a cubic surface. We prove that $\frak j = \frak j' \circ \phi$, where
$\phi: \mathcal X \to \mathcal D_6$ is birational. This provides a geometric
description of $\frak j'$. Finally we describe the relations between the
different moduli spaces considered and prove that some, including $\mathcal X$,
are rational.

consider the private computation of polynomials of degree $g=1$, i.e., private
linear computation (PLC) for coded databases. In PLC, a user wishes to compute
a linear combination over the $f$ messages while keeping the coefficients of

proposed star-product PIR and Lagrange coded computation. The second scheme
considers the special case of coded databases with systematic Lagrange
encoding. Both schemes yield improved rates, while asymptotically, as
$f\rightarrow \infty$, the systematic scheme gives a significantly better

topological data analysis (TDA) determines the stability of spatial

action policy in a sequential decision process, through repeated experience. In
a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal
rewards. As in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. As in
multi-armed bandit problems, when an agent picks an action, he can not infer
ex-post the rewards induced by other action choices. In reinforcement learning,
his actions have consequences: they influence not only rewards, but also future
states of the world. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal
policy -- a mapping from the states of the world to the set of actions, in
order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term strategy. Exploring
might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead to optimal
long-term ones. Many problems of optimal control, popular in economics for more
than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework, and
recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep
learning algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex
behavioral problems. In this article, we propose a state-of-the-art of

$D\bar{D}\to \pi\pi$ rescattering. In the model, the $\chi_c^0$ appears as a
narrow resonant state of the $D\bar D$ system below threshold. It is introduced
in an unitary two channel S-matrix model of the coupled $D\bar D$ and $\pi\pi$

has a sharp sign change at the $D\bar D$ threshold, changing the sign of the CP

disfavor the standard least squares estimators. Inequalities among estimators
are connected to names of Cramer, Rao and Frechet. The standard demonstrations
of these inequalities require very special analytical properties of the
probability functions, globally indicated as regular models. These limiting
conditions are too restrictive to handle realistic problems in track fitting. A
previous extension to heteroscedastic models of the Cramer-Rao-Frechet

proved beyond any possible doubts the superiority of the heteroscedastic models

distributions are typical members of the required regular models. Instead, the
realistic probability distributions, encountered in tracker detectors, are very
different from Gaussian distributions. Therefore, to have well grounded set of
inequalities, the limitations to regular models must be overtaken. The aim of
this paper is to demonstrate the inequalities for least squares estimators for
irregular models of probabilities, explicitly excluded by the
Cramer-Rao-Frechet demonstrations. Estimators for straight and parabolic tracks

unusable. Also, when using new modality or presence of images with rare
patterns, a bulk amount of similar image data and their corresponding labels
are required for training these models. In this work, we propose to use a
few-shot learning approach that requires less training data and can be used to
predict label classes of test samples from an unseen dataset. We propose a
novel additive angular margin metric in the framework of prototypical network
in few-shot learning setting. We compare our approach to the several
established methods on a large cohort of multi-center, multi-organ, and
multi-modal endoscopy data. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Based on the Noether charge formalism of Iyer and Wald, we obtain the slope of
the complexity of formation in the small and large time approximations. By
circuit analogy, we show that our results concur with the switchback effect of
the quantum system. These results show that the switchback effect is a general
feature of the CA complexity in stationary black holes and its existence is
independent of the explicit gravitational theory as well as spacetime

geometric interpretation, which indicates the intersection pattern between the
graph of $f$ and the lines in the affine plane $AG(2,q)$. When $q$ is even, the
long-standing open problem of classifying o-polynomials can be rephrased in a
simple way, namely, classifying all polynomials which have the same
intersection distribution as $x^2$. Inspired by this connection, we proceed to
consider the next simplest case and derive the intersection distribution for
all degree three polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ both odd and even.
Moreover, we initiate to classify all monomials having the same intersection
distribution as $x^3$, where some characterizations of such monomials are
obtained and a conjecture is proposed. In addition, two applications of the
intersection distributions of degree three polynomials are presented. The first
one is the construction of nonisomorphic Steiner triple systems and the second

their robustness to input perturbations must be better understood before they

subject in the context of natural images that can potentially be built upon.
However, it cannot be assumed that conclusions about robustness will transfer
from natural images to mammogram images, due to significant differences between
the two image modalities. In order to determine whether conclusions will
transfer, we measure the sensitivity of a radiologist-level screening mammogram
image classifier to four commonly studied input perturbations that natural
image classifiers are sensitive to. We find that mammogram image classifiers
are also sensitive to these perturbations, which suggests that we can build on
the existing literature. We also perform a detailed analysis on the effects of
low-pass filtering, and find that it degrades the visibility of clinically
meaningful features called microcalcifications. Since low-pass filtering
removes semantically meaningful information that is predictive of breast
cancer, we argue that it is undesirable for mammogram image classifiers to be
invariant to it. This is in contrast to natural images, where we do not want
DNNs to be sensitive to low-pass filtering due to its tendency to remove
information that is human-incomprehensible.

domain gap between two domains and co-train a UWF fundus diagnosis model by
pseudo-labelling and adversarial learning. We design a regularisation technique
to regulate the domain adaptation. Also, we apply MixUp to overcome the
over-fitting issue from incorrect generated pseudo-labels. Our experimental
results on either single or both domains demonstrate that the proposed method
can well adapt and transfer the knowledge from traditional fundus images to UWF
fundus images and improve the performance of retinal disease recognition.

questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the
spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR
model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also
caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases
in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct
five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out
of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000
people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective
and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South
Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario
1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios
were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\%
effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the
transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario
active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission
rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of
cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$
was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about
~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting
measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the
recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate
measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully
that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.

compute these zeros by a predictor-corrector type algorithm. It is known that
the H-infinity norm of delay differential algebraic systems, which can model

arbitrarily small delay perturbations. This recently led to the concept of
strong H-infinity norms, which explicitly take into account such small delay

is magnetoconductivity oscillations induced by inter-subband (out-of-plane) and

magneto-oscillations induced by intra-subband excitation are similar to
remarkable microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO) reported for

were observed and well described theoretically for resonant inter-subband

zero-resistance states (ZRS), the in-plane redistribution of electrons,
self-generated audio-frequency oscillations, and incompressible states. These

of quantum theory always seem to involve properties that are fine tuned, i.e.
properties that hold at the operational level but break at the ontological
level. Their appearance at the operational level is due to unexplained special
choices of the ontological parameters, which is what we mean by a fine tuning.
Famous examples of such features are contextuality and nonlocality. In this
article, we develop a theory-independent mathematical framework for
characterizing operational fine tunings. These are distinct from causal fine
tunings -- already introduced by Wood and Spekkens in [NJP,17 033002(2015)] --
as the definition of an operational fine tuning does not involve any
assumptions about the underlying causal structure. We show how known examples
of operational fine tunings, such as Spekkens' generalized contextuality,
violation of parameter independence in Bell experiment, and ontological time
asymmetry, fit into our framework. We discuss the possibility of finding new
fine tunings and we use the framework to shed new light on the relation between
nonlocality and generalized contextuality. Although nonlocality has often been
argued to be a form of contextuality, this is only true when nonlocality
consists of a violation of parameter independence. We formulate our framework
also in the language of category theory using the concept of functors.

through hierarchical structures, can become computationally onerous for
modeling massive spatial data sets because of its reliance on iterative
estimation algorithms. This manuscript develops a conjugate Bayesian framework
for analyzing multivariate spatial data using analytically tractable posterior
distributions that obviate iterative algorithms. We discuss differences between
modeling the multivariate response itself as a spatial process and that of
modeling a latent process in a hierarchical model. We illustrate the
computational and inferential benefits of these models using simulation studies
and analysis of a Vegetation Index data set with spatially dependent
observations numbering in the millions.

dual doped graphene with different doping sequence were successfully prepared
using a controllable two steps facile thermal treatment method. The first

absorption properties of the dual doped graphene samples. Meanwhile, the second
doping step affected the doping sites and further had a repairing or damaging

two pronounced absorption peaks which intensity was decided by the order of the

This task is particularly relevant for supporting forensic investigation as
documents may contain criminal evidence. As an alternative to the laborious and
time-consuming manual process, several researchers have been investigating ways
to perform automatic digital reconstruction. A central problem in automatic
reconstruction of shredded documents is the pairwise compatibility evaluation
of the shreds, notably for binary text documents. In this context, deep
learning has enabled great progress for accurate reconstructions in the domain
of mechanically-shredded documents. A sensitive issue, however, is that current
deep model solutions require an inference whenever a pair of shreds has to be
evaluated. This work proposes a scalable deep learning approach for measuring
pairwise compatibility in which the number of inferences scales linearly
(rather than quadratically) with the number of shreds. Instead of predicting
compatibility directly, deep models are leveraged to asymmetrically project the
raw shred content onto a common metric space in which distance is proportional
to the compatibility. Experimental results show that our method has accuracy
comparable to the state-of-the-art with a speed-up of about 22 times for a test
instance with 505 shreds (20 mixed shredded-pages from different documents).

architecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger
Fabric to support parallel transactions and improve the blockchain's
throughput. However, this new architecture might render many invalid
transactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the
block formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data
processing, such as cryptography and consensus.
  In this work, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate
architecture, by reducing invalid transactions to improve the throughput of
blockchains. Our method is inspired by state-of-the-art optimistic concurrency
control techniques in modern database systems. In contrast to existing
blockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might abort
serializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained.
Specifically, unserializable transactions are aborted before ordering and the
remaining transactions are guaranteed to be serializable. For evaluation, we
implement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of
Hyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the
performance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two
of which are respectively implemented with one standard and one
state-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases. The results
demonstrate that FabricSharp achieves 25% higher throughput compared to the
other systems in nearly all experimental scenarios. Moreover, the
FastFabricSharp's improvement over FastFabric is up to 66%.

performing inference on a linguistically driven conditional random field (CRF)

The system describes robot actions by using robot observations; histories from

existing sequence-to-sequence models to this mapping: 1) it is hard to prepare
a large-scale dataset for any kind of robots and their environment, and 2)
there is a gap between the number of samples obtained from robot action
observations and generated word sequences of captions. We introduced
unsupervised segmentation based on K-means clustering to unify typical robot
observation patterns into a class. This method makes it possible for the
network to learn the relationship from a small amount of data. Moreover, we
utilized a chunking method based on byte-pair encoding (BPE) to fill in the gap

as in the best-known transforms due to Ailon and Liberty [SODA, 2008], and
Bamberger and Krahmer [arXiv, 2017]. Our algorithm is memory-optimal, and
outperforms existing algorithms in regimes when $n$ is sufficiently large and
the distortion parameter is sufficiently small. In particular, this confirms a

has been reached that satellites are preferentially aligned with major axes of
their host centrals. There are still some issues unsolved on this topic. In
this paper, we present studies on satellite spatial distribution. To fairly
compare with observations, we develop a novel galaxy finder and reconstruction
algorithm in hydrodynamical simulation, which is based on the projected mock
image, taking into account the full consideration of the point spread function,
pixel size, surface brightness limit, resolution and redshift dimming effects.
With galaxy samples constructed using such an algorithm, the satellite
alignment is examined by comparing with observational results. It is found that
the observational alignment can be reproduced for red galaxies, which dominate
the sample in this study, but not for blue galaxies. Satellites' radial
distribution is also investigated. It exhibits that outer satellites within
host halos show stronger alignment signal than satellites in the inner regions,
especially for red satellites, which is in contrast with previous studies. The
disagreement is mainly due to extra galaxies identified by our new galaxy
finder, which are mainly located in the inner region of host halos. Our study
illustrates that at lower redshift, the alignment strength becomes stronger,
while radial distribution curve becomes flatter. This suggests differences in
the evolution of the angular distribution between satellites residing in the
inner and outer halos, and implies that the post-infall evolution reduces the
original alignment signal, that the impact decreases for satellites with later
infall times.

local feature detectors and descriptors. First, the ability to estimate the
local shape (scale, orientation, etc.) of feature points is often neglected
during dense feature extraction, while the shape-awareness is crucial to
acquire stronger geometric invariance. Second, the localization accuracy of
detected keypoints is not sufficient to reliably recover camera geometry, which
has become the bottleneck in tasks such as 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we
present ASLFeat, with three light-weight yet effective modifications to
mitigate above issues. First, we resort to deformable convolutional networks to
densely estimate and apply local transformation. Second, we take advantage of
the inherent feature hierarchy to restore spatial resolution and low-level
details for accurate keypoint localization. Finally, we use a peakiness
measurement to relate feature responses and derive more indicative detection
scores. The effect of each modification is thoroughly studied, and the
evaluation is extensively conducted across a variety of practical scenarios.

it is called a {\em permutation rational function (PRf)}. Let $N_d(q)$ denote
the number of PPs of degree $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $N_{v,u}(q)$
denote the number of PRfs with a numerator of degree $v$ and a denominator of

of PPs. The number of monic degree 3 PRfs is known [11]. We develop efficient
computational techniques for $N_{v,u}(q)$, and use them to show $N_{4,3}(q) =

confidentiality of solicited data turns out to be the sine qua non, though it
was an arguably dispensable property in the centralized setting. To ensure the
""new"" requirement of data privacy, existing decentralized HITs use generic
zero-knowledge proof frameworks (e.g. SNARK), but scarcely perform well in
practice, due to the inherently expensive cost of generality.
  We present a practical decentralized protocol for HITs, which also achieves
the fairness between requesters and workers. At the core of our contributions,
we avoid the powerful yet highly-costly generic zk-proof tools and propose a
special-purpose scheme to prove the quality of encrypted data. By various
non-trivial statement reformations, proving the quality of encrypted data is
reduced to efficient verifiable decryption, thus making decentralized HITs
practical. Along the way, we rigorously define the ideal functionality of
decentralized HITs and then prove the security due to the ideal-real paradigm.
  We further instantiate our protocol to implement a system called Dragoon, an
instance of which is deployed atop Ethereum to facilitate an image annotation
task used by ImageNet. Our evaluations demonstrate its practicality: the
on-chain handling cost of Dragoon is even less than the handling fee of
Amazon's Mechanical Turk for the same ImageNet HIT.

contribution of each participant, which was named in honor of Lloyd Shapley.
Shapley value has been recently applied in data marketplaces for compensation
allocation based on their contribution to the models. Shapley value is the only
value division scheme used for compensation allocation that meets three
desirable criteria: group rationality, fairness, and additivity. In cooperative
game theory, the marginal contribution of each contributor to each coalition is
a nonnegative value. However, in machine learning model training, the marginal
contribution of each contributor (data tuple) to each coalition (a set of data
tuples) can be a negative value, i.e., the accuracy of the model trained by a
dataset with an additional data tuple can be lower than the accuracy of the
model trained by the dataset only.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to handle the negative
marginal contribution when computing Shapley value. We explore three
philosophies: 1) taking the original value (Original Shapley Value); 2) taking
the larger of the original value and zero (Zero Shapley Value); and 3) taking
the absolute value of the original value (Absolute Shapley Value). Experiments
on Iris dataset demonstrate that the definition of Absolute Shapley Value
significantly outperforms the other two definitions in terms of evaluating data
importance (the contribution of each data tuple to the trained model).

can survive to lower redshifts ($z \sim 2$) than previously thought, due to gas
at mean density being heated to $T \sim 3 \times 10^4$ K by reionization, which
is inhomogeneous, and shocks. Given the high sensitivities of upcoming
Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys, this effect will be a novel broadband systematic for
cosmological application. From the astrophysical point of view, however, the
imprint of inhomogeneous reionization can shed light on the EOR and cosmic
dawn. We utilize a hybrid method -- which includes two different simulation
codes capable of handling the huge dynamical range -- to show the impact of
patchy reionization on the Ly$\alpha$ forest and its dependence on different
astrophysical scenarios. We found statistically significant deviations in the
1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum at $k = 0.14$ cMpc$^{-1}$ that range from $\sim
1\%$ at $z = 2$ up to almost $\sim 20\%$ at $z = 4$. The deviations in the 3D
Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum, at the same wavenumber, are large and range from a
few per cent at $z = 2$ up to $\sim 50\%$ at $z = 4$, although these deviations
ignore the effect of He II reionization and AGN feedback at $z<4$. By
exploiting different $k$-dependence of power spectrum among various
astrophysical scenarios, the effect of patchy reionization on the Ly$\alpha$
forest power spectrum can open a new window into cosmic reionization and
possibly cosmic dawn.

might have stronger radiative feedback to change torus structures and/or their
tori might have higher metallicities. Our conclusions do not depend on the
choice of galaxy template libraries. However, since the predicted polycyclic

cautions should be taken on deriving galaxy FIR contribution from PAH fluxes.

equations with the Janhunen source term. First, the second-order accurate
well-balanced semi-discrete entropy conservative (EC) schemes are constructed,
satisfying the entropy identity for the given convex entropy function and
preserving the steady states of the lake at rest (with zero magnetic field).
The key is to match both discretizations for the fluxes and the non-flat river
bed bottom and Janhunen source terms, and to find the affordable EC fluxes of
the second-order EC schemes. Next, by using the second-order EC schemes as
building block, high-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete EC schemes are
proposed. Then, the high-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete ES schemes
%satisfying the entropy inequality are derived by adding a suitable dissipation
term to the EC scheme with the WENO reconstruction of the scaled entropy
variables in order to suppress the numerical oscillations of the EC schemes.
After that, the semi-discrete schemes are integrated in time by using the
high-order strong stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to obtain
the fully-discrete high-order well-balanced schemes. The ES property of the
Lax-Friedrichs flux is also proved and then the positivity-preserving ES
schemes are studied by using the positivity-preserving flux limiter. Finally,
extensive numerical tests are conducted to validate the accuracy, the
well-balanced, ES and positivity-preserving properties, and the ability to

per block and 2 groups of uncorrelated diagonal neighbors together with groups
of mutually correlated coefficients groups of 6 coefficients per blocs and 8

embedding scheme can be designed using only 8 disjoint lattices. The cost map
for each lattice is updated firstly by using an implicit underlying Gaussian
distribution with a variance directly computed from the embedding costs, and
secondly by deriving conditional distributions from multivariate distributions.
The covariance matrix of these distributions takes into account both the

the region-to-region reproductive number---i.e. the average number of other

proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length
of the time-delay before region-level control measures are imposed. Thus,
reductions in travel and the speed with which regions take action play decisive
roles in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on
average, infected regions (including those that become re-infected in the
future) impose social distancing measures shortly after active spreading begins
within them, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in

Elimination will in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social
distancing measures have been lifted from most of the regions.

anomaly detection by examining sensor stream statistics. AEGIS utilizes Kernel
Density Estimation (KDE)-based non-parametric density estimation to generate a
real-time statistical model of the sensor data stream. The likelihood estimate
of the sensor data point can be obtained based on the generated statistical
model to detect outliers. We present CMOS Gilbert Gaussian cell-based design to
realize Gaussian kernels for KDE. For outlier detection, the decision boundary
is defined in terms of kernel standard deviation ($\sigma_{Kernel}$) and
likelihood threshold ($P_{Thres}$). We adopt a sliding window to update the
detection model in real-time. We use time-series dataset provided from Yahoo to
benchmark the performance of AEGIS. A f1-score higher than 0.87 is achieved by
optimizing parameters such as length of the sliding window and decision
thresholds which are programmable in AEGIS. Discussed architecture is designed
using 45nm technology node and our approach on average consumes $\sim$75 $\mu$W

introduce a new type of inversion symmetry-protected topological

the defective edge states are protected by (generalized) chiral symmetry and
thus the (singular) defective edge states are unstable against the perturbation
breaking the chiral symmetry. In addition, the results are generalized to
nonHermitian topological insulators with inversion symmetry in higher

attenuate pressure fluctuations in turbulent supersonic flow over a rectangular
cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of 6 at a Mach number of 1.4 and a Reynolds
number based on cavity depth of 10,000. Large-eddy simulations (LES) and
dynamic modal decomposition (DMD) of the supersonic cavity flow reveal the
dominance of two-dimensional Rossiter modes II and IV. These predominantly
two-dimensional vortical structures generate high-amplitude unsteadiness over
the cavity through trailing-edge impingement and create oblique shock waves by
obstructing the freestream. To disrupt the undesired formation of vortical
structures, we introduce three-dimensional unsteady forcing along the cavity
leading edge to generate streamwise vortical structures. Resolvent analysis
with respect to the time-averaged base flow is leveraged to determine the
optimal combination of forcing frequency and spanwise wavenumber. Instead of
selecting the most amplified resolvent forcing modes, we seek the combination
of control parameters that yields sustained amplification of the primary
resolvent-based kinetic energy distribution over the entire length of the
cavity. The sustained amplification is critical to ensure that the selected
forcing input remains effective to prevent the formation of the large spanwise
vortices. This resolvent-analysis-based flow control guideline is validated
with a number of companion LES of the controlled cavity flows. The optimal
control setup is verified to be the most effective in reducing the pressure
root-mean-square level up to 52% along the aft and bottom cavity walls compared
to the baseline cavity flow. The present flow control guideline derived from

The proposed framework enables APs to evaluate observed rewards compositionally
for contending APs, allowing both robustness against reward fluctuation due to
neighboring APs' varying channels and assessment of even unexplored channels.
To realize this framework, we propose contention-driven feature extraction
(CDFE), which extracts the adjacency relation among APs under contention and
forms the basis for expressing reward functions in the disentangled form, that
is, a linear combination of parameters associated with neighboring APs under
contention). This allows the CMAB to be leveraged with joint a linear upper
confidence bound (JLinUCB) exploration and to delve into the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. Moreover, we address the problem of non-convergence --
the channel exploration cycle -- by proposing a penalized JLinUCB (P-JLinUCB)
based on the key idea of introducing a discount parameter to the reward for
exploiting a different channel before and after the learning round. Numerical
evaluations confirm that the proposed method allows APs to assess the channel
quality robustly against reward fluctuations by CDFE and achieves better
convergence properties by P-JLinUCB.

spreading of EE over the entire system. Evaluating the propagation speed of

unlike neutral excitons, the flow of trions can generate a net detectable
charge current. Trions under favourable doping conditions can be created in a
coherent manner using resonant excitation. In this work, we exploit these
properties to demonstrate a gate controlled trion switch in a few-layer
graphene/monolayer WS2/monolayer graphene vertical heterojunction. By using a
high resolution spectral scan through a temperature controlled variation of the
bandgap of the WS2 sandwich layer, we obtain a gate voltage dependent vertical
photocurrent strongly relying on the spectral position of the excitation, and
the photocurrent maximizes when the excitation energy is resonant with the
trion peak position. Further, the resonant photocurrent thus generated can be
effectively controlled by a back gate voltage applied through the incomplete
screening of the bottom monolayer graphene, and the photocurrent strongly
correlates with the gate dependent trion intensity, while the non-resonant
photocurrent exhibits only a weak gate dependence -unambiguously proving a
trion driven photocurrent generation under resonance. We estimate a sub-100 fs
switching time of the device. The findings are useful towards demonstration of
ultra-fast excitonic devices in layered materials.

conjecture of Soergel and Lunts in the setting of Koszul duality and Langlands'
philosophy, postulates that the equivariant derived category of bounded
complexes with constructible equivariant cohomology sheaves on $\text{X}$ is
equivalent to a full subcategory of the derived category of modules over a
graded ring defined as a suitable graded $Ext$. Only special cases of this
conjecture have been proven so far. {\it The purpose of this paper is to
provide a proof of this conjecture for all projective toroidal imbeddings of
complex reductive groups.} In fact, we show that the methods used by Lunts for
a proof in the case of toric varieties can be extended with suitable
modifications to handle the toroidal imbedding case. {\it Since every
equivariant imbedding of a complex reductive group is dominated by a toroidal
imbedding, the class of varieties for which our proof applies is quite large.}

for this conjecture to be true and that half of these vanish when the odd

vanish. This last vanishing condition had been proven to be true in many cases

phenomena in biological processes at meso-scopic scales. Strong inter-ciliary
couplings modify the natural beating frequencies, $\omega$, of individual cilia
to produce a collective motion that moves around a group frequency $\omega_m$.
Here we study the thermodynamic cost of synchronizing cilia arrays by mapping
their dynamics onto a generic phase oscillator model. The model suggests that
upon synchronization the mean heat dissipation rate is decomposed into two
contributions, dissipation from each cilium's own natural driving force and
dissipation arising from the interaction with other cilia, the latter of which
can be interpreted as the one produced by a potential with a time-dependent
protocol in the framework of our model. The spontaneous phase-synchronization
of beating dynamics of cilia induced by strong inter-ciliary coupling is always
accompanied with a significant reduction of dissipation for the cilia
population, suggesting that organisms as a whole expend less energy by
attaining a temporal order. At the level of individual cilia, however, a
population of cilia with $|\omega|< \omega_m$ expend more amount of energy upon
synchronization.

total-variation (TV) regularization (in the sense of measures) on the second

knots. While there are efficient algorithms for determining such adaptive
splines, the difficulty with TV regularization is that the solution is
generally non-unique, an aspect that is often ignored in practice. In this
paper, we present a systematic analysis that results in a complete description
of the solution set with a clear distinction between the cases where the
solution is unique and those, much more frequent, where it is not. For the
latter scenario, we identify the sparsest solutions, i.e., those with the
minimum number of knots, and we derive a formula to compute the minimum number
of knots based solely on the data points. To achieve this, we first consider
the problem of exact interpolation which leads to an easier theoretical
analysis. Next, we relax the exact interpolation requirement to a regression
setting, and we consider a penalized optimization problem with a strictly
convex data-fidelity cost function. We show that the underlying penalized
problem can be reformulated as a constrained problem, and thus that all our
previous results still apply. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose a
simple and fast two-step algorithm, agnostic to uniqueness, to reach a sparsest

non-convex likelihood functions with latent variables. Many authors modified
its simple design to fit more specific situations. For instance, the
Expectation (E) step has been replaced by Monte Carlo (MC), Markov Chain Monte
Carlo or tempered approximations, etc. Most of the well-studied approximations
belong to the stochastic class. By comparison, the literature is lacking when
it comes to deterministic approximations. In this paper, we introduce a
theoretical framework, with state-of-the-art convergence guarantees, for any
deterministic approximation of the E step. We analyse theoretically and
empirically several approximations that fit into this framework. First, for
intractable E-steps, we introduce a deterministic version of MC-EM using
Riemann sums. A straightforward method, not requiring any hyper-parameter
fine-tuning, useful when the low dimensionality does not warrant a MC-EM. Then,
we consider the tempered approximation, borrowed from the Simulated Annealing
literature and used to escape local extrema. We prove that the tempered EM
verifies the convergence guarantees for a wider range of temperature profiles
than previously considered. We showcase empirically how new non-trivial
profiles can more successfully escape adversarial initialisations. Finally, we
combine the Riemann and tempered approximations into a method that accomplishes
both their purposes.

viability of such an oscillating signal in the same data using Bayesian and
information theoretical criterion, to complement the frequentist analysis in
P19. We fit this data to three different parametrizations (an offset Newtonian,
Yukawa, and an oscillating model), and assess the significance of the
oscillating model using AIC, BIC, WAIC, and Bayes factor. All these techniques
provide decisive evidence for the oscillating model compared to the Newtonian
model, provided the phase is fixed to the same value as in P19. If the phase is
allowed to vary, then significance from BIC, WAIC, and Bayes based tests
reduces to strong evidence, whereas only AIC still shows decisive evidence. Our

of V426 Sge as a classical symbiotic star, determine the photometric ephemeris
of the light minima, and suggest the path from its 1968 symbiotic nova outburst
to the following 2018 Z And-type outburst. We re-constructed an historical
light curve (LC) of V426 Sge from approximately the year 1900, and used
original low- and high-resolution spectroscopy complemented with Swift-XRT and
UVOT, optical UBVRcIc and near-infrared JHKL photometry obtained during the
2018 outburst and the following quiescence. The historical LC reveals no
symbiotic-like activity from 1900 to 1967. In 1968, V426 Sge experienced a
symbiotic nova outburst that ceased around 1990. From approximately 1972, a
wave-like orbitally related variation with a period of $493.4\pm 0.7$ days
developed in the LC. This was interrupted by a Z And-type outburst from the
beginning of August 2018 to the middle of February 2019. At the maximum of the
2018 outburst, the burning white dwarf (WD) increased its temperature to
$>2\times 10^5$ K, generated a luminosity of $\sim 7\times 10^{37}(d/3.3kpc)^2$
erg/s, and blew a wind at the rate of $\sim 3\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr.
The donor is a normal M4-5 III giant and the accretor is a low-mass $\sim$0.5
M$_{\odot}$ WD. During the transition from the symbiotic nova outburst to the
quiescent phase, a pronounced sinusoidal variation along the orbit develops in
the LC of most symbiotic novae. The following eventual outburst is of Z
And-type, when the accretion by the WD temporarily exceeds the upper limit of
the stable burning. At this point the system becomes a classical symbiotic
star.

Many neural networks have been designed for this task. However, they often

a guided convolutional layer to recover dense depth from sparse and irregular

the maximum size of a set $S$ of edges such that every pair of edges in $S$ has
distance at most $2$ in the line graph of $G$. As a relaxation of the renowned
Erd\H{o}s--Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il conjecture regarding the strong chromatic index,
Faudree et al. suggested investigating the strong clique number, and
conjectured a quadratic upper bound in terms of the maximum degree.
  Recently, Cames van Batenburg, Kang, and Pirot conjectured a linear upper
bound in terms of the maximum degree for graphs without even cycles. Namely, if
$G$ is a $C_{2k}$-free graph, then $\omega_S(G)\leq
(2k-1)\Delta(G)-{2k-1\choose 2}$, and if $G$ is a $C_{2k}$-free bipartite
graph, then $\omega_S(G)\leq k\Delta(G)-(k-1)$. We prove the second conjecture
in a stronger form, by showing that forbidding all odd cycles is not necessary.
To be precise, we show that a $\{C_5, C_{2k}\}$-free graph $G$ with
$\Delta(G)\ge 1$ satisfies $\omega_S(G)\leq k\Delta(G)-(k-1)$, when either
$k\geq 4$ or $k\in \{2,3\}$ and $G$ is also $C_3$-free. Regarding the first
conjecture, we prove an upper bound that is off by the constant term. Namely,
for $k\geq 3$, we prove that a $C_{2k}$-free graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)\ge 1$
satisfies $\omega_S(G)\leq (2k-1)\Delta(G)+(2k-1)^2$. This improves some

methods have been developed for segmentation of BUS image and show some
advantages compared with conventional region-, model-, and traditional
learning-based methods. However, previous deep learning methods typically use
skip-connection to concatenate the encoder and decoder, which might not make
full fusion of coarse-to-fine features from encoder and decoder. Since the
structure and edge of lesion in BUS image are common blurred, these would make
it difficult to learn the discriminant information of structure and edge, and
reduce the performance. To this end, we propose and evaluate a coarse-to-fine
fusion convolutional network (CF2-Net) based on a novel feature integration
strategy (forming an 'E'-like type) for BUS image segmentation. To enhance
contour and provide structural information, we concatenate a super-pixel image
and the original image as the input of CF2-Net. Meanwhile, to highlight the
differences in the lesion regions with variable sizes and relieve the imbalance
issue, we further design a weighted-balanced loss function to train the CF2-Net
effectively. The proposed CF2-Net was evaluated on an open dataset by using
four-fold cross validation. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the

engineering. A simple and efficient programming language could accelerate
applications of machine learning in various fields. Currently, the programming
languages most commonly used to develop machine learning algorithms include
Python, MATLAB, and C/C ++. However, none of these languages well balance both
efficiency and simplicity. The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and
open-source programming language that was originally designed for
high-performance computing, which can well balance the efficiency and
simplicity. This paper summarizes the related research work and developments in
the application of the Julia language in machine learning. It first surveys the
popular machine learning algorithms that are developed in the Julia language.
Then, it investigates applications of the machine learning algorithms
implemented with the Julia language. Finally, it discusses the open issues and
the potential future directions that arise in the use of the Julia language in
machine learning.

distortion and assume the shape of a pear. This phenomenon is important for
measurements of electric-dipole moments of atoms, which would indicate CP
violation and hence probe physics beyond the standard model of particle
physics. Isotopes of both radon and radium have been identified as candidates
for such measurements. Here, we have observed the low-lying quantum states in
$^{224}$Rn and $^{226}$Rn by accelerating beams of these radioactive nuclei. We
report here additional states not assigned in our 2019 publication. We show
that radon isotopes undergo octupole vibrations but do not possess static
pear-shapes in their ground states. We conclude that radon atoms provide less
favourable conditions for the enhancement of a measurable atomic

the high-order neighbors in social networks to improve the performance of item

the model learning with social relations, we instead propose to directly factor
social relations in the predictive model, aiming at learning better user

neighbors increase dramatically with the order size, we propose to recursively
""propagate"" embeddings along the social network, effectively injecting the
influence of high-order neighbors into user representation. We conduct
experiments on two real datasets of Yelp and Douban to verify our High-Order

semiconductors is one of the grand challenges of spintronics. This process is
commonly achieved via a ferromagnetic tunnel barrier where non-linear electric
transport occurs. In this work, we demonstrate that non-linearity may lead to a
spin-to-charge conversion efficiency larger than 10 times the spin polarization
of the tunnel barrier when the latter is under bias of a few mV. We identify
the underlying mechanisms responsible for this remarkably efficient spin
detection as the tunnel barrier deformation and the conduction band shift
resulting from a change of applied voltage. In addition, we derive an
approximate analytical expression for the detector spin sensitivity
$P_{\textrm{det}}(V)$. Calculations performed for different barrier shapes show
that this enhancement is present in oxide barriers as well as in Schottky
tunnel barriers even if the dominant mechanisms differs with the barrier type.
Moreover, although the spin signal is reduced at high temperatures, it remains
superior to the value predicted by the linear model. Our findings shed light
into the interpretation and understanding of electrical spin detection
experiments and open new paths to optimize the performance of spin transport

Importantly, we take one step further by dynamically learning the mask head of

Specifically, the mask branch is decoupled into a mask kernel branch and mask
feature branch, which are responsible for learning the convolution kernel and
the convolved features respectively. Moreover, we propose Matrix NMS (non

NMS of masks. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in

distinguished by their effective degrees of freedom. All given spectra are
characterized by a universal mean temperature parameter $\sim$ 200 MeV which
agrees with the Hagedorn temperature. Our analysis suggests that QCD scattering

Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is
their ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, a
well established measure of RNNs long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus
formal understanding of the effect of depth on their ability to correlate data
throughout time is limited. Specifically, existing depth efficiency results on
convolutional networks do not suffice in order to account for the success of
deep RNNs on data of varying lengths. In order to address this, we introduce a
measure of the network's ability to support information flow across time,
referred to as the Start-End separation rank, which reflects the distance of
the function realized by the recurrent network from modeling no dependency
between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep
recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are combinatorially
higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Thus, we establish
that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent
networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of
quantifying this key attribute. We empirically demonstrate the discussed
phenomena on common RNNs through extensive experimental evaluation using the
optimization technique of restricting the hidden-to-hidden matrix to being
orthogonal. Finally, we employ the tool of quantum Tensor Networks to gain
additional graphic insights regarding the complexity brought forth by depth in
recurrent networks.

making is the difficulty of assigning a level of confidence to model

deep Bayesian neural network suffers from lack of expressiveness, and more
expressive models such as deep kernel learning, which is an extension of sparse
Gaussian process, captures only the uncertainty from the higher level latent
space. Therefore, the deep learning model under it lacks interpretability and
ignores uncertainty from the raw data. In this paper, we merge features of the
deep Bayesian learning framework with deep kernel learning to leverage the
strengths of both methods for more comprehensive uncertainty estimation.
Through a series of experiments on predicting the first incidence of heart
failure, diabetes and depression applied to large-scale electronic medical
records, we demonstrate that our method is better at capturing uncertainty than
both Gaussian processes and deep Bayesian neural networks in terms of
indicating data insufficiency and distinguishing true positive and false
positive predictions, with a comparable generalisation performance.
Furthermore, by assessing the accuracy and area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve over the predictive probability, we show that our method
is less susceptible to making overconfident predictions, especially for the
minority class in imbalanced datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how uncertainty
information derived by the model can inform risk factor analysis towards model
interpretability.

differential equations (PDEs) play a critical role in delivering efficient,
dimension-independent convergence for both Newton solution of deterministic
inverse problems, as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of posteriors in
the Bayesian setting. These methods require the ability to repeatedly perform
such operations on the Hessian as multiplication with arbitrary vectors,
solving linear systems, inversion, and (inverse) square root. Unfortunately,
the Hessian is a (formally) dense, implicitly-defined operator that is
intractable to form explicitly for practical inverse problems, requiring as
many PDE solves as inversion parameters. Low rank approximations are effective
when the data contain limited information about the parameters, but become
prohibitive as the data become more informative. However, the Hessians for many
inverse problems arising in practical applications can be well approximated by
matrices that have hierarchically low rank structure. Hierarchical matrix
representations promise to overcome the high complexity of dense
representations and provide effective data structures and matrix operations
that have only log-linear complexity. In this work, we describe algorithms for
constructing and updating hierarchical matrix approximations of Hessians, and
illustrate them on a number of representative inverse problems involving
time-dependent diffusion, advection-dominated transport, frequency domain
acoustic wave propagation, and low frequency Maxwell equations, demonstrating
up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to globally low rank
approximations.

checkerboards, or markers and require high user involvement and technical

methods that exploit geometric patterns of a physical structure. However,
current SoA approaches are bounded by restrictions in the placement and the

correspondence estimation to achieve more robust and flexible multi-sensor
spatial alignment. In particular, we incorporate geometric constraints in an
end-to-end manner into a typical segmentation based model and bridge the
intermediate dense classification task with the targeted pose estimation one.
This is accomplished by a soft, differentiable procrustes analysis that
regularizes the segmentation and achieves higher extrinsic calibration
performance in expanded sensor placement configurations, while being
unrestricted by the number of sensors of the volumetric capture system. Our
model is experimentally shown to achieve similar results with marker-based
methods and outperform the markerless ones, while also being robust to the pose

the standard approach to tackle solid-state electronic problems.
  These rely on distributed pseudopotential tables that were built from
all-electron atomic calculations using few popular semi-local
exchange-correlation functionals, while pseudopotentials based on more modern
functionals, like meta-GGA and hybrid functionals, or for many-body methods,
such as $GW$, are often not available.
  Because of this, employing pseudopotentials created with inconsistent
exchange-correlation functionals has become a common practice.
  Our aim is to quantify systematically the error in the determination of the
electronic band gap when cross-functional pseudopotential calculations are
performed. To this end we compare band gaps obtained with norm-conserving
pseudopotentials or the projector-augmented wave method with all-electron
calculations for a large dataset of 473 solids. We focus in particular on
density functionals that were designed specifically for band-gap calculations.
  On average, the absolute error is about 0.1 eV, yielding absolute relative
errors in the 5-10\% range. Considering that typical errors stemming from the
choice of the functional are usually larger, we conclude that the effect of
choosing an inconsistent pseudopotential is rather harmless for most
applications.
  However, we find specific cases where absolute errors can be larger than 1
eV, or others where relative errors can amount to a large fraction of the band
gap.

to compute the optimal policies for a multi-agent system with $N$ cooperative
agents where each agent privately observes it's own private type and publicly
observes each others' actions. The goal is to maximize their collective reward.
The problem belongs to the broad class of decentralized control problems with
partial information. We use the common agent approach wherein some fictitious
common agent picks the best policy based on a belief on the current states of
the agents. These beliefs are updated individually for each agent from their
current belief and action histories. Belief state updates without the knowledge
of system dynamics is a challenge. In this paper, we employ particle filters
called the bootstrap filter distributively across agents to update the belief.
We provide a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method for this multi-agent
partially observable Markov decision processes using the particle filter and
sampled trajectories to estimate the optimal policies for the agents. We
showcase our results with the help of a smartgrid application where the users
strive to reduce collective cost of power for all the agents in the grid.
Finally, we compare the performances for model and model-free implementation of
the RL algorithm establishing the effectiveness of particle filter (pf) method.

choice of the time discretisation step. Second, we derive closed-form
expressions for the conditional and asymptotic means and variances of all

splittings, and the log-ODE scheme the classical ODE method. The mean and
variance biases of the log-ODE scheme are very small for many relevant
parameter settings. However, in some situations the two derived Strang
splittings may be a better alternative, one of them requiring considerably less

the growth time is extracted from the evolved kinetic energy. The results for
the new rotation laws highlight similarities with the commonly considered

with the star (i.e. whenever there is a point where the mode's pattern speed
matches the bulk angular velocity) and grows faster deep inside the co-rotation
region. However, the new profiles add features, like an additional co-rotation
point to the problem, which affect the onset of instability. The rotation laws
influence more drastically the oscillation frequencies of the l=m=2 f-mode in
fast rotating models, but affect the instability growth time at any rotation

prepared by solid state reaction method and their magnetic properties have been
investigated. Rietveld refinement of X-ray powder diffraction patterns showed
that all samples are single phase and crystallized with the rhombohedral
structure in the R-3c space group. A second order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic
phase transition was observed for all materials. The Griffiths phase (GP),
identified from the temperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility, was
suppressed by increasing magnetic field and showed a significant dependence on
A-site chemical substitution. The critical behaviour of the compounds was
investigated near to their Curie temperatures, using intrinsic magnetic field
data. The critical exponents (\b{eta}, {\gamma} and {\delta}) are close to the
mean-field approximation values for all three compounds. The observed
mean-field like behaviour is a consequence of the GP and the formation of
ferromagnetic clusters. Long-range ferromagnetic order is established as the
result of long-range interactions between ferromagnetic clusters. The
magnetocaloric effect was studied in terms of the isothermal entropy change.
Our study shows that the material with the lowest chemical substitution (x =
0.3) has the highest potential (among the three compounds) as magnetic
refrigerant, owing to its higher relative cooling power (258 J/kg at 5 T field)
and a magnetic phase transition near room temperature.

pyramid. Different from existing methods, our Laplacian is data-dependent and
we introduce an attention diagonal matrix to learn a better distance metric. It
gets rid of projecting and re-projecting processes, which makes our proposed
method a light-weight module that can be easily plugged into current computer
vision architectures. More importantly, performing graph reasoning directly in
the feature space retains spatial relationships and makes spatial pyramid
possible to explore multiple long-range contextual patterns from different

electromagnetic (EM) scattering by arbitrarily shaped non-magnetic

such particles can exhibit a very strong isotropic magnetic response, resulting
from the coupling of the incident wave with the circular displacement currents
of the EM fields. The main aim of this work is to mathematically illustrate
this phenomenon. We shall first introduce the EM scattering resolvent and the
concept of dielectric subwavelength resonances. Then we derive the a priori
estimates for the subwavelength resonances and the associated resonant modes.
We also show the existence of resonances and obtain their asymptotic expansions
in terms of the small particle size and the high contrast parameter. After
that, we investigate the enhancement of the scattering amplitude and the cross
sections when the resonances occur. In doing so, we develop a novel multipole
radiation framework that directly separates the electric and magnetic multipole
moments and allows us to clearly see their orders of magnitude and blow--up
rates. We prove that at the dielectric subwavelength resonant frequencies, the
nanoparticles with high refractive indices behave like the sum of the electric
dipole and the resonant magnetic dipole. Some explicit calculations and
numerical experiments are also provided to validate our general results and

adaptive optics (AO) system due to the finite time between measuring the
wavefront phase and applying the phase correction. One approach to mitigating
the servo-lag error is predictive control. We aim to estimate and understand
the potential on-sky performance that linear data-driven prediction would
provide for VLT/SPHERE under various turbulence conditions. We used a linear
minimum mean square error predictor and applied it to 27 different AO telemetry
data sets from VLT/SPHERE taken over many nights under various turbulence
conditions. We evaluated the performance of the predictor using residual
wavefront phase variance as a performance metric. We show that prediction
always results in a reduction in the temporal wavefront phase variance compared
to the current VLT/SPHERE AO performance. We find an average improvement factor
of 5.1 in phase variance for prediction compared to the VLT/SPHERE residuals.
When comparing to an idealised VLT/SPHERE, we find an improvement factor of
2.0. Under our 27 different cases, we find the predictor results in a smaller
spread of the residual temporal phase variance. Finally, we show there is no
benefit to including spatial information in the predictor in contrast to what
might have been expected from the frozen flow hypothesis. A purely temporal
predictor is best suited for AO on VLT/SPHERE.

they can form any effect monoid. Hence, there are quite exotic effectuses
resulting from more pathological effect monoids.
  In this paper we introduce sigma-effectuses, where certain countable sums of

separate the morphisms we find that in the 0,1 case the category must embed
into the category of sets and partial functions (and hence the category of
Boolean algebras), showing that it implements a deterministic model, while in
the [0,1] case we find it embeds into the category of Banach order-unit spaces

gas in a synthetically driven one-dimensional optical lattice. In particular,
we examine the bosonic analogue of electronic higher harmonic generation in a
strong time-dependent synthetic vector potential manifesting itself as the
synthetic electric field. We show that the vector potential can generate
reasonably high harmonics in the insulating regime, while the superfluid regime
exhibits only a few harmonics. In the insulating regime, the number of
harmonics increases with the increase in the strength of the vector potential.
This originates primarily due to the field-driven resonant and non-resonant
excitations in the neutral Mott state and their recombination with the ground
state. If the repulsive interaction between two atoms ($U$) is close to the
strength of the gauge potential ($A_0$), the resonant quasiparticle-quasihole
pairs on nearest-neighbor sites, namely dipole states are found to a play a
dominant role in the generating higher harmonics. However, in the strong-field
limit $A_0\gg U$, the nonresonant states where quasiparticle-quasihole pairs
are not on nearest-neighbor sites give rise to higher harmonics.

This is most important
in cases where the initial data is in short supply. This is, for existing

distribution is impossible. For natural language, sentence editing offers a
solution - relying on small but meaningful changes to the original ones.
Learning which changes are meaningful also requires large amounts of training
data. We thus aim to learn this in a source domain where data is abundant and
apply it in a different, target domain, where data is scarce - cross-domain
augmentation.
  We create the Edit-transformer, a Transformer-based sentence editor that is
significantly faster than the state of the art and also works cross-domain. We
argue that, due to its structure, the Edit-transformer is better suited for
cross-domain environments than its edit-based predecessors. We show this
performance gap on the Yelp-Wikipedia domain pairs. Finally, we show that due
to this cross-domain performance advantage, the Edit-transformer leads to
meaningful performance gains in several downstream tasks.

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to the concentration data, and computing a
curvature measure from the pairwise log-ratios of these fits. The higher the
curvature, the more likely one or both elements of the pair indicate local
mineralization. This method is applied on two geochemical data sets which have

to test the technique for its ability to identify pathfinder elements to detect

hydrodynamic escape. However, due to strong pressures, stellar winds can
confine planetary atmospheres, reducing their escape. Here, we investigate
under which conditions atmospheric escape of close-in giants could be confined
by the large pressure of their host star's winds. For that, we simulate escape
in planets at a range of orbital distances ([0.04, 0.14] au), planetary
gravities ([36%, 87%] of Jupiter's gravity), and ages ([1, 6.9] Gyr). For each
of these simulations, we calculate the ram pressure of these escaping
atmospheres and compare them to the expected stellar wind external pressure to
determine whether a given atmosphere is confined or not. We show that, although
younger close-in giants should experience higher levels of atmospheric escape,
due to higher stellar irradiation, stellar winds are also stronger at young
ages, potentially reducing escape of young exoplanets. Regardless of the age,
we also find that there is always a region in our parameter space where
atmospheric escape is confined, preferably occurring at higher planetary
gravities and orbital distances. We investigate confinement of some known
exoplanets and find that the atmosphere of several of them, including pi Men c,
should be confined by the winds of their host stars, thus potentially
preventing escape in highly irradiated planets. Thus, the lack of hydrogen
escape recently reported for pi Men c could be caused by the stellar wind.

foregrounds by minimizing the distance of global prototypes with the same
category but from different domains. Thanks to this coarse-to-fine feature
adaptation, domain knowledge in foreground regions can be effectively

limitations in terms of scalability and practical implementation. Optimal
decentralized controllers, on the other hand, are difficult to find. In this
paper, we propose a framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn
decentralized controllers from data. While GNNs are naturally distributed
architectures, making them perfectly suited for the task, we adapt them to
handle delayed communications as well. Furthermore, they are equivariant and
stable, leading to good scalability and transferability properties. The problem
of flocking is explored to illustrate the potential of GNNs in learning
decentralized controllers.

  from Motion",,,,,"cs.CV math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fitting a matrix of a given rank to data in a least squares sense can be done
very effectively using 2nd order methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt by
explicitly optimizing over a bilinear parameterization of the matrix. In
contrast, when applying more general singular value penalties, such as weighted
nuclear norm priors, direct optimization over the elements of the matrix is
typically used. Due to non-differentiability of the resulting objective
function, first order sub-gradient or splitting methods are predominantly used.
While these offer rapid iterations it is well known that they become inefficent
near the minimum due to zig-zagging and in practice one is therefore often
forced to settle for an approximate solution.
  In this paper we show that more accurate results can in many cases be
achieved with 2nd order methods. Our main result shows how to construct
bilinear formulations, for a general class of regularizers including weighted
nuclear norm penalties, that are provably equivalent to the original problems.
With these formulations the regularizing function becomes twice differentiable
and 2nd order methods can be applied. We show experimentally, on a number of
structure from motion problems, that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

subject to the constraints of conservation of angular momentum and constant

lowest energy state accessible to the system corresponds to equal mass stars on
a circular orbit, where the stellar spin angular velocities are both
synchronized and aligned with the orbit. These features are roughly consistent
with observed properties of close binary systems. We also find the conditions
required for this minimum energy state to exist: [1] The total angular momentum
must exceed a critical value, [2] the orbital angular momentum must be three

topological phases of matter. This article reports the experimental realization
of the time-reversal invariant helical edge-modes in bilayer graphene/monolayer
WSe$_2$-based heterostructures -- a phase generally considered as a precursor
to the field of generic topological insulators. Our observation of this elusive
phase depended crucially on our ability to create mesoscopic devices comprising
both a moir\'e superlattice potential and strong spin-orbit coupling; this
resulted in materials whose electronic band structure could be tuned from
trivial to topological by an external displacement field. We find that the
topological phase is characterized by a bulk bandgap and by helical edge-modes
with electrical conductance quantized exactly to $2e^2/h$ in zero external
magnetic field. We put the helical edge-modes on firm grounds through
supporting experiments, including the verification of predictions of the
Landauer-B$\mathrm{\ddot{u}}$ttiker model for quantum transport in
multi-terminal mesoscopic devices. Our non-local transport properties
measurements show that the helical edge-modes are dissipationless and
equilibrate at the contact probes. We achieved the tunability of the different
topological phases with electric and magnetic fields, which allowed us to
achieve topological phase transitions between trivial and multiple, distinct
topological phases. We also present results of a theoretical study of a
realistic model which, in addition to replicating our experimental results,
explains the origin of the topological insulating bulk and helical edge-modes.
Our experimental and theoretical results establish a viable route to realizing

as the two isospin amplitudes of non-leptonic kaon decays for $K\to

addressed: Firstly, robustness, that is, the reliable performance of
state-of-the-art methods when run on challenging images (e.g. in the presence
of blood, smoke or motion artifacts). Secondly, generalization; algorithms
trained for a specific intervention in a specific hospital should generalize to
other interventions or institutions.

Robust Medical Instrument Segmentation (ROBUST-MIS) challenge as an
international benchmarking competition with a specific focus on the robustness

performed in three different stages with an increasing domain gap between the

that algorithm performance degrades with an increasing domain gap. While the

proofs-of-concept, certified products are failing to breakthrough to the
clinic. AI in healthcare is a multi-party process with deep knowledge required
in multiple individual domains. The lack of understanding of the specific
challenges in the domain is, therefore, the major contributor to the failure to
deliver on the big promises. Thus, we present a decision perspective framework,
for the development of AI-driven biomedical products, from conception to market
launch. Our framework highlights the risks, objectives and key results which
are typically required to proceed through a three-phase process to the market
launch of a validated medical AI product. We focus on issues related to
Clinical validation, Regulatory affairs, Data strategy and Algorithmic
development. The development process we propose for AI in healthcare software
strongly diverges from modern consumer software development processes. We
highlight the key time points to guide founders, investors and key stakeholders
throughout their relevant part of the process. Our framework should be seen as
a template for innovation frameworks, which can be used to coordinate team
communications and responsibilities towards a reasonable product development
roadmap, thus unlocking the potential of AI in medicine.

neural networks using genetic algorithms is to find a sensible crossover
operation between parent networks. Indeed, naive crossover leads to
functionally damaged offspring that do not retain information from the parents.
This is because neural networks are invariant to permutations of neurons,
giving rise to multiple ways of representing the same solution. This is often
referred to as the competing conventions problem. In this paper, we propose a
two-step safe crossover(SC) operator. First, the neurons of the parents are
functionally aligned by computing how well they correlate, and only then are
the parents recombined. We compare two ways of measuring relationships between
neurons: Pairwise Correlation (PwC) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).
We test our safe crossover operators (SC-PwC and SC-CCA) on MNIST and CIFAR-10
by performing arithmetic crossover on the weights of feed-forward neural
network pairs. We show that it effectively transmits information from parents
to offspring and significantly improves upon naive crossover. Our method is
computationally fast,can serve as a way to explore the fitness landscape more
efficiently and makes safe crossover a potentially promising operator in future
neuroevolution research and applications.

the context of developmental neuro-robotics, where the training information is

in the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in
the properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare
evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors.
Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune 'desert' (a region
in mass-radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly
valuable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b, which is thought to
have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b and
NGTS-4b, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their
outer atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which
has a radius smaller than Neptune's but an anomalously large mass of
$39.1^{+2.7}_{-2.6}$ Earth masses and a density of $5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ grams
per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth's. Interior structure models suggest
that any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than
$3.9^{+0.8}_{-0.9}$ per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have
been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal
self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided
substantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation.
Although photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to
reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses)
hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying
that any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or
other volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the
remnant core of a giant planet.

several state-of-the-art attack methods for classification on the field of

the attack performance for universal attacks. Experimental results show that it
is possible to generate significant errors on depth estimation. In particular,
we demonstrate that our methods can conduct targeted attacks on given objects

simulations for fermions and address its sign problem. PIMD simulations are
widely used for studying many-body quantum systems at thermal equilibrium.
However, they assume that the particles are distinguishable and neglect bosonic
and fermionic exchange effects. Interacting fermions play a key role in many
chemical and physical systems, such as electrons in quantum dots and ultracold
trapped atoms. A direct sampling of the fermionic partition function is
impossible using PIMD since its integrand is not positive definite. We show
that PIMD simulations for fermions are feasible by employing our recently
developed method for bosonic PIMD and reweighting the results to obtain
fermionic expectation values. The approach is tested against path integral
Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations for up to 7 electrons in a two-dimensional
quantum dot for a range of interaction strengths. However, like PIMC, the
method suffers from the sign problem at low temperatures. We propose a simple
approach for alleviating it by simulating an auxiliary system with a larger
average sign and obtaining an upper bound to the energy of the original system
using the Bogoliubov inequality. This allows fermions to be studied at
temperatures lower than would otherwise have been feasible using PIMD, as
demonstrated in the case of a three-electron quantum dot. Our results extend
the boundaries of PIMD simulations of fermions and will hopefully stimulate the
development of new approaches for tackling the sign problem.

Discerning and
characterizing the properties of distant, faint pulsating stars is achievable
through high-cadence microlensing observations. Combining stellar variability
period with microlensing gives the source distance, type, and radius and helps
better determine the lens parameters. Considering periodically variations in
their radius and surface temperature, their microlensing light curves are
resulted from multiplication of the magnification factor with variable finite
size effect by the intrinsic brightness curves of pulsing source. The variable
finite source size due to pulsation can be significant for transit and single
microlensing and while caustic-crossing features. This kind of deviation in the
magnification factor is considerable when the ratio of the source radius to the
projected lens-source distance is in the range of $\rho_{\star}/u \in[0.4,10]$
and its duration is short and in the same order of the time of crossing the
source radius. Other deviations due to variable source intensity and its area
make colored and periodic deviations which are asymmetric with respect to the
signs of pulsation phase. The positive phases makes deviations with larger
amplitude that negative phase. These deviations dominate in filters with short
wave lengths (e.g., $B-$band). The position of magnification peaks in
microlensing of variable stars varies and this displacement differs in

There may be infinitely many flux discontinuities, and the set of

cannot be assumed. In [6] Audusse and Perthame proved a uniqueness result that
does not require the existence of traces, using adapted entropies. We
generalize the Godunov-type scheme of Adimurthi, Jaffre and Gowda [2] for this
problem with the following assumptions on the flux function, (i) the flux is BV
in the spatial variable and (ii) the critical point of the flux is BV as a
function of the space variable. We prove that the Godunov approximations
converge to an adapted entropy solution, thus providing an existence result,
and extending the convergence result of Adimurthi, Jaffre and Gowda.

the signal-to-noise ratio $>$10 and spectroscopic redshifts up to $z=0.6$. The
radio morphology classification was performed by a visual examination of the
FIRST and the NVSS contour maps overlaid on a DSS image, while an optical
morphology classification was based on the 120 arcsec snapshot images from SDSS
DR 7.
  The majority of radio galaxies in ROGUE I, i.e. $\sim$ 93%, are unresolved
(compact or elongated), while the rest of them exhibit extended morphologies,
such as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I, II, and hybrid, wide-angle tail,
narrow-angle tail, head-tail sources, and sources with intermittent or
reoriented jet activity, i.e. double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped. Most of FR
IIs have low radio luminosities, comparable to the luminosities of FR Is.
Moreover, due to visual check of all radio maps and optical images, we were
able to discover or reclassify a number of radio objects as giant,
double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped radio galaxies. The presented sample can
serve as a database for training automatic methods of identification and

the two manifolds where the convergent point is close to the optimal solution.
Numerical examples for nonnegative low rank matrix approximation and low rank

function to the problem on $\mathbb{R}^3\times[0,T)$. Here $T$ denotes a
maximal existence time of $v$.
  The first aim of the present paper is to prove unique global existence of the
solution to the problem and asymptotic behavior of the solution in the
supercritical case $\gamma\in (0,3)$, and show a lower estimate of the lifespan
in the critical or subcritical case $\gamma\in \left(-\frac{1}{2},0\right]$.
The essential part for their proofs is to derive a weaker estimate under the
weaker condition than the case without damping and to recover the weakness by
the effect of the dissipative term.
  The second aim of the present paper is to prove a small data blow-up and the
almost sharp upper estimate of the lifespan for positive data with a compact
support in the subcritical case $\gamma\in \left(-\frac{1}{2},0\right)$. The
essential part for the proof is to refine the argument for the proof of Theorem
6.1 in \cite{H20} to obtain the upper estimate of the lifespan.
  Our two results determine that a critical exponent $\gamma_c$ which divides
global existence and blow-up for small solutions is $0$, namely $\gamma_c=0$.
As the result, we can see that the critical exponent shift from $2$ to $0$ due
to the effect of the scale invariant damping term.

process, and how to design an event-based scheduling scheme considering these
uncertainties has not been addressed in the literature. In this work, we start
from the formulation of a discrete-time remote estimation process in the CRSN,

transmission. In order to achieve a better tradeoff between estimation
performance and communication consumption, we propose both open-loop and
closed-loop schedules using the hidden information under a Bayesian setting.
The open-loop schedule does not rely on any feedback signal but only works for
stable plants. For unstable plants, a closed-loop schedule is designed based on
feedback signals. The parameter design problems in both schedules are
efficiently solved by convex programming. Numerical simulations are included to

  Concatenated Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"eess.IV astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rock classification plays an important role in rock mechanics, petrology,
mining engineering, magmatic processes, and numerous other fields pertaining to
geosciences. This study proposes a concatenated convolutional neural network
(Con-CNN) method for classifying the geologic rock type based on petrographic
thin sections. Herein, plane polarized light (PPL) and crossed polarized light
(XPL) were used to acquire thin section images as the fundamental data. After
conducting the necessary pre-processing analyses, the PPL and XPL images as
well as their comprehensive image (CI) were incorporated in three convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) comprising the same structure for achieving a
preliminary classification; these images were developed by employing the fused
principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, the results of the CNNs were
concatenated by using the maximum likelihood detection to obtain a
comprehensive classification result. Finally, a statistical revision was
applied to fix the misclassification due to the proportion difference of
minerals that were similar in appearance. In this study, 13 types of 92 rock
samples, 196 petrographic thin sections, 588 images, and 63504 image patches
were fabricated for the training and validation of the Con-CNN. The five-folds
cross validation shows that the method proposed provides an overall accuracy of
89.97%, which facilitates the automation of rock classification in petrographic
thin sections.

cyber-physical system (CPS), it is difficult to restore the complete attack
path, and the intent of the attack cannot be identified automatically. A method
is therefore proposed for the extracting patterns of coordinated network
attacks on electric power CPS based on temporal-topological correlation. First,
the attack events are aggregated according to the alarm log of the cyber space,
and a temporal-causal Bayesian network-based cyber attack recognition algorithm
is proposed to parse out the cyber attack sequences of the same attacker. Then,
according to the characteristic curves of different attack measurement data in
physical space, a combination of physical attack event criteria algorithm is
designed to distinguish the types of physical attack events. Finally, physical
attack events and cyber attack sequences are matched via temporal-topological
correlation, frequent patterns of attack sequences are extracted, and hidden
multi-step attack patterns are found from scattered grid measurement data and
information from alarm logs. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
method are verified by the testbed at Mississippi State University.

therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

to strong flares and fast halo coronal mass ejections CMEs. In the present
paper, we carefully identify the chain of events from the Sun to the Earth
induced by all 12 X-class flares that occurred in 2002. In this small sample,
we find an unusual high rate (58\%) of solar sources with a longitude larger
than 74 degrees. Yet, all 12 X-class flares are associated with at least one
CME. The fast halo CMEs (50\% ) are related to interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) at
L1 and weak Dst minimum values ($> -51\;$nT); while 5 (41\%) of the 12 X-class
flares are related to solar proton events (SPE). We conclude that: (i) All
twelve analyzed solar events, even those associated with fast halo CMEs
originating from the central disk region, and those ICMEs and SPEs were not
very geo-effective. This unexpected result demonstrates that the suggested
events in the chain (fast halo CME, X-class flares, central disk region, ICME,
SPE) are not infallible proxies for geo-effectiveness. (ii) The low value of
integrated and normalized southward component of the IMF ($B^*_z$) may explain
the low geo-effectiveness for this small sample. In fact, $B^*_z$ is well
correlated to the weak Dst and low auroral electrojet (AE) activity. Hence, the
only space weather impact at Earth in 2002 we can explain is based on $B^*_z$
at L1.

to evaluate functions of matrices. The problem requires finding the connected
components of a graph whose vertices are eigenvalues of a real or complex
matrix and whose edges are pairs of eigenvalues that are at most \delta away
from each other. Davies and Higham proposed solving this problem by enumerating
the edges of the graph, which requires at least $\Omega(n^{2})$ work. We show
that the problem can be solved by computing the Delaunay triangulation of the
eigenvalues, removing from it long edges, and computing the connected
components of the remaining edges in the triangulation. This leads to an
$O(n\log n)$ algorithm. We have implemented both algorithms using CGAL, a
mature and sophisticated computational-geometry software library, and we
demonstrate that the new algorithm is much faster in practice than the naive

  detection",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major challenge when trying to detect fraud is that the fraudulent
activities form a minority class which make up a very small proportion of the
data set. In most data sets, fraud occurs in typically less than 0.5% of the
cases. Detecting fraud in such a highly imbalanced data set typically leads to
predictions that favor the majority group, causing fraud to remain undetected.
We discuss some popular oversampling techniques that solve the problem of
imbalanced data by creating synthetic samples that mimic the minority class. A
frequent problem when analyzing real data is the presence of anomalies or
outliers. When such atypical observations are present in the data, most
oversampling techniques are prone to create synthetic samples that distort the
detection algorithm and spoil the resulting analysis. A useful tool for anomaly
detection is robust statistics, which aims to find the outliers by first
fitting the majority of the data and then flagging data observations that
deviate from it. In this paper, we present a robust version of ROSE, called
robROSE, which combines several promising approaches to cope simultaneously
with the problem of imbalanced data and the presence of outliers. The proposed
method achieves to enhance the presence of the fraud cases while ignoring
anomalies. The good performance of our new sampling technique is illustrated on
simulated and real data sets and it is shown that robROSE can provide better
insight in the structure of the data. The source code of the robROSE algorithm

evaluating the wind farm with simplified surrogate models, casting a large
uncertainty on the estimated benefit. This paper presents a framework for
determining the benefit of wake steering on the AEP, incorporating simulation
results from a surrogate model and large eddy simulations in order to reduce
the uncertainty. Furthermore, a time-varying wind direction is considered for a
better representation of the ambient conditions at the real wind farm site.
Gaussian process regression is used to combine the two data sets into a single
improved model of the energy gain. This model estimates a 0.60% gain in AEP for

a differentiable renderer that synthesizes a 2D image from the surfel

view-dependent on-screen resolution, unlike representations that capture
world-space resolution, i.e., voxels or meshes. We show that Pix2Shape learns a
consistent scene representation in its encoded latent space and that the
decoder can then be applied to this latent representation in order to
synthesize the scene from a novel viewpoint. We evaluate Pix2Shape with

a tree-based model of a process, in which internal vertices represent

process tree is easily translated into a sound Workflow net (WF-net), however,
the reverse is not the case. Yet, an algorithm that translates a WF-net into a
