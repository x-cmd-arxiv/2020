human-occupied dynamic environments. Navigation around humans is especially
difficult because it requires anticipating their future motion, which can be
quite challenging. We propose an approach that combines learning-based
perception with model-based optimal control to navigate among humans based only
on monocular, first-person RGB images. Our approach is enabled by our novel
data-generation tool, HumANav that allows for photorealistic renderings of
indoor environment scenes with humans in them, which are then used to train the
perception module entirely in simulation. Through simulations and experiments
on a mobile robot, we demonstrate that the learned navigation policies can
anticipate and react to humans without explicitly predicting future human
motion, generalize to previously unseen environments and human behaviors, and
transfer directly from simulation to reality. Videos describing our approach
and experiments, as well as a demo of HumANav are available on the project

the temporal domain and the resulting wavefronts can be used to trigger
time-domain computations. While recording the wavefronts can be done using
standard digital techniques, that approach has substantial translation costs
between temporal and digital domains. To avoid these costs, we propose a spike

the centers of these galaxies having solar or slightly sub-solar
luminosity-weighted metallicities, galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the depth of

4491, NGC 4584, and NGC 4620) that are deeper than those predicted for a solar
chemical mixture and a solar-neighborhood mass function. Considering the depth
of the NaD lines found by Davidge (2018a), the deep NaI2.21um lines are
tentatively attributed to a bottom-heavy mass function. This is counter to
observed trends between mass function slope and velocity dispersion. Two of the
three galaxies with deep NaI2.21um (NGC 4584 and NGC 4620) have Sersic
exponents that are consistent with a classical bulge. As for NGC 4491, its
central NIR spectrum contains prominent emission lines. The relative strengths
of Brgamma and H_2S(1), the presence of [FeII] emission, and the mid-infrared

formation near the center of that galaxy. Wavelengths that contain the
Ballick-Ramsey C_2 band at 1.76um are matched by moderately metal-poor E-MILES

The kink is a
static, non-symmetric exact solution to SG, stable in the energy space
$H^1\times L^2$. It is well-known that the linearized operator around the kink
has a simple kernel and no internal modes. However, it possesses an odd
resonance at the bottom of the continuum spectrum, deeply related to the
existence of the (in)famous wobbling kink, an explicit periodic-in-time
solution of SG around the kink that contradicts the asymptotic stability of the
kink in the energy space.
  In this paper, we further investigate the influence of resonances in the
asymptotic stability question. We also discuss the relationship between
breathers, wobbling kinks and resonances in the SG setting. By gathering
B\""acklund transformations (BT) and Virial estimates around odd perturbations
of the vacuum solution, we first identify the manifold of initial data around
zero under which BTs are related to the wobbling kink solution. It turns out
that (even) small breathers are deeply related to odd perturbations around the
kink, including the wobbling kink itself. As a consequence of this result,
using BTs we can construct a smooth manifold of initial data close to the kink,
for which there is asymptotic stability in the energy space. The initial data
has spatial symmetry of the form (kink + odd, even), non-resonant in principle,
and not preserved by the flow. This asymptotic stability property holds despite
the existence of wobbling kinks in SG. We also show that wobbling kinks are
orbitally stable under odd data, and clarify some interesting connections
between SG and $\phi^4$ at the level of linear B\""acklund transformations.

semiconductors due to their exceptional performance as active layers in solar

ionic compounds, where ion migration plays a decisive role in their formation,
their photovoltaic performance and their long-term stability. Given the
above-mentioned complexity, molecular dynamics simulations based on classical
force fields are especially suited to study MHP properties, such as lattice
dynamics and ion migration. In particular, the possibility to model mixed
compositions is important since they are the most relevant to optimize the
optical band gap and the stability. With this intention, we employ DFT
calculations and a genetic algorithm to develop a fully transferable classical
force field valid for the benchmark inorganic perovskite compositional set
CsPb(Br_xI_(1-x))_3 (x = 0,1/3,2/3,1). The resulting force field reproduces
correctly, with a common set of parameters valid for all compositions, the
experimental lattice parameter as a function of bromide/iodide ratio, the
ion-ion distances and the XRD spectra of the pure and mixed structures. The
simulated thermal conductivities and ion migration activation energies of the
pure compounds are also in good agreement with experimental trends. Our
molecular dynamics simulations make it possible to predict the compositional
dependence of the ionic diffusion coefficient on bromide/iodide ratio and
vacancy concentration. For vacancy concentrations of around 9 10^21 cm^-3, we
obtained ionic diffusion coefficients at ambient temperature of 10^-11 and
10^-13 cm2/s for CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively. Interestingly, in comparison
with the pure compounds, we predict a significantly lower activation energy for
vacancy migration and faster diffusion for the mixed perovskites.

solving an extremal symmetric eigenvalue problem. Convergence-based error
estimates depend heavily on the eigenvalue gap. In practice, this gap is often
relatively small, resulting in significant overestimates of error. One way to
avoid this issue is through the use of uniform error estimates, namely, bounds
that depend only on the dimension of the matrix and the number of iterations.
In this work, we prove explicit upper and lower uniform error estimates for the
Lanczos method. These lower bounds, paired with numerical results, imply that
the maximum error of $m$ iterations of the Lanczos method over all $n \times n$
symmetric matrices does indeed depend on the dimension $n$ in practice. The
improved bounds for extremal eigenvalues translate immediately to error
estimates for the condition number of a symmetric positive definite matrix. In
addition, we prove more specific results for matrices that possess some level
of eigenvalue regularity or whose eigenvalues converge to some limiting
empirical spectral distribution. Through numerical experiments, we show that
the theoretical estimates of this paper do apply to practical computations for
reasonably sized matrices.

solved via incremental algorithms, which split computation into a series of
small tasks acting on shared state, which gets updated progressively.
  While the sequential variant of such algorithms usually specifies a fixed
(but sometimes random) order in which the tasks should be performed, a standard
approach to parallelizing such algorithms is to relax this constraint to allow
for out-of-order parallel execution. This is the case for parallel
implementations of Dijkstra's single-source shortest-paths algorithm (SSSP),
and for parallel Delaunay mesh triangulation.
  While many software frameworks parallelize incremental computation in this
way, it is still not well understood whether this relaxed ordering approach can
still provide any complexity guarantees.
  In this paper, we address this problem, and analyze the efficiency guarantees
provided by a range of incremental algorithms when parallelized via relaxed
schedulers.
  We show that, for algorithms such as Delaunay mesh triangulation and sorting
by insertion, schedulers with a maximum relaxation factor of $k$ in terms of
the maximum priority inversion allowed will introduce a maximum amount of
wasted work of $O(log(n) poly (k) ), $ where $n$ is the number of tasks to be
executed.
  For SSSP, we show that the additional work is $O(poly (k) d_{max} / w_{min}),
$ where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum distance between two nodes, and $w_{min}$ is
the minimum such distance. In practical settings where $n \gg k$, this suggests
that the overheads of relaxation will be outweighed by the improved scalability
of the relaxed scheduler.
  On the negative side, we provide lower bounds showing that certain algorithms
will inherently incur a non-trivial amount of wasted work due to scheduler
relaxation, even for relatively benign relaxed schedulers.

Relying on control variables, we develop a constructive two-step identification

and the second step uses ``between-group'' variations, correcting for
endogeneity, to identify the APE. We propose a natural semiparametric estimator

variance. The estimator is computationally easy to implement, and Monte Carlo

contrast to its Newtonian counterpart which is linearly stable at all Reynolds

The unstable mode has a phase speed close to the base-state maximum over the
entire unstable region in the relevant parameter space, implying that the
unstable mode belongs to a class of viscoelastic center modes. Unlike the
Newtonian transition which is dominated by nonlinear processes, the linear
instability discussed here could be very relevant to the onset of turbulence in
viscoelastic pipe flows. The prediction of an instability is, in fact,
consistent with several experimental studies on pipe flow of polymer solutions,
ranging from previous reports of early turbulence to the more recent discovery
of elasto-inertial turbulence. The instability identified in this study

subnetworks of a face model, the robustness of a sample representation and
thus, its quality is estimated. The experiments are conducted in a

unfolding on top of them. The identification of structures playing important
roles in such processes remains largely an open question, despite recent
progresses in the case of static networks. Here, we consider as candidate
structures the recently introduced concept of span-cores: the span-cores
decompose a temporal network into subgraphs of controlled duration and
increasing connectivity, generalizing the core-decomposition of static graphs.
To assess the relevance of such structures, we explore the effectiveness of
strategies aimed either at containing or maximizing the impact of a spread,
based respectively on removing span-cores of high cohesiveness or duration to
decrease the epidemic risk, or on seeding the process from such structures. The
effectiveness of such strategies is assessed in a variety of empirical data
sets and compared to baselines that use only static information on the
centrality of nodes and static concepts of coreness, as well as to a baseline
based on a temporal centrality measure. Our results show that the most stable
and cohesive temporal cores play indeed an important role in epidemic processes
on temporal networks, and that their nodes are likely to represent influential
spreaders.

  Information",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian experimental design (BED) is a framework that uses statistical
models and decision making under uncertainty to optimise the cost and
performance of a scientific experiment. Sequential BED, as opposed to static
BED, considers the scenario where we can sequentially update our beliefs about
the model parameters through data gathered in the experiment. A class of models
of particular interest for the natural and medical sciences are implicit
models, where the data generating distribution is intractable, but sampling
from it is possible. Even though there has been a lot of work on static BED for
implicit models in the past few years, the notoriously difficult problem of
sequential BED for implicit models has barely been touched upon. We address
this gap in the literature by devising a novel sequential design framework for
parameter estimation that uses the Mutual Information (MI) between model
parameters and simulated data as a utility function to find optimal
experimental designs, which has not been done before for implicit models. Our
approach uses likelihood-free inference by ratio estimation to simultaneously
estimate posterior distributions and the MI. During the sequential BED
procedure we utilise Bayesian optimisation to help us optimise the MI utility.
We find that our framework is efficient for the various implicit models tested,
yielding accurate parameter estimates after only a few iterations.

distinguish between original and forged regions in a JPEG image, based on the
detection of single and double compressed blocks, without fully decompressing

carefully design the input to DenseNet with a specific combination of
quantization step sizes and the respective histograms for a JPEG block. Using

for the detection of single and double compressed blocks of sizes $256 \times

--propagating in a collisionless magnetized plasma with a sheared
parallel-directed velocity flow-- is here studied by means of two-dimensional
hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) simulations. The unperturbed sheared flow has been
represented by an exact solution of the HVM set of equations (Malara {\it et
al.}, Phys. Rev. E 97, 053212), this avoiding spurious oscillations that would
arise from the non-stationary initial state and inevitably affect the dynamics
of the system. We have considered the evolution of both a small and a moderate
amplitude Alfv\'en wave, in order to separate linear wave-shear flow couplings
from kinetic effects, the latter being more relevant for larger wave
amplitudes. The phase-mixing generated by the shear flow modifies the initial
perturbation, leading to the formation of small-scale transverse fluctuations
at scales comparable with the proton inertial length. By analyzing both the
polarization and group velocity of perturbations in the shear regions, we
identify them as Kinetic Alfv\'en Waves (KAWs). In the moderate amplitude run,
kinetic effects distort the proton distribution function in the shear region.
This leads to the formation of a proton beam, at the Alfv\'en speed and
parallel to the magnetic field. Such a feature, due to the parallel electric
field associated with KAWs, positively compares with solar-wind observations of
suprathermal ions' populations, suggesting that it may be related to the
presence of ion-scales KAW-like fluctuations.

blending registered images for a visual analysis and follow up by the

solve the problem. While it relies on scene understanding, the latter only
considers objects that could originate hazard. These are denoted as
action-inducing, since changes in their state should trigger vehicle actions.
They also define a set of explanations for these actions, which should be
produced jointly with the latter. An extension of the BDD100K dataset,
annotated for a set of 4 actions and 21 explanations, is proposed. A new
multi-task formulation of the problem, which optimizes the accuracy of both
action commands and explanations, is then introduced. A CNN architecture is
finally proposed to solve this problem, by combining reasoning about action
inducing objects and global scene context. Experimental results show that the
requirement of explanations improves the recognition of action-inducing
objects, which in turn leads to better action predictions.

heavily obscured by gas and dust, which prevents establishing whether or not
the galaxy harbours a supermassive black hole coexisting with the starburst.
Some sources have been proposed in the literature as candidates for an active

of a supermassive black hole at the nucleus of NGC 253 might have on cosmic ray

active nucleus, and we evaluate the feasibility of particle acceleration by the
black hole dynamo mechanism. As a by-product, we explore the potential
contribution from non-thermal particles in the accretion flow to the
high-energy emission of the galaxy. We found that in the three most plausible
nucleus candidates, the emission of the accretion flow would inhibit the black
hole dynamo mechanism. To rule out completely the influence that a putative

clarification concerning the true nature of the nucleus is needed.

relative and absolute. The interactions between the network nodes might be
controlled by redirecting the emission between the condensates or by sending
the phase information between nodes using resonant excitation. We discuss the
conditions under which the proposed machine leads to a pure polariton simulator
with pre-programmed couplings or results in a hybrid classical polariton
simulator. We argue that the proposed architecture for the remote coupling

difficult-to-avoid feature, especially in near-term quantum technologies.
However, noise has often played beneficial roles, from enhancing weak signals
in stochastic resonance to protecting the privacy of data in differential
privacy. It is then natural to ask, can we harness the power of quantum noise
that is beneficial to quantum computing? An important current direction for
quantum computing is its application to machine learning, such as
classification problems. One outstanding problem in machine learning for
classification is its sensitivity to adversarial examples. These are small,
undetectable perturbations from the original data where the perturbed data is
completely misclassified in otherwise extremely accurate classifiers. They can
also be considered as `worst-case' perturbations by unknown noise sources. We
show that by taking advantage of depolarisation noise in quantum circuits for
classification, a robustness bound against adversaries can be derived where the
robustness improves with increasing noise. This robustness property is
intimately connected with an important security concept called differential
privacy which can be extended to quantum differential privacy. For the
protection of quantum data, this is the first quantum protocol that can be used
against the most general adversaries. Furthermore, we show how the robustness
in the classical case can be sensitive to the details of the classification
model, but in the quantum case the details of classification model are absent,
thus also providing a potential quantum advantage for classical data that is
independent of quantum speedups. This opens the opportunity to explore other
ways in which quantum noise can be used in our favour, as well as identifying
other ways quantum algorithms can be helpful that is independent of quantum
speedups.

developers can admit technical debt by other means, e.g., by creating issues in
tracking systems and labelling them as referring to TD. We refer to this type
of SATD as issue-based SATD or just SATD-I. We study a sample of 286 SATD-I

SATD-I instances can be tracked to source code comments. We also show that
SATD-I issues take more time to be closed, compared to other issues, although
they are not more complex in terms of code churn. Besides, in 45% of the
studied issues TD was introduced to ship earlier, and in almost 60% it refers
to Design flaws. Finally, we report that most developers pay SATD-I to reduce
its costs or interests (66%). Our findings suggest that there is space for
designing novel tools to support technical debt management, particularly tools
that encourage developers to create and label issues containing TD concerns.

distinct line profile can be well-modelled by a low eccentricity
($e\approx0.1$) accretion disk extending out to $\sim$100 $R_{p}$ and a
Gaussian component originating from non-disk clouds, though a bipolar outflow
origin cannot be completely ruled out. Our analysis indicates that in
AT~2018hyz, disk formation took place promptly after the most-bound debris
returned to pericenter, which we estimate to be roughly tens of days before the
first detection. Redistribution of angular momentum and mass transport,
possibly through shocks, must occur on the observed timescale of about a month
to create the large \Ha-emitting disk that comprises $\lesssim$5\% of the
initial stellar mass. With these new insights from AT~2018hyz, we infer that
circularization is efficient in at least some, if not all optically-bright,
X-ray faint TDEs. In these efficiently circularized TDEs, the detection of
double-peaked emission depends on the disk inclination angle and the relative
strength of the disk contribution to the non-disk component, possibly
explaining the diversity seen in the current sample.

(e.g. in metals and semiconductors), and has been studied extensively for
decades. In fact, it is among the oldest and the most-investigated many body
problems in physics. However, there is a lack of an analytical expression for
the self-energy $Re \Sigma^{(R)}( \varepsilon,T)$ when energy $\varepsilon$ and
temperature $k_{B} T$ are arbitrary with respect to each other (while both
being still small compared with the Fermi energy). We revisit this problem and
calculate analytically the self-energy on the mass shell for a two-dimensional
electron system with Coulomb interactions in the high density limit $r_s \ll
1$, for temperature $ r_s^{3/2} \ll k_{B} T/ E_F \ll r_s$ and energy $r_s^{3/2}
\ll |\varepsilon |/E_F \ll r_s$. We provide the exact high-density analytical
expressions for the real and imaginary parts of the electron self-energy with
arbitrary value of $\varepsilon /k_{B} T$, to the leading order in the
dimensionless Coulomb coupling constant $r_s$, and to several higher than
leading orders in $k_{B} T/r_s E_F$ and $\varepsilon /r_s E_F$. We also obtain
the asymptotic behavior of the self-energy in the regimes $|\varepsilon | \ll
k_{B} T$ and $|\varepsilon | \gg k_{B} T$. The higher-order terms have subtle
and highly non-trivial compound logarithmic contributions from both
$\varepsilon $ and $T$, explaining why they have never before been calculated
in spite of the importance of the subject matter.

computationally expensive and often require substantial computational efforts.
The mitigation of computational burden is usually enabled through parallelism
in high-performance cluster (HPC) architecture. In this paper, an asynchronous
constrained batch-parallel Bayesian optimization method is proposed to
efficiently solve the computationally-expensive simulation-based optimization
problems on the HPC platform, with a budgeted computational resource, where the
maximum number of simulations is a constant. The advantages of this method are
three-fold. First, the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization is improved,
where multiple input locations are evaluated massively parallel in an
asynchronous manner to accelerate the optimization convergence with respect to
physical runtime. This efficiency feature is further improved so that when each
of the inputs is finished, another input is queried without waiting for the
whole batch to complete. Second, the method can handle both known and unknown
constraints. Third, the proposed method considers several acquisition functions
at the same time and sample based on an evolving probability mass distribution
function using a modified GP-Hedge scheme, where parameters are corresponding
to the performance of each acquisition function. The proposed framework is
termed aphBO-2GP-3B, which corresponds to asynchronous parallel hedge Bayesian
optimization with two Gaussian processes and three batches. The aphBO-2GP-3B
framework is demonstrated using two high-fidelity expensive industrial
applications, where the first one is based on finite element analysis (FEA) and
the second one is based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.

connectivity for optimization-based thermal management of CVs is the relatively
slow thermal dynamics, which necessitate the use of a long prediction horizon
to achieve the best performance. Long-term prediction of the CV speed, unlike
the V2V/V2I-based short-range prediction, is difficult and error-prone. The
multiple timescales inherent to power and thermal systems call for a variable
timescale optimization framework with access to short- and long-term vehicle
speed preview. To this end, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a
multi-range speed preview for integrated power and thermal management (iPTM) of
connected hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is presented in this paper. The MPC
is formulated to manage the power-split between the engine and the battery
while enforcing the power and thermal (engine coolant and catalytic converter
temperatures) constraints. The MPC exploits prediction and optimization over a
shorter receding horizon and longer shrinking horizon. Over the longer
shrinking horizon, the vehicle speed estimation is based on the data collected
from the connected vehicles traveling on the same route as the ego-vehicle.
Simulation results of applying the MPC over real-world urban driving cycles in
Ann Arbor, MI are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and fuel-saving

and therefore it is necessary to improve the techniques involved as much as
possible. In view of the large present and forthcoming galaxy catalogues, we
propose, implement, and evaluate an algorithm that combines the two most
popular techniques used to identify galaxy systems. The algorithm can be easily
applied to any spectroscopic galaxy catalogue, but here we demonstrate its use
on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Assuming that a galaxy group is a
gravitationally bounded system that has at least one bright galaxy, we begin by
identifying groups with a Friends-Of-Friends algorithm adapted to fit this
definition. In view of the shortcomings of this method, particularly the lack
of ability to identify low-number groups, and consequently the inability to
study the occupation of halos throughout the mass range, we improve it by
adding a halo-based procedure. To assess the performance, we construct a mock
catalogue from a semi-analytical model to compare the groups identified using
our method with those obtained from the simulation. The comparison of groups
extracted using our method with those of a mock catalogue shows that the
proposed algorithm provides excellent results. The modifications introduced to
the Friends-Of-Friends algorithm in the first part of the procedure to fit the
adopted group definition gave reliable groups. Furthermore, the incorporation
of the halo-based method reduces the interlopers while more accurately
reproducing the number of galaxies per group. As a specific application, we use
the algorithm to extract groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

measures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the
number of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still
exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this
brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by
means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we
introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all
infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that
they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is
determined by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of
newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different
compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0 >1$, then the
number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if
$\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions
imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays
exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development
in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth
dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth).
Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection
(maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting
measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the
total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate
remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced
quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.

positive and negative electric streamer discharges. From hydrodynamic
equations, in the assumption of a solution in the shape of a streamer, it is
possible to derive several relations between streamer parameters, which form a
system of algebraic equations (SAE). Because of the made approximations, the
error in the solution of this system is expected to be probably up to a few
tens of percent. Solving the SAE allows us to express all streamer parameters
in terms of the streamer length $L$, the constant uniform external electric
field $E_e$, and the streamer radius. The solutions with different radii are
valid solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, and are analogous to the
propagation modes of flat-front perturbations with different transverse
wavelengths. We interpret the streamer as a nonlinear instability, whose
behavior is determined by choosing the radius at which the velocity is
maximized, because, as we show, the velocity plays the same role as the
exponential growth rate in the case of linear instabilities.
  Thus, streamer behavior is unambiguously determined by $E_e$ and $L$, in a
relatively computationally economical way. In contrast, numerical methods of
solving the microscopic equations, such as hydrodynamic simulations, are more
computationally demanding, and the preferred solution in them arises
automatically because of numerical fluctuations. The calculations for air at
sea level conditions produce reasonable values for commonly observed streamer
parameters. The calculated positive streamer velocities and negative threshold
fields are compatible with experimental measurements. The physical reason for
the positive threshold fields is also discussed. A much simplified analytical
model (Appendix B) reproduces many of the presented results, at least
qualitatively.

reduced system of the complete set of state variables. Reduced systems possess
memory integrals, based on the well known Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formulism. Our
numerical strategy to recover the reduced system starts by formulating a
discrete approximation of the memory integral in the MZ formulation. The
resulting unknown approximate MZ equations are of finite dimensional, in the
sense that a finite number of past history data are involved. We then present a
deep neural network structure that directly incorporates the history terms to
produce memory in the network. The approach is suitable for any practical
systems with finite memory length. We then use a set of numerical examples to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

important for understanding galaxy formation and testing the properties of dark
matter. Most studies of substructure evolution make predictions based on
empirical models of tidal mass loss that are calibrated using numerical
simulations. This approach can be accurate in the cases considered, but lacks
generality and does not provide a physical understanding of the processes
involved. Recently, we demonstrated that truncating NFW distribution functions
sharply in energy results in density profiles that resemble those of tidally
stripped systems, offering a path to constructing physically motivated models
of tidal mass loss. In this work, we review calculations of mass loss based on
energy truncation alone, and then consider what secondary effects may modulate
mass loss beyond this. We find that a combination of dependence on additional
orbital parameters and variations in individual particle energies over an orbit
results in a less abrupt truncation in energy space as a subhalo loses mass.
Combining the energy truncation approach with a simple prediction for the
mass-loss rate, we construct a full model of mass loss that can accurately
predict the evolution of a subhalo in terms of a single parameter $\eta_{\rm
eff}$. This parameter can be fully determined from the initial orbital and halo
properties, and does not require calibration with numerical simulations.

that the water clusters possess a universal negative electrostatic potential
with respect to their surrounding, as is known for aqueous liquid-vapor

monoatomic salts, can dramatically impact the transfer free energies of larger
charged molecules because of their weak hydration and increased affinity to

control parameter, we consider the occurrence of the ergodicity with quench
dynamics in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XY model in a transverse magnetic
field. The ground-state phase diagram consists of two ferromagnetic and
paramagnetic phases. It is known the magnetization in this spin system is
non-ergodic. We set up two different experiments as we call them single and
double quenches and test the dynamics of the magnetization along the $Z$-axis
and the spin-spin correlation function along the $X$-axis which are the order
parameters of the zero-temperature phases . Our exact results reveal that for
single quenches at zero-temperature, the ergodicity depends on the initial
state and the order parameter. Interestingly on the other setup, a double
quench on a cyclic path, ergodicity is completely broken for starting from the
phase corresponding to the order parameter. Otherwise, it depends on the first
quenched point, and the quench time $T$ when the model spent before a second
quench in the way back which gives an ability to controlling the ergodicity in
the system. Therefore, and contrary to expectations, in the mentioned model the
ergodicity can be observed with probing quench dynamics at zero-temperature.
Our results provide further insight into the zero-temperature dynamical
behavior of quantum systems and their connections to the ergodicity phenomenon.

satellite debris of all massive galaxies reaching the inner Milky Way on a
timescale of 2 Gyr. Up to 80$\%$ of the dark matter is stripped from the
satellites, while this happens for up to 30$\%$ of their stars. The stellar
debris ends mostly in the inner Milky Way halo, whereas the dark matter debris
shows a flat mass distribution over the full main halo. The dark matter debris
follows a density profile with inner power law index $\alpha_{\rm DM}=-0.66$
and outer index $\beta_{\rm DM}=2.94$, while for stars $\alpha_{*}=-0.44$ and
$\beta_{*}=6.17$. In the inner 25 kpc, the distribution of the stellar debris
is flatter than that of the dark matter debris and the orientations of their
short axes differ significantly. Changing the orientation of the stellar disc
by 90$^{\rm{o}}$ has only a minor impact on the distribution of the satellite
debris. Our results indicate that the dark matter is more easily stripped than
stars from the Milky Way satellites. The structure of the debris is dominated
by the satellite orbital properties. The radial profiles, the flattening and
the orientation of the stellar and dark matter debris are significantly

are generally classified as either local or global, depending on what portion
of the data space they are purported to explain. The improved coverage of
global explainers usually comes at the expense of explainer fidelity. One way
of trading off the advantages of both approaches is to aggregate several local
explainers into a single explainer model with improved coverage. However, the
problem of aggregating these local explainers is computationally challenging,
and existing methods only use heuristics to form these aggregations.
  In this paper we propose a local explainer aggregation method which selects
local explainers using non-convex optimization. In contrast to other heuristic
methods, we use an integer optimization framework to combine local explainers
into a near-global aggregate explainer. Our framework allows a decision-maker
to directly tradeoff coverage and fidelity of the resulting aggregation through

  spectral models","10 pages, 4 figures conference paper. Published at the The 25th IAHR
  International Symposium on Ice",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Increased economic activity and research interest in the Arctic raise the
need for better wave forecasts in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Mathematical and
numerical models of wave propagation in sea ice would benefit from more in situ
data for validation. This study presents shipborne wave measurements from the
MIZ where altimeter readings are corrected for ship motion to obtain estimated
single point ocean surface elevation. From the combined measurements, we obtain
significant wave height and zero up-crossing period, as well as one-dimensional
wave spectra. In addition, we provide spectra and integrated parameters
obtained from inertial motion units (IMU) placed on ice floes inside the MIZ.
The results are compared with integrated parameters from the WAM-4 spectral
wave model over a period of three days in the open ocean. We also compare our
measurements outside and inside the MIZ with hindcast data from the new
pan-Arctic WAM-3 model and the Wave Watch III model for the European Arctic,
which both model wave attenuation in sea ice. A good agreement is found with
WAM-4 and WW3 in zero up-crossing period and significant wave height outside
the MIZ, where deviations are less than 23%. WAM-3 is on the other hand up to
60% higher than observations. WW3 and WAM-3 are able to estimate the trends for
significant wave height and zero up-crossing period inside the MIZ, although
the discrepancies with respect to the observations were larger than in the open
ocean. Wave damping by sea ice is investigated by looking at the spatial
attenuation coefficients. Predicted attenuation coefficients are found to be
72-83% smaller for WW3 and 3-64% larger for WAM-3 compared to observations.
Hence, further model tuning is necessary to better estimate wave parameters in
the ice.

$H^g$ are conjugate in $\langle H, H^g \rangle$ for each $g \in G$. Some
problems in Finite Group Theory, Combinatorics, and Permutation Group Theory
were solved in terms of pronormality, therefore, the question of pronormality
of a given subgroup in a given group is of interest. Subgroups of odd index in
finite groups satisfy a native necessary condition of pronormality. In this
paper we continue investigations on pronormality of subgroups of odd index and
consider the pronormality question for subgroups of odd index in some direct
products of finite groups.
  In particular, in this paper we prove that the subgroups of odd index are
pronormal in the direct product $G$ of finite simple symplectic groups over
fields of odd characteristics if and only if the subgroups of odd index are
pronormal in each direct factor of $G$. Moreover, deciding the pronormality of
a given subgroup of odd index in the direct product of simple symplectic groups
over fields of odd characteristics is reducible to deciding the pronormality of
some subgroup $H$ of odd index in a subgroup of $\prod_{i=1}^t \mathbb{Z}_3\wr
Sym_{n_i}$, where each $Sym_{n_i}$ acts naturally on $\{1,\dots, n_i\}$, such
that $H$ projects onto $\prod_{i=1}^t Sym_{n_i}$. Thus, in this paper we obtain
a criterion of pronormality of a subgroup $H$ of odd index in a subgroup of
$\prod_{i=1}^t \mathbb{Z}_{p_i}\wr Sym_{n_i}$, where each $p_i$ is a prime and
each $Sym_{n_i}$ acts naturally on $\{1,\dots, n_i\}$, such that $H$ projects

  Methods: Our proposed system is comprised of four Time-of-Flight (ToF)
cameras rigidly attached to strategic locations on the daVinci Xi patient side
cart (PSC). The cameras are registered to the robot's kinematic chain by
performing a one-time calibration routine and therefore, information from all

systems with hard state and action constraints. Despite its success in many
domains, reinforcement learning is challenging to apply to problems with hard
constraints, especially if both the state variables and actions are
constrained. Previous works seeking to ensure constraint satisfaction, or
safety, have focused on adding a projection step to a learned policy. Yet, this
approach requires solving an optimization problem at every policy execution
step, which can lead to significant computational costs.
  To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new approach, termed Vertex
Networks (VNs), with guarantees on safety during exploration and on learned
control policies by incorporating the safety constraints into the policy
network architecture. Leveraging the geometric property that all points within
a convex set can be represented as the convex combination of its vertices, the
proposed algorithm first learns the convex combination weights and then uses
these weights along with the pre-calculated vertices to output an action. The
output action is guaranteed to be safe by construction. Numerical examples
illustrate that the proposed VN algorithm outperforms vanilla reinforcement
learning in a variety of benchmark control tasks.

  experiments",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The determination of an optimal design for a given regression problem is an
intricate optimization problem, especially for models with multivariate
predictors. Design admissibility and invariance are main tools to reduce the
complexity of the optimization problem and have been successfully applied for
models with univariate predictors. In particular several authors have developed
sufficient conditions for the existence of saturated designs in univariate
models, where the number of support points of the optimal design equals the
number of parameters. These results generalize the celebrated de la Garza
phenomenon (de la Garza, 1954) which states that for a polynomial regression
model of degree $p-1$ any optimal design can be based on at most $p$ points.
This paper provides - for the first time - extensions of these results for
models with a multivariate predictor. In particular we study a geometric
characterization of the support points of an optimal design to provide
sufficient conditions for the occurrence of the de la Garza phenomenon in
models with multivariate predictors and characterize properties of admissible
designs in terms of admissibility of designs in conditional univariate
regression models.

(2P) LSM is a variant of LSM that exploits the 2P absorption effect for sample
excitation. The light polarization state plays a significant, and often
overlooked, role in 2P absorption processes. The scope of this work is to test
whether using different polarization states for excitation light can affect the
detected signal levels in 2P LSM imaging of typical biological samples with a
spatially unordered dye population. Supported by a theoretical model, we
compared the fluorescence signals obtained using different polarization states
with various fluorophores (fluorescein, EGFP and GCaMP6s) and different samples
(liquid solution and fixed or living zebrafish larvae). In all conditions, in
agreement with our theoretical expectations, linear polarization oriented
parallel to the detection plane provided the largest signal levels, while
perpendicularly-oriented polarization gave low fluorescence signal with the
biological samples, but a large signal for the fluorescein solution. Finally,
circular polarization generally provided lower signal levels. These results
highlight the importance of controlling the light polarization state in 2P LSM
of biological samples. Furthermore, this characterization represents a useful
guide to choose the best light polarization state when maximization of signal
levels is needed, e.g. in high-speed 2P LSM.

learning-based deformable image registration methods achieve fast image
registration by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the
spatial transformation from the synthetic ground truth or the similarity
metric. However, these approaches often ignore the topology preservation of the
transformation and the smoothness of the transformation which is enforced by a
global smoothing energy function alone. Moreover, deep learning-based
approaches often estimate the displacement field directly, which cannot
guarantee the existence of the inverse transformation. In this paper, we
present a novel, efficient unsupervised symmetric image registration method
which maximizes the similarity between images within the space of diffeomorphic
maps and estimates both forward and inverse transformations simultaneously. We
evaluate our method on 3D image registration with a large scale brain image
dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy and running
time while maintaining desirable diffeomorphic properties.

quarks is one of the few largely unexplored Standard Model object
classification problems remaining in high energy collider physics. In this
paper we investigate the purest version of this classification problem in the
form of distinguishing strange-quark jets from down-quark jets. Our strategy
relies on the fact that a strange-quark jet contains on average a higher ratio
of neutral kaon energy to neutral pion energy than does a down-quark jet.
Long-lived neutral kaons deposit energy mainly in the hadronic calorimeter of a
high energy detector, while neutral pions decay promptly to photons that
deposit energy mainly in the electromagnetic calorimeter. In addition,
short-lived neutral kaons that decay in flight to charged pion pairs can be
identified as a secondary vertex in the inner tracking system. Using these
handles we study different approaches to distinguishing strange-quark from
down-quark jets, including single variable cut-based methods, a boosted
decision tree (BDT) with a small number of simple variables, and a deep
learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with jet images. We
show that modest gains are possible from the CNN compared with the BDT or a
single variable. Starting from jet samples with only strange-quark and
down-quark jets, the CNN algorithm can improve the strange to down ratio by a
factor of roughly 2 for strange tagging efficiencies below 0.2, and by a factor
of 2.5 for strange tagging efficiencies near 0.02.

in the sense that an algebraic companion of the deductive machinery can always
be found. Since the inception of da Costa's paraconsistent calculi $C_n$,
algebraic equivalents for such systems have been sought. It is known, however,
that these systems are not self-extensional (i.e., they do not satisfy the
replacement property). More than this, they are not algebraizable in the sense
of Blok-Pigozzi. The same negative results hold for several systems of the
hierarchy of paraconsistent logics known as Logics of Formal Inconsistency
(LFIs). Because of this, several systems belonging to this class of logics are
only characterizable by semantics of a non-deterministic nature. This paper
offers a solution for two open problems in the domain of paraconsistency, in
particular connected to algebraization of LFIs, by extending with rules several
LFIs weaker than $C_1$ , thus obtaining the replacement property (that is, such
LFIs turn out to be self-extensional). Moreover, these logics become
algebraizable in the standard Lindenbaum-Tarski's sense by a suitable variety
of Boolean algebras extended with additional operations. The weakest LFI
satisfying replacement presented here is called RmbC, which is obtained from
the basic LFI called mbC. Some axiomatic extensions of RmbC are also studied.
In addition, a neighborhood semantics is defined for such systems. It is shown
that RmbC can be defined within the minimal bimodal non-normal logic E+E
defined by the fusion of the non-normal modal logic E with itself. Finally, the
framework is extended to first-order languages. RQmbC, the quantified extension
of RmbC, is shown to be sound and complete w.r.t. the proposed algebraic
semantics.

each observes the entire state of the other agent. We initiate the study of
$\textit{message complexity}$ for population protocols, where the state of an
agent is divided into an externally-visible $\textit{message}$ and an internal
component, where only the message can be observed by the other agent in an
interaction.
  We consider the case of $O(1)$ message complexity. When time is unrestricted,
we obtain an exact characterization of the stably computable predicates based
on the number of internal states $s(n)$: If $s(n) = o(n)$ then the protocol
computes semilinear predicates (unlike the original model, which can compute
non-semilinear predicates with $s(n) = O(\log n)$), and otherwise it computes a
predicate decidable by a nondeterministic $O(n \log s(n))$-space-bounded Turing
machine. We then introduce novel $O(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ expected time
protocols for junta/leader election and general purpose broadcast correct with
high probability, and approximate and exact population size counting correct

bounded-message-size protocols is the size of the internal states: with
unbounded internal states, any computable function can be computed with

  Sets: Collinearity Testing and Related Problems",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present subquadratic algorithms, in the algebraic decision-tree model of
computation, for detecting whether there exists a triple of points, belonging
to three respective sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ of points in the plane, that satisfy
a certain polynomial equation or two equations. The best known instance of such
a problem is testing for the existence of a collinear triple of points in
$A\times B\times C$, a classical 3SUM-hard problem that has so far defied any
attempt to obtain a subquadratic solution, whether in the (uniform) real RAM
model, or in the algebraic decision-tree model. While we are still unable to
solve this problem, in full generality, in subquadratic time, we obtain such a
solution, in the algebraic decision-tree model, that uses only roughly
$O(n^{28/15})$ constant-degree polynomial sign tests, for the special case
where two of the sets lie on two respective one-dimensional curves and the
third is placed arbitrarily in the plane. Our technique is fairly general, and
applies to many other problems where we seek a triple that satisfies a single
polynomial equation, e.g., determining whether $A\times B\times C$ contains a
triple spanning a unit-area triangle. This result extends recent work by Barba
\etal~(2017) and by Chan (2018), where all three sets $A$,~$B$, and~$C$ are
assumed to be one-dimensional.
  As a second application of our technique, we again have three $n$-point sets
$A$, $B$, and $C$ in the plane, and we want to determine whether there exists a
triple $(a,b,c) \in A\times B\times C$ that simultaneously satisfies two
independent real polynomial equations. For example, this is the setup when
testing for collinearity in the complex plane, when each of the sets $A$, $B$,
$C$ lies on some constant-degree algebraic curve. We show that problems of this
kind can be solved with roughly $O(n^{24/13})$ constant-degree polynomial sign
tests.

smoothness-inducing regularization. Such regularization effectively constrains
the search space, and enforces smoothness in the learned policy. Moreover, our
proposed framework can also improve the robustness of policy against
measurement error in the state space, and can be naturally extended to
distribubutionally robust setting. We apply the proposed framework to both
on-policy (TRPO) and off-policy algorithm (DDPG). Through extensive

R_i$ denote the join output of $Q$. In addition to $Q$, we are given a

subset $\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta} \subseteq J_{Q}$ such that every tuple in
$J_{Q}$ is within Hamming distance $\Delta - 1$ from some tuple in
$\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}$. The join covering problem captures both computing
the natural join from database theory and constructing a covering code with
covering radius $\Delta - 1$ from coding theory, as special cases.
  We consider the combinatorial version of the join covering problem, where our
goal is to determine the worst-case $|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ in terms of the
structure of $Q$ and value of $\Delta$. One obvious approach to upper bound
$|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ is to exploit a distance property (of Hamming
distance) from coding theory and combine it with the worst-case bounds on
output size of natural joins (AGM bound hereon) due to Atserias, Grohe and Marx
[SIAM J. of Computing'13]. Somewhat surprisingly, this approach is not tight
even for the case when the input relations have arity at most two. Instead, we
show that using the polymatroid degree-based bound of Abo Khamis, Ngo and Suciu
[PODS'17] in place of the AGM bound gives us a tight bound (up to constant
factors) on the $|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ for the arity two case. We prove
lower bounds for $|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ using well-known classes of
error-correcting codes e.g, Reed-Solomon codes. We can extend our results for
the arity two case to general arity with a polynomial gap between our upper and

distortions and metallicity have attracted tremendous attention. Developing
such materials at low dimensions remains challenging since both conducting
electrons and reduced dimensions are supposed to quench ferroelectricity. Here,
based on first-principles calculations, we report the discovery of
ferroelectric behavior in two-dimensional (2D) metallic materials with
electrostatic doping, even though ferroelectricity is unconventional at the
atomic scale. We reveal that PbTe monolayer is intrinsic ferroelectrics with
pronounced out-of-plane electric polarization originated from its
non-centrosymmetric buckled structure. The ferroelectric distortions can be
preserved with carriers doping in the ferroelectric monolayer, which thus
enables the doped PbTe monolayer to act as a 2D polar metal. With an effective
Hamiltonian extracted from the parametrized energy space, we found that the
elastic-polar mode interaction is of great importance for the existence of
robust polar instability in the doped system. The application of this doping
strategy is not specific to the present crystal, but is rather general to other
2D ferroelectrics to bring about the fascinating metallic ferroelectric
properties. Our findings thus change conventional acknowledge in 2D materials

Previous research has shown that nondeterminism can cause applications to

propose Adaptive Interventional Debugging (AID) for debugging such intermittent
failures. AID combines existing statistical debugging, causal analysis, fault
injection, and group testing techniques in a novel way to (1) pinpoint the root
cause of an application's intermittent failure and (2) generate an explanation
of how the root cause triggers the failure. AID works by first identifying a
set of runtime behaviors (called predicates) that are strongly correlated to
the failure. It then utilizes temporal properties of the predicates to
(over)-approximate their causal relationships. Finally, it uses fault injection
to execute a sequence of interventions on the predicates and discover their
true causal relationships. This enables AID to identify the true root cause and
its causal relationship to the failure. We theoretically analyze how fast AID
can converge to the identification. We evaluate AID with six real-world
applications that intermittently fail under specific inputs. In each case, AID
was able to identify the root cause and explain how the root cause triggered
the failure, much faster than group testing and more precisely than statistical
debugging. We also evaluate AID with many synthetically generated applications
with known root causes and confirm that the benefits also hold for them.

presentation attacks, also called spoofing attacks. Replay is among the
simplest attacks to mount - yet difficult to detect reliably. The
generalization failure of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) has driven the
community to study various alternative deep learning CMs. The majority of them
are supervised approaches that learn a human-spoof discriminator. In this
paper, we advocate a different, deep generative approach that leverages from
powerful unsupervised manifold learning in classification. The potential
benefits include the possibility to sample new data, and to obtain insights to
the latent features of genuine and spoofed speech. To this end, we propose to
use variational autoencoders (VAEs) as an alternative backend for replay attack
detection, via three alternative models that differ in their
class-conditioning. The first one, similar to the use of Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) in spoof detection, is to train independently two VAEs - one for
each class. The second one is to train a single conditional model (C-VAE) by
injecting a one-hot class label vector to the encoder and decoder networks. Our
final proposal integrates an auxiliary classifier to guide the learning of the
latent space. Our experimental results using constant-Q cepstral coefficient
(CQCC) features on the ASVspoof 2017 and 2019 physical access subtask datasets
indicate that the C-VAE offers substantial improvement in comparison to
training two separate VAEs for each class. On the 2019 dataset, the C-VAE
outperforms the VAE and the baseline GMM by an absolute 9 - 10% in both equal
error rate (EER) and tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) metrics. Finally,
we propose VAE residuals - the absolute difference of the original input and
the reconstruction as features for spoofing detection.

It is conjectured that the identity corresponds to a generalized second law of
thermodynamics which holographically relates the covariant entropy contained
within a volumetric $n$- and $(n-1)$-form, starting from an $(n-2)$-spatial
area. The time-like geodesics inherit an effective `geometric spin' while the
null geodesics are suggested to obey the generalized covariant entropy bound so
long as they conform to Einstein's equation of state. To then comply with the
equation of state, a metriplectic system is introduced, whereby a newly defined
energy functional is derived for the entropy. Such an entropy functional
mediates the Casimir invariants of the Hamiltonian and therefore preserves the
symplectic form of quantum mechanics. For null geodesics, the Poisson bracket
of the entropy functional with the Hamiltonian is shown to elegantly result in
Einstein's energy-mass relation.

algorithm that restores monotonicity while degrading the expected value of the

logarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$ and exponential in the number of parameters. We
also give a lower bound showing that this exponential dependence is necessary.
Finally, we obtain improved query complexity bounds for restoring the weaker

  convergence analysis",,,,,"math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last three decades, there has been a considerable effort within the
applied probability community to develop techniques for bounding the
convergence rates of general state space Markov chains. Most of these results
assume the existence of drift and minorization (d\&m) conditions. It has often
been observed that convergence rate bounds based on single-step d\&m tend to be
overly conservative, especially in high-dimensional situations. This article
builds a framework for studying this phenomenon. It is shown that any
convergence rate bound based on a set of d\&m conditions cannot do better than
a certain unknown optimal bound. Strategies are designed to put bounds on the
optimal bound itself, and this allows one to quantify the extent to which a
d\&m-based convergence rate bound can be sharp. The new theory is applied to
several examples, including a Gaussian autoregressive process (whose true
convergence rate is known), and a Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm. The
results strongly suggest that convergence rate bounds based on single-step d\&m
conditions are quite inadequate in high-dimensional settings.

we investigate the strain rate and dislocation density dependence of the

orders of magnitude in strain rate and 9 orders of magnitude in dislocation
density. Based on these large set of simulations and theoretical analysis, a
new analytical relationship between material strength, dislocation density,
strain rate and dislocation mobility is proposed, which is in excellent
agreement with the current simulations as well as with experimental data. The
results show that the material strength is a non-monotonic function of
dislocation density and displays two universal regimes (first decreasing, then
increasing) as the dislocation density increases. The first regime is a result
of strain rate hardening, while the second regime is dominated by the classical
Taylor forest hardening. Accordingly, the strength displays universally, as a
function of strain rate, a rate-independent regime at low strain rates
(governed by forest hardening) followed by a rate hardening regime at high
strain rates (governed by strain rate hardening). All the results can be
captured by a single scaling function. Finally, the fluctuations of dislocation
flow are analyzed in terms of the strain rate dependent distribution of
dislocation segment velocities. It is found that the fluctuations are governed
by another universal scaling function and diverge in the rate independent
limit, indicating a critical behavior. The current analysis provides a
comprehensive understanding on how collective dislocation motions are governed
by the competition between the internal elastic interactions of dislocations,

  We have applied a principal component analysis to the mean Str\""omgren

us to segregate dwarf stars from bright giants and supergiant stars, with the
aid of the metaindices. Two of the planes show that the projections of dwarfs

  (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much?
  (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place
order, prevent the overflow of capacity?
  (3) When should such strategies be implemented?
  Our answers are as follows:
  (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor
of ten.
  (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but
even that will not work if implemented too late.
  (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19
can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the
strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be
successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the
emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of
deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the
precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties
in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion
that it exists and will soon be closed.
  Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs,
there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario
in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next
week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and
then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too
late.

proving the exactness of the DUCC Ansatz based on the general many-body form of
anti-Hermitian cluster operators defining external and internal excitations.
Using these formalisms, it is possible to calculate the energy of the entire
system as an eigenvalue of downfolded/effective Hamiltonian in the active
space, that is identifiable with the sub-system of the composite system. It can
also be shown that downfolded Hamiltonians integrate out Fermionic degrees of
freedom that do not correspond to the physics encapsulated by the active space.
In this paper, we extend these results to the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation, showing that a similar construct is possible to partition a system
into a sub-system that varies slowly in time and a remaining sub-system that
corresponds to fast oscillations. This time-dependent formalism allows coupled

Specifically, a target agent with degraded sensor data sends a compressed

determines who to connect with (i.e., receive information from). We
additionally develop the AirSim-CP dataset and metrics based on the AirSim

improve the efficiency of remote collaborative work among factory workers. The
transmission of omnidirectional video (OV) is the most important step in
implementing virtual remote collaboration. Compared with the ordinary video
transmission, OV transmission requires more bandwidth, which is still a huge
burden even under 5G networks. The tile-based scheme can reduce bandwidth
consumption. However, it neither accurately obtain the field of view(FOV) area,
nor difficult to support real-time OV streaming. In this paper, we propose an
edge-assisted viewport adaptive scheme (EVAS-OV) to reduce bandwidth
consumption during real-time OV transmission. First, EVAS-OV uses a Gated
Recurrent Unit(GRU) model to predict users' viewport. Then, users were divided
into multicast clusters thereby further reducing the consumption of computing
resources. EVAS-OV reprojects OV frames to accurately obtain users' FOV area
from pixel level and adopt a redundant strategy to reduce the impact of
viewport prediction errors. All computing tasks were offloaded to edge servers
to reduce the transmission delay and improve bandwidth utilization.
Experimental results show that EVAS-OV can save more than 60\% of bandwidth
compared with the non-viewport adaptive scheme. Compared to a two-layer scheme
with viewport adaptive, EVAS-OV still saves 30\% of bandwidth.

has attracted wide attention, most recently in terms of probing-based
approaches. Previous work focuses on using or probing source linguistic
features in the encoder. To date, the way word translation evolves in
Transformer layers has not yet been investigated. Naively, one might assume
that encoder layers capture source information while decoder layers translate.
In this work, we show that this is not quite the case: translation already
happens progressively in encoder layers and even in the input embeddings. More
surprisingly, we find that some of the lower decoder layers do not actually do
that much decoding. We show all of this in terms of a probing approach where we
project representations of the layer analyzed to the final trained and frozen
classifier level of the Transformer decoder to measure word translation
accuracy. Our findings motivate and explain a Transformer configuration change:
if translation already happens in the encoder layers, perhaps we can increase
the number of encoder layers, while decreasing the number of decoder layers,
boosting decoding speed, without loss in translation quality? Our experiments
show that this is indeed the case: we can increase speed by up to a factor 2.3
with small gains in translation quality, while an 18-4 deep encoder
configuration boosts translation quality by +1.42 BLEU (En-De) at a speed-up of

galaxies passing through the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters.
For dwarf galaxies (DGs) within a cluster, the transformation from gaseous to
gas-poor systems by RPS is not easily observed and must happen in the outskirts
of clusters. In a few objects in close by galaxy clusters and the field, RPS
has been observed. Since cluster early-type DGs also show a large variety of
internal structures (unexpected central gas reservoirs, blue stellar cores,
composite radial stellar profiles), we aim in this study to investigate how ram
pressure (RP) affects the interstellar gas content and therefore the
star-formation (SF) activity. Using a series of numerical simulations, we
quantify the dependence of the stripped-off gas on the velocity of the
infalling DGs and on the ambient ICM density. We demonstrated that SF can be
either suppressed or triggered by RP depending on the ICM density and the DGs
mass. Under some conditions, RP can compress the gas, so that it is
unexpectedly retained in the central DG region and forms stars. When gas clouds
are still bound against stripping but lifted from a thin disk and fall back,
their new stars form an ellipsoidal (young) stellar population already with a
larger velocity dispersion without the necessity of harassment. Most
spectacularly, star clusters can form downstream in stripped-off massive gas
clouds in the case of strong RP. We compare our results to observations.

specifically, on each user device we keep a local copy of the news
recommendation model, and compute gradients of the local model based on the
user behaviors in this device. The local gradients from a group of randomly
selected users are uploaded to server, which are further aggregated to update
the global model in the server. Since the model gradients may contain some
implicit private information, we apply local differential privacy (LDP) to them
before uploading for better privacy protection. The updated global model is
then distributed to each user device for local model update. We repeat this

the effectiveness of our method in news recommendation model training with

extends the physical realization conditions from the time-invariant case to the
time-varying case for linear stochastic quantum systems. By relating the fault
tolerant H-infinity control problem to the dissipation properties and the
solutions of Riccati differential equations, an H-infinity controller for the
quantum system is then designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities

of the system is presented in terms of the absorption coefficient, refractive
index and dielectric constant for pristine as well as the defective
configurations. Negative value of dielectric constant for Boron vacant system
in the energy range 0.9-1.4 eV and for Nitrogen vacant system in the energy

hydrogenated graphene in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment. We find for most
combination of electron density ($n_e$) and hydrogen density ($n_H$), MR at
different temperature can be scaled to $\alpha=(\mu_BB)/[k_B(T-T^*)]$, where
$T^*$ is the Curie-Weiss temperature. The sign of $T^*$ indicates the existence
of tunable ferromagnetic-like ($T^* >0$) and anti-ferromagnetic-like ($T^* <0$)
coupling in hydrogenated graphene. However, the lack of hysteresis of MR or
anomalous Hall effect below $|T^*|$ points to the fact that long-range magnetic
order did not emerge, which we attribute to the competition of different
magnetic orders and disordered arrangement of magnetic moments on graphene. We
also find that localized impurity states introduced by H adatoms could modify
the capacitance of hydrogenated graphene. This work provides a new way to
extract information from large negative MR behavior and can be a key to help
understanding interactions of magnetic moments in graphene.

sign-pattern of the matrix in the dynamics. However, these sign conditions are
not invariant under a coordinate transformation. A natural question is to
determine if a given~$n$-dimensional system is $k$-positive up to a coordinate
transformation. We study this problem for two special kinds of transformations:
permutations and scaling by a signature matrix. For any $n\geq 4$

593-860 GeV with the Wilson parameter equals to unity; it is also shown that
the greater the $\Lambda$, the lower the phase transition strength and the

pinned in the advancing side during the evaporation process, while the receding

the droplet on inclined substrate results in complex thermo-solutal Marangoni
convection that is captured through IR images. The droplet exhibits two
distinct oscillatory water-rich cold regions around the advancing contact line
during the early stage of evaporation, while the more volatile and lighter
ethanol creates a hotter and rapidly evaporating cell near the receding side.
As ethanol evaporates away, the ethanol rich cells collapse producing thermal
pulsations along the incline. Subsequently, the thermal patterns become similar
to that of the pure-water droplet. It is also observed that the thermo-solutal
driven oscillatory convection increases with increasing substrate temperature.
Despite the complexity in convection dynamics, the evaporation rate exhibits a
universal behavior in the normalized time at different substrate temperatures

as a toy model for the many-body quantum dynamics, we propose a novel and
transparent theoretical explanation of the anomalously slow dynamics that
emerges in the bad metal phase preceding the Many-Body Localization transition.
By mapping the time-decorrelation of many-body wave-functions onto Directed
Polymers in Random Media, we show the existence of a glass transition within
the extended regime separating a metallic-like phase at small disorder, where
delocalization occurs on an exponential number of paths, from a bad metal-like
phase at intermediate disorder, where resonances are formed on rare, specific,
disorder dependent site orbitals on very distant generations. The physical
interpretation of subdiffusion and non-exponential relaxation emerging from
this picture is complementary to the Griffiths one, although both scenarios
rely on the presence of heavy-tailed distribution of the escape times. We
relate the dynamical evolution in the glassy phase to the depinning transition
of Directed Polymers, which results in macroscopic and abrupt jumps of the
preferred delocalizing paths when a parameter like the energy is varied, and
produce a singular behavior of the overlap correlation function between
eigenstates at different energies. By comparing the quantum dynamics on
loop-less Cayley trees and Random Regular Graphs we discuss the effect of
loops, showing that in the latter slow dynamics and apparent power-laws extend
on a very large time-window but are eventually cut-off on a time-scale that
diverges at the MBL transition.

tasks. However, GCN-based models (GCNs) is an inherently coupled training

leads to the limitation of flexibility in processing large-scale graph. With
the depth of layers increases, the computational and memory cost of GCNs grow
explosively due to the recursive neighborhood expansion. To tackle these
issues, we present Node2Grids, a flexible uncoupled training framework that
leverages the independent mapped data for obtaining the embedding. Instead of
directly processing the coupled nodes as GCNs, Node2Grids supports a more
efficacious method in practice, mapping the coupled graph data into the
independent grid-like data which can be fed into the efficient Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). This simple but valid strategy significantly saves memory
and computational resource while achieving comparable results with the leading
GCN-based models. Specifically, by ranking each node's influence through
degree, Node2Grids selects the most influential first-order as well as
second-order neighbors with central node fusion information to construct the
grid-like data. For further improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, a
simple CNN-based neural network is employed to capture the significant
information from the mapped grid-like data. Moreover, the grid-level attention
mechanism is implemented, which enables implicitly specifying the different
weights for neighboring nodes with different influences. In addition to the
typical transductive and inductive learning tasks, we also verify our framework

is noisy. The most popular application of bayesian optimization is the
automatic hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms, where we obtain
the best configuration of machine learning algorithms by optimizing the
estimation of the generalization error of these algorithms. Despite being
applied with success, bayesian optimization methodologies also have
hyperparameters that need to be configured such as the probabilistic surrogate

of these hyperparameters implies obtaining bad quality results. Typically,
these hyperparameters are tuned by making assumptions of the objective function
that we want to evaluate but there are scenarios where we do not have any prior
information about the objective function. In this paper, we propose a first
attempt over automatic bayesian optimization by exploring several heuristics
that automatically tune the acquisition function of bayesian optimization. We
illustrate the effectiveness of these heurisitcs in a set of benchmark problems

cosmology by increasing the total number of observed modes by several orders of
magnitude compared to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In
this paper, we consider IM of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the redshift range $0
\lesssim z \lesssim 3$ employing a halo model approach where HI is assumed to
follow the distribution of dark matter (DM) halos. If a portion of the DM is
composed of ultralight axions then the abundance of halos is changed compared
to cold dark matter below the axion Jeans mass. With fixed total HI density,
$\Omega_{\rm HI}$, assumed to reside entirely in halos, this effect introduces
a scale-independent increase in the HI power spectrum on scales above the axion
Jeans scale, which our model predicts consistent with N-body simulations.
Lighter axions introduce a scale-dependent feature even on linear scales due to
its suppression of the matter power spectrum near the Jeans scale. We use the
Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the ability of future HI surveys to
constrain the axion fraction of DM and marginalize over astrophysical and model
uncertainties. We find that a HIRAX-like survey is a very reliable IM survey
configuration, being affected minimally by uncertainties due to non-linear
scales, while the SKA1MID configuration is the most constraining as it is
sensitive to non-linear scales. Including non-linear scales and combining a
SKA1MID-like IM survey with the Simons Observatory CMB, the benchmark ""fuzzy
DM"" model with $m_a = 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ can be constrained at the 10% level.
For lighter ULAs this limit improves below 1%, and allows the possibility to
test the connection between axion models and the grand unification scale across
a wide range of masses.

We aim to study how fundamental starspot properties such as intensity contrast,
temperature and magnetic field strength vary with spectral type. We first
simulated in 2D, multiple spots of each spectral type to find out appropriate
initial conditions for our 3D runs. We find that with increasing stellar
effective temperature, there is an increase in the temperature difference
between the umbra of the spot and its surrounding photosphere, from 350K on the
M0V star to 1400K on the G2V star. This trend in our simulated starspots is
consistent with observations. The magnetic field strengths of all the starspot
umbrae are in the 3-4.5 kG range. The G2V and K0V umbrae have comparable
magnetic field strengths around 3.5 kG, while the M0V umbra has a relatively
higher field strength around 4 kG. We discuss the physical reasons behind both
these trends. All of the three starspots develop penumbral filament-like
structures with Evershed flows. The average Evershed flow speed drops from 1.32
km s$^{-1}$ in the G2V penumbra to 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ in the M0V penumbra.

combinatorial mathematics, introduced in the early $1960$s. A \textit{total
coloring} of a graph $G$ is a map $f:V(G) \cup E(G) \rightarrow \mathcal{K}$,
where $\mathcal{K}$ is a set of colors, satisfying the following three
conditions: 1. $f(u) \neq f(v)$ for any two adjacent vertices $u, v \in V(G)$;
2. $f(e) \neq f(e')$ for any two adjacent edges $e, e' \in E(G)$; and 3. $f(v)
\neq f(e)$ for any vertex $v \in V(G)$ and any edge $e \in E(G)$ that is
incident to the same vertex $v$. The \textit{total chromatic number},
$\chi''(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a \textit{total

graph $G$ $\chi''(G)\leq \Delta + 2$. This conjecture is one of the classic
unsolved mathematical problems. In this paper, we settle this classical
conjecture by proving that the \textit{total chromatic number} $\chi''(G)$ of a
graph is indeed bounded above by $\Delta+2$. Our novel approach involves
algebraic settings over a finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and Vizing's theorem is
an essential part of the algebraic settings.

cyclotron frequency are frequently observed in the solar wind. The waves are
obliquely propagating close to the resonance cone, with significant electric
fields parallel to the background magnetic field, enabling strong interactions
with electrons. Propagation angles are distinctly different from whistlers
usually observed in the solar wind, and amplitudes are significantly larger.
Waves occur most often in association with stream interaction regions (SIRs),
and are often close-packed. 68 percent of the 54 SIRs had narrowband whistler
groups; 33 percent of the nine interplanetary coronal mass ejections had
coherent groups. Although wave occurrence as a function of the electron
temperature anisotropy and parallel beta is constrained by the thresholds for
the whistler temperature anisotropy and firehose instabilities, neither is
consistent with observed wave properties. We show for the first time that
comparisons of wave data to thresholds for the electron beam driven instability
(beam speed greater than twice the electron Alfven speed) and to the whistler
heat flux fan instability indicate that either might destabilize the narrowband
waves. In contrast, the less coherent waves, on average, are associated with
zero or near zero heat flux and much higher electron Alfven speeds, without
higher energy beams. This suggests that the less coherent waves may be more
effective in regulating the electron heat flux, or that the scattering and
energization of solar wind electrons by the narrowband waves results in
broadening of the waves. The highly oblique propagation and large amplitudes of
both the narrowband and less coherent whistlers enable resonant interactions
with electrons over a broad energy range, and, unlike parallel whistlers does
not require that the electrons and waves counter-propagate.

PQE is a generalization of quantifier elimination where one can limit the set
of clauses taken out of the scope of quantifiers to a small subset of target
clauses. The appeal of PQE is twofold. First, PQE can be dramatically simpler
than full quantifier elimination. Second, PQE provides a language for
performing incremental computations. Many verification problems (e.g.
equivalence checking and model checking) are inherently incremental and so can
be solved in terms of PQE. Our approach is based on deriving clauses depending
only on unquantified variables that make the target clauses
$\mathit{redundant}$. Proving redundancy of a target clause is done by
construction of a ""certificate"" clause implying the former. We describe a PQE
algorithm called $\mathit{START}$ that employs the approach above. To evaluate
$\mathit{START}$, we apply it to invariant generation for a sequential circuit
$N$. The goal of invariant generation is to find an $\mathit{unwanted}$
invariant of $N$ proving unreachability of a state that is supposed to be
reachable. If $N$ has an unwanted invariant, it is buggy. Our experiments with
FIFO buffers and HWMCC-13 benchmarks suggest that $\mathit{START}$ can be used

  Semantic Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exploring contextual information in convolution neural networks (CNNs) has
gained substantial attention in recent years for semantic segmentation. This
paper introduces a Bi-directional Contextual Aggregating Network, called
BiCANet, for semantic segmentation. Unlike previous approaches that encode
context in feature space, BiCANet aggregates contextual cues from a categorical
perspective, which is mainly consist of three parts: contextual condensed
projection block (CCPB), bi-directional context interaction block (BCIB), and
muti-scale contextual fusion block (MCFB). More specifically, CCPB learns a
category-based mapping through a split-transform-merge architecture, which
condenses contextual cues with different receptive fields from intermediate
layer. BCIB, on the other hand, employs dense skipped-connections to enhance
the class-level context exchanging. Finally, MCFB integrates multi-scale
contextual cues by investigating short- and long-ranged spatial dependencies.
To evaluate BiCANet, we have conducted extensive experiments on three semantic
segmentation datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. The
experimental results demonstrate that BiCANet outperforms recent
state-of-the-art networks without any postprocess techniques. Particularly,
BiCANet achieves the mIoU score of 86.7%, 82.4% and 38.66% on PASCAL VOC 2012,
Cityscapes and ADE20K testset, respectively.

education has been opened up. It is crucial to have a dropout warning framework
to preemptively identify K-12 students who are at risk of dropping out of the
online courses. Prior researchers have focused on predicting dropout in Massive
Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which often deliver higher education, i.e.,
graduate level courses at top institutions. However, few studies have focused
on developing a machine learning approach for students in K-12 online courses.
In this paper, we develop a machine learning framework to conduct accurate
at-risk student identification specialized in K-12 multimodal online
environments. Our approach considers both online and offline factors around
K-12 students and aims at solving the challenges of (1) multiple modalities,
i.e., K-12 online environments involve interactions from different modalities
such as video, voice, etc; (2) length variability, i.e., students with
different lengths of learning history; (3) time sensitivity, i.e., the dropout
likelihood is changing with time; and (4) data imbalance, i.e., only less than
20\% of K-12 students will choose to drop out the class. We conduct a wide
range of offline and online experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. In our offline experiments, we show that our method improves the
dropout prediction performance when compared to state-of-the-art baselines on a
real-world educational dataset. In our online experiments, we test our approach
on a third-party K-12 online tutoring platform for two months and the results
show that more than 70\% of dropout students are detected by the system.

and the claim that information-theoretic compression is causally linked to
generalization are plausible, empirical evidence was found to be both
supporting and conflicting. We review this evidence together with a detailed
analysis of how the respective information quantities were estimated. Our
survey suggests that compression visualized in information planes is not
necessarily information-theoretic, but is rather often compatible with
geometric compression of the latent representations. This insight gives the
information plane a renewed justification.
  Aside from this, we shed light on the problem of estimating mutual
information in deterministic neural networks and its consequences.
Specifically, we argue that even in feed-forward neural networks the data
processing inequality need not hold for estimates of mutual information.
Similarly, while a fitting phase, in which the mutual information between the
latent representation and the target increases, is necessary (but not
sufficient) for good classification performance, depending on the specifics of
mutual information estimation such a fitting phase need not be visible in the
information plane.

Borrowing between sources can potentially result in more efficient estimators,

observational sources or in clinical trials with noncompliance, causal effect
estimators are needed to simultaneously adjust for confounding and to estimate

assuming exchangeability of the regression coefficients and parameters between

In this work, we propose a method that learns image features targeted for
image-retrieval-based localization. Retrieval-based localization has several
benefits, such as easy maintenance and quick computation. However, the
state-of-the-art features only provide visual similarity scores which do not
explicitly reveal the geometric distance between query and retrieved images.
Knowing this distance is highly desirable for accurate localization, especially
when the reference images are sparsely distributed in the scene. Therefore, we
propose a novel loss function for learning image features which are both
visually representative and geometrically relatable. This is achieved by
guiding the learning process such that the feature and geometric distances
between images are directly proportional. In our experiments we show that our
features not only offer significantly better localization accuracy, but also
allow to estimate the trajectory of a query sequence in absence of the

Fits to the spectral energy distributions using a delayed star formation
history model indicate a subtle but interesting average radial trend for the
spiral galaxies: the inner stellar systems decrease in age with increasing
radius, consistent with inside-out disk formation, but the trend reverses in
the outermost regions with the stellar age nearly as old as the innermost
stars. These results suggest an old stellar outer disk population formed
through radial migration and/or the cumulative history of minor mergers and
accretions of satellite dwarf galaxies. The subset of S0 galaxies studied here
show the opposite trend compared to what is inferred for spirals:
characteristic stellar ages that are increasingly older with radius for the
inner portions of the galaxies, and increasingly younger stellar ages for the

applications powered by deep learning are moving from the cloud to the edge.
When deploying neural networks (NNs) onto the devices under complex
environments, there are various types of possible faults: soft errors caused by
cosmic radiation and radioactive impurities, voltage instability, aging,
temperature variations, and malicious attackers. Thus the safety risk of
deploying NNs is now drawing much attention. In this paper, after the analysis
of the possible faults in various types of NN accelerators, we formalize and
implement various fault models from the algorithmic perspective. We propose
Fault-Tolerant Neural Architecture Search (FT-NAS) to automatically discover
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that are reliable to various
faults in nowadays devices. Then we incorporate fault-tolerant training (FTT)
in the search process to achieve better results, which is referred to as
FTT-NAS. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the discovered architectures
outperform other manually designed baseline architectures significantly, with
comparable or fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameters.
Specifically, with the same fault settings, F-FTT-Net discovered under the
feature fault model achieves an accuracy of 86.2% (VS. 68.1% achieved by
MobileNet-V2), and W-FTT-Net discovered under the weight fault model achieves
an accuracy of 69.6% (VS. 60.8% achieved by ResNet-20). By inspecting the
discovered architectures, we find that the operation primitives, the weight
quantization range, the capacity of the model, and the connection pattern have
influences on the fault resilience capability of NN models.

as deep neural networks (DNN) are not robust and adversarial examples can cause
the model to make a false prediction. The paper considers the problem of
efficiently detecting adversarial examples in LECs used for regression in CPS.
The proposed approach is based on inductive conformal prediction and uses a
regression model based on variational autoencoder. The architecture allows to
take into consideration both the input and the neural network prediction for
detecting adversarial, and more generally, out-of-distribution examples. We
demonstrate the method using an advanced emergency braking system implemented
in an open source simulator for self-driving cars where a DNN is used to
estimate the distance to an obstacle. The simulation results show that the
method can effectively detect adversarial examples with a short detection

Most prior art, however, incurs excessive layout overheads and necessitates
customization of active-device manufacturing processes, i.e., the
front-end-of-line (FEOL). As a result, camouflaging has typically been applied
selectively, which can ultimately undermine its resilience. Here, we propose a
low-cost and generic scheme---full-chip camouflaging can be finally realized
without reservations. Our scheme is based on obfuscating the interconnects,
i.e., the back-end-of-line (BEOL), through design-time handling for real and
dummy wires and vias. To that end, we implement custom, BEOL-centric
obfuscation cells, and develop a CAD flow using industrial tools. Our scheme
can be applied to any design and technology node without FEOL-level
modifications. Considering its BEOL-centric nature, we advocate applying our
scheme in conjunction with split manufacturing, to furthermore protect against
untrusted fabs. We evaluate our scheme for various designs at the physical,
DRC-clean layout level. Our scheme incurs a significantly lower cost than most
of the prior art. Notably, for fully camouflaged layouts, we observe average
power, performance, and area overheads of 24.96%, 19.06%, and 32.55%,
respectively. We conduct a thorough security study addressing the threats
(attacks) related to untrustworthy FEOL fabs (proximity attacks) and malicious
end-users (SAT-based attacks). An empirical key finding is that only
large-scale camouflaging schemes like ours are practically secure against
powerful SAT-based attacks. Another key finding is that our scheme hinders both
placement- and routing-centric proximity attacks; correct connections are
reduced by 7.47X, and complexity is increased by 24.15X, respectively, for such
attacks.

displaying continuity in their relationships. Second, it is difficult for
humans to determine a similarity score that is consistent across a large enough

Prob2Vec, that consists of abstraction and embedding steps. Prob2Vec achieves
96.88\% accuracy on a problem similarity test, in contrast to 75\% from
directly applying state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods. It is
interesting that Prob2Vec is able to distinguish very fine-grained differences
among problems, an ability humans need time and effort to acquire. In addition,
the sub-problem of concept labeling with imbalanced training data set is
interesting in its own right. It is a multi-label problem suffering from
dimensionality explosion, which we propose ways to ameliorate. We propose the
novel negative pre-training algorithm that dramatically reduces false negative

the fluid pressure is equal to a negative matter-energy density providing a

increasingly important in the past years given its various applications in

has been established in several branches of physics such as cavity
electrodynamics, trapped ions, quantum dots, atoms inside cavities and so on.
In this sense, we will discuss the issue of the generation of nonclassical
states in the context of a superconducting qubit in a microcavity. It has been
recently proposed a way to engineer quantum states using a SQUID charge qubit
inside a cavity with a controllable interaction between the cavity field and
the charge qubit. The key ingredients to engineer these quantum states are a
tunable gate voltage and a classical magnetic field applied to SQUID. Some
models including these ingredients and using some appropriate approximations
which allow for the linearization of the interaction and nonclassical states of
the field were generated. Since decoherence is known to affect quantum effects
uninterruptedly and decoherence process are works even when the quantum state
is being formed, therefore, it is interesting to envisage processes through
which quantum superpositions are generated as fast as possible. The decoherence
effect has been studied and quantified in the context of cavity QED where it is
shown that the more quantum is the superposition, more rapidly the
environmental effects occur during the process of creating the quantum state.
In the latter reference, we have succeeded in linearizing the Hamiltonian
through the application of an appropriate unitary transformation and for
certain values of the parameters involved, we have showed that it is possible
to obtain specific Hamiltonians. In this work we will use such approach for
preparing superposition of two squeezed coherent states.

the investigation of Differential Evolution was considered, motivated by the
high efficiency of variations of this technique in real-valued problems. A
basic DE algorithm, namely ""DE/rand/1"" was used to optimize the simulated
design of a targeted drug delivery system for tumor treatment on PhysiCell
simulator. The suggested approach proved to be more efficient than a standard
genetic algorithm, which was not able to escape local minima after a predefined
number of generations. The key attribute of DE that enables it to outperform
standard EAs, is the fact that it keeps the diversity of the population high,
throughout all the generations. This work will be incorporated with ongoing
research in a more wide applicability platform that will design, develop and
evaluate targeted drug delivery systems aiming cancer tumours.

both the actual objective of an effective tumour treatment and the novelty

  Theory of Artifacts in Deep Learning","24 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning is currently the most widespread and successful technology in
artificial intelligence. It promises to push the frontier of scientific
discovery beyond current limits. However, skeptics have worried that deep
neural networks are black boxes, and have called into question whether these
advances can really be deemed scientific progress if humans cannot understand
them. Relatedly, these systems also possess bewildering new vulnerabilities:
most notably a susceptibility to ""adversarial examples"". In this paper, I argue
that adversarial examples will become a flashpoint of debate in philosophy and
diverse sciences. Specifically, new findings concerning adversarial examples
have challenged the consensus view that the networks' verdicts on these cases
are caused by overfitting idiosyncratic noise in the training set, and may
instead be the result of detecting predictively useful ""intrinsic features of
the data geometry"" that humans cannot perceive (Ilyas et al., 2019). These
results should cause us to re-examine responses to one of the deepest puzzles
at the intersection of philosophy and science: Nelson Goodman's ""new riddle"" of
induction. Specifically, they raise the possibility that progress in a number
of sciences will depend upon the detection and manipulation of useful features
that humans find inscrutable. Before we can evaluate this possibility, however,
we must decide which (if any) of these inscrutable features are real but
available only to ""alien"" perception and cognition, and which are distinctive
artifacts of deep learning-for artifacts like lens flares or Gibbs phenomena
can be similarly useful for prediction, but are usually seen as obstacles to
scientific theorizing. Thus, machine learning researchers urgently need to
develop a theory of artifacts for deep neural networks, and I conclude by
sketching some initial directions for this area of research.

performance with increasing data and computation resources. Compared to the
decision system, the perception system is more suitable to be designed in an
end-to-end framework, since it does not require online driving exploration. In
this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for autonomous driving
perception. A latent space is introduced to capture all relevant features
useful for perception, which is learned through sequential latent
representation learning. The learned end-to-end perception model is able to
solve the detection, tracking, localization and mapping problems altogether
with only minimum human engineering efforts and without storing any maps
online. The proposed method is evaluated in a realistic urban driving
simulator, with both camera image and lidar point cloud as sensor inputs. The

video representation learning. The proposed method exploits inherent structure
of unlabeled video data to explicitly enforce temporal coherency in the
embedding space, rather than indirectly learning it through ranking or
predictive proxy tasks. In the same way that high-level visual information in
the world changes smoothly, we believe that nearby frames in learned
representations will benefit from demonstrating similar properties. Using this
assumption, we train our TCE model to encode videos such that adjacent frames
exist close to each other and videos are separated from one another. Using TCE
we learn robust representations from large quantities of unlabeled video data.
We thoroughly analyse and evaluate our self-supervised learned TCE models on a
downstream task of video action recognition using multiple challenging
benchmarks (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51). With a simple but effective 2D-CNN
backbone and only RGB stream inputs, TCE pre-trained representations outperform

  5 main-text figures. 5 supplementary figures. 2 supplementary tables",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Neuroscientific data analysis has traditionally relied on linear algebra and
stochastic process theory. However, the tree-like shapes of neurons cannot be
described easily as points in a vector space (the subtraction of two neuronal
shapes is not a meaningful operation), and methods from computational topology
are better suited to their analysis. Here we introduce methods from Discrete
Morse (DM) Theory to extract the tree-skeletons of individual neurons from
volumetric brain image data, and to summarize collections of neurons labelled
by tracer injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is
sensible to summarize the collection of neurons using a consensus tree-shape
that provides a richer information summary than the traditional regional
'connectivity matrix' approach. The conceptually elegant DM approach lacks
hand-tuned parameters and captures global properties of the data as opposed to
previous approaches which are inherently local. For individual skeletonization
of sparsely labelled neurons we obtain substantial performance gains over
state-of-the-art non-topological methods (over 10% improvements in precision
and faster proofreading). The consensus-tree summary of tracer injections
incorporates the regional connectivity matrix information, but in addition
captures the collective collateral branching patterns of the set of neurons
connected to the injection site, and provides a bridge between single-neuron
morphology and tracer-injection data.

There is limited capacity for the cache and for making content updates. Each
content is associated with a utility function that is monotonically decreasing
in the AoI. For this combinatorial optimization problem, we present the
following contributions. First, we provide theoretical results settling the
boundary of problem tractability. In particular, by a reformulation using
network flows, we prove the boundary is essentially determined by whether or
not the contents are of equal size. Second, we derive an integer linear
formulation for the problem, of which the optimal solution can be obtained for
small-scale scenarios. Next, via a mathematical reformulation, we derive a
scalable optimization algorithm using repeated column generation. In addition,
the algorithm computes a bound of global optimum, that can be used to assess
the performance of any scheduling solution. Performance evaluation of
large-scale scenarios demonstrates the strengths of the algorithm in comparison
