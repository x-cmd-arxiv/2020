visually-collocated fashion items, such as clothes, shoes, bags, etc. While
existing methods demonstrate promising results, they remain lacking in
flexibility and diversity, e.g. assuming a fixed number of items or favoring
safe but boring recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel fashion
collocation framework, Neural Graph Filtering, that models a flexible set of
fashion items via a graph neural network. Specifically, we consider the visual
embeddings of each garment as a node in the graph, and describe the
inter-garment relationship as the edge between nodes. By applying symmetric
operations on the edge vectors, this framework allows varying numbers of
inputs/outputs and is invariant to their ordering. We further include a style
classifier augmented with focal loss to enable the collocation of significantly
diverse styles, which are inherently imbalanced in the training set. To
facilitate a comprehensive study on diverse fashion collocation, we reorganize
Amazon Fashion dataset with carefully designed evaluation protocols. We
evaluate the proposed approach on three popular benchmarks, the Polyvore
dataset, the Polyvore-D dataset, and our reorganized Amazon Fashion dataset.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods with over 10% improvements on the standard AUC
metric on the established tasks. More importantly, 82.5% of the users prefer
our diverse-style recommendations over other alternatives in a real-world
perception study.

compared. Except for Li, the only detectable abundance difference between
lithium-enriched and normal giants among the investigated elements from carbon
to europium occurs for carbon. Among Li-rich giants with A(Li) = 1.8 to 3.1,
the C deficiency is very similar to that reported for the normal giants (with
A(Li) $<$ 1.8) where the slight C deficiency arises from the first dredge-up.
Carbon is slightly under abundant relative to normal giants among the super
Li-rich giants where the Li abundance exceeds A(Li) = 3.2. The C abundance as
well as the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios from the literature suggest that addition
of Li to create a Li-rich giant may occur independently of the abundance
changes wrought by the first dredge-up. Creation of a super Li-rich giant,
however, appears to occur with additional CN-cycle conversion of C to N. The
probability of becoming a Li-rich giant is approximately independent of a
star's mass, although the majority of the Li-rich giants are found to be low
mass ($M \leq$ 2 M$_\odot$). The frequency of occurrence of Li-enriched giants
among normal giants is about one percent and slightly dependent on metallicity
([Fe/H]). Li-enriched and normal giants are found to have similar projected
rotational velocity which suggest that Li-enrichment in giants is not linked to
scenarios such as mergers and tidal interaction between binary stars.

reproducible individual fingerprint, which has opened the possibility of
personalized medicine for neuro/psychiatric disorders. Thus, developing
accurate ways to compare FCs is essential to establish associations with
behavior and/or cognition at the individual-level.
  Methods: Canonically, FCs are compared using Pearson's correlation
coefficient of the entire functional connectivity profiles. Recently, it has
been proposed that the use of geodesic distance is a more accurate way of
comparing functional connectomes, one which reflects the underlying
non-Euclidean geometry of the data. Computing geodesic distance requires FCs to
be positive-definite and hence invertible matrices. As this requirement depends
on the fMRI scanning length and the parcellation used, it is not always
attainable and sometimes a regularization procedure is required.
  Results: In the present work, we show that regularization is not only an
algebraic operation for making FCs invertible, but also that an optimal
magnitude of regularization leads to systematically higher fingerprints. We
also show evidence that optimal regularization is dataset-dependent, and varies
as a function of condition, parcellation, scanning length, and the number of
frames used to compute the FCs.
  Discussion: We demonstrate that a universally fixed regularization does not
fully uncover the potential of geodesic distance on individual fingerprinting,
and indeed could severely diminish it. Thus, an optimal regularization must be
estimated on each dataset to uncover the most differentiable across-subject and
reproducible within-subject geodesic distances between FCs. The resulting
pairwise geodesic distances at the optimal regularization level constitute a
very reliable quantification of differences between subjects.

a forest of spectral lines and directly observing its Doppler shift while
orbiting the host star. In this study, we analyse VLT/CRIRES (R = 100,000)
L-band observations of the non-transiting giant planet HD 179949 b centred
around 3.5 microns. We observe a weak (3.0 sigma, or S/N = 4.8) spectral
signature of H2O in absorption contained within the radial velocity of the
planet at superior-conjunction, with a mild dependence on the choice of line
list used for the modelling. Combining this data with previous observations in
the K-band, we measure a detection significance of 8.4 sigma for an atmosphere
that is most consistent with a shallow lapse-rate, solar C/O ratio, and with CO
and H2O being the only major sources of opacity in this wavelength range. As
the two sets of data were taken three years apart, this points to the absence
of strong radial-velocity anomalies due, e.g., to variability in atmospheric
circulation. We measure a projected orbital velocity for the planet of KP =
(145.2 +- 2.0)kms^{-1} (1 sigma) and improve the error bars on this parameter

  evaporation","12 pages, 12 figures (5 pages, 6 figures for Supplemental Material)",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In drying liquid films of polymer-colloid mixtures, the stratification in
which polymers are placed on top of larger colloids is studied. It is often
presumed that the formation of segregated polymer-colloid layers is solely due
to the proportion in size at fast evaporation as in binary colloid mixtures. By
comparing experiments with a theoretical model, we found that the transition in
viscosity near the drying interface was another important parameter for
controlling the formation of stratified layers in polymer-colloid mixtures. At
high evaporation rates, increased polymer concentrations near the surface lead
to a phase transition from semidilute to concentrated regime, in which
colloidal particles are kinetically arrested. Stratification only occurs if the
formation of a stratified layer precedes the evolution to the concentrated
regime near the drying interfaces. Otherwise, the colloids will be trapped by
the polymers in the concentrated regime before forming a segregated layer.
Also, no stratification is observed if the initial polymer concentration is too
low to form a sufficiently high polymer concentration gradient within a short
period of time. Our findings are relevant for developing solution-cast polymer
composite for painting, antifouling and antireflective coatings.

description, called a Lagrangian multiform or a pluri-Lagrangian structure. The
fundamental object in this theory is not a Lagrange function but a differential
$d$-form that is integrated over arbitrary $d$-dimensional submanifolds. All
such action integrals must be stationary for a field to be a solution to the
pluri-Lagrangian problem. In this paper we present a procedure to obtain
Hamiltonian structures from the pluri-Lagrangian formulation of an integrable
hierarchy of PDEs. As a prelude, we review a similar procedure for integrable
ODEs. We show that exterior derivative of the Lagrangian $d$-form is closely
related to the Poisson brackets between the corresponding Hamilton functions.
In the ODE (Lagrangian 1-form) case we discuss as examples the Toda hierarchy
and the Kepler problem. As examples for the PDE (Lagrangian 2-form) case we
present the potential and Schwarzian Korteweg-de Vries hierarchies, as well as
the Boussinesq hierarchy.

this Gaussian random matrix behavior as the relative strength of the source

functional graphical models with shared structures. In many applications, data
are naturally regarded as a vector of random functions rather than as a vector
of scalars. For example, electroencephalography (EEG) data are treated more
appropriately as functions of time. In such a problem, not only can the number
of functions measured per sample be large, but each function is itself an
infinite-dimensional object, making estimation of model parameters challenging.
This is further complicated by the fact that curves are usually observed only
at discrete time points. We first define a functional differential graph that
captures the differences between two functional graphical models and formally
characterize when the functional differential graph is well defined. We then
propose a method, FuDGE, that directly estimates the functional differential
graph without first estimating each individual graph. This is particularly
beneficial in settings where the individual graphs are dense but the
differential graph is sparse. We show that FuDGE consistently estimates the
functional differential graph even in a high-dimensional setting for both fully
observed and discretely observed function paths. We illustrate the finite
sample properties of our method through simulation studies. We also propose a
competing method, the Joint Functional Graphical Lasso, which generalizes the
Joint Graphical Lasso to the functional setting. Finally, we apply our method
to EEG data to uncover differences in functional brain connectivity between a
group of individuals with alcohol use disorder and a control group.

probe the inner gaseous disc in HMYSOs and investigate the origin and physical
characteristics of the CO bandhead emission (2.3-2.4 $\mu$m). We present the
first GRAVITY/VLTI observations at high spectral (R=4000) and spatial (mas)
resolution of the CO overtone transitions in NGC 2024 IRS2. The continuum
emission is resolved in all baselines and is slightly asymmetric, displaying
small closure phases ($\leq$8$^{\circ}$). Our best ellipsoid model provides a
disc inclination of 34$^{\circ}$$\pm$1$^{\circ}$, a disc major axis position
angle of 166$^{\circ}$$\pm$1$^{\circ}$, and a disc diameter of 3.99$\pm$0.09
mas (or 1.69$\pm$0.04 au, at a distance of 423 pc). The small closure phase
signals in the continuum are modelled with a skewed rim, originating from a
pure inclination effect. For the first time, our observations spatially and
spectrally resolve the first four CO bandheads. Changes in visibility, as well
as differential and closure phases across the bandheads are detected. Both the
size and geometry of the CO-emitting region are determined by fitting a
bidimensional Gaussian to the continuum-compensated CO bandhead visibilities.
The CO-emitting region has a diameter of 2.74$\pm^{0.08}_{0.07}$ mas
(1.16$\pm$0.03 au), and is located in the inner gaseous disc, well within the
dusty rim, with inclination and $PA$ matching the dusty disc geometry, which
indicates that both dusty and gaseous discs are coplanar. Physical and
dynamical gas conditions are inferred by modelling the CO spectrum. Finally, we
derive a direct measurement of the stellar mass of $M_*\sim$14.7$^{+2}_{-3.6}$
M$_{\odot}$ by combining our interferometric and spectral modelling results.

intriguing possibilities to realize unconventional $p$-wave pairing and
Majorana modes. Here, we provide a detailed study of the effect of a uniform
magnetization in the normal region: We show how the interplay between the
spin-momentum locking of the topological insulator and an in-plane
magnetization parallel to the direction of phase bias leads to an asymmetry of
the Andreev spectrum with respect to transverse momenta. If sufficiently large,
this asymmetry induces a transition from a regime of gapless,
counterpropagating Majorana modes to a regime with unprotected modes that are
unidirectional at small transverse momenta. Intriguingly, the
magnetization-induced asymmetry of the Andreev spectrum also gives rise to a
Josephson Hall effect, that is, the appearance of a transverse Josephson
current. The amplitude and current phase relation of the Josephson Hall current
are studied in detail. In particular, we show how magnetic control and gating
of the normal region can enable sizable Josephson Hall currents compared to the
longitudinal Josephson current. Finally, we also propose in-plane magnetic
fields as an alternative to the magnetization in the normal region and discuss
how the planar Josephson Hall effect could be observed in experiments.

when used in polycrystalline form and with a high-concentration of aliovalent

defects in this material are scarcely studied and poorly understood. In this
article, using first-principles simulations, we provide a fundamental
understanding of the atomic-structure, thermodynamic stability and electronic
properties of undoped grain-boundaries (GBs) and alkaline-earth metal (AEM)
doped GBs in ceria. Using density-functional theory simulations, with a GGA+U
functional, we find the $\Sigma$3 (111)/[$\bar{1}$01] GB is thermodynamically
more stable than the $\Sigma$3 (121)/[$\bar{1}$01] GB due to the larger atomic
coherency in the $\Sigma$3 (111)/[$\bar{1}$01] GB plane. We dope the GBs with
$\sim$20% [M]$_{GB}$ (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) and find that the GB energies
have a parabolic dependence on the size of solutes, the interfacial strain and
the packing density of the GB. We see a stabilization of the GBs upon Ca, Sr
and Ba doping whereas Be and Mg render them thermodynamically unstable. The
electronic density of states reveal that no defect states are present in or
above the band gap of the AEM doped ceria, which is highly conducive to
maintain low electronic mobility in this ionic conductor. The electronic
properties, unlike the thermodynamic stability, exhibit complex
inter-dependence on the structure and chemistry of the host and the solutes.
This work makes advances in the atomic-scale understanding of aliovalent cation
doped ceria GBs serving as an anchor to future studies that can focus on
understanding and improving ionic-transport.

  \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{N^2}\#\left\{\substack{1\leq m,n,k,l\leq
N\\\{m,n\}\neq\{k,l\}} : |x_m+x_n-x_k-x_l| \leq \frac{s}{N^2}\right\} = 2s
  \end{equation*}
  then $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is equidistributed. This notion generalizes to
higher orders, and for any $k$ we show that a sequence exhibiting $2k$-fold
Poissonian correlation is equidistributed. In the course of this investigation
we obtain a discrepancy bound for a sequence in terms of its closeness to
$2k$-fold Poissonian correlation. This result refines earlier bounds of
Grepstad & Larcher and Steinerberger in the case of pair correlation, and
resolves an open question of Steinerberger.

The energy barriers between metastable states decrease as the temperature

flexibility. It complicates the control design, compromises the control

new control architecture for controlling flexible-joint robots. Our approach
uses a multi-layer neural network to approximate unknown dynamics needed for
the feedforward control. The network may be viewed as a linear-in-parameter
representation of the robot dynamics, with the nonlinear basis of the robot
dynamics connected to the linear output layer. The output layer weights are
updated based on the tracking error and the nonlinear basis. The internal
weights of the nonlinear basis are updated by online backpropagation to further
reduce the tracking error. To use time scale separation to reduce the coupling
of the two steps - the update of the internal weights is at a lower rate
compared to the update of the output layer weights. With the update of the
output layer weights, our controller adapts quickly to the unknown dynamics
change and disturbances (such as attaching a load). The update of the internal
weights would continue to improve the converge of the nonlinear basis
functions. We show the stability of the proposed scheme under the ""outer loop""
control, where the commanded joint position is considered as the control input.
Simulation and physical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed controller on a Baxter robot, which exhibits
significant joint flexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators.

gravitational-wave detectors, it proves timely to consider how the internal
structure of neutron stars affects the way in which they can be asymmetrically
deformed. Such deformations may leave measurable imprints on gravitational-wave
signals and can be sourced through tidal interactions or the formation of
mountains. We detail the formalism that describes fully-relativistic neutron
star models with elastic crusts undergoing static perturbations. This formalism
primes the problem for studies into a variety of mechanisms that can deform a
neutron star. We present results for a barotropic equation of state and a
realistic model for the elastic crust, which enables us to compute relevant
quantities such as the tidal deformability parameter. We find that the
inclusion of an elastic crust provides a very small correction to the tidal
deformability. The results allow us to demonstrate when and where the crust
starts to fail during a binary inspiral and we find that the majority of the
crust will remain intact up until merger.

error-correction, computational complexity, and pseudorandomness are crucial
concepts for understanding the black hole interior. We assume that the Hawking
radiation emitted by an old black hole is pseudorandom, meaning that it cannot
be distinguished from a perfectly thermal state by any efficient quantum
computation acting on the radiation alone. We then infer the existence of a
subspace of the radiation system which we interpret as an encoding of the black
hole interior. This encoded interior is entangled with the late outgoing
Hawking quanta emitted by the old black hole, and is inaccessible to
computationally bounded observers who are outside the black hole. Specifically,
efficient operations acting on the radiation, those with quantum computational
complexity polynomial in the entropy of the remaining black hole, commute with
a complete set of logical operators acting on the encoded interior, up to
corrections which are exponentially small in the entropy. Thus, under our
pseudorandomness assumption, the black hole interior is well protected from
exterior observers as long as the remaining black hole is macroscopic. On the
other hand, if the radiation is not pseudorandom, an exterior observer may be
able to create a firewall by applying a polynomial-time quantum computation to
the radiation.

signals in global 21-cm signal experiments depend principally on the overlap
between signal and foreground models. In this paper, we investigate two
strategies for decreasing this overlap: (i) utilizing time dependence by
fitting multiple drift-scan spectra simultaneously and (ii) measuring all four
Stokes parameters instead of only the total power, Stokes I. Although measuring
polarization requires different instruments than are used in most existing
experiments, all existing experiments can utilize drift-scan measurements
merely by averaging their data differently. In order to evaluate the increase
in constraining power from using these two techniques, we define a method for
connecting Root-Mean-Square (RMS) uncertainties to probabilistic confidence
levels. Employing simulations, we find that fitting only one total power
spectrum leads to RMS uncertainties at the few K level, while fitting multiple
time-binned, drift-scan spectra yields uncertainties at the $\lesssim 10$ mK
level. This significant improvement only appears if the spectra are modeled
with one set of basis vectors, instead of using multiple sets of basis vectors
that independently model each spectrum. Assuming that they are simulated
accurately, measuring all four Stokes parameters also leads to lower
uncertainties. These two strategies can be employed simultaneously and fitting
multiple time bins of all four Stokes parameters yields the best precision
measurements of the 21-cm signal, approaching the noise level in the data.

are destroyed when tuning to a critical point. In particular, topologically
protected edge states supposedly delocalize when the bulk correlation length
diverges. We show that this is not true in general. Edge states of topological
insulators or superconductors remain exponentially localized---despite a
vanishing band gap---if the transition increases the topological index. This
applies to all classes where the topological classification is larger than
$Z_2$, notably including Chern insulators. Moreover, these edge states are
stable to disorder, unlike in topological semi-metals. This new phenomenon is
explained by generalizing band (or mass) inversion---a unifying perspective on
topological insulators---to kinetic inversion. In the spirit of the
bulk-boundary correspondence, we also identify topological invariants at
criticality, which take half-integer values and separate topologically-distinct
universality classes by a multi-critical point. This work enlarges the scope of
topological protection and stability by showing that bulk energy gaps can be
unnecessary. Experimental probes and stability to interactions are discussed.

Astrometric reductions of a system using the
assumption that the object moves like a single point mass can be biased by
unresolved binary stars. The discrepancy between the centre of mass of the
system (which moves like a point mass) and the centre of light (which is what
we observe) introduces additional motion. We explore the extent to which binary
systems affect single object models fit to astrometric data. This tells us how
observations are diluted by binaries and which systems cause the largest
discrepancies - but also allows us to make inferences about the binarity of
populations based on observed astrometric error. By examining a sample of mock
observations, we show that binaries with periods close to one year can mimic
parallax and thus bias distance measurements, whilst long period binaries can
introduce significant apparent proper motion. Whilst these changes can soak up
some of the error introduced by the binary, the total deviation from the best
fitting model can be translated into a lower limit on the on-sky separation of
the pair. Throughout we link these predictions to data from the Gaia satellite,
whilst leaving the conclusions generalizable to other surveys.

simulations of galaxies formed in a cosmological context, one hosting a fast
bar and the other a slow one. We find that bar length, R_b, measurements
fluctuate on a dynamical timescale by up to 100%, depending on the spiral
structure strength and measurement threshold. The bar amplitude oscillates by
about 15%, correlating with R_b. The Tremaine-Weinberg-method estimates of the
bars' instantaneous pattern speeds show variations around the mean of up to
~20%, typically anti-correlating with the bar length and strength. Through
power spectrum analyses, we establish that these bar pulsations, with a period
in the range ~60-200 Myr, result from its interaction with multiple spiral
modes, which are coupled with the bar. Because of the presence of odd spiral
modes, the two bar halves typically do not connect at exactly the same time to
a spiral arm, and their individual lengths can be significantly offset. We
estimated that in about 50% of bar measurements in Milky Way-mass external
galaxies, the bar lengths of SBab type galaxies are overestimated by ~15% and
those of SBbc types by ~55%. Consequently, bars longer than their corotation
radius reported in the literature, dubbed ""ultra-fast bars"", may simply
correspond to the largest biases. Given that the Scutum-Centaurus arm is likely
connected to the near half of the Milky Way bar, recent direct measurements may
be overestimating its length by 1-1.5 kpc, while its present pattern speed may
be 5-10 km/s/kpc smaller than its time-averaged value.

of mass decouple, causing a single-source astrometric model to perform poorly.
We show that such stars can be easily detected with the reduced chi2 statistic,
or RUWE, provided as part of Gaia DR2. We convert RUWE into the amplitude of
the image centroid wobble, which, if scaled by the source distance, is
proportional to the physical separation between companions (for periods up to
several years). We test this idea on a sample of known spectroscopic binaries
and demonstrate that the amplitude of the centroid perturbation scales with the
binary period and the mass ratio as expected. We apply this technique to the
Gaia DR2 data and show how the binary fraction evolves across the
Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The observed incidence of unresolved companions
is high for massive young stars and drops steadily with stellar mass, reaching
its lowest levels for white dwarfs. We highlight the elevated binary fraction
for the nearby Blue Stragglers and Blue Horizontal Branch stars. We also
illustrate how unresolved hierarchical triples inflate the relative velocity
signal in wide binaries. Finally, we point out a hint of evidence for the
existence of additional companions to the hosts of extrasolar hot jupiters.

magnetization switching using spin orbit torques, which have been reported to

field-free magnetization switching due to a tilt of the anisotropy direction
against the use of an antiferromagnetic bias field. Simple results obtained
analytically show that a bias field not only causes the magnetization reversal
but also reduces the corresponding energy barrier. The critical current
required for magnetization switching is analyzed on the basis of a macrospin

by a tilt of the anisotropy is more robust than the bias field in the
development of memory elements, a compromise between requirements has to be
adopted when selecting the parameters for specific applications.

detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We present
optical+UV photometry of the transient, as well as an X-ray spectrum and radio
upper limits. The bolometric light curve of AT 2018hyz is comparable to other
known TDEs and declines at a rate consistent with a $t^{-5/3}$ at early times,
emitting a total radiated energy of $E = 9\times10^{50}$ erg. An excess bump
appears in the UV light curve about 50 days after bolometric peak, followed by
a flattening beyond 250 days. The light curve shows an excess bump in the UV
about 50 days after bolometric peak lasting for at least 100 days, which may be
related to an outflow. We detect a constant X-ray source present for at least
86 days. The X-ray spectrum shows a total unabsorbed flux of $\sim
4\times10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and is best fit by a blackbody plus
power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma = 0.8$. A thermal X-ray model is
unable to account for photons $> 1$ keV, while the radio non-detection favors
inverse-Compton scattering rather than a jet for the non-thermal component. We
model the optical and UV light curves using the Modular Open-Source Fitter for
Transients (MOSFiT) and find a best fit for a black hole of $5.2\times10^6$
M$_\odot$ partially disrupting a $0.1$ M$_\odot$ star (stripping a mass of
$\sim 0.01$ M$_\odot$ for the inferred impact parameter, $\beta=0.6$). The low

see hydrogen emission with disk-like line profiles in the spectra of AT 2018hyz

AT 2018hyz shows a blue spectral continuum and broad emission lines, consistent
with previous TDE candidates. High cadence follow-up spectra show broad Balmer
lines and He I in early spectra, with He II making an appearance after
$\sim70-100$ days. The Balmer lines evolve from a smooth broad profile, through
a boxy, asymmetric double-peaked phase consistent with accretion disc emission,
and back to smooth at late times. The Balmer lines are unlike typical AGN in
that they show a flat Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta\sim1.5$), suggesting
the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via
photo-ionisation. The flat Balmer decrement together with the complex profiles
suggest that the emission lines originate in a disc chromosphere, analogous to
those seen in cataclysmic variables. The low optical depth of material due to a
possible partial disruption may be what allows us to observe these
double-peaked, collisionally excited lines. The late appearance of He II may be
due to an expanding photosphere or outflow, or late-time shocks in debris
collisions.

BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)? (b) How much entity knowledge is already contained
in pretrained BERT? (c) Does additional entity knowledge improve BERT's

simplification of the entity linking setup that works surprisingly well: simply
cast it as a per token classification over the entire entity vocabulary (over
700K classes in our case). We show on an entity linking benchmark that (i) this
model improves the entity representations over plain BERT, (ii) that it
outperforms entity linking architectures that optimize the tasks separately and
(iii) that it only comes second to the current state-of-the-art that does
mention detection and entity disambiguation jointly. Additionally, we
investigate the usefulness of entity-aware token-representations in the

the fundamentals of the difference set of the extended co-prime array, also

different sources of domain shift between image and video saliency data and

crux of the proposed optimization algorithm is an optimal control of the
minimization precision in each iteration. We establish the optimal precision
control and the resulting order-optimal regret performance for strongly convex

progression of precision across iterations is independent of the
low-dimensional CM routine employed, suggesting a general framework for
extending low-dimensional optimization routines to high-dimensional problems.
The proposed algorithm is amenable to online implementation and inherits the

differential equation of the entropy of the de Sitter black hole in the
higherdimensional de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. Solving
the differential equation, we obtain the corrected entropy and effective
thermodynamic quantities of the de Sitter black hole. The results show that for
multiparameter black holes, the entropy satisfied differential equation is
invariable with different independent state parameters. Therefore, the entropy
of higher-dimensional dS black holes in dRGT massive gravity is only a function
of the position of the black hole horizon, and is independent of other state
parameters. It is consistent with the corresponding entropy of the black hole

construct the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of each AS2COSMOS
SMG, and subsequently model this emission with MAGPHYS to estimate their
photometric redshifts. We find a median photometric redshift for the
S_870um>6.2mJy AS2COSMOS sample of z=2.87+/-0.08, and clear evidence for an
increase in the median redshift with 870-um flux density suggesting strong
evolution in the bright-end of the 870um luminosity function.

of point transformations but here we show how it is also possible to use e

solar (i.e., CI-chondritic) values, in sharp contrast to the non-CI
carbonaceous meteorites and the Earth, which are enriched in refractory
elements and have Mg/Si ratios that are solar or larger. We show that the
formation of a first generation of planetesimals during the condensation of
refractory elements implies the subsequent formation of residual condensates
with strongly sub-solar Al/Si and Mg/Si ratios. The mixing of residual
condensates with different amounts of material with solar refractory/Si element
ratios explains the Al/Si and Mg/Si values of non-carbonaceous chondrites. To
match quantitatively the observed ratios, we find that the first-planetesimals
should have accreted when the disk temperature was ~1,330-1,400 K depending on
pressure and assuming a solar C/O ratio of the disk. We discuss how this model
relates to our current understanding of disk evolution, grain dynamics, and
planetesimal formation. We also extend the discussion to moderately volatile
elements (e.g., Na), explaining how it may be possible that the depletion of
these elements in non-carbonaceous chondrites is correlated with the depletion
of refractory elements (e.g., Al). Extending the analysis to Cr, we find
evidence for a higher than solar C/O ratio in the protosolar disk's gas
when/where condensation from a fractionated gas occurred. Finally, we discuss
the possibility that the supra-solar Al/Si and Mg/Si ratios of the Earth are
due to the accretion of ~40% of the mass of our planet from the
first-generation of refractory-rich planetesimals.

enough energy to be inside its own Schwarzschild radius, and will result in
collapse. In this paper, we consider an inverse problem: what kind of field
ranges arise during the gravitational collapse of a classical field? Despite
the fact that collapse has been studied for almost a hundred years, most of the
discussion is phrased in terms of fluid stress tensors, and not fields. An
exception is the scalar collapse made famous by Choptuik. We re-consider
Choptuik-like systems, but with the emphasis now on the evolution of the
scalar. We give strong evidence that generic spherically symmetric collapse of
a massless scalar field leads to super-Planckian field movement. But we also
note that in every such supercritical collapse scenario, the large field range
is hidden behind an apparent horizon. We also discuss how the familiar perfect
fluid models for collapse like Oppenheimer-Snyder and Vaidya should be viewed

other, is known among the Markov chain Monte Carlo community for being a
remarkably strong result, but it is also known for being one that is notably
difficult to establish. Indeed, one has to prove that the probability to reach
a state $\mathbf{y}$ from a state $\mathbf{x}$, using a sampler, is greater
than or equal to the probability using the other sampler, and this must hold
for all pairs $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ such that $\mathbf{x} \neq

inequality between the probabilities for all these states: essentially, the
dominance holds asymptotically, as a varying parameter grows without bound, as
long as the states for which the probabilities are greater than or equal to
belong to a mass-concentrating set. The weak ordering turns out to be useful to
compare lifted samplers for partially-ordered discrete state-spaces with their
Metropolis--Hastings counterparts. An analysis in great generality yields a
qualitative conclusion: they asymptotically perform better in certain
situations (and we are able to identify them), but not necessarily in others

with adversarial agents and improve resilience guarantees of existing
algorithms. A common approach to achieving resilient vector consensus is that
every non-adversarial (or normal) agent in the network updates its state by
moving towards a point in the convex hull of its \emph{normal} neighbors'
states. Since an agent cannot distinguish between its normal and adversarial
neighbors, computing such a point, often called as \emph{safe point}, is a
challenging task. To compute a safe point, we propose to use the notion of
\emph{centerpoint}, which is an extension of the median in higher dimensions,
instead of Tverberg partition of points, which is often used for this purpose.
We discuss that the notion of centerpoint provides a complete characterization
of safe points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we show that a safe point is
essentially an interior centerpoint if the number of adversaries in the
neighborhood of a normal agent $i$ is less than $\frac{N_i}{d+1} $, where $d$
is the dimension of the state vector and $N_i$ is the total number of agents in
the neighborhood of $i$. Consequently, we obtain necessary and sufficient
conditions on the number of adversarial agents to guarantee resilient vector
consensus. Further, by considering the complexity of computing centerpoints, we
discuss improvements in the resilience guarantees of vector consensus
algorithms and compare with the other existing approaches. Finally, we
numerically evaluate the performance of our approach through experiments.

confidence-guided stereo 3D object detection pipeline that uses separate
decoders for foreground and background pixels during depth estimation, and
leverages the confidence estimation from the depth estimation network as a soft

features ten energy-aligned low effective mass pockets (six along $\Gamma-X$

$T=100-700$~K. Comparison with the previously investigated Ba$_{2}$BiAu
compound shows that the additional $L$-pockets in Sr$_{2}$BiAu significantly
increase its low-temperature power factor to a maximum value of
$12$~mW~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-2}$ near $T=300$~K. However, at high temperatures the
power factor of Sr$_{2}$BiAu drops below that of Ba$_{2}$BiAu because the $L$
states are heavier and subject to strong scattering by phonon deformation as
opposed to the lighter $\Gamma-X$ states that are limited by polar-optical
scattering. Sr$_{2}$SbAu is predicted to deliver lower $n$-type of $zT=3.4$ at
$T=750$~K due to appreciable misalignment between the $L$ and $\Gamma-X$
carrier pockets, generally heavier scattering, and slightly higher lattice
thermal conductivity. Soft acoustic modes, responsible for low lattice thermal
conductivity, also increase vibrational entropies and high-temperature
stability of the Heusler compounds, suggesting that their experimental
synthesis may be feasible. The dominant intrinsic defects are found to be Au
vacancies, which drive the Fermi level towards the conduction band and work in
favor of $n$-doping.

often achieve zero training loss on real-world tasks although the optimization
landscape is known to be highly non-convex. To understand the success of SGD
for training deep neural networks, this work presents a mean-field analysis of
deep residual networks, based on a line of works that interpret the continuum
limit of the deep residual network as an ordinary differential equation when
the network capacity tends to infinity. Specifically, we propose a new
continuum limit of deep residual networks, which enjoys a good landscape in the
sense that every local minimizer is global. This characterization enables us to
derive the first global convergence result for multilayer neural networks in
the mean-field regime. Furthermore, without assuming the convexity of the loss
landscape, our proof relies on a zero-loss assumption at the global minimizer
that can be achieved when the model shares a universal approximation property.
Key to our result is the observation that a deep residual network resembles a
shallow network ensemble, i.e. a two-layer network. We bound the difference
between the shallow network and our ResNet model via the adjoint sensitivity
method, which enables us to apply existing mean-field analyses of two-layer
networks to deep networks. Furthermore, we propose several novel training
schemes based on the new continuous model, including one training procedure
that switches the order of the residual blocks and results in strong empirical
performance on the benchmark datasets.

promising technique to provide both enhanced computational capability and

wireless energy transfer (WET) and for computation offloading is hostile. To
mitigate this hindrance, we propose to employ the emerging technique of
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in WP-MEC systems, which is capable of
providing an additional link both for WET and for computation offloading.
Specifically, we consider a multi-user scenario where both the WET and the
computation offloading are based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) systems. Built on this model, an innovative framework is developed to
minimize the energy consumption of the IRS-aided WP-MEC network, by optimizing
the power allocation of the WET signals, the local computing frequencies of
wireless devices, both the sub-band-device association and the power allocation
used for computation offloading, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients.
The major challenges of this optimization lie in the strong coupling between
the settings of WET and of computing as well as the unit-modules constraint on
IRS reflection coefficients. To tackle these issues, the technique of
alternative optimization is invoked for decoupling the WET and computing
designs, while two sets of locally optimal IRS reflection coefficients are
provided for WET and for computation offloading separately relying on the
successive convex approximation method. The numerical results demonstrate that
our proposed scheme is capable of monumentally outperforming the conventional
WP-MEC network without IRSs.

important recent work discovered that fast inactivation can drastically alter
the conditional FPT distribution of a mortal diffusive searcher, if the

we prove a general theorem which yields an explicit formula for all the moments

universal, as it holds under very general conditions on the diffusive searcher
dynamics, the target, and the spatial domain. These results prove in

compared to the FPT without inactivation is (i) much faster, (ii) much less

transformation on a composite system can be generated using 2-local unitaries,
i.e., those that act only on two subsystems. Beside its fundamental importance
in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the
dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various
constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible
unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can
experience after a sufficiently long time. We ask if such universality remains
valid in the presence of conservation laws and global symmetries. In
particular, can k-local symmetric unitaries on a composite system generate all
symmetric unitaries on that system? Interestingly, it turns out that the answer
is negative in the case of continuous symmetries, such as U(1) and SU(2):
generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using
local symmetric unitaries. In fact, the difference between the dimensions of
the manifold of all symmetric unitaries and the submanifold of unitaries
generated by k-local symmetric unitaries, constantly increases with the system
size. On the other hand, we find that this no-go theorem can be circumvented
using ancillary qubits. For instance, any unitary invariant under rotations
around z can be implemented using Hamiltonian XX+YY together with local Z

in a random graph model proposed by Krioukov et al.~in 2010. In this model,
nodes are chosen randomly inside a disk in the hyperbolic plane and two nodes
are connected if they are at most a certain hyperbolic distance from each
other. It has been shown that this model has various properties associated with
complex networks, e.g. power-law degree distribution, short distances and
non-vanishing clustering coefficient. Here we show that the clustering
coefficient tends in probability to a constant $\gamma$ that we give explicitly
as a closed form expression in terms of $\alpha, \nu$ and certain special
functions. This improves earlier work by Gugelmann et al., who proved that the
clustering coefficient remains bounded away from zero with high probability,
but left open the issue of convergence to a limiting constant. Similarly, we
are able to show that $c(k)$, the average clustering coefficient over all
vertices of degree exactly $k$, tends in probability to a limit $\gamma(k)$
which we give explicitly as a closed form expression in terms of $\alpha, \nu$
and certain special functions. We are able to extend this last result also to
sequences $(k_n)_n$ where $k_n$ grows as a function of $n$. Our results show
that $\gamma(k)$ scales differently, as $k$ grows, for different ranges of
$\alpha$. More precisely, there exists constants $c_{\alpha,\nu}$ depending on
$\alpha$ and $\nu$, such that as $k \to \infty$, $\gamma(k) \sim c_{\alpha,\nu}
\cdot k^{2 - 4\alpha}$ if $\frac{1}{2} < \alpha < \frac{3}{4}$, $\gamma(k) \sim
c_{\alpha,\nu} \cdot \log(k) \cdot k^{-1} $ if $\alpha=\frac{3}{4}$ and
$\gamma(k) \sim c_{\alpha,\nu} \cdot k^{-1}$ when $\alpha > \frac{3}{4}$. These
results contradict a claim of Krioukov et al., which stated that the limiting
values $\gamma(k)$ should always scale with $k^{-1}$ as we let $k$ grow.

Their high-temperature atmospheres (>2,000 K) are ideal laboratories for
studying extreme planetary climates and chemistry. Daysides are predicted to be
cloud-free, dominated by atomic species and substantially hotter than
nightsides. Atoms are expected to recombine into molecules over the nightside,
resulting in different day-night chemistry. While metallic elements and a large
temperature contrast have been observed, no chemical gradient has been measured
across the surface of such an exoplanet. Different atmospheric chemistry
between the day-to-night (""evening"") and night-to-day (""morning"") terminators
could, however, be revealed as an asymmetric absorption signature during
transit. Here, we report the detection of an asymmetric atmospheric signature
in the ultra-hot exoplanet WASP-76b. We spectrally and temporally resolve this
signature thanks to the combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy with a
large photon-collecting area. The absorption signal, attributed to neutral
iron, is blueshifted by -11+/-0.7 km s-1 on the trailing limb, which can be
explained by a combination of planetary rotation and wind blowing from the hot
dayside. In contrast, no signal arises from the nightside close to the morning
terminator, showing that atomic iron is not absorbing starlight there. Iron
must thus condense during its journey across the nightside.

adoption in tasks like depth estimation and optical flow prediction. In
contrast, how to perform forward warping has seen less attention, partly due to
additional challenges such as resolving the conflict of mapping multiple pixels
to the same target location in a differentiable way. We propose softmax
splatting to address this paradigm shift and show its effectiveness on the
application of frame interpolation. Specifically, given two input frames, we
forward-warp the frames and their feature pyramid representations based on an
optical flow estimate using softmax splatting. In doing so, the softmax
splatting seamlessly handles cases where multiple source pixels map to the same
target location. We then use a synthesis network to predict the interpolation
result from the warped representations. Our softmax splatting allows us to not
only interpolate frames at an arbitrary time but also to fine tune the feature
pyramid and the optical flow. We show that our synthesis approach, empowered by
softmax splatting, achieves new state-of-the-art results for video frame
interpolation.

for doubly charged scalars decaying to vector bosons pairs. The doubly charged
scalars are part of a degenerate fermiophobic custodial fiveplet with states
$H_5^{\pm\pm}$, $H_5^\pm$, and $H_5^0$ and common mass $m_5$. The GM model has
been extensively studied at the LHC for $m_5 > 200$ GeV but there is a largely
unprobed region of parameter space from $120$ GeV $< m_5 < 200$ GeV where light
doubly-charged scalars could exist. This region has been neglected by
experimental searches due in part to the lack of a benchmark for $m_5 < 200$
GeV. In this paper we propose a new ""low-$m_5$"" benchmark for the GM model,
defined for $m_5 \in (50, 550)$ GeV, and characterize its properties. We apply
all existing experimental constraints and summarize the phenomenology of the
surviving parameter space. We show that the benchmark populates almost the
entirety of the relevant allowed parameter plane for $m_5$ below 200 GeV and
satisfies the constraints from the 125 GeV Higgs boson signal strengths. We
compute the 125 GeV Higgs boson's couplings to fermion and vector boson pairs
and show that they are always enhanced in the benchmark relative to those in
the Standard Model. We also compute the most relevant production cross sections
for $H_5$ at the LHC, including Drell-Yan production of $H_5$ pairs. The
process $pp \to H \to H_5 H_5$ contributes in a small region of parameter
space, but is small compared to the Drell-Yan production cross section. Finally
we compute the branching ratios of $H_5^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ and $H_5^{\pm} \to
W^{\pm} \gamma$. The width-to-mass ratio of each of the $H_5$ states is below
1\% over the entire benchmark, so that the narrow-width approximation is well
justified.

synchronous and asynchronous design. In contrast, we take the view that the
better question to ask is how synchronous the system can and should be. Based

telescope for observations especially at millimeter wavelengths or shorter
wavelengths, even for a multibeam radio telescope. To analyze a system with a
beam waveguide, a lossless antenna consisting of two apertures in series is
considered in the frame of the scalar wave approximation. We found that the
antenna efficiency can be evaluated with the field distribution over the second
aperture, and that the antenna efficiency is factorized into three factors:
efficiencies of beam coupling, transmission spillover, and reception spillover.
The factorization is applicable to general aperture-type antennas with beam
waveguides, and can relate the aperture efficiency to the pupil function. We
numerically confirmed our factorization with an optical simulation. This
evaluation enables us to manage the aberrations and is useful in design of
multibeam radio telescopes.

two error formalisms: the average and maximum error criteria, where the
averaging and maximization are taken with respect to the side-information of
the source. Applying our asymptotic expansions to the derived one-shot coding

in non-degenerate settings, the first-order fundamental limits differ under the
average and maximum error criteria. This is in contrast to a different but
related setting considered by the present authors (for variable-length

identical but the second-order terms are different under these criteria.

bounds is in one-to-one correspondence with the non-perturbative saturation of
unitarity by 2-to-N particle scattering amplitudes at the point of optimal
truncation. These bounds are more stringent than Bekenstein's bound and in a
consistent theory all three get saturated simultaneously. This is true for all
known entropy-saturating objects such as solitons, instantons, baryons,
oscillons, black holes or simply lumps of classical fields. We refer to these
collectively as ""saturons"" and show that in renormalizable theories they behave
in all other respects like black holes. Finally, it is argued that the

State-of-the-art methods show promising results by representing shapes using
implicit functions in 3D that are learned using discriminative neural networks.
However, learning implicit functions requires dense and irregular sampling in
3D space, which also makes the sampling methods affect the accuracy of shape
reconstruction during test. To avoid dense and irregular sampling in 3D, we
propose to represent shapes using 2D functions, where the output of the
function at each 2D location is a sequence of line segments inside the shape.
Our approach leverages the power of functional representations, but without the
disadvantage of 3D sampling. Specifically, we use a voxel tubelization to
represent a voxel grid as a set of tubes along any one of the X, Y, or Z axes.
Each tube can be indexed by its 2D coordinates on the plane spanned by the
other two axes. We further simplify each tube into a sequence of occupancy
segments. Each occupancy segment consists of successive voxels occupied by the
shape, which leads to a simple representation of its 1D start and end location.
Given the 2D coordinates of the tube and a shape feature as condition, this
representation enables us to learn 3D shape structures by sequentially
predicting the start and end locations of each occupancy segment in the tube.
We implement this approach using a Seq2Seq model with attention, called
SeqXY2SeqZ, which learns the mapping from a sequence of 2D coordinates along
two arbitrary axes to a sequence of 1D locations along the third axis.
SeqXY2SeqZ not only benefits from the regularity of voxel grids in training and
testing, but also achieves high memory efficiency. Our experiments show that
SeqXY2SeqZ outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods under widely used
benchmarks.

  https://github.com/mtensor/rulesynthesis",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many aspects of human reasoning, including language, require learning rules
from very little data. Humans can do this, often learning systematic rules from
very few examples, and combining these rules to form compositional rule-based
systems. Current neural architectures, on the other hand, often fail to
generalize in a compositional manner, especially when evaluated in ways that
vary systematically from training. In this work, we present a neuro-symbolic
model which learns entire rule systems from a small set of examples. Instead of
directly predicting outputs from inputs, we train our model to induce the
explicit system of rules governing a set of previously seen examples, drawing
upon techniques from the neural program synthesis literature. Our
rule-synthesis approach outperforms neural meta-learning techniques in three
domains: an artificial instruction-learning domain used to evaluate human
learning, the SCAN challenge datasets, and learning rule-based translations of
number words into integers for a wide range of human languages.

half-hypermultiplet arises for generic complex structures achieving them. The
exceptional fibers at the enhanced point exhibit different structures depending
on how the colliding 7-brane approaches the stack of gauge 7-branes, as
previously observed by Morrison and Taylor in the case of the enhancement from
$SU(6)$ to $E_6$. When the colliding brane approaches them as $O(s)$, where $s$
is the coordinate of the base space along the gauge 7-branes, the resolution
process ends up with fewer exceptional fibers than naively expected from the
Kodaira classification, with a non-Dynkin intersection matrix including
half-integral intersection numbers. We confirm that the exceptional fibers at
the enhanced point form extremal rays of the cone of the positive weights of
the relevant pseudo-real representation, explaining why a half-hypermultiplet
arises there. By altering the ordering of the singularities blown up in the
process, we obtain, for both $SO(12)\rightarrow E_7$ and $E_7\rightarrow E_8$,
the intersection diagram on every other row of the corresponding box graphs. We
present detailed derivations of the intersection diagrams of the exceptional
fibers at the singularity enhanced points by examining how an exceptional curve
is lifted up on the chart arising due to the subsequent blowing-up process.
When the colliding brane approaches the stack of branes as $O(s^2)$, we obtain
additional conifold singularity at the enhanced point, which completes the full
Dynkin diagram of the enhanced group as was found previously.

implementation stage of a movable autonomous service robot. To this end, we
leverage the idea of directed fuzzing and design RoboFuzz that systematically
tests an autonomous service robot in line with the robot's states and the
surrounding environment. The methodology of RoboFuzz is to study critical
environmental parameters affecting the robot's state transitions and subject
the robot control program with rational but harmful sensor values so as to
compromise the robot. Furthermore, we develop detection and mitigation
algorithms to counteract the impact of RoboFuzz. The difficulties mainly lie in
the trade-off among limited computation resources, timely detection and the
retention of work efficiency in mitigation. In particular, we propose detection
and mitigation methods that take advantage of historical records of obstacles
to detect inconsistent obstacle appearances regarding untrustworthy sensor
values and navigate the movable robot to continue moving so as to carry on a
planned task. By doing so, we manage to maintain a low cost for detection and
mitigation but also retain the robot's work efficacy. We have prototyped the
bundle of RoboFuzz, detection and mitigation algorithms in a real-world movable
robot. Experimental results confirm that RoboFuzz makes a success rate of up to
93.3% in imposing concrete threats to the robot while the overall loss of work
efficacy is merely 4.1% at the mitigation mode.

small batches constrained by memory consumption, 2) training on mobile or

propose a simple but effective method, called extended batch normalization
(EBN). For NCHW format feature maps, extended batch normalization computes the
mean along the (N, H, W) dimensions, as the same as batch normalization, to
maintain the advantage of batch normalization. To alleviate the problem caused
by small batch size, extended batch normalization computes the standard
deviation along the (N, C, H, W) dimensions, thus enlarges the number of
samples from which the standard deviation is computed. We compare extended
batch normalization with batch normalization and group normalization on the

and a large battery is needed to provide meaningful resiliency. By using
forecast of solar generation and household demand, an intelligent decision
maker can operate the equipment (battery and critical loads) to ensure that the
critical loads are serviced to the maximum duration possible. With the aid of
such an intelligent control system, a smaller (and thus lower cost) system can
service the primary loads for the same duration that a much larger system will

  In this paper we propose such an intelligent control system. A model
predictive control (MPC) architecture is used that uses available measurements
and forecasts to make optimal decisions for batteries and critical loads in
real time. The optimization problem is formulated as a MILP (mixed integer
linear program) due to the on/off decisions for the loads. Performance is
compared with a non-intelligent baseline controller, for a PV-battery system

conducted for a one week period during hurricane Irma in 2017. Simulations show
that the cost of the PV+battery system to provide a certain resiliency

exposition, we focus on two special problems in this paper: Boolean Conjunctive
Query (BCQ) and computing variable/factor marginals in Probabilistic Graphical

such queries as long as the underlying hypergraph of the query is
$O(1)$-degenerate and has $O(1)$-arity. In particular, the $O(1)$-degeneracy
condition covers most well-studied queries that are efficiently computable in
the centralized computation model like queries with constant treewidth. These
tight bounds depend on a new notion of `width' (namely internal-node-width) for
Generalized Hypertree Decompositions (GHDs) of acyclic hypergraphs, which
minimizes the number of internal nodes in a sub-class of GHDs. To the best of
our knowledge, this width has not been studied explicitly in the theoretical

COVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide important information for vaccine

trees of the human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strains
from 79 countries. This finding has important implications to the management of
COVID-19 and the development of vaccines and medications.

  Connectivity of A Graph Metric",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bobkov, Houdr\'e, and the last author [2000] introduced a Poincar\'e-type
functional parameter, $\lambda_\infty$, of a graph and related it to
connectivity of the graph via Cheeger-type inequalities. A work by the second
author, Raghavendra, and Vempala [2013] related the complexity of
$\lambda_\infty$ to the so-called small-set expansion (SSE) problem and further
set forth the desiderata for NP-hardness of this optimization problem. We
confirm the conjecture that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is NP-hard for weighted
trees.
  Beyond measuring connectivity in many applications we want to optimize it.
This, via convex duality, leads to a problem in machine learning known as the
Maximum Variance Embedding (MVE). The output is a function from vertices to a
low dim Euclidean space, subject to bounds on Euclidean distances between
neighbors. The objective is to maximize output variance. Special cases of MVE
into $n$ and $1$ dims lead to absolute algebraic connectivity [1990] and spread
constant [1998], that measure connectivity of the graph and its Cartesian
$n$-power, respectively. MVE has other applications in measuring diffusion
speed and robustness of networks, clustering, and dimension reduction.
  We show that computing MVE in tree-width dims is NP-hard, while only one
additional dim beyond width of a given tree-decomposition makes the problem in
P. We show that MVE of a tree in 2 dims defines a non-convex yet benign
optimization landscape, i.e., local=global optima. We further develop a linear
time combinatorial algorithm for this case. Finally, we denote approximate
Maximum Variance Embedding is tractable in significantly lower dims. For trees
and general graphs, for which Maximum Variance Embedding cannot be solved in
less than $2$ and $\Omega(n)$ dims, we provide $1+\varepsilon$ approximation
algorithms for embedding into $1$ and $O(\log n /\varepsilon^2)$ dims,
respectively.

detection, which means to simultaneously recognize and localize activities in
long untrimmed videos. Currently, the most effective methods of temporal
activity detection are based on deep learning, and they typically perform very
well with large scale annotated videos for training. However, these methods are
limited in real applications due to the unavailable videos about certain
activity classes and the time-consuming data annotation. To solve this
challenging problem, we propose a novel task setting called zero-shot temporal
activity detection (ZSTAD), where activities that have never been seen in
training can still be detected. We design an end-to-end deep network based on
R-C3D as the architecture for this solution. The proposed network is optimized
with an innovative loss function that considers the embeddings of activity
labels and their super-classes while learning the common semantics of seen and
unseen activities. Experiments on both the THUMOS14 and the Charades datasets
show promising performance in terms of detecting unseen activities.

Markoff's proof of this fact, several authors have showed that the structure of

multi-scale fusion networks (SFANet) and SegNet for accurate and efficient
crowd counting. Inspired by SFANet, the first model, which is named M-SFANet,
is attached with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and context-aware module
(CAN). The encoder of M-SFANet is enhanced with ASPP containing parallel atrous
convolutional layers with different sampling rates and hence able to extract
multi-scale features of the target object and incorporate larger context. To
further deal with scale variation throughout an input image, we leverage the
CAN module which adaptively encodes the scales of the contextual information.
The combination yields an effective model for counting in both dense and sparse
crowd scenes. Based on the SFANet decoder structure, M-SFANet's decoder has
dual paths, for density map and attention map generation. The second model is
called M-SegNet, which is produced by replacing the bilinear upsampling in
SFANet with max unpooling that is used in SegNet. This change provides a faster
model while providing competitive counting performance. Designed for high-speed
surveillance applications, M-SegNet has no additional multi-scale-aware module
in order to not increase the complexity. Both models are encoder-decoder based
architectures and are end-to-end trainable. We conduct extensive experiments on
five crowd counting datasets and one vehicle counting dataset to show that
these modifications yield algorithms that could improve state-of-the-art crowd
counting methods. Codes are available at

choosing different projection (forward) steps. Both proposed methods also work
efficiently without assuming the Lipschitz continuity and without directly
using the cocoercive constant. Moreover, they have the following desired
features: (i) very general iterations are derived for both methods, recovering
the FBF and the FBHF iterations and allowing possibly larger stepsizes if the
projection steps are over-relaxing; and (ii) strong convergence to the best
approximation solution of the problem is proved for Method 2. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time that an FBF-type method converges
strongly for finding the best approximation solution of the three operator

recently due to the increasing popularity of location-based networks, e.g.,

Matrix Factorization (MF) based techniques have proven to be effective.
However, existing MF approaches suffer from two major problems: (1) Expensive
computations and storages due to the centralized model training mechanism: the
centralized learners have to maintain the whole user-item rating matrix, and
potentially huge low rank matrices. (2) Privacy issues: the users' preferences
are at risk of leaking to malicious attackers via the centralized learner. To
solve these, we present a Decentralized MF (DMF) framework for POI
recommendation. Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices
and sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based
decentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, e.g.,
cell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on
one's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as
distributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the
computation and storage issue. Experimental results on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that, comparing with the classic and state-of-the-art latent factor
models, DMF significantly improvements the recommendation performance in terms

tests. However, the powers of these tests are still severely limited due to the

of individual SNPs are substantially impossible. In this article, we provide an
efficient set-based inference framework that addresses the two important issues
simultaneously based on a Bayesian semiparametric multilevel mixture model. We
propose to use the multilevel hierarchical model that incorporate the
variations in set-specific effects and variant-specific effects, and to apply
the optimal discovery procedure (ODP) that achieves the largest overall power

of the proposed methods is demonstrated through application to a genome-wide

effort and cost, especially when it is done manually. Besides, during this
process, developers and testers are likely to adopt bad design choices, which
may lead to the introduction of the so-called test smells in test code. Test
smells are bad solutions to either implement or design test code. As the test
code with test smells increases in size, these tests might become more complex,
and as a consequence, much harder to understand and evolve correctly.
Therefore, test smells may have a negative impact on the quality and
maintenance of test code and may also harm the whole software testing
activities. In this context, this study aims to understand whether test
professionals non-intentionally insert test smells. We carried out an expert
survey to analyze the usage frequency of a set of test smells. Sixty
professionals from different companies participated in the survey. We selected
14 widely studied smells from the literature, which are also implemented in
existing test smell detection tools. The yielded results indicate that
experienced professionals introduce test smells during their daily programming
tasks, even when they are using standardized practices from their companies,
and not only for their personal assumptions. Another relevant evidence was that

from a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer into a 3D architecture. Despite the
importance of controlling the growth of microbial colonies and biofilms in a
variety of medical and industrial settings, the underlying physical mechanisms
behind single-cell dynamics, collective behaviors of densely-packed cells, and
3D complex colony expansion remain largely unknown. In this work, we explore
the mechanisms behind the 2D-to-3D transition of motile Pseudomonas aeruginosa
colonies; we provide a new motility-induced, rate-dependent buckling mechanism
for their out-of-plane growth. We find that swarming of motile bacterial
colonies generate sustained in-plane flows. We show that the viscous shear
stresses and dynamic pressures arising from these flows allow cells to overcome
cell-substrate adhesion, leading to buckling of bacterial monolayers and growth
into the third dimension. Modeling bacterial monolayers as 2D fluid films, we
identify universal relationships that elucidate the competition between
in-plane viscous stresses, pressure and cell-substrate adhesion. Furthermore,
we show that bacterial monolayers can exhibit crossover from swarming to
kinetically-arrested, glassy-like states above an onset density, resulting in
distinct 2D-to-3D transition mechanisms. Combining experimental observations of
P. aeruginosa colonies at single-cell resolution, molecular dynamics
simulations of active systems, and theories of glassy dynamics and 2D fluid

of essential and critical structures, like hospitals, universities and bridges,
located in earthquake-prone areas. The purpose of using LRB is providing the
structure with period lengthening and the capacity of dissipating a
considerable amount of earthquake energy to mitigate the effects of strong
ground motions. Therefore, studying the damage mechanics of this kind of
devices is fundamental to understand and accurately describe their
thermomechanical behavior, so that seismically isolated structures can be
designed more safely.
  Traditionally, up to this point, the hysteretic behavior of LBR has been
modeled using 1) Newtonian mechanics and empirical curve fitting degradation
functions, or 2) heat conduction theories and idealized bilinear curves which
include degradation effects. The reason for using models that are essentially
phenomenological or that contain some adjusted parameters is the fact that
universal laws of motion by Newton lack the term to account for degradation and
energy loss of a system. In this paper, the Unified Mechanics Theory, which
integrates laws of Thermodynamics and Newtonian mechanics at ab-initio level,
is used to model the force-displacement response of LRB. When Unified Mechanics
Theory is used, there is no need for curve fitting techniques to describe the
degradation behavior of the material. Damage or degradation at every point is
calculated using entropy generation and the physics based fundamental equations
of the material along the Thermodynamics State Index (TSI) axis.
  A finite element model of a lead-rubber bearing was constructed in ABAQUS,
where a user material subroutine UMAT was implemented to define the Unified
Mechanics Theory equations and the viscoplastic constitutive model for lead.

advertising industries can have terabyte-scale parameters that do not fit in
the GPU memory nor the CPU main memory on a computing node. For example, a

parameter server for massive scale deep learning ads systems. We propose a
hierarchical workflow that utilizes GPU High-Bandwidth Memory, CPU main memory

evaluation (OPE) methods for sequential decision making problems can estimate
the performance of evaluation policies before deploying them. This assumption
is frequently violated due to unobserved confounders, unrecorded variables that
impact both the decisions and their outcomes. We assess robustness of OPE
methods under unobserved confounding by developing worst-case bounds on the
performance of an evaluation policy. When unobserved confounders can affect
every decision in an episode, we demonstrate that even small amounts of
per-decision confounding can heavily bias OPE methods. Fortunately, in a number
of important settings found in healthcare, policy-making, operations, and
technology, unobserved confounders may primarily affect only one of the many
decisions made. Under this less pessimistic model of one-decision confounding,
we propose an efficient loss-minimization-based procedure for computing
worst-case bounds, and prove its statistical consistency. On two simulated

many labeled images. Operating costs of retraining a model becomes very
expensive because the object shape of a product or a part often is changed in a
factory. It is important to reduce the amount of labeled images required to
train a model for a picking robot. In this study, we propose a multi-task
learning framework for few-shot classification using feature vectors from an
intermediate layer of a model that detects grasping positions. In the field of
manufacturing, multitask for shape classification and grasping-position
detection is often required for picking robots. Prior multi-task learning
studies include methods to learn one task with feature vectors from a deep
neural network (DNN) learned for another task. However, the DNN that was used
to detect grasping positions has two problems with respect to extracting
feature vectors from a layer for shape classification: (1) Because each layer
of the grasping position detection DNN is activated by all objects in the input
image, it is necessary to refine the features for each grasping position. (2)
It is necessary to select a layer to extract the features suitable for shape
classification. To tackle these issues, we propose a method to refine the
features for each grasping position and to select features from the optimal
layer of the DNN. We then evaluated the shape classification accuracy using
these features from the grasping positions. Our results confirm that our
proposed framework can classify object shapes even when the input image
includes multiple objects and the number of images available for training is
small.

stable or unstable ionization fronts (I-fronts) observed in simulations of
moving black holes (BHs). The front instability may trigger bursts of gas
accretion, rendering the BH significantly more luminous than at steady-state.
We perform a series of idealized three dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
simulations resolving the I-fronts around BHs of mass $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and
velocity $v_\infty$ accreting from a medium of density $n_\mathrm{H}$. The
I-front, with radius $R_\mathrm{I}$, transitions from D-type to R-type as the
BH velocity becomes larger than a critical value $v_\mathrm{R}\sim
40\,\mathrm{km/s}$. The D-type front is preceded by a bow-shock of thickness
$\Delta R_\mathrm{I}$ that decreases as $v_\infty$ approaches $v_\mathrm{R}$.
We find that both D-type and R-type fronts can be unstable given the following
two conditions: i) for D-type fronts the shell thickness must be $\Delta
R_\mathrm{I}/R_\mathrm{I}<0.05$ (i.e., $v_\infty \gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$.),
while no similar restriction holds for R-type fronts; ii) the temperature jump
across the I-front must be $T_\mathrm{II}/T_\mathrm{I}>3$. This second
condition is satisfied if $T_\mathrm{I}<5000\,\mathrm{K}$ or if
$n_\mathrm{H}\,M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^6\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Due to
X-ray pre-heating typically $T_\mathrm{I} \sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$, unless the
D-type shell is optically thick to X-rays, which also happens when
$n_\mathrm{H}\,M_\mathrm{BH}$ is greater than a metallicity-dependent critical
value. We thus conclude that I-fronts around BHs are unstable only for
relatively massive BHs moving trough very dense molecular clouds. We briefly
discuss the observational consequences of the X-ray luminosity bursts likely
associated with this instability.

revisited by taking into account relativistic corrections. The decay amplitudes
are derived in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, in which the involved one-loop
integrals are evaluated analytically. Intriguingly, from both the
quark-antiquark content and the gluonic content of $\eta^{(\prime)}$, the
relativistic corrections make significant contributions to the decay rates of
$h_{c}\rightarrow\gamma\eta^{(\prime)}$. By comparison with the leading-order
contributions from the quark-antiquark content (one-loop level), the ones from
the gluonic content (tree level) are also important, which is compatible with
the conclusion obtained without relativistic corrections. Usually, for $\eta$
production processes, the predicted branching ratios are sensitive to the angle
of $\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing. As an illustration, using the
Feldmann-Kroll-Stech result about the mixing angle
$\phi=39.3^{\circ}\pm1.0^{\circ}$ as input, we find that the predicted ratio
$R_{h_{c}}=\mathcal{B}(h_{c}\rightarrow\gamma\eta)/\mathcal{B}(h_{c}\rightarrow\gamma\eta^{\prime})$
is much smaller than the experiment measurement. While, with
$\phi=33.5^{\circ}\pm0.9^{\circ}$ extracted from the asymptotic limit of the
$\gamma^{\ast}\gamma-\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factor, we obtain
$R_{h_{c}}=30.3\%$ in consistent with $R_{h_{c}}^{exp}=(30.7\pm11.3\pm8.7)\%$.
As a cross-check, the mixing angle $\phi=33.8^{\circ}\pm2.5^{\circ}$ is
extracted by employing the ratio $R_{h_{c}}$, and a brief discussion on the
difference in the determinations of $\phi$ is given.

exactly one item out of a single heap of identical items, until the heap is

decreases by one unit depending on whether the maximizing player won the turn

domain by leveraging the knowledge from a labeled source domain. This can be
achieved by learning a domain-invariant feature space. Though the learned
representations are separable in the source domain, they usually have a large
variance and samples with different class labels tend to overlap in the target
domain, which yields suboptimal adaptation performance. To fill the gap, a
Fisher loss is proposed to learn discriminative representations which are
within-class compact and between-class separable. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that the Fisher loss is a general and effective loss
for deep domain adaptation. Noticeable improvements are brought when it is used
together with widely adopted transfer criteria, including MMD, CORAL and domain

reconstruct the distribution of the overall ultrasound attenuation in tissue

reflector. This requires a standard ultrasound transducer operating in
pulse-echo mode and a calibration protocol using water measurements, thus it
can be implemented on conventional ultrasound systems with minor adaptations.
Herein, we extend this method by additionally estimating and imaging the
frequency-dependent nature of local ultrasound attenuation for the first time.
Spatial distributions of attenuation coefficient and exponent are
reconstructed, enabling an elaborate and expressive tissue-specific
characterization. With simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed method
yields a low reconstruction error of 0.04dB/cm at 1MHz for attenuation
coefficient and 0.08 for the frequency exponent. With tissue-mimicking phantoms

reproducibility are demonstrated. Attenuation exponents of a gelatin-cellulose

growth of galaxies mostly via negative feedback. However, their effects on
their hosts are far from clear, especially for low and moderate luminosity
Seyferts. To investigate this issue, we have obtained cold molecular gas
observations, traced by the CO(2-1) transition, using the NOEMA interferometer
of five nearby (distances between 19 and 58 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies. The
resolution of approx. 0.3-0.8 arcsec (approx. 30-100 pc) and field of view of
NOEMA allowed us to study the CO(2-1) morphology and kinematics in the nuclear
regions (approx. 100 pc) and up to radial distances of approx. 900 pc. We have
detected CO(2-1) emission in all five galaxies with disky or circumnuclear ring
like morphologies. We derived cold molecular gas masses on nuclear (approx. 100
pc) and circumnuclear (approx. 650 pc) scales in the range from $10^6$ to
$10^7$M$_{\odot}$ and from $10^7$ to $10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively. In all
of our galaxies the bulk of this gas is rotating in the plane of the galaxy.
However, non-circular motions are also present. In NGC 4253, NGC 4388 and NGC
7465, we can ascribe the streaming motions to the presence of a large-scale
bar. In Mrk 1066 and NGC 4388, the non-circular motions in the nuclear regions
are explained as outflowing material due to the interaction of the AGN wind
with molecular gas in the galaxy disk. We conclude that for an unambiguous and
precise interpretation of the kinematics of the cold molecular gas we need a
detailed knowledge of the host galaxy (i.e., presence of bars, interactions,
etc) as well as of the ionized gas kinematics and the ionization cone geometry.

conditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv.

of stable mass transfer from evolved red giants. The orbits of these binaries
show a strong correlation between their orbital periods and mass ratios. The
origins of this correlation have, so far, been lacking a conclusive
explanation. We aim to find a binary evolution model which can explain the
observed correlation. Radii of evolved red giants, and hence the resulting
orbital periods, strongly depend on their metallicity. We have performed a
small but statistically significant binary population synthesis study with the
binary stellar evolution code MESA. We have used a standard model for binary
mass loss and a standard Galactic metallicity history. The resulting sdBs were
selected based on the same criteria as used in observations and then compared
with the observed population. We have achieved an excellent match to the
observed period - mass ratio correlation without explicitly fine-tuning any
parameters. Furthermore, our models produce a good match to the observed period
- metallicity correlation. We predict several new correlations which link the
observed sdB binaries to their progenitors, and a correlation between the
period, metallicity and core mass for subdwarfs and young low-mass He white
dwarfs. We also predict that sdB binaries have distinct orbital properties
depending on whether they formed in the bulge, thin or thick disc, or the halo.
We demonstrate, for the first time, how the metallicity history of the Milky
Way is imprinted in the properties of the observed post-mass transfer binaries.
We show that Galactic chemical evolution is an important factor in binary
population studies of interacting systems containing at least one evolved
low-mass (Mi < 1.6 Msol) component. Finally, we provide an observationally
supported model of mass transfer from low-mass red giants onto main-sequence
stars.

Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number are more accurate at the late
stage of an epidemic. And the transition-like behavior of exponential growth
method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection
point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Compared to
ODE-based SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models
generally show a better performance on studying the COVID-19 epidemics, whose
success we believe could be attributed to a proper trade-off between model

the star. The neutron star crust experiences shear stress due to the
oscillations and, if the resonant amplitudes are large enough, may become
over-strained. This over-straining can lead to fractures or quakes which
release energy, thereby fueling precursor activity prior to the merger. Using
some simple Maclaurin spheroid models, we investigate the influence of magnetic
fields and rapid rotation on tidally-forced $f$- and $r$- modes, and connect
the associated eigenfrequencies with the orbital frequencies corresponding to
precursor events seen in, for example, GRB 090510.

means of quantum superchannels, also known as process matrices. Quantum
superchannels with multiple slots are deterministic transformations whichtake
independent quantum operations as inputs. While they are enforced to respect
the laws of quantum mechanics, the use of input operations may lack a definite
causal order, and characterizations of general superchannels in terms of
quantum objects with a physical implementation have been missing. In this
paper, we provide a mathematical characterization for pure superchannels with
two slots (also known as bipartite pure processes), which are superchannels
preserving the reversibility of quantum operations. We show that the
reversibility preserving condition restricts all pure superchannels with two
slots to be either a quantum circuit only consisting of unitary operations or a
coherent superposition of two unitary quantum circuits where the two input
operations are differently ordered. The latter may be seen as a generalization
of the quantum switch, allowing a physical interpretation for pure two-slot
superchannels. An immediate corollary is that purifiable bipartite processes
cannot violate device-independent causal inequalities.

previous studies, we propose a new method called Denoising Autoencoder with
Temporal and Categorical Constraints (DAE_CTC)} to study the skeletal

learning under privileged information, we integrate action categories and
temporal coordinates into a stacked denoising autoencoder in the training
phase, to preserve category and temporal feature, while learning the hidden
representation from a skeleton. Thus, we are able to improve the discriminative
validity of the hidden representation. In order to mitigate the variation
resulting from temporary misalignment, a new method of temporal registration,
called Locally-Warped Sequence Registration (LWSR), is proposed for registering
the sequences of inter- and intra-class actions. We finally represent the
sequences using a Fourier Temporal Pyramid (FTP) representation and perform
classification using a combination of LWSR registration, FTP representation,
and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results on three
action data sets, namely MSR-Action3D, UTKinect-Action, and Florence3D-Action,
show that our proposal performs better than many existing methods and
comparably to the state of the art.

evaluate chiral and deconfinement transition temperatures. It is found that,
inclusion of the AMM of the quarks in presence of the background magnetic field
results in a substantial decrease in the chiral as well as deconfinement
transition temperatures in contrast to an enhancement in the chiral transition
temperature in its absence. Using standard techniques of finite temperature
field theory, the two point thermo-magnetic mesonic correlation functions in
the scalar ($\sigma$) and neutral pseudoscalar ($\pi^0$) channels are evaluated
to calculate the masses of $\sigma $ and $ \pi^0 $ considering the AMM of the

compare the characteristics of algal blooms in the shallow and deep water, we
consider the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman as a case study. While the Arabian
Gulf is a shallow region dominated by advective features, the Sea of Oman is a
deep channel dominated by numerous eddies. Both these regions is have rarely
been studied due to lack of available data thus preventing the characterization
of phenomenon such as algal blooms in the regions. Nonetheless, a recent unique
and comprehensive dataset of the frequent algal blooms collected over the last
decade in the Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea is utilized in this study to analyze
the spatio-temporal variability of the blooms thereof. These data are also used
to characterize the algal bloom species and analyze the relationship between
the water properties and the algal blooms in the shallow and deep waters. There
is a general decreasing trend of the algal bloom events from 2010 to 2018 in
the Arabian Gulf while in the Sea of Oman there is an increasing trend. We
reveal a clear seasonality with the highest frequency of algal blooms during
winter and spring. We have noticed that algal blooms have the feature of the
annual cycle with initial blooms happening in November-December and
December-January in the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman, respectively. The
analysis further demonstrates that the algal blooms grow better at salinity
levels of 39-40 psu/37-37.5 psu, temperature of 23-24 oC, and pH of 8 in the
Arabian Gulf/Oman Sea. Findings of this study provide insight into the
relationship between water properties and algal bloom frequency, and a basis

vulnerable to adversarial attacks in which adversaries purposely craft domain

DGA classifiers against adversarial attacks. To this end, we train and evaluate
state-of-the-art deep learning and random forest (RF) classifiers for DGA
detection using side information that is harder for adversaries to manipulate

to imply Venus had a shallow ocean's worth of water throughout much of its
history. Another view is that Venus had a long lived (approximately 100 million
year) primordial magma ocean with a CO2 and steam atmosphere. Venus' long lived
steam atmosphere would sufficient time to dissociate most of the water vapor,
allow significant hydrogen escape and oxidize the magma ocean. A third scenario
is that Venus had surface water and habitable conditions early in its history
for a short period of time (< 1 Gyr), but that a moist/runaway greenhouse took
effect because of a gradually warming sun, leaving the planet desiccated ever
since. Using a general circulation model we demonstrate the viability of the
first scenario using the few observational constraints available. We further
speculate that Large Igneous Provinces and the global resurfacing 100s of
millions of years ago played key roles in ending the clement period in its
history and presenting the Venus we see today. The results have implications

of Hf/Sm, Zr/Sm, Ti/Eu, K/Th, Nb/Th, La/K and Ba/K in the lavas are not
features of the melt equilibration with residual amphibole or phlogopite, and
cannot be due to variable degrees of batch or dynamic melting of uncarbonated
lherzolite source. Enrichment in REE, Th and Ba relative to K, Hf, Zr, Ti and

expectations of a functional of a solution to a stochastic differential
equation (SDE). However, MLMC estimators may be unstable and have a poor
(noncanonical) complexity in the case of low regularity of the functional. To
overcome this issue, we extend our previously introduced idea of numerical
smoothing in (Quantitative Finance, 23(2), 209-227, 2023), in the context of
deterministic quadrature methods to the MLMC setting. The numerical smoothing
technique is based on root-finding methods combined with one-dimensional
numerical integration with respect to a single well-chosen variable. This study
is motivated by the computation of probabilities of events, pricing options
with a discontinuous payoff, and density estimation problems for dynamics where
the discretization of the underlying stochastic processes is necessary. The
analysis and numerical experiments reveal that the numerical smoothing
significantly improves the strong convergence, and consequently, the complexity
and robustness (by making the kurtosis at deep levels bounded) of the MLMC
method. In particular, we show that numerical smoothing enables recovering the
MLMC complexities obtained for Lipschitz functionals due to the optimal
variance decay rate when using the Euler--Maruyama scheme. For the Milstein
scheme, numerical smoothing recovers the canonical MLMC complexity even for the
nonsmooth integrand mentioned above. Finally, our approach efficiently
estimates univariate and multivariate density functions.

than 5 years, demonstrating a high level of performance. SPHERE has produced
outstanding results using a variety of operating modes, primarily in the field
of direct imaging of exoplanetary systems, focusing on exoplanets as point
sources and circumstellar disks as extended objects. The achievements obtained
thus far with SPHERE (~200 refereed publications) in different areas
(exoplanets, disks, solar system, stellar physics...) have motivated a large
consortium to propose an even more ambitious set of science cases, and its
corresponding technical implementation in the form of an upgrade. The SPHERE+
project capitalizes on the expertise and lessons learned from SPHERE to push
high contrast imaging performance to its limits on the VLT 8m-telescope. The
scientific program of SPHERE+ described in this document will open a new and
compelling scientific window for the upcoming decade in strong synergy with
ground-based facilities (VLT/I, ELT, ALMA, and SKA) and space missions (Gaia,
JWST, PLATO and WFIRST). While SPHERE has sampled the outer parts of planetary
systems beyond a few tens of AU, SPHERE+ will dig into the inner regions around
stars to reveal and characterize by mean of spectroscopy the giant planet
population down to the snow line. Building on SPHERE's scientific heritage and
resounding success, SPHERE+ will be a dedicated survey instrument which will
strengthen the leadership of ESO and the European community in the very
competitive field of direct imaging of exoplanetary systems. With enhanced
capabilities, it will enable an even broader diversity of science cases
including the study of the solar system, the birth and death of stars and the
exploration of the inner regions of active galactic nuclei.

to disillusion of the latter. The main casualty of Bell's model with hidden
variables is that it straightforwardly contradicts to the Heinsenberg's
uncertainty and generally Bohr's complementarity principles. Thus, we do not
criticize the derivation or interpretation of the Bell inequality (as was done
by numerous authors). Our critique is directed against the model as it is. The
original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument was based on the Heinseberg's
principle, but EPR did not question it. Hence, the arguments of EPR and Bell
differ crucially. It is worth to find the physical seed of the aforementioned
principles. This is the {\it quantum postulate}: the existence of indivisible
quantum of action. Bell's approach with hidden variable straightforwardly
implies rejection of the quantum postulate. Heisenberg compared the quantum
postulate with constancy of light's velocity in special relativity. Thus
attempts to explain long distance correlations within the Bell model can be
compared with attempts to construct models violating the laws of relativity
theory. Following Zeilinger, I search for the fundamental principles of quantum
mechanics (QM) similar to the principles of relativity and consider the quantum
action and complementarity principles as such principles.

AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive
(semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a
mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using
an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of
problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG,
demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse
system solvers.

prioritized knowledge bases (KBs), which consist of an ontology, a set of
facts, and a priority relation between conflicting facts. In the database
setting, a closely related scenario has been studied and led to the definition
of three different notions of optimal repairs (global, Pareto, and completion)
of a prioritized inconsistent database. After transferring the notions of
globally-, Pareto- and completion-optimal repairs to our setting, we study the
data complexity of the core reasoning tasks: query entailment under
inconsistency-tolerant semantics based upon optimal repairs, existence of a
unique optimal repair, and enumeration of all optimal repairs. Our results
provide a nearly complete picture of the data complexity of these tasks for
ontologies formulated in common DL-Lite dialects. The second contribution of
our work is to clarify the relationship between optimal repairs and different
notions of extensions for (set-based) argumentation frameworks. Among our
results, we show that Pareto-optimal repairs correspond precisely to stable
extensions (and often also to preferred extensions), and we propose a novel
semantics for prioritized KBs which is inspired by grounded extensions and
enjoys favourable computational properties. Our study also yields some results
of independent interest concerning preference-based argumentation frameworks.

Most present works perform negative sampling from unobserved data to supply the
training of recommender models with negative signals. Nevertheless, existing
negative sampling strategies, either static or adaptive ones, are insufficient
to yield high-quality negative samples --- both informative to model training
and reflective of user real needs. In this work, we hypothesize that item
knowledge graph (KG), which provides rich relations among items and KG
entities, could be useful to infer informative and factual negative samples.
Towards this end, we develop a new negative sampling model, Knowledge Graph
Policy Network (KGPolicy), which works as a reinforcement learning agent to
explore high-quality negatives. Specifically, by conducting our designed
exploration operations, it navigates from the target positive interaction,
adaptively receives knowledge-aware negative signals, and ultimately yields a
potential negative item to train the recommender. We tested on a matrix
factorization (MF) model equipped with KGPolicy, and it achieves significant
improvements over both state-of-the-art sampling methods like DNS and IRGAN,
and KG-enhanced recommender models like KGAT. Further analyses from different
angles provide insights of knowledge-aware sampling. We release the codes and

Solar-Terrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) near solar maximum has
revealed that outflowing density structures are released in an ubiquitous
manner in the solar wind. The present study investigates whether these density
fluctuations could originate from the transient heating of the low corona
observed during Coronal Bright Points (CBPs). We assume that part of the
intense heating measured during CBPs occurs at the coronal base of open
magnetic fields that channel the forming solar wind. We employ the solar wind
model MULTI-VP to quantify the plasma compression induced by transient heating
and investigate how the induced perturbation propagates to the upper corona. We
show that for heating rates with statistics comparable to those observed during
CBPs the compressive wave initially increases the local plasma density by a
factor of up to 50$\%$ at 5 R$_\odot$. The wave expands rapidly beyond 30 solar
radii and the local enhancement in density decreases beyond. Based on the
occurrence rates of CBPs measured in previous studies, we impose transient
heating events at the base of thousands of open magnetic field lines to study
the response of the entire 3-D corona. The simulated density cubes are then
converted into synthetic white-light imagery. We show that the resulting
brightness variations occupy all position angles in the images on timescales of
hours. We conclude that a significant part of the ubiquitous brightness
variability of the solar corona could originate in the strong transient heating
of flux tubes induced by CBPs.

stellar mass ($M_s$), effective radius ($R_e$) and mass-to-luminosity ratio

finest sub-group level. Some of these groups have high overlap and were merged
through a multi-phased syncytial algorithm motivated from Almod\'ovar-Rivera
and Maitra (2020). Five groups were merged in the first phase, resulting in
three complex-structured groups. Our algorithm determined further complex
structure and permitted another merging phase, revealing two complex-structured
groups at the highest level. A nonparametric bootstrap procedure was also used
to estimate the confidence of each of our group assignments. These assignments
generally had high confidence in classification, indicating great degree of
certainty of the HSS assignments into our complex-structured groups. The
physical and kinematic properties of the two groups were assessed in terms of
$M_s$, $R_e$, surface density and $M_s/L_\nu$. The first group consisted of
older, smaller and less bright HSS while the second group consisted of brighter
and younger HSS. Our analysis provides novel insight into the physical and
evolutionary properties of HSS and also helps understand physical and
evolutionary properties of candidate globular clusters. Further, the candidate
globular clusters (GCs) are seen to have very high chance of really being GCs
rather than dwarfs or dwarf ellipticals that are also indicated to be quite
distinct from each other.

limitation, when we are interested to analyse the global evolution of mortality
patterns without loosing sight of specific components evolution. The paper
analyses whether there are different patterns of mortality decline among
developed countries, identifying the role played by all the mortality
components. We implement a cluster analysis using a Functional Data Analysis
(FDA) approach, which allows us to consider age-specific mortality rather than
summary measures as it analyses curves rather than scalar data. Combined with a
Functional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method it can identify what part
of the curves (mortality components) is responsible for assigning one country
to a specific cluster. FDA clustering is applied to 32 countries of Human
Mortality Database and years 1960--2010. The results show that the evolutions
of developed countries follow the same pattern (with different timing): (1) a
reduction of infant mortality, (2) an increase of premature mortality, (3) a
shift and compression of deaths. Some countries are following this scheme and
recovering the gap with precursors, others do not show signs of recovery.
Eastern Europe countries are still at stage (2) and it is not clear if and when
they will enter into phase (3). All the country differences relates the
different timing with which countries undergo the stages identified by
clusters. The cluster analysis based on FDA allows therefore a comprehensive
understanding of the patterns of mortality decline for considered countries.

viscosity solution of a single Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential

systems. Numerical methods to solve the HJ equation have historically relied on
a discrete grid of the solution space and exhibits exponential scaling with
system dimension, preventing their applicability to multiple vehicle systems.

delivered by the latest generation of ground-based instruments equipped with an
extreme adaptive optics system and a coronagraphic device, such as SPHERE at
the VLT. This signature appears when the atmospheric turbulence conditions are
varying faster than the adaptive optics loop can correct. The wind driven halo
shows as a radial extension of the point spread function along a distinct
direction (sometimes referred to as the butterfly pattern). When present, it
significantly limits the contrast capabilities of the instrument and prevents
the extraction of signals at close separation or extended signals such as
circumstellar disks. This limitation is consequential because it contaminates
the data a substantial fraction of the time: about 30% of the data produced by
the VLT/SPHERE instrument are affected by the wind driven halo.Aims. This paper
reviews the causes of the wind driven halo and presents a method to analyze its
contribution directly from the scientific images. Its effect on the raw
contrast and on the final contrast after post-processing is
demonstrated.Methods. We used simulations and on-sky SPHERE data to verify that
the parameters extracted with our method are capable of describing the wind
driven halo present in the images. We studied the temporal, spatial and
spectral variation of these parameters to point out its deleterious effect on
the final contrast.Results. The data driven analysis we propose does provide
information to accurately describe the wind driven halo contribution in the
images. This analysis justifies why this is a fundamental limitation to the
final contrast performance reached.Conclusions. With the established procedure,
we will analyze a large sample of data delivered by SPHERE in order to propose,
in the future, post-processing techniques tailored to remove the wind driven
halo.

explain their photometric properties which are not reproduced by a
supernova-like instantaneous explosion. Furthermore, the model predicts
characteristic spectral features and evolution, which are well in line with
those of AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. Despite the different observational
properties, the wind model shows that they have some common features; the large
mass-loss rates (up to $\sim 20M_{\odot}{\rm ~yr^{-1}}$ for AT2018cow and $\sim

envelope is rapidly ejected by an event at a stellar core scale. On the other

method and ultra-weak discontinuous Galerkin (UWDG) method. Firstly, we rewrite
the PDEs with high order spatial derivatives into a lower order system, then
apply the UWDG method to the system. We first consider the fourth order and
fifth order nonlinear PDEs in one space dimension, and then extend our method
to general high order problems and two space dimensions. The main advantage of
our method over the LDG method is that we have introduced fewer auxiliary
variables, thereby reducing memory and computational costs. The main advantage
of our method over the UWDG method is that no internal penalty terms are
necessary in order to ensure stability for both even and odd order PDEs. We
prove stability of our method in the general nonlinear case and provide optimal
error estimates for linear PDEs for the solution itself as well as for the
auxiliary variables approximating its derivatives. A key ingredient in the
proof of the error estimates is the construction of the relationship between
the derivative and the element interface jump of the numerical solution and the
auxiliary variable solution of the solution derivative. With this relationship,
we can then use the discrete Sobolev and Poincar\'{e} inequalities to obtain
the optimal error estimates. The theoretical findings are confirmed by

optical dipole trap on in-situ absorption probe imaging of the trapped atoms
has been investigated. We have calculated the light-shift of various energy
levels of $^{87}$Rb atoms relevant for trapping in an optical dipole trap
(ODT). The spatial varying intensity of the ODT beam results in position
dependent light-shift (i.e. AC-Stark shift). Such modifications in the energy
levels of the atom result in modification in the absorption cross-section,
which finally modifies the optical density (OD) in in-situ absorption imaging
at a given wavelength of imaging probe beam. Incorporating the light-shift in
analysis of images, the correct number of atoms in the optical dipole trap has
been estimated for the experimentally observed absorption images of the trapped
cloud. The in-situ imaging and this work can be useful in estimating the
instantaneous loss rate from the trap during the evaporative cooling of trapped
atom cloud.

on uniform $C^{2,1}$-domains on $L_q$. In particular, classes of non-Helmholtz
domains, i.e., domains for which the Helmholtz decomposition does not exist,
are adressed. On the one hand, it is proved that the Stokes equations subject
to partial slip in general are not well-posed in the standard setting that
usually applies for Helmholtz domains. On the other hand, it is proved that
under certain reasonable assumptions the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations
subject to partial slip are well-posed in a generalized setting. This setting
relies on a generalized version of the Helmholtz decomposition which exists
under suitable conditions on the intersection and the sum of gradient and
solenoidal fields in $L_q$. The proved well-posedness of the Stokes resolvent
problem turns even out to be equivalent to the existence of the generalized
Helmholtz decomposition. The presented approach, for instance, includes the
sector-like non-Helmholtz domains introduced by Bogovski\u{\i} and Maslennikova

features the flat-top shape with the discrete part of its spectrum consisting
of plane-wave Bogoliubov phonons propagating through the flat-density bulk and
reflected by edges of the droplet. With decreasing $\gamma$ these modes cross
into the continuum, sequentially crossing the particle-emission threshold at
specific critical values. A notable exception is the breathing mode which we
find to be always bound. The balance point $\gamma = 0$ provides implementation
of a system governed by the GPE with an unusual quadratic nonlinearity. This

this ratio tends to 1 and the droplet transforms into the soliton solution of

Archard notably proposed a model to describe the probability of wear particle

this model is largely adopted in the investigations of wear, the presence of

contact configuration already since the early stages of the process. In such a
configuration, a significant amount of wear is produced at the interface
between the trapped debris and the sliding bodies. Here, relying on analytical

is favoured within the sliding surfaces, instead of within the debris particle,
and test such result by means of numerical simulations with a phase-field

debris particle accretion, rather than its break down. The effects of adhesion,

and vertex attributes, as shown in recent research. As in other machine
learning domains, concerns about robustness to adversarial manipulation can
prevent potential users from adopting proposed methods when the consequence of
action is very high. This paper considers two topological characteristics of
graphs and explores the way these features affect the amount the adversary must
perturb the graph in order to be successful. We show that, if certain vertices
are included in the training set, it is possible to substantially an
adversary's required perturbation budget. On four citation datasets, we
demonstrate that if the training set includes high degree vertices or vertices
that ensure all unlabeled nodes have neighbors in the training set, we show
that the adversary's budget often increases by a substantial factor---often a
factor of 2 or more---over random training for the Nettack poisoning attack.
Even for especially easy targets (those that are misclassified after just one
or two perturbations), the degradation of performance is much slower, assigning
much lower probabilities to the incorrect classes. In addition, we demonstrate
that this robustness either persists when recently proposed defenses are
applied, or is competitive with the resulting performance improvement for the
defender.

Typical adaptive systems rely solely on the human's overall or cognitive

employ a square gradient particle-field interaction term to model non-isotropic

homogeneous water box demonstrate that it is possible to parameterize the
equation of state to reproduce any target density for a given external

such applications, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has considered
the adoption of terrestrial cellular networks to support UAV sensing services,
also known as the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this paper, we consider a
cellular Internet of UAVs, where the sensory data can be transmitted either to
base station (BS) via cellular links, or to mobile devices by underlay
UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications. To evaluate the freshness of data, the age
of information (AoI) is adopted, in which a lower AoI implies fresher data.
Since UAVs' AoIs are determined by their trajectories during sensing and
transmission, we investigate the AoI minimization problem for UAVs by designing
their trajectories. This problem is a Markov decision problem (MDP) with an
infinite state-action space, and thus we utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to approximate the state-action space. Then, we propose a
multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results
show that our algorithm achieves a lower AoI than greedy algorithm and policy

interfaces in (010) beta-Ga2O3/(AlxGa1-x)2O3 heterostructures, whose roughness
is ruled by that of the Ga2O3 layer, can enable higher mobility 2DEGs by
reducing interface roughness scattering. To this end we experimentally prove
that a substrate offcut along the [001] direction allows to obtain smooth
beta-Ga2O3 layers in (010)-homoepitaxy under metal-rich conditions. Applying
In-mediated metal-exchange catalysis (MEXCAT) in molecular beam epitaxy at high
substrate temperatures (Tg = 900 {\deg}C) we compare the morphology of layers
grown on (010)-oriented substrates with different unintentional offcuts. The
layer roughness is generally ruled by (i) (110) and (-110)-facets visible as
elongated features along the [001] direction (rms < 0.5 nm), and (ii) trenches
(5-10 nm deep) orthogonal to [001]. We show that an unintentional substrate
offcut of only 0.1{\deg} almost oriented along the [001] direction suppresses
these trenches resulting in a smooth morphology with a roughness exclusively
determined by the facets, i.e., rms 0.2 nm. Since we found the facet-and-trench
morphology in layers grown by MBE with and without MEXCAT, we propose that the
general growth mechanism for (010)-homoepitaxy is ruled by island growth whose
coalescence results in the formation of the trenches. The presence of a
substrate offcut in the [001] direction can allow for step-flow growth or
island nucleation at the step edges, which prevents the formation of trenches.
Moreover, we give experimental evidence for a decreasing surface diffusion
length or increasing nucleation density with decreasing metal-to-oxygen flux
ratio. Based on our results we can rule-out step bunching as cause of the
trench formation as well as a surfactant-effect of indium during MEXCAT.

speedup in certain key areas, quantum algorithms are still hard to implement
right, and the validation of such quantum programs is a challenge. Early
attempts either suffer from the lack of automation or parametrized reasoning,
or target high-level abstract algorithm description languages far from the
current de facto consensus of circuit-building quantum programming languages.
As a consequence, no significant quantum algorithm implementation has been
currently verified in a scale-invariant manner. We propose Qbricks, the first
formal verification environment for circuit-building quantum programs,
featuring clear separation between code and proof, parametric specifications
and proofs, high degree of proof automation and allowing to encode quantum
programs in a natural way, i.e. close to textbook style. Qbricks builds on best
practice of formal verification for the classical case and tailor them to the
quantum case: we bring a new domain-specific circuit-building language for
quantum programs, namely Qbricks-DSL, together with a new logical specification
language Qbricks-Spec and a dedicated Hoare-style deductive verification rule
named Hybrid Quantum Hoare Logic. Especially, we introduce and intensively
build upon HOPS, a higher-order extension of the recent path-sum symbolic
representation, used for both specification and automation. To illustrate the
opportunity of Qbricks, we implement the first verified parametric
implementations of several famous and non-trivial quantum algorithms, including
the quantum part of Shor integer factoring (Order Finding - Shor-OF), quantum
phase estimation (QPE) - a basic building block of many quantum algorithms, and
Grover search. These breakthroughs were amply facilitated by the specification
and automated deduction principles introduced within Qbricks.

Unfortunately, acquiring adequate annotations is very time-consuming and labor
intensive. This is especially true for class-level 6D pose estimation, as one
is required to create a highly detailed reconstruction for all objects and then
annotate each object and scene using these models. To overcome this
shortcoming, we additionally propose the idea of synthetic-to-real domain
transfer for class-level 6D poses by means of self-supervised learning, which
removes the burden of collecting numerous manual annotations. In essence, after
training our proposed method fully supervised with synthetic data, we leverage
recent advances in differentiable rendering to self-supervise the model with
unannotated real RGB-D data to improve latter inference. We experimentally
demonstrate that we can retrieve precise 6D poses and metric shapes from a
single RGB image.

but most national weather recording networks are often spatially too sparse to
capture rainfall patterns adequately. To bring the best out of these two
sources of information, climatologists and hydrologists have been seeking
models that can efficiently merge different types of rainfall data. One
inherent difficulty is to capture the appropriate multivariate dependence
structure among rainfall maxima. For this purpose, multivariate extreme value
theory suggests the use of a max-stable process. Such a process can be
represented by a max-linear combination of independent copies of a hidden
stochastic process weighted by a Poisson point process. In practice, the choice
of this hidden process is non-trivial, especially if anisotropy,
non-stationarity and nugget effects are present in the spatial data at hand. By
coupling forecast ensemble data from the French national weather service

uncorrelated between channels. To carry out this study, a simple multichannel
laser-phase-noise model that has been experimentally validated for
weakly-coupled multicore-fiber transmission is considered. As the considered
rotation scheme is intended to work in conjunction with receiver-side carrier
phase estimation (CPE), the model is modified to further assume that imperfect
CPE has taken place, leaving residual phase noise in the processed signal.
Based on this model, two receiver structures are derived and used to
numerically optimize transmitter-side signal rotations through Monte Carlo
simulations. For reasonable amounts of residual phase noise, rotations based on
Hadamard matrices are found to be near-optimal for transmission of
four-dimensional signals. Furthermore, Hadamard rotations can be performed for
any dimension that is a power of two. By exploiting this property, an increase

ionising continuum photons. We start from the Ly$\alpha$ fluxes measured in the
spectra of the sources detected spectroscopically. From these fluxes we derive
the ionising emissivity of continuum photons of the proto-cluster, which we
compare with the ionising emissivity required to reionise the proto-cluster
volume. We find that the sources in the proto-cluster are capable of ionising a
large bubble, indeed larger than the volume occupied by the proto-cluster. For
various calculations we have used the model AMIGA, in particular to derive the
emissivity of the Lyman continuum photons required to maintain the observed
volume ionised. Besides, we have assumed the ionising photons escape fraction
given by AMIGA at this redshift.

reference person, and has become a hot topic in recent years. Prior arts
usually focus on preserving the character of a clothing image (e.g. texture,
logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains
a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions
and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue,
we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating
and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic
layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g. long
sleeve shirt$\rightarrow$arm, arm$\rightarrow$jacket), and then determines
whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the
predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothing
details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout
generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to
progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a
clothes warping module warps clothing images according to the generated
semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to
stabilize the warping process during training. Third, an inpainting module for
content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic
layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body.
In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate
photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer
fine-details.

to be printed that is represented as a tetrahedral mesh, we first establish a
geodesic distance field embedded on the mesh, whose value at any vertex is the
geodesic distance to the base of the model. Next, the model is naturally
decomposed into curved layers by interpolating a number of iso-geodesic
distance surfaces (IGDSs). These IGDSs morph from bottom-up in an intrinsic and
smooth way owing to the nature of geodesics, which will be used as the curved
printing layers that are friendly to multi-axis printing. In addition, to cater
to the collision-free requirement and to improve the printing efficiency, we
also propose a printing sequence optimization algorithm for determining the
printing order of the IGDSs, which helps reduce the air-move path length. Ample
experiments in both computer simulation and physical printing are performed,
and the experimental results confirm the advantages of our method.

associated with a unique causal history, its prime cause. However, it is quite
common for an event to have disjunctive causes in that it can be enabled by any
one of multiple sets of causes. Sometimes the sets of causes may be mutually
exclusive, inconsistent one with another, and sometimes not, in which case they
coexist consistently and constitute parallel causes of the event. The
established model of general event structures can model parallel causes. On
occasion however such a model abstracts too far away from the precise causal
histories of events to be directly useful. For example, sometimes one needs to
associate probabilities with different, possibly coexisting, causal histories
of a common event. Ideally, the causal histories of a general event structure
would correspond to the configurations of its causal unfolding to a prime event
structure; and the causal unfolding would arise as a right adjoint to the
embedding of prime in general event structures. But there is no such
adjunction. However, a slight extension of prime event structures remedies this
defect and provides a causal unfolding as a universal construction. Prime event
structures are extended with an equivalence relation in order to dissociate the
two roles, that of an event and its enabling; in effect, prime causes are
labelled by a disjunctive event, an equivalence class of its prime causes. With
this enrichment a suitable causal unfolding appears as a pseudo right adjoint.
The adjunction relies critically on the central and subtle notion of extremal
causal realisation as an embodiment of causal history. Finally, we explore
subcategories which support parallel causes as well the key operations needed
in developing probabilistic distributed strategies with parallel causes.

factor for understanding the delicate mechanisms that control the spin-down of
stars in this evolutionary phase. We note that our models predict that the
behaviour of the variations of the braking index is distinct when the star
density decreases. In the present study, we used three sample stellar targets

conductive plates and ferromagnetic poles are derived. The solutions are
obtained by summing an infinite sequence of fields from linear charge-images
and current-images in complex space. Knowledge of the normal component of the E
field on the conductor surface makes it possible to calculate the induced
electric charge surface density. In addition, we derive within an improved
linear approximation new analytical expressions for fields near the beam in the
case of an arbitrary beam offset from the median plane. The mathematical
features of exact solutions and limitations for the applicability of linear
approximations are specified.The primary goals of the future high-luminosity
p-p and heavy-ion LHC programme are the search for yet unobserved effects of
physics beyond the SM, searches for rare or low-sensitivity processes in the
Higgs sector, and probing in more detail the mechanism of EW symmetry breaking.
This programme relies on the stable operation of the accelerator. However, as
the beam luminosity increases, a number of destabilizing phenomena occur, in
particular field emission, enhancing the electron cloud effect. For the case of
a proton beam, we apply the exact 2D solution for estimating the intensity of
electron field emission activated by the electric field of the beam in
collimators of the future high-luminosity LHC. Calculation shows that the field
emission intensity is very sensitive to a collimator surface roughness. In
addition, with a relatively small and accidental beam displacement from the
median path, about 20% of the collimator half-gap, the emission intensity
increases by a factor of 1.E+7. This will partially neutralize the beam space
charge, violating acceleration dynamics and enhancing instability effects.

  arXiv:1901.04779",,,,"stat.CO cs.DB stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Record linkage is the process of bringing together the same entity from
overlapping data sources while removing duplicates. Huge amounts of data are
now being collected by public or private organizations as well as by
researchers and individuals. Linking and analysing relevant information from
this massive data reservoir can provide new insights into society. However,
this increase in the amount of data may also increase the likelihood of
incorrectly linked records among databases. It has become increasingly
important to have effective and efficient methods for linking data from
different sources. Therefore, it becomes necessary to assess the ability of a
linking method to achieve high accuracy or to compare between methods with
respect to accuracy. In this paper, we improve on a Markov Chain based Monte
Carlo simulation approach (MaCSim) for assessing a linking method. MaCSim
utilizes two linked files that have been previously linked on similar types of
data to create an agreement matrix and then simulates the matrix using a
proposed algorithm developed to generate re-sampled versions of the agreement
matrix. A defined linking method is used in each simulation to link the files
and the accuracy of the linking method is assessed. The improvement proposed
here involves calculation of a similarity weight for every linking variable
value for each record pair, which allows partial agreement of the linking
variable values. A threshold is calculated for every linking variable based on
adjustable parameter ""tolerance"" for that variable. To assess the accuracy of
linking method, correctly linked proportions are investigated for each record.
The extended MaCSim approach is illustrated using a synthetic dataset provided
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) based on realistic data settings.
Test results show higher accuracy of the assessment of linkages.

modalities (e.g., image and depth) and to deal with degraded or missing input
are less well studied. In particular, we note that previous approaches towards
deep fusion do not perform significantly better than models employing a single
modality. We conjecture that this is because of the naive approaches to feature
space fusion through summation or concatenation which do not take into account
the different strengths of each modality. To address this, we propose an
end-to-end framework, termed VMLoc, to fuse different sensor inputs into a
common latent space through a variational Product-of-Experts (PoE) followed by
attention-based fusion. Unlike previous multimodal variational works directly
adapting the objective function of vanilla variational auto-encoder, we show
how camera localization can be accurately estimated through an unbiased
objective function based on importance weighting. Our model is extensively

With a KPP type setting, after establishing the fundamental solution of a

recently developed dynamical system theories to obtain the existence of the
spreading speed and its coincidence with the minimal speed of pulsating waves,

excess of pore water pressure. This phenomenon leads to several disastrous
damages of the soil foundation. The aim of this paper is to assess numerically
the effect of the liquefaction-induced settlement of the soil foundation on an

this purpose, a 2D finite element model of a dam founded on a layered soil/rock

represent the soil behaviour. The crest settlement of the embankment was
selected as the quantifiable damage variable of the study. Fragility functions
were drawn to give the probability exceedance of some proposed damage levels as
function of a seismic severity parameter. In addition, the anisotropy was
tested by the change in the soil permeability and a comparison with the
isotropy was held. According to the results, the crest settlement increases
with the peak ground acceleration and the fragility functions showed that above
0.2g, the probability to have moderate damage in the anisotropic case reaches
unity whereas it is lesser in the isotropic case. The embankment will not show
serious damage for this same value of acceleration in the two cases.

sufficient diversity is an important open problem for Natural Language
Generation (NLG) community. Recently, generative adversarial models have been
applied extensively on text generation tasks, where the adversarially trained
generators alleviate the exposure bias experienced by conventional maximum
likelihood approaches and result in promising generation quality. However, due
to the notorious defect of mode collapse for adversarial training, the
adversarially trained generators face a quality-diversity trade-off, i.e., the
generator models tend to sacrifice generation diversity severely for increasing
generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which aims to
improve the performance of adversarial text generation via efficiently
decelerating mode collapse of the adversarial training. To this end, we
introduce a cooperative training paradigm, where a language model is
cooperatively trained with the generator and we utilize the language model to
efficiently shape the data distribution of the generator against mode collapse.
Moreover, instead of engaging the cooperative update for the generator in a
principled way, we formulate a meta learning mechanism, where the cooperative
update to the generator serves as a high level meta task, with an intuition of
ensuring the parameters of the generator after the adversarial update would
stay resistant against mode collapse. In the experiment, we demonstrate our
proposed approach can efficiently slow down the pace of mode collapse for the
adversarial text generators. Overall, our proposed method is able to outperform
the baseline approaches with significant margins in terms of both generation
quality and diversity in the testified domains.
