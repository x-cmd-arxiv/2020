for the sake of completeness. Yet, for the case of accumulating 'steps' on the
sphere, reference to distances as done there is replaced by reference to the
angles, which makes simpler expressions. The treatment here of the action of a

proposes an end-to-end approach that tightly integrates a state-of-the-art
dispatching algorithm, a machine-learning model to predict zone-to-zone demand
over time, and a model predictive control optimization to relocate idle
vehicles. Experiments using historic taxi trips in New York City indicate that
this integration decreases average waiting times by about 30% over all test
cases and reaches close to 55% on the largest instances for high-demand zones.

stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40 during its 2005 outburst, revealing a rich
and complex disk wind. Soon after its launch, the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory began monitoring the same outburst. Some X-ray Telescope (XRT)
observations were obtained in a mode that makes it impossible to remove strong
Mn calibration lines, so the Fe K-alpha line region in the spectra was
previously neglected. However, these lines enable a precise calibration of the
energy scale, facilitating studies of the absorption-dominated disk wind and
its velocity shifts. Here, we present fits to 15 Swift/XRT spectra, revealing
variability and evolution in the outflow. The data strongly point to a
magnetically driven disk wind: both the higher velocity (e.g., v ~ 10^4 km/s)
and lower velocity (e.g., v ~ 10^3 km/s) wind components are typically much
faster than is possible for thermally driven outflows (v < 200 km/s), and
photoionization modeling yields absorption radii that are two orders of
magnitude below the Compton radius that defines the typical inner extent of
thermal winds. Moreover, correlations between key wind parameters yield an
average absorption measure distribution (AMD) that is consistent with
magnetohydrodynamic wind models. We discuss our results in terms of recent
observational and theoretical studies of black hole accretion disks and
outflows, and future prospects.

believed that their threads, as seen in H$\alpha$ observations, provide
indirect information concerning magnetic field topology. We investigate the
spontaneous emergence and evolution of fine structure in high-density
condensations formed through the process of thermal instability under typical
solar coronal conditions. Our study reveals intricate multidimensional
processes that occur through in situ condensations in a representative coronal
volume in a low plasma beta regime. We performed 2D and 3D numerical
simulations of interacting slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes when all
relevant non-adiabatic effects are included.
  We show that the interaction of multiple slow MHD wave modes in a regime
unstable to the thermal mode leads to thermal instability. This initially forms
pancake-like structures almost orthogonal to the local magnetic field, while
low-pressure induced inflows of matter generate rebound shocks. This is
succeeded by the rapid disruption of these pancake sheets through thin-shell
instabilities evolving naturally from minute ram pressure imbalances. This
eventually creates high-density blobs accompanied by thread-like features from
shear flow effects. The further evolution of the blobs follows the magnetic
field lines, such that a dynamical realignment with the background magnetic
field appears. However, the emerging thread-like features are not at all
field-aligned, implying only a very weak link between fine structure
orientation and magnetic field topology which has far-reaching implications for
field topology interpretations based on H$\alpha$ observations.

$\gtrsim$M7 and given Gaia DR2 parallaxes. Dividing the Gaia DR2 20pc sample
into subsamples of various astrometric and photometric quality, we studied
their distribution on the sky, in the $M_G$ vs. $G$$-$$RP$ colour-magnitude

After excluding 139 known WDs and 263 known UCDs from the CMD, we checked all

this study) for the correctness of their Gaia DR2 proper motions. For confirmed
UCD candidates we estimated spectral types photometrically using Gaia and
near-infrared absolute magnitudes and colours. We failed to confirm new WDs,
but found 50 new UCD candidates not mentioned in three previous studies using
Gaia DR2. They have relatively small proper motions and tangential velocities
and are concentrated towards the Galactic plane. Half of them have spectral
types in SIMBAD and/or previous non-Gaia distance estimates that placed them

Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats
to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late
December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of
evolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,
genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate
method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes.
The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard
distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations
are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method
serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic
viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis
shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase,
and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for
vaccine development in disease control.

graphene-reinforced elastomers in liquids. Anisotropic swelling was observed
for samples reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), induced by the
in-plane orientation of the GNPs. Upon the addition of the GNPs, the diameter
swelling ratio of the nanocomposites was significantly reduced, whereas the
thickness swelling ratio increased and was even greater than that of the
unfilled elastomers. The swelling phenomenon has been analyzed in terms of a
modification of the Flory-Rhener theory. The newly-derived equations proposed
herein, can accurately predict the dependence of dimensional swelling (diameter
and thickness) on volume swelling, independent of the type of elastomer and
solvent. The anisotropic swelling of the samples was also studied in
combination with the evaluation of the tensile properties of the filled

GNP-reinforced elastomers, based on the filler geometry and volume fraction has
been developed. It was found that the swelling of rubber nanocomposites induces
a biaxial constraint from the graphene flakes.

defines a non-perturbative function with roots equal to the allowed energies,

on an intermediate three-body quantity, denoted $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{df},3}$,

represent time-series data/sensor nodes responses as a pattern with a

superposing random noise to the time-series data to assess the robustness of
the framework with noise-polluted data. Results indicate that the proposed
framework is capable of predicting failure with acceptable accuracy even in the
presence of high noise levels. The findings demonstrate satisfactory

telescope that observes the sky in the TeV band. Recently, the development of a
mini-array (MA) of ASTRI telescopes has been funded by the Istituto Nazionale
di Astrofisica. The ASTRI Comprehensive Data Challenge (ACDC) project aims at
optimizing the scientific exploitation and analysis techniques of the ASTRI MA,
by performing a complete end-to-end simulation of a tentative scientific
program, from the generation of suitable instrument response functions to the
proposal, selection, analysis, and interpretation of the simulated data. We
assumed that the MA will comprise nine ASTRI telescopes arranged in a (almost)
square geometry (mean distance between telescopes of ~250m). We simulated three
years of observations, adopting a realistic pointing plan that takes into
account, for each field, visibility constraints for an assumed site in Paranal
(Chile) and observational time slots in dark sky conditions. We simulated the
observations of nineteen Galactic and extragalactic fields selected for their
scientific interest, including several classes of objects (such as pulsar wind
nebulae, supernova remnants, gamma-ray binaries etc), for a total of 81
point-like and extended sources. Here we present an overview of the ACDC
project, providing details on the different software packages needed to carry
out the simulated three-years operation of the ASTRI MA. We discuss the results
of a systematic analysis applied on the whole simulated data, by making use of
prototype science tools widely adopted by the TeV astronomical community.
Furthermore, particular emphasis is also given to some targets used as
benchmarks.

  Reconstruction","Accepted at ECCV 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.CG cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficiently reconstructing complex and intricate surfaces at scale is a
long-standing goal in machine perception. To address this problem we introduce
Deep Local Shapes (DeepLS), a deep shape representation that enables encoding
and reconstruction of high-quality 3D shapes without prohibitive memory
requirements. DeepLS replaces the dense volumetric signed distance function
(SDF) representation used in traditional surface reconstruction systems with a
set of locally learned continuous SDFs defined by a neural network, inspired by
recent work such as DeepSDF. Unlike DeepSDF, which represents an object-level
SDF with a neural network and a single latent code, we store a grid of
independent latent codes, each responsible for storing information about
surfaces in a small local neighborhood. This decomposition of scenes into local
shapes simplifies the prior distribution that the network must learn, and also
enables efficient inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization power of DeepLS by showing object shape encoding and
reconstructions of full scenes, where DeepLS delivers high compression,
accuracy, and local shape completion.

explore the multi-scale collaborative representation for rain streaks from the
perspective of input image scales and hierarchical deep features in a unified

employ recurrent calculation to capture the global texture, thus allowing to
explore the complementary and redundant information at the spatial dimension to
characterize target rain streaks. Besides, we construct multi-scale pyramid
structure, and further introduce the attention mechanism to guide the fine
fusion of this correlated information from different scales. This multi-scale
progressive fusion strategy not only promotes the cooperative representation,
but also boosts the end-to-end training. Our proposed method is extensively
evaluated on several benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.

We propose a novel Projective Spatial Transformer module that generalizes
spatial transformers to projective geometry, thus enabling differentiable

we show that our transformer enables end-to-end learning of an image processing

convex with respect to the pose parameters, and can thus be optimized
effectively using conventional gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that spatial transformers have been described for

specifically the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)
algorithm, to extrapolate the DL CSI based on the extracted parameters of
multipath components in the uplink channel. We apply the HRPE to two different

acquired from channel measurement campaigns with two different types of channel
sounders: a) a switched array-based, real-time, time-domain, outdoors setup at
3.5 GHz, and b) a virtual array-based, high-accuracy, frequency-domain, indoors
setup at 2.4 and 5-7 GHz. The performance metrics of the extrapolated channels
that we evaluate include the mean squared error, beamforming efficiency, and
spectral efficiency in multiuser MIMO scenarios. The results show that the
HRPE-based channel extrapolation performs best under the simple VSS model,

rise to interesting fractional topological phenomena when the system is doped

precisely, it was shown that under highly dynamic events, buckling of

structural failure, suggesting that efficient structural design of planetary

this work, we combine both aspects of previous research on tensegrity
structures, showing a possible lattice-like structural configuration able to
withstand impact events, store pre-impact kinetic energy, and utilize a part of
that energy for the locomotion process. Our work shows the feasibility of this

images or speech. We will use ""visual sudoku"" as a prototype problem, where the
given cell digits are handwritten and provided as an image thereof. In this
case, one first has to train and use a classifier to label the images, so that
the labels can be used for solving the problem. In this paper, we explore the
hybridization of classifying the images with the reasoning of a constraint
solver. We show that pure constraint reasoning on predictions does not give
satisfactory results. Instead, we explore the possibilities of a tighter
integration, by exposing the probabilistic estimates of the classifier to the
constraint solver. This allows joint inference on these probabilistic
estimates, where we use the solver to find the maximum likelihood solution. We
explore the trade-off between the power of the classifier and the power of the
constraint reasoning, as well as further integration through the additional use
of structural knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of calibration
of the probabilistic estimates on the reasoning. Our results show that such
hybrid approaches vastly outperform a separate approach, which encourages a
further integration of prediction (probabilities) and constraint solving.

well-established anatomical properties. The intuitive idea is to model a fiber

tracking. Having the knowledge about the presence and locations of other

dense localized state vectors, which can encode, for example, if the local
region is target, background, or distractor. These state vectors are propagated
through the sequence and combined with the appearance model output to localize
the target. Our network is learned to effectively utilize the scene information

to the gwIMF. The chemical evolution of Bo\""otes I, one of the best observed

consistent with independent estimations and similar to Dragonfly 44. The
recovered best fitting input parameters in this work are not covered in the

monitoring campaign conducted about five years ago, and is puzzling considering
that the system apparently did not show major outbursts ever since. The switch
of the pulsar to the spin-up regime supports the common assumption that torques
acting on the accreting neutron star are nearly balanced and thus SXP 1062
likely also spins with a period close to the equilibrium value for this system.
The current monitoring of the source revealed also a sharp drop of its soft
X-ray flux right after the outburst, which is in drastic contrast to the
behaviour during the previous outburst when the pulsar remained observable for
years with only a minor flux decrease after the end of the outburst. This
unexpected off state of the source lasted for at most 20 days after which SXP
1062 returned to the level observed during previous campaigns. We discuss this
and other findings in context of the modern models of accretion onto strongly
magnetized neutron stars.

those measured in fully 3D simulation data, which is partly because cores
identified in projected 2D maps tend to coexist within filamentary structures,
while 3D cores are generally more rounded. In addition, we examine the
progression of magnetic field from pc- to core-scale in the simulation, which
is consistent with the anisotropic core formation model that gas preferably
flow along the magnetic field toward dense cores. When comparing the observed
cores identified from the GBT Ammonia Survey (GAS) and Planck
polarization-inferred magnetic field orientations, we find that the relative
core-field alignment has a regional dependence among different clouds. More
specifically, we find that dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud tend to
align perpendicular to the background magnetic field, while those in Perseus

kinematic/action spaces, we find that the $\sqrt{J_R}$ vs $L_z$ space allows
for the cleanest selection of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage stars with minimal

Stars with $30 \leq \sqrt{J_R} \leq 50$ (kpc km s$^{-1})^{1/2}$ and $-500 \leq

literature estimates by $0.1-0.3$ dex. Based on the MDFs, we find that
selection of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage stars in other kinematic/action spaces
without additional population information leads to contaminated samples. The
clean Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage sample selected according to our criteria is
slightly retrograde and lies along the blue sequence of the high $V_T$ halo CMD

the mass of the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage progenitor satellite to be
$10^{8.85-9.85}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent with literature estimates

model with heavy vectorlike quarks in a type-II two Higgs double model, called
the VLQ-2HDM. A reasonable benchmark point is suggested in the exact wrong-sign
limit, where the opposite sign between the up-type VLQ and down-type VLQ
couplings to the Higgs boson causes the cancellation of their contributions to
the single-Higgs production from gluon fusion. Because of the threshold effects
from the heavy VLQs in the loop, the VLQ-2HDM accommodates the bumps in the
distributions of the invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair ($M_{hh}$) and the
transverse momentum of a Higgs boson ($p_T^h$). The positions of two bumps are
closely related as $ M_{hh} \simeq 2 M_{\rm VLQ}$ and $p_T^h \simeq M_{\rm

the $M_{hh}$ and $p_T^h$ distributions into high-mass and high-$p_T^h$ regions.
On the other hand, the non-SM Higgs trilinear coupling cases have the
distributions shift into low $ M_{hh}$ and $p_T^h$ regions. Therefore, the
kinematic region with high $M_{hh}$ and high $p_T^h$ will be a smoking-gun

October ACA observations to search for HCN. The disk-averaged brightness
temperature of Ceres is measured to be between 170 K and 180 K during our 2017

with an amplitude of about 4%. Our HCN search returns a negative result with an
upper limit production rate of ~2$\times$10$^{24}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, assuming
globally uniform production and a Haser model. A thermophysical model suggests
that Ceres's top layer has higher dielectric absorption than lunar-like
materials at a wavelength of 1 mm. However, previous observations showed that
the dielectric absorption of Ceres decreases towards longer wavelengths. Such
distinct dielectric properties might be related to the hydrated phyllosilicate
composition of Ceres and possibly abundant $\mu$m-sized grains on its surface.
The thermal inertia of Ceres is constrained by our modeling as likely being
between 40 and 160 tiu, much higher than previous measurements at infrared
wavelengths. Modeling also suggests that Ceres's lightcurve is likely dominated
by spatial variations in its physical or compositional properties that cause
changes in Ceres's observed thermal properties and dielectric absorption as it
rotates.

control-affine systems. It is assumed that the class of systems under
consideration satisfies nonlinear controllability conditions with respect to
the stabilizable variables. Under these assumptions, a time-periodic feedback
control is constructed explicitly by using the inversion of the matrix composed
of the control vector fields and their Lie brackets. The proposed control
design scheme is applied to solving the leader-following problem for nonlinear
multi-agent systems. These results are illustrated with two examples of
nonholonomic control problems: the partial stabilization of a rolling disc and
the leader-following task for two unicycles.

between individual quantum objects. Since similar experiments with single
particles and more slits produce interference fringes reducible to a
combination of double-slit patterns it is usually argued that quantum
interference occurs between pairs of trajectories, compactly denoted as
second-order interference. Here we show that quantum mechanics in fact allows
for interference of arbitrarily high order. This occurs naturally when one
considers multiple quantum objects interacting in the presence of a
nonlinearity, both of which are required to observe higher-order interference.
We make this clear by treating a generalised multi-slit interferometer using
second-quantisation. We then present explicit experimentally-relevant examples
both with photons interacting in nonlinear media and an interfering
Bose-Einstein condensate with particle-particle interactions. These examples
are all perfectly described by quantum theory, and yet exhibit higher-order
interference based on multiple particles interacting nonlinearly.

heavy-fermion compound that is electrically insulating but yet it displays
quantum oscillations, which are a telltale signature of the metallic state.
Adding to the enigma is the possibility that SmB$_6$ is a topological Kondo
insulator. Here, by treating the spin degree of freedom on an equal footing
with other degrees of freedom using the parameter-free strongly-constrained and
appropriately-normed (SCAN) density functional, we explore the ground-state

in the material. The computed band structure, crystal-field splittings in the
$f$-electron complex, the heavy effective electron mass at the Fermi energy,
and the large specific heat are all in good agreement with the corresponding
experimental results. In particular, our predicted FS explains the
experimentally observed bulk quantum oscillations as well as the low electrical

be robust regardless of its magnetic configuration. The excellent performance
of SCAN in heavy-fermion systems is explained in terms of its ability to treat

cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory

discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end
of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of
infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the
updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net
to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study
is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19
cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep
convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural
network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image
to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.
Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,
respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models
showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with
f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to
classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework.
Clinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.

internal multiple attenuation in the past years. Starting from a wave-equation
based method that required a smooth velocity model, there are now Marchenko
equation-based methods that do not require any model information or user-input.
In principle, these methods accurately predict internal multiples. Therefore,
the role of the adaptive filter has changed for these methods. Rather than
needing an aggressive adaptive filter to compensate for inaccurate internal
multiple predictions, only a conservative adaptive filter is needed to
compensate for minor amplitude and/or phase errors in the internal multiple
predictions caused by imperfect acquisition and preprocessing of the input
data. We demonstate that a conservative adaptive filter can be used to improve
the attenuation of internal multiples when applying a Marchenko multiple

that an adaptive filter can be used as a feedback mechanism to improve the

multiple change-point detection using a sensor network in which a fusion center
(FC) can receive a data stream from each sensor. Due to communication
limitations, the FC monitors only a subset of the sensors at each time slot.
Since the number of change points can be high, we adopt the false discovery
rate (FDR) criterion for controlling the rate of false alarms, while minimizing
the average detection delay (ADD). We propose two Bayesian detection procedures
that handle the communication limitations by monitoring the subset of the
sensors with the highest posterior probabilities of change points having
occurred. This monitoring policy aims to minimize the delay between the
occurrence of each change point and its declaration using the corresponding
posterior probabilities. One of the proposed procedures is more conservative
than the second one in terms of having lower FDR at the expense of higher ADD.
It is analytically shown that both procedures control the FDR under a specified
tolerated level and are also scalable in the sense that they attain an ADD that
does not increase asymptotically with the number of sensors. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the proposed detection procedures are useful for trading off
between reduced ADD and reduced average number of observations drawn until
discovery. Numerical simulations are conducted for validating the analytical
results and for demonstrating the properties of the proposed procedures.

for optical super-resolution imaging because it allows a doubling of image
resolution at speeds compatible for live-cell imaging. However, the
reconstruction of SIM images is often slow and prone to artefacts. Here we
propose a versatile reconstruction method, ML-SIM, which makes use of machine
learning. The model is an end-to-end deep residual neural network that is
trained on a simulated data set to be free of common SIM artefacts. ML-SIM is
thus robust to noise and irregularities in the illumination patterns of the raw
SIM input frames. The reconstruction method is widely applicable and does not
require the acquisition of experimental training data. Since the training data
are generated from simulations of the SIM process on images from generic
libraries the method can be efficiently adapted to specific experimental SIM
implementations. The reconstruction quality enabled by our method is compared
with traditional SIM reconstruction methods, and we demonstrate advantages in
terms of noise, reconstruction fidelity and contrast for both simulated and
experimental inputs. In addition, reconstruction of one SIM frame typically
only takes ~100ms to perform on PCs with modern Nvidia graphics cards, making
the technique compatible with real-time imaging. The full implementation and

(reward) defectors (cooperators) in a one-shot prisoner's dilemma with
third-party punishment/reward. Study 2 (N=253) extends Study 1 to a different
method of punishing/rewarding: participants are asked to rate the behaviour of
a defector/cooperator on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. In this case too, we find
that people do not discriminate between genders. Study 3a (N=331) and Study 3b
(N=310) conceptually replicate Study 2 with a slightly different gender
manipulation. These latter studies show that, in situations where they do not
have specific beliefs about the gender of the defector/cooperator's partner,
neither men nor women discriminate between genders.

on numerical simulations, due to the complex structure of the governing

disparate scales in space and time. A full-scale computational modelling
remains a formidable challenge since it amounts to simultaneously handle six or
more spatial decades in space and twice as many in time. Coarse-grained methods
often provide a viable strategy to significantly mitigate this issue, through
the implementation of mesoscale supramolecular forces designed to capture the
essential physics at a fraction of the computational cost of a full-detail
description.
  Here, we review some recent advances in the design of a lattice Boltzmann
mesoscale approach for soft flowing materials, inclusive of near-contact
interactions (NCI) between dynamic interfaces, as they occur in high
packing-fraction soft flowing crystals.
  The method proves capable of capturing several aspects of the rheology of
soft flowing crystals, namely, i) a 3/2 power-law dependence of the dispersed
phase flow rate on the applied pressure gradient, ii) the structural transition
between an ex-two and ex-one (bamboo) configurations with the associated drop
of the flow rate, iii) the onset of interfacial waves once NCI is sufficiently
intense.

screening from the Bernal bilayer, the strength of electron-electron Coulomb

screening, the insulating states become less robust, whereas the stability of
superconductivity is enhanced. Out results demonstrate the ability to directly

  In this paper we present a method to synthesize a refocused image of the
static background in the presence of dynamic objects that uses a light-field
acquired with a linear camera array. We simultaneously estimate both the depth
and the refocused image of the static scene using semantic segmentation for
detecting dynamic objects in a single time step. This eliminates the need for
initializing a static map . The algorithm is parallelizable and is implemented

find a single cluster concentrated on this local region. Such a task is called
local clustering. In contrast to global clustering, local clustering aims to
find only one cluster that is concentrating on the given seed vertex (and also
on the designated attributes for attributed graphs). Currently, very few

measures for a local cluster: Graph Unimodality (GU) and Attribute Unimodality

latter measures the homogeneity of the subspace that is composed of the

bilayer, and bulk structures. Unlike usual non-magnetic vdW semiconductors, in
which many-electron interactions and excited states are sensitive to
dimensionality, many-electron interactions are always enhanced and dominate
quasiparticle energies and optical responses of both two-dimensional and bulk
CrCl3. The electron-hole (e-h) binding energy can reach 3 eV in monolayer and
remains as high as 2 eV in bulk. Because of the cancellation effect between
self-energy corrections and e-h binding energies, the lowest-energy exciton
(optical gap) is almost not affected by the change of dimensionality. Besides,
for the excitons with similar e-h binding energies, their dipole oscillator
strength can differ by a few orders of magnitude.Our analysis shows that such a
big difference is from a unique interference effect between complex exciton
wavefunctions and interband transitions. Finally, we find that the interlayer
stacking sequence and magnetic coupling barely change quasiparticle band gaps
and optical absorption spectra of CrCl3. Our calculated low-energy exciton peak
positions agree with available measurements. These findings give insight into
the understanding of many-electron interactions and the interplay between

metallicities, we find that [Si/Fe] is enhanced at supersolar metallicities. We
speculate on possible enrichment scenarios to explain such a trend. However,
the sample size is modest and the result needs to be confirmed by additional
measurements of silicon and other \textalpha-elements. We also derive a new
distribution of [Fe/H] and find the most metal rich stars at [Fe/H]=+0.5 dex,
confirming our earlier conclusions that the Galactic center hosts no stars with
extreme chemical composition.

  HMM-based Alignment",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work in word spotting in handwritten documents has yielded impressive
results. This progress has largely been made by supervised learning systems,
which are dependent on manually annotated data, making deployment to new
collections a significant effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that
utilises transcripts without bounding box annotations to train
segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting models, given a partially
trained model. This is done through a training-free alignment procedure based
on hidden Markov models. This procedure creates a tentative mapping between
word region proposals and the transcriptions to automatically create additional
weakly annotated training data, without choosing any single alignment
possibility as the correct one. When only using between 1% and 7% of the fully
annotated training sets for partial convergence, we automatically annotate the
remaining training data and successfully train using it. On all our datasets,
our final trained model then comes within a few mAP% of the performance from a
model trained with the full training set used as ground truth. We believe that
this will be a significant advance towards a more general use of word spotting,
since digital transcription data will already exist for parts of many
collections of interest.

Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ in the low temperature ($T$) and moderate magnetic field
($\mathbf{B}$) regime ($T\in[0.1,1.7]K$, $B\in[0,0.3]T$). Our objective is to
understand the main physics shaping the out-of-equilibrium magnetisation vs.
temperature curves in two different regimes. Very far from equilibrium, turning
on the magnetic field after having cooled the system in zero field (ZFC) can
increase the concentration of magnetic monopoles; this accelerates the
dynamics. Similarly to electrolytes, this occurs through dissociation of bound
monopole pairs. However, for spin ices the polarisation of the vacuum out of
which the monopole pairs are created is a key factor shaping the magnetisation
curves, with no analog. We observe a threshold field near $0.2T$ for this fast
dynamics to take place, linked to the maximum magnetic force between the
attracting pairs. Surprisingly, within a regime of low temperatures and
moderate fields, an extended Ohm's law can be used to describe the ZFC
magnetisation curve obtained with the dipolar spin-ice model. However, in real
samples the acceleration of the dynamics appears even sharper than in
simulations, possibly due to the presence of avalanches. On the other hand, the
effect of the field nearer equilibrium can be just the opposite to that at very
low temperatures. Single crystals, as noted before for powders, abandon
equilibrium at a blocking temperature $T_B$ which increases with field.
Curiously, this behaviour is present in numerical simulations even within the
nearest-neighbours interactions model. Simulations and experiments show that
the increasing trend in $T_B$ is stronger for $\mathbf{B}\parallel[100]$. This
suggests that the field plays a part in the dynamical arrest through monopole
suppression, which is quite manifest for this field orientation.

of three steps. First, we extract the coarse object point cloud from the RGB-D
image by 2D detection. Second, we feed the coarse object point cloud to a
translation localization network to perform 3D segmentation and object
translation prediction. Third, via the predicted segmentation and translation,
we transfer the fine object point cloud into a local canonical coordinate, in
which we train a rotation localization network to estimate initial object
rotation. In the third step, we define point-wise embedding vector features to
capture viewpoint-aware information. To calculate more accurate rotation, we
adopt a rotation residual estimator to estimate the residual between initial
rotation and ground truth, which can boost initial pose estimation performance.
Our proposed G2L-Net is real-time despite the fact multiple steps are stacked
via the proposed coarse-to-fine framework. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets show that G2L-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in

to elastic scattering, the model allows for inelastic interactions, which can

cross section $0.01\lesssim\sigma/m<1\textrm{ cm}^{2}{ \rm g}^{-1}$ and the
kick velocity $V_{k}\simeq 100\textrm{ km s}^{-1}$ has been shown to robustly
resolve the missing satellites, core-cusp, and too-big-to-fail problems in
$N$-body cosmological simulations tested on MW-like haloes of a virial mass
$\sim5 \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ (Paper I $\&$ II). With the aim of further
constraining the parameter space available for the 2cDM model, we extend our
analysis to dwarf and galaxy cluster haloes with their virial mass of $\sim
10^7 - 10^8$ and $\sim 10^{13} - 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. We find
$\sigma_{0} / m \gtrsim 0.1 \textrm{ cm}^{2}{\rm g}^{-1}$ is preferentially
disfavored for both dwarfs and galaxy cluster haloes in comparison with
observations, while $\sigma_{0} / m = 0.001 \textrm{ cm}^{2}{\rm g}^{-1}$
causes little perceptible difference from that of the CDM counterpart for most
of the cross section's velocity dependence studied in this work. Our main
result is that within the reasonable set of parameters the 2cDM model can
successfully explain the observational trends seen in dwarf galaxy and galaxy

($N\geq3$) systems can be explained if most systems belong to a single
intrinsic population, with a subset of high-multiplicity systems ($\sim20\%$)
hosting additional, undetected planets intermediate in period between the known

roughly the same size and approximately coplanar. We find that forward modeling
has not yet reproduced the high degree of spacing similarity (in log-period)

among stars, disks, and planets probes the complex dynamical processes guiding
their formation and evolution. The accuracy of the \textit{Gaia} catalog can be
exploited to enable comparison of binary orbits with known planet or disk

\textit{Gaia} astrometry can place meaningful limits on orbital elements in
cases with reliable astrometry, and discuss metrics for assessing the
reliability of \textit{Gaia} DR2 solutions for orbit fitting. We demonstrate
our method by determining orbital elements for three systems (DS Tuc AB, GK/GI
Tau, and Kepler-25/KOI-1803) using \textit{Gaia} astrometry alone. We show that
DS Tuc AB's orbit is nearly aligned with the orbit of DS Tuc Ab, GK/GI Tau's

Kepler-25/KOI-1803 orbit is not aligned with either component's transiting

Cr adatoms are incrementally deposited onto the TI held in ultrahigh vacuum at

electron density shows a non-monotonic evolution with the Cr density

$n_{\mathrm{Cr}}$. This unusual behavior is ascribed to the dual roles of the
Cr as ionized impurities and electron donors, having competing effects of
enhancing and decreasing the electronic inhomogeneities in the surface state at
low and high $n_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ respectively. The magnetoconductivity is
obtained for different $n_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ on one and the same sample, which
yields clear evidence that the weak antilocalization effect persists and the

role in the evolution of the lithosphere. These phenomena are commonly modeled
by Stokes flows with viscoplastic rheologies. The nonlinearities of these
rheologies make the numerical solution of the resulting systems challenging,
and iterative methods often converge slowly or not at all. Yet accurate
solutions are critical for representing the physics. Moreover, for some
rheology laws, aspects of solvability are still unknown. We study a basic but
representative viscoplastic rheology law. The law involves a yield stress that
is independent of the dynamic pressure, referred to as von Mises yield
criterion. Two commonly used variants, perfect/ideal and composite
viscoplasticity, are compared. We derive both variants from energy minimization
principles, and we use this perspective to argue when solutions are unique. We
propose a new stress-velocity Newton solution algorithm that treats the stress
as an independent variable during the Newton linearization but requires
solution only of Stokes systems that are of the usual velocity-pressure form.
To study different solution algorithms, we implement 2D and 3D finite element
discretizations, and we generate Stokes problems with up to 7 orders of
magnitude viscosity contrasts, in which compression or tension results in
significant nonlinear localization effects. Comparing the performance of the
proposed Newton method with the standard Newton method and the Picard
fixed-point method, we observe a significant reduction in the number of
iterations and improved stability with respect to problem nonlinearity, mesh
refinement, and the polynomial order of the discretization.

provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the
usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this
scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant
phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the
automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or
sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to
name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These
include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their
development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and
its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide
further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come
to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis
and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so
far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.

received attention over the past two decades. In recent literature, there has
been interest in a generalization of these types of algebra in which each
individual operation is replaced by a family of operations indexed by a fixed

existing work by showing that a similar extension is possible already for the
most familiar types of algebra: commutative, associative, and Lie. Second, we
show that these concepts arise naturally and in a unified manner from a
categorical perspective. For this, one simply has to consider the standard
types of algebra but in reference to the monoidal category of $S$-graded vector

neutron stars allow us to probe the strong and dynamical field regime of
gravity. On the other hand, a collective signal from many individual,
unresolved sources results in what is known as a stochastic background. We here
consider probing gravity with such a background from stellar-mass binary black
hole mergers. We adopt a simple power-law spectrum and carry out a parameter
estimation study with a network of current and future ground-based detectors by
including both general relativistic and beyond general relativistic variables.
For a network of second-generation detectors, we find that one can place
meaningful bounds on the deviation parameter in the gravitational-wave
amplitude if it enters at a sufficiently negative post-Newtonian order.
However, such future bounds from a stochastic background are weaker than
existing bounds from individual sources, such as GW150914 and GW151226. We also
find that systematic errors due to mismodeling of the spectrum is much smaller
than statistical errors, which justifies our use of the power-law model.
Regarding a network of third-generation detectors, we find that the bounds on
the deviation parameter from statistical errors improve upon the
second-generation case, though systematic errors now dominate the error budget
and thus one needs to use a more realistic spectrum model. We conclude that
individual sources seem to be more powerful in probing general relativity than
the astrophysical stochastic background.

linear in the order parameter and an applied magnetic field. The lowered

that the elastic constants change proportional to the field and are shown to

in the solar corona. However, the current quantitative understanding of this
relationship is based on the analysis of only a handful of events. Here we
report a statistical study of 60 CME-flare events from August 2010 to December
2013. We investigate kinematic properties of CMEs and magnetic reconnection in
the low corona during the early phase of the eruptions, by combining limb
observations from STEREO with simultaneous on-disk views from SDO. For a subset
of 42 events with reconnection rate evaluated by the magnetic fluxes swept by
the flare ribbons on the solar disk observed from SDO, we find a strong
correlation between the peak CME acceleration and the peak reconnection rate.
Also, the maximum velocities of relatively fast CMEs (> 600 km/s) are
positively correlated with the reconnection flux, but no such correlation is
found for slow CMEs. A time-lagged correlation analysis suggests that the
distribution of the time lag of CME acceleration relative to reconnection rate
exhibits three peaks, approximately 10 minutes apart, and on average,
acceleration-lead events have smaller reconnection rates. We further compare
the CME total mechanical energy with the estimated energy in the current sheet.
The comparison suggests that, for small-flare events, reconnection in the
current sheet alone is insufficient to fuel CMEs. Results from this study
suggest that flare reconnection may dominate the acceleration of fast CMEs, but
for events of slow CMEs and weak reconnection, other mechanisms may be more
important.

creating a plane-wave-like migration front, without assistance of diffusion
channels. Nitrogen magneto-ionics requires lower threshold voltages and
exhibits enhanced rates and cyclability. This is due to the lower activation
energy for ion diffusion and the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared

multiple co-evolving systems have required that each system can only change its
state during an associated pre-fixed, limited set of time intervals. However,
in many real-world cases the times when systems change their states are
randomly determined, e.g., in almost all biological examples of co-evolving
systems. Such randomness in the timing drastically modifies the thermodynamics.
Here I derive FTs that apply whether or not the timing is random. These FTs
provide new versions of the second law, and of all conventional thermodynamic
uncertainty relations (TURs). These new results are often stronger than the
conventional versions, which ignore how an overall system may decompose into a
set of co-evolving systems. In addition, the new TURs often bound entropy
production (EP) of the overall system even if none of the criteria for a

attacks in both digital and physical domains. While feasible, digital attacks
have limited applicability in attacking deployed systems, including face
recognition systems, where an adversary typically has access to the input and
not the transmission channel. In such setting, physical attacks that directly
provide a malicious input through the input channel pose a bigger threat. We
investigate the feasibility of conducting real-time physical attacks on face
recognition systems using adversarial light projections. A setup comprising a
commercially available web camera and a projector is used to conduct the
attack. The adversary uses a transformation-invariant adversarial pattern
generation method to generate a digital adversarial pattern using one or more
images of the target available to the adversary. The digital adversarial
pattern is then projected onto the adversary's face in the physical domain to
either impersonate a target (impersonation) or evade recognition (obfuscation).
We conduct preliminary experiments using two open-source and one commercial
face recognition system on a pool of 50 subjects. Our experimental results
demonstrate the vulnerability of face recognition systems to light projection
attacks in both white-box and black-box attack settings.

assume that they are acting in our best interests. But what should we assume
when it is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is acting on our behalf?
Early examples of AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google, and Cortana already
serve as a key interface between consumers and information on the web, and
users routinely rely upon AI-driven systems like these to take automated
actions or provide information. Superficially, such systems may appear to be
acting according to user interests. However, many AI systems are designed with
embedded conflicts of interests, acting in ways that subtly benefit their
creators (or funders) at the expense of users. To address this problem, in this
paper we introduce the concept of AI loyalty. AI systems are loyal to the
degree that they are designed to minimize, and make transparent, conflicts of
interest, and to act in ways that prioritize the interests of users. Properly
designed, such systems could have considerable functional and competitive - not
to mention ethical - advantages relative to those that do not. Loyal AI
products hold an obvious appeal for the end-user and could serve to promote the
alignment of the long-term interests of AI developers and customers. To this
end, we suggest criteria for assessing whether an AI system is sufficiently
transparent about conflicts of interest, and acting in a manner that is loyal
to the user, and argue that AI loyalty should be considered during the
technological design process alongside other important values in AI ethics such
as fairness, accountability privacy, and equity. We discuss a range of
mechanisms, from pure market forces to strong regulatory frameworks, that could
support incorporation of AI loyalty into a variety of future AI systems.

with inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiment in hole-doped cuprates.

string-inspired cosmological model, in which condensates of primordial
gravitational waves (GW), formed at the very early eras after the Big Bang, are
considered responsible for inducing inflation and then a smooth exit to a
radiation dominated epoch. Primordial axion fields, that exist in the
fundamental massless gravitational (bosonic) string multiplet, couple to the
non-trivial GW-induced anomalies. As a result of this coupling, there exist
axion background configurations which violate (spontaneously) Lorentz symmetry,
and remain undiluted at the end of inflation. In models with heavy sterile
right-handed neutrinos (RHN), such backgrounds are linked to novel (Lorentz and
CPT Violating) mechanisms for the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in
the Cosmos, via the asymmetric decays of the RHN to standard model particles
and antiparticles. During the QCD epoch, the axions develop an
instanton-induced mass and can, thus, play the r\^ole of Dark Matter (DM). The
energy density of such a Universe, throughout its evolution, has the form of
that of a ""running vacuum model"", that is, it can be expanded in power series
of even powers of the Hubble parameter $H(t)$. The coefficients of those terms,
though, are different for the various cosmological epochs. For the
phenomenology of our model, which is consistent with the current cosmological
data, and could also help in alleviating (some of) the tensions, it suffices to
consider up to and including quartic powers of $H(t)$. In the early Universe
phase, it is the $H^4(t)$ term, induced by the GW condensate of the
gravitational anomaly, that drives inflation without the need for external
inflaton fields.

incorporate syntactic information such as constituency parsing trees into the
encoding sequence to learn both the semantic and syntactic information from the

from one queue to another. Each flow is partially characterized by its rate and
a continuous function that measures the stochastic variability over time. This
function is a scaled version of the variance-time curve, called the index of
dispersion for counts (IDC). The required IDC functions for the flows can be
calculated from the model primitives, estimated from data or approximated by
solving a set of linear equations. A robust queueing technique is used to
generate approximations of the mean steady-state performance at each queue from
the IDC of the total arrival flow and the service specification at that queue.

radio fluxes of 3C 454.3 and PKS 1633+382 are correlated without any time-lag,
suggesting that they are from the same radiation region. Similar correlation is
also observed in 3C 273 and PKS 1222+216, but the radio flux is lag behind the
gamma-ray flux approximately ~160 days and ~290 days, respectively. This likely
suggests that their gamma-ray emission regions are located at the upstream of
their radio cores at 43 GHz. The gamma-ray and radio fluxes of the other four
blazars are not correlated, implying that the gamma-ray and radio emission may
be from different regions in their jets. The gamma-ray light curves of the
eight blazars can be decomposed into some long timescale variability components

(URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services on the same licensed
spectrum has gained a lot of attention from both academia and industry.
However, the coexistence of these services is not trivial due to the diverse
multiple access protocols, contrasting frame distributions in the existing

services. Therefore, such coexistence drives towards a challenging resource
scheduling problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we first
investigate the possibilities of scheduling URLLC packets in incumbent eMBB
traffic. In this regard, we formulate an optimization problem for coexistence
by dynamically adopting a superposition or puncturing scheme. In particular,
the aim is to provide spectrum access to the URLLC users while reducing the
intervention on incumbent eMBB users. Next, we apply the one-to-one matching
game to find stable URLLC-eMBB pairs that can coexist on the same spectrum.
Then, we apply the contract theory framework to design contracts for URLLC
users to adopt the superposition scheme. Simulation results reveal that the
proposed contract-based scheduling scheme achieves up to 63% of the eMBB rate
for the ""No URLLC"" case compared to the ""Puncturing"" scheme.

training it to learn parameters of a Gaussian model approximating the prior on

then apply Bayesian reasoning to leverage the prior and information from the

we use the closed-form analytic \textit{maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimate in
the NLB algorithm to obtain the noise-free patch that maximizes the posterior

been developed concerning the validity and/or efficiency of statistical

mechanism is crucially relevant for conducting proper practical investigations.
The conventional notions include the three common potential classes -- missing
completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. In this
paper, we present a new hypothesis testing approach for deciding between
missing at random and missing not at random. Since the potential alternatives
of missing at random are broad, we focus our investigation on a general class
of models with instrumental variables for data missing not at random. Our
setting is broadly applicable, thanks to that the model concerning the missing
data is nonparametric, requiring no explicit model specification for the data
missingness. The foundational idea is to develop appropriate discrepancy
measures between estimators whose properties significantly differ only when
missing at random does not hold. We show that our new hypothesis testing
approach achieves an objective data oriented choice between missing at random
or not. We demonstrate the feasibility, validity, and efficacy of the new test
by theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and a real data analysis.

  This White Paper summarizes the Outer Planets Analysis Group's (OPAG's)
priorities in the Decadal Survey. Taking into account the science to be
achieved, the timing of solar system events, technological readiness, and
programmatic factors, our mission recommendations are as follows. OPAG strongly
endorses the completion and launch of the Europa Clipper mission, maintaining
the science capabilities identified upon its selection, and a Juno extended
mission at Jupiter. For the decade 2023-2032, OPAG endorses a new start for two
directed missions: first, a mission to Neptune or Uranus with atmospheric
probe(s), and second, a life detection Ocean World mission, along with
additional technological development for life detection. A Neptune mission is
preferred because, while the Neptune and Uranus systems provide equally
compelling opportunities, Triton is a higher priority ocean world target than
the Uranian satellites. The mission to Neptune or Uranus should fly first
because a delay threatens key science objectives, and additional technological
development is required for a directed life detection mission.
  Along with missions, we emphasize the necessity of maintaining a healthy
Research and Analysis (R&A) program as well as a robust Earth-based observing
program. OPAG's top two technology priorities are rapid development of a
next-generation radioisotope power source for a mission to Neptune or Uranus,

multivariate normal and Student-$t$ probabilities arising in spatial
statistics. The approach combines a tile-low-rank representation of covariance
matrices with a block-reordering scheme for efficient Quasi-Monte Carlo
simulation. The tile-low-rank representation decomposes the high-dimensional
problem into many diagonal-block-size problems and low-rank connections. The
block-reordering scheme reorders between and within the diagonal blocks to
reduce the impact of integration variables from right to left, thus improving
the Monte Carlo convergence rate. Simulations up to dimension $65{,}536$
suggest that the new method can improve the run time by an order of magnitude
compared with the non-reordered tile-low-rank Quasi-Monte Carlo method and two
orders of magnitude compared with the dense Quasi-Monte Carlo method. Our
method also forms a strong substitute for the approximate conditioning methods
as a more robust estimation with error guarantees. An application study to wind
stochastic generators is provided to illustrate that the new computational
method makes the maximum likelihood estimation feasible for high-dimensional
skew-normal random fields.

size selected gold particles with N= 100 70000 using electron energy loss (EEL)
spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The EEL mapping
assigns a feature at 2.7 eV as the bulk plasmon and another at 2.4 eV as
surface plasmon, which evolution reveals three regimes. When N decreases from
70000 to 887, the bulk plasmon stays unchanged while the surface plasmon
exhibits a slight red shift from 2.4 to 2.3 eV. It can be understood by the
dominance of classical plasmon physics and electron boundary scattering induced
retardation. When N further decreases from 887 to 300, the bulk plasmon
disappears totally and the surface plasmon shows a steady blueshift, which
indicates that the quantum confinement emerges and modifies the intraband
transition. When N 100 300, the plasmon is split to three fine features, which
is attributed to superimposed single electron transitions between the quantized
molecular like energy level by the time dependent density functional theory
calculations. The surface plasmon's excitation ratio has a scaling law with an
exponential dependence on N ( N^0.669), essentially the square of the radius. A
unified evolution picture from the classical to quantum, molecular plasmon is
thus demonstrated.

support vector machines (SVMs). A number of approaches have been proposed to
extend the original binary SVM to an all-in-one multiclass SVM. However, its
direct extension to a unified multilabel SVM has not been widely investigated.
We propose a straightforward extension to the SVM to cope with multiclass and
multilabel classification problems within a unified framework. Our framework
deviates from the conventional soft margin SVM framework with its direct
oppositional structure. In our formulation, class-specific weight vectors
(normal vectors) are learned by maximizing their margin with respect to an
origin and penalizing patterns when they get too close to this origin. As a
result, each weight vector chooses an orientation and a magnitude with respect
to this origin in such a way that it best represents the patterns belonging to
its corresponding class. Opposition between classes is introduced into the
formulation via the minimization of pairwise inner products of weight vectors.
We also extend our framework to cope with nonlinear separability via standard
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Biases which are closely related to
the origin need to be treated properly in both the original feature space and
Hilbert space. We have the flexibility to incorporate constraints into the
formulation (if they better reflect the underlying geometry) and improve the
performance of the classifier. To this end, specifics and technicalities such
as the origin in RKHS are addressed. Results demonstrates a competitive
classifier for both multiclass and multilabel classification problems.

finds numerous applications in data mining, machine learning, and artificial

correlated across multiple feature representations (views) of the same set of
entities. CCA and to a lesser extent GCCA have been studied from the
statistical and algorithmic points of view, but not as much from the standpoint
of linear algebra. This paper offers a fresh algebraic perspective of GCCA
based on a (bi-)linear generative model that naturally captures its essence. It
is shown that from a linear algebra point of view, GCCA is tantamount to
subspace intersection; and conditions under which the common subspace of the
different views is identifiable are provided. A novel GCCA algorithm is
proposed based on subspace intersection, which scales up to handle large GCCA
tasks. Synthetic as well as real data experiments are provided to showcase the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

analysis of massive geostatistical datasets. The underlying idea combines ideas
on high-dimensional geostatistics by partitioning the spatial domain and
modeling the regions in the partition using a sparsity-inducing directed
acyclic graph (DAG). We extend the model over the DAG to a well-defined spatial
process, which we call the Meshed Gaussian Process (MGP). A major contribution
is the development of a MGPs on tessellated domains, accompanied by a Gibbs
sampler for the efficient recovery of spatial random effects. In particular,
the cubic MGP (Q-MGP) can harness high-performance computing resources by
executing all large-scale operations in parallel within the Gibbs sampler,
improving mixing and computing time compared to sequential updating schemes.
Unlike some existing models for large spatial data, a Q-MGP facilitates massive
caching of expensive matrix operations, making it particularly apt in dealing
with spatiotemporal remote-sensing data. We compare Q-MGPs with large synthetic
and real world data against state-of-the-art methods. We also illustrate using
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Serengeti park

heterogeneous wireless networks with imperfect channels. In the heterogeneous
networks, multiple wireless networks adopt different medium access control
(MAC) protocols to share a common wireless spectrum and each network is unaware
of the MACs of others. This paper aims to design a distributed deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) based MAC protocol for a particular network, and
the objective of this network is to achieve a global $\alpha$-fairness
objective. In the conventional DRL framework, feedback/reward given to the
agent is always correctly received, so that the agent can optimize its strategy
based on the received reward. In our wireless application where the channels
are noisy, the feedback/reward (i.e., the ACK packet) may be lost due to
channel noise and interference. Without correct feedback, the agent (i.e., the
network user) may fail to find a good solution. Moreover, in the distributed
protocol, each agent makes decisions on its own. It is a challenge to guarantee
that the multiple agents will make coherent decisions and work together to
achieve the same objective, particularly in the face of imperfect feedback
channels. To tackle the challenge, we put forth (i) a feedback recovery
mechanism to recover missing feedback information, and (ii) a two-stage action
selection mechanism to aid coherent decision making to reduce transmission
collisions among the agents. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of these two mechanisms. Last but not least, we believe that the
feedback recovery mechanism and the two-stage action selection mechanism can
also be used in general distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning problems
in which feedback information on rewards can be corrupted.

the variance of the images, which include extreme viewpoint changes such as

in the sort-step, $k$-nearest neighbor search with soft-voting to sort the

the insert-step, we add additional samples from the dataset that were not
retrieved by image-similarity. This approach allows overcoming the low visual

of the end-to-end segmentation model, we propose a new deep convolutional
network model for medical image pixel segmentation, called MC-Net. The core of
this network model consists of four parts, namely, an encoder network, a
multiple max-pooling integration module, a cross multiscale deconvolution
decoder network and a pixel-level classification layer. In the network
structure of the encoder, we use multiscale convolution instead of the
traditional single-channel convolution. The multiple max-pooling integration
module first integrates the output features of each submodule of the encoder
network and reduces the number of parameters by convolution using a kernel size
of 1. At the same time, each max-pooling layer (the pooling size of each layer
is different) is spliced after each convolution to achieve the translation
invariance of the feature maps of each submodule. We use the output feature
maps from the multiple max-pooling integration module as the input of the
decoder network; the multiscale convolution of each submodule in the decoder
network is cross-fused with the feature maps generated by the corresponding
multiscale convolution in the encoder network. Using the above feature map
processing methods solves the sparsity problem after the max-pooling
layer-generating matrix and enhances the robustness of the classification. We
compare our proposed model with the well-known Fully Convolutional Networks for
Semantic Segmentation (FCNs), DecovNet, PSPNet, U-net, SgeNet and other
state-of-the-art segmentation networks such as HyperDenseNet, MS-Dual,

poloidal and parallel flows that control the physical set-up of the SOL region.
Here, we present post-processing analysis of simulations from the gyrokinetic
code XGC1, comparing edge turbulence characteristics from a simulation of
DIII-D against one of C-Mod. We find that the equilibrium $E \times B$ flux
across the separatrix has a similar poloidal pattern in both discharges which
can be explained by magnetic drifts and trapped ion excursions. However,
collisionality is noted to play a major role in that it prevents local charge
accumulations from having global effects in C-Mod. In both cases, turbulent
electron heat flux is higher than the ion one. This seems to be a universal
characteristic of the tokamak edge. We identify turbulent frequencies and
growth rates of the dominant mode in both simulations. In C-Mod, these numbers
point to the presence of a drift wave. In DIII-D, linear simulations with Gene
reveal a trapped electron mode. Furthermore, we present the amplitude and size
distributions of the blobs from both simulations. Amplitude distributions are
in qualitative agreement with experimental observations while size
distributions are consistent with the fact that most blobs are not connecting
to the divertor plates and suggest that they are generated by the shearing of
the turbulent modes.

for flow properties while boundary conditions play a role of the driving force.
Their effects on flow properties have been analyzed via a quasi-one-dimensional
Poisson-Nernst-Planck model for small and relatively large permanent charges.
The analytical studies have led to the introduction of flux ratios that reflect
permanent charge effects and have a universal property. The studies also show
that the flux ratios have different behaviors for small and large permanent
charges. However, the existing analytical techniques can reveal neither
behaviors of flux ratios nor transitions between small and large permanent
charges. In this work we present a numerical investigation on flux ratios to
bridge between small and large permanent charges. Numerical results verify the
analytical predictions for the two extremal regions. More significantly,
emergence of non-trivial behaviors is detected as the permanent charge varies
from small to large. In particular, saddle-node bifurcations of flux ratios are
revealed, showing rich phenomena of permanent charge effects by the power of
combining analytical and numerical techniques. An adaptive moving mesh finite

identification is a challenging problem due to correlations introduced in data

finite-time guarantees in both open and closed-loop system identification.
Deploying this estimation method, we propose adaptive control online learning
(AdaptOn), an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively learns
the system dynamics and continuously updates its controller through online
learning steps. AdaptOn estimates the model dynamics by occasionally solving a
linear regression problem through interactions with the environment. Using
policy re-parameterization and the estimated model, AdaptOn constructs
counterfactual loss functions to be used for updating the controller through
online gradient descent. Over time, AdaptOn improves its model estimates and
obtains more accurate gradient updates to improve the controller. We show that
AdaptOn achieves a regret upper bound of $\text{polylog}\left(T\right)$, after
$T$ time steps of agent-environment interaction. To the best of our knowledge,
AdaptOn is the first algorithm that achieves $\text{polylog}\left(T\right)$
regret in adaptive control of unknown partially observable linear dynamical
systems which includes linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control.

services for each unique segment. To do so, the first stage is defining these

security controls. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning technique

prediction in recommender systems. In most existing deep learning models,
feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated.
However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and
computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and
complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm
called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can
automatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models
with computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to
convergence. In the \emph{search stage}, instead of searching over a discrete
set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by
introducing the architecture parameters. By implementing a regularized
optimizer over the architecture parameters, the model can automatically
identify and remove the redundant feature interactions during the training
process of the model. In the \emph{re-train stage}, we keep the architecture
parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the performance.
Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one
private) demonstrate that AutoFIS can significantly improve various FM based
models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto the training platform of Huawei App
Store recommendation service, where a 10-day online A/B test demonstrated that
AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by 20.3\% and 20.1\% in terms of CTR and CVR

methods since it serves as a basic performance estimator for different

supernet should give a reasonable ranking over all paths. They thus treat all
paths equally, and spare much effort to train paths. However, it is harsh for a
single supernet to evaluate accurately on such a huge-scale search space (e.g.,
$7^{21}$). In this paper, instead of covering all paths, we ease the burden of
supernet by encouraging it to focus more on evaluation of those
potentially-good ones, which are identified using a surrogate portion of
validation data. Concretely, during training, we propose a multi-path sampling
strategy with rejection, and greedily filter the weak paths. The training
efficiency is thus boosted since the training space has been greedily shrunk
from all paths to those potentially-good ones. Moreover, we further adopt an
exploration and exploitation policy by introducing an empirical candidate path
pool. Our proposed method GreedyNAS is easy-to-follow, and experimental results
on ImageNet dataset indicate that it can achieve better Top-1 accuracy under
same search space and FLOPs or latency level, but with only $\sim$60\% of
supernet training cost. By searching on a larger space, our GreedyNAS can also
obtain new state-of-the-art architectures.

contribution is to propose estimators of the Riemannian gradient and Hessian
from noisy objective function evaluations, based on a Riemannian version of the
Gaussian smoothing technique. The proposed estimators overcome the difficulty
of the non-linearity of the manifold constraint and the issues that arise in
using Euclidean Gaussian smoothing techniques when the function is defined only
over the manifold. We use the proposed estimators to solve Riemannian
optimization problems in the following settings for the objective function: (i)
stochastic and gradient-Lipschitz (in both nonconvex and geodesic convex
settings), (ii) sum of gradient-Lipschitz and non-smooth functions, and (iii)
Hessian-Lipschitz. For these settings, we analyze the oracle complexity of our
algorithms to obtain appropriately defined notions of $\epsilon$-stationary
point or $\epsilon$-approximate local minimizer. Notably, our complexities are
independent of the dimension of the ambient Euclidean space and depend only on
the intrinsic dimension of the manifold under consideration. We demonstrate the

that have not been recognized previously or fully explored, including
significant acceleration of network convergence (i.e., the networks trained
with GCP can support rapid decay of learning rates, achieving favorable
performance while significantly reducing number of training epochs), stronger
robustness to distorted examples generated by image corruptions and

distance measure. Examples of such tasks include similarity search, clustering,

been known that the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is the best
measure to use for most tasks, in most domains. Because the classic DTW
algorithm has quadratic time complexity, many ideas have been introduced to
reduce its amortized time, or to quickly approximate it. One of the most cited
approximate approaches is FastDTW. The FastDTW algorithm has well over a
thousand citations and has been explicitly used in several hundred research
efforts. In this work, we make a surprising claim. In any realistic data mining
application, the approximate FastDTW is much slower than the exact DTW. This
fact clearly has implications for the community that uses this algorithm:
allowing it to address much larger datasets, get exact results, and do so in
less time.

signals from continuous measurement of the error syndrome operators and use a

done as in the conventional operation. We optimize our continuous operation
protocol for evolution under quantum memory and under quantum annealing, by
maximizing the fidelity between the target and actual logical states at a
specified final time. In the case of quantum memory we show that our continuous
operation protocol yields a logical error rate that is slightly larger than the

advantage of our protocol is that it can be simpler to implement. For quantum
annealing, we show that our continuous quantum error correction protocol can
significantly reduce the final logical state infidelity when the continuous
measurements are sufficiently strong relative to the strength of the
time-dependent Hamiltonian, and that it can also significantly reduces the run

focus on individual samples, with less emphasis on how classes are distributed
or which classes are hard to deal with. In this work, we show that this is
harmful. We propose a method based on the Bayes' rule, that can naturally
incorporate class imbalance into the Active Learning framework. We derive that
three terms should be considered together when estimating the probability of a
classifier making a mistake for a given sample; i) probability of mislabelling
a class, ii) likelihood of the data given a predicted class, and iii) the prior
probability on the abundance of a predicted class. Implementing these terms
requires a generative model and an intractable likelihood estimation.
Therefore, we train a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for this purpose. To
further tie the VAE with the classifier and facilitate VAE training, we use the
classifiers' deep feature representations as input to the VAE. By considering
all three probabilities, among them especially the data imbalance, we can
substantially improve the potential of existing methods under limited data
budget. We show that our method can be applied to classification tasks on
multiple different datasets -- including one that is a real-world dataset with
heavy data imbalance -- significantly outperforming the state of the art.

synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) scenario, and expected from the low-redshift and
high-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as GRB 180720B and GRB 190114C.
Recently, VHE emission was detected by the H.E.S.S. telescopes from one of the
closest burst GRB 190829A which was associated with the supernova (SN) 2019oyw.
In this paper, we present a temporal and spectral analysis from optical bands
to Fermi-LAT energy range over multiple observational periods beginning just
after the BAT trigger time and extending for almost three months. We show that
the X-ray and optical observations are consistent with synchrotron
forward-shock emission evolving between the characteristic and cooling spectral
breaks during the early and late afterglow in a uniform-density medium.
Modeling the light curves together with its spectral energy distribution, it is
shown that the outflow expands with an initial bulk Lorentz factor of
$\Gamma\sim 30$, which is high for a low-luminosity GRBs and low for a
high-luminosity GRBs. The values of the initial bulk Lorentz factor and the
isotropic equivalent energy suggest that GRB 190829A is classified as an
intermediate-luminosity burst and consequently, it becomes the first burst of
this class in being detected in the VHE gamma-ray band by an imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope, and, in turn, the first event without being
simultaneously observed by the Fermi-LAT instrument. Analyzing the
intermediate-luminosity bursts with $z\lesssim 0.2$ such as GRB 130702A, we
show that bursts with intermediate luminosity are potential candidates to be

operations associated with the training of DNNs. Strategies to improve the
efficiency of MVM computation in hardware have been demonstrated with minimal
impact on training accuracy. However, the VVOP computation remains a relatively
less explored bottleneck even with the aforementioned strategies. Stochastic
computing (SC) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of VVOP computation
but on relatively shallow networks with bounded activation functions and
floating-point (FP) scaling of activation gradients. In this paper, we propose
ESSOP, an efficient and scalable stochastic outer product architecture based on
the SC paradigm. We introduce efficient techniques to generalize SC for weight
update computation in DNNs with the unbounded activation functions (e.g.,
ReLU), required by many state-of-the-art networks. Our architecture reduces the
computational cost by re-using random numbers and replacing certain FP
multiplication operations by bit shift scaling. We show that the ResNet-32

Hardware design of ESSOP at 14nm technology node shows that, compared to a

part of their target selection criteria, the production of realistic SEDs in
simulations is necessary for assisting in survey design and interpretation of
observations. The recent success in reproducing the observed luminosity
functions (LF) from far-UV to far-IR, using the state-of-the-art semi-analytic

towards better galaxy colour predictions. We show that with \shark\ and

central-satellite interactions and radiation re-processing by dust are critical
for this achievement. The first three processes create a bimodal distribution,
while dust attenuation defines the location and shape of the blue and red

displays the known issue of over-quenching of satellite galaxies, the
introduction of empirically-motivated observational errors and classification
from the same group finder used in GAMA greatly reduces this tension. The
introduction of random re-assignment of $\sim 15\%$ of centrals/satellites as

address the problem of next event prediction. However, due to insufficient

predictions that are indistinguishable from the ground truth. We formally show
that the worst-case accuracy of the proposed approach is at least equal to the
accuracy achieved in non-adversarial settings. From the experimental evaluation
it emerges that the approach systematically outperforms all baselines both in
terms of accuracy and earliness of the prediction, despite using a simple
network architecture and a naive feature encoding. Moreover, the approach is
more robust, as its accuracy is not affected by fluctuations over the case

detailed analysis of symmetric spatial multiplexing identifies a particular

an improvement. Photon number resolution opens an additional possibility for
optimizing the system in that the heralding strategy can be defined in terms of
actual detected photon numbers. Our results show that this kind of optimization
opens an additional parameter range of improved efficiency. Moreover, this
higher efficiency can be achieved by using less multiplexed units, i.e.,
smaller system size as compared to threshold-detector schemes. We also extend

The observed correlation between the prompt gamma-ray luminosity and X-ray

attention. However, the previous works suffer from error propagation due to the
accumulation of reconstructed error in inter predictive coding. Meanwhile, the
previous learning based video codecs are also not adaptive to different video
contents. To address these two problems, we propose a content adaptive and
error propagation aware video compression system. Specifically, our method
employs a joint training strategy by considering the compression performance of
multiple consecutive frames instead of a single frame. Based on the learned
long-term temporal information, our approach effectively alleviates error
propagation in reconstructed frames. More importantly, instead of using the
hand-crafted coding modes in the traditional compression systems, we design an
online encoder updating scheme in our system. The proposed approach updates the
parameters for encoder according to the rate-distortion criterion but keeps the
decoder unchanged in the inference stage. Therefore, the encoder is adaptive to
different video contents and achieves better compression performance by
reducing the domain gap between the training and testing datasets. Our method
is simple yet effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning based
video codecs on benchmark datasets without increasing the model size or
decreasing the decoding speed.

conveniently be adapted for classification problems. One compelling reason is
probably the fact that ridge regression emits a closed-form solution thereby
facilitating the training phase. However in the case of high-dimensional
problems, the closed-form solution which involves inverting the regularised
covariance matrix is rather expensive to compute. The high computational demand
of such operation also renders difficulty in constructing ensemble of ridge
regressions. In this paper, we consider learning an ensemble of ridge
regressors where each regressor is trained in its own randomly projected

integrates single object tracking and metric learning into a unified triplet

around active regions are covered with fine bright elongated structures called
bright fibrils. The mechanisms that form these structures and cause them to
appear bright are still unknown. We aim to investigate the physical properties,
such as temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and microturbulence, in the
atmosphere that produces bright fibrils and to compare those to the properties
of their surrounding atmosphere. We used simultaneous observations of a plage
region in Fe I 6301-2 \r{A}, Ca II 8542 \r{A}, Ca II K, and H$\alpha$ acquired
by the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We
manually selected a sample of 282 Ca II K bright fibrils. We compared the
appearance of the fibrils in our sample to the Ca II 8542 \r{A} and H$\alpha$
data. We performed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions
using the inversion code STiC on the Fe I 6301-2 \r{A}, Ca II 8542 \r{A}, Ca II
K lines to infer the physical properties of the atmosphere. The line profiles
in bright fibrils have a higher intensity in their K$_2$ peaks compared to
profiles formed in the surrounding atmosphere. The inversion results show that
the atmosphere in fibrils is on average $100-200$~K hotter at an optical depth
log$(\tau) = -4.3$ compared to their surroundings. The line-of-sight velocity
at chromospheric heights in the fibrils does not show any preference towards
upflows or downflows. The microturbulence in the fibrils is on average 0.5 km
s$^{-1}$ higher compared to their surroundings. Our results suggest that the
fibrils have a limited extent in height, and they should be viewed as hot
threads pervading the chromosphere.

enables hybrid quantum networks, quantum-enhanced sensing, and probing the

generation of an entangled state between the motion of a macroscopic mechanical

reference frame and providing, under ideal circumstances, a backaction-free
subspace; in the experiment, quantum backaction is suppressed by 4.6 dB. Our
results pave the road towards measurement of motion beyond the standard quantum

many applications, achieving unrivaled levels of predictive performance.
Unfortunately, the black-box nature of Deep Learning models has posed
unanswered questions about what they learn from data. Certain application
scenarios have highlighted the importance of assessing the bounds under which
Deep Learning models operate, a problem addressed by using assorted approaches
aimed at audiences from different domains. However, as the focus of the
application is placed more on non-expert users, it results mandatory to provide
the means for him/her to trust the model, just like a human gets familiar with
a system or process: by understanding the hypothetical circumstances under
which it fails. This is indeed the angular stone for this research work: to
undertake an adversarial analysis of a Deep Learning model. The proposed
framework constructs counterfactual examples by ensuring their plausibility,
e.g. there is a reasonable probability that a human could generate them without
resorting to a computer program. Therefore, this work must be regarded as
valuable auditing exercise of the usable bounds a certain model is constrained
within, thereby allowing for a much greater understanding of the capabilities
and pitfalls of a model used in a real application. To this end, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and multi-objective heuristics are used to furnish a
plausible attack to the audited model, efficiently trading between the
confusion of this model, the intensity and plausibility of the generated
counterfactual. Its utility is showcased within a human face classification
task, unveiling the enormous potential of the proposed framework.

investigate the effect of diverse recoding of granule (GR) cells on OKR by
varying the connection probability $p_c$ from Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal
value of $p_c^*~(=0.06)$, individual GR cells exhibit diverse spiking patterns
which are in-phase, anti-phase, or complex out-of-phase with respect to their
population-averaged firing activity. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via
parallel fibers (PFs) from GR cells are effectively depressed by the
error-teaching signals via climbing fibers from the inferior olive which are
also in-phase ones. Synaptic weights at in-phase PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses
of active GR cells are strongly depressed via strong long-term depression
(LTD), while those at anti-phase and complex out-of-phase PF-PC synapses are
weakly depressed through weak LTD. This kind of ""effective"" depression (i.e.,
strong/weak LTD) at the PF-PC synapses causes a big modulation in firings of
PCs, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on the vestibular
nucleus (VN) neuron (which evokes OKR). For the firing of the VN neuron, the
learning gain degree ${\cal{L}}_g$, corresponding to the modulation gain ratio,
increases with increasing the learning cycle, and it saturates at about the
300th cycle. By varying $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we find that a plot of saturated
learning gain degree ${\cal L}_g^*$ versus $p_c$ forms a bell-shaped curve with
a peak at $p_c^*$ (where the diversity degree in spiking patterns of GR cells
is also maximum). Consequently, the more diverse in recoding of GR cells, the
more effective in motor learning for the OKR adaptation.

the multi-billion-dollar database industry. Although SQL has been standardized,
the full standard is based on ambiguous natural language rather than formal
specification. Commercial SQL implementations interpret the standard in
different ways, so that, given the same input data, the same query can yield
different results depending on the SQL system it is run on. Even for a
particular system, mechanically checked formalization of all widely-used
features of SQL remains an open problem. The lack of a well-understood formal
semantics makes it very difficult to validate the soundness of database
implementations.
  Although formal semantics for fragments of SQL were designed in the past,
they usually did not support set and bag operations, lateral joins, nested
subqueries, and, crucially, null values. Null values complicate SQL's semantics
in profound ways analogous to null pointers or side-effects in other
programming languages. Since certain SQL queries are equivalent in the absence
of null values, but produce different results when applied to tables containing
incomplete data, semantics which ignore null values are able to prove query
equivalences that are unsound in realistic databases.
  A formal semantics of SQL supporting all the aforementioned features was only
proposed recently. In this paper, we report about our mechanization of SQL
semantics covering set/bag operations, lateral joins, nested subqueries, and
nulls, written in the Coq proof assistant, and describe the validation of key
metatheoretic properties. Additionally, we are able to use the same framework
to formalize the semantics of a flat relational calculus (with null values),
and show a certified translation of its normal forms into SQL.

paper, we propose a novel LfD+RL framework, namely Adaptive Conditional Neural
Movement Primitives (ACNMP), that allows efficient policy improvement in novel
environments and effective skill transfer between different agents. This is
achieved through exploiting the latent representation learned by the underlying
Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model, and simultaneous training of the model
with supervised learning (SL) for acquiring the demonstrated trajectories and
via RL for new trajectory discovery. Through simulation experiments, we show
that (i) ACNMP enables the system to extrapolate to situations where pure LfD
fails; (ii) Simultaneous training of the system through SL and RL preserves the
shape of demonstrations while adapting to novel situations due to the shared
representations used by both learners; (iii) ACNMP enables order-of-magnitude
sample-efficient RL in extrapolation of reaching tasks compared to the existing
approaches; (iv) ACNMPs can be used to implement skill transfer between robots
having different morphology, with competitive learning speeds and importantly
with less number of assumptions compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
Finally, we show the real-world suitability of ACNMPs through real robot

Considering the atomic level shifts generated by the Stark shift effect, the
dynamical behavior of both quantum coherence (QC) measured using a quantum
Jensen-Shannon divergence and of quantum correlations captured by quantum
discord (QD) are investigated. It is shown that the intensity-dependent
Stark-shift in the cavity and the number of coherent state photons plays a key
role in enhancing or destroying both QC and QD during the process of intrinsic
decoherence. We remarked that increasing the Stark-shift parameters, the
frequencies of the transition for the mode of the cavity field, and photons
number destroy both the amount of QC and QD and effected their periodicity.
More importantly, QC and QD exhibit similar behavior and both show a revival
phenomenon. We believe that the present work shows that the quantum information

recent conference, ii) review and present three papers from the chosen session
and iii) analyze the relationship between the chosen papers from the session.
To evaluate the course, we designed a set of questions to understand the
motivation and decisions behind the students' choices as well as to evaluate
and improve the quality of the course. Our key insights from the evaluation are
the following: The three most popular topics of interest were Privacy, Web
Security and Authentication, ii) 33% of the students chose the sessions based
on the title of papers and iii) when providing an encouraging environment,
students enjoy and engage in discussions.

platinum, together with manganese as constituents in the Heusler compound such

the tetragonal inverse Heusler structure, Mn1.4PtSn exhibits large

elliptic kernel identities of a new and striking character: They relate solely
to the root systems $A_2$ and $A_3$ and have no coupling type parameters
\cite{Ra18}. The pertinent 2- and 3-variable Hamiltonians are analytic
difference operators and the kernel functions are built from the elliptic gamma
function. Razamat presented compelling evidence for the validity of these
identities, and checked them to a certain order in a power series expansion.
This paper is mainly concerned with analytical proofs of these identities. More
specifically, we furnish a complete proof of the identities for the $A_2$
elliptic case and for the $A_3$ hyperbolic case, and consider several
specializations. We also discuss the implications the kernel identities might
have for a Hilbert space scenario involving common eigenvectors of the
Hamiltonians and the integral operators associated with the kernel functions.

systems, characterized by a complex interplay between topology and
interconnections strength. It is well-known that the topology of a network
affects its resilience to failures or attacks, as well as its functions.
Exchanging information is crucial for many real systems: the internet,
transportation networks and the brain are key examples. Despite the
introduction of measures of efficiency to analyze network flows, i.e.
topologies characterized by weighted connectivity, here we show that they fail
to capture combined information of link existence and link weight. In this
letter we propose a physically-grounded estimator of flow efficiency which can
be computed for every weighted network, regardless from the scale and nature of
weights and from any (missing) metadata. Remarkably, results show that our
estimator captures the heterogeneity of flows along with topological
differences and its complement information obtained from percolation analysis
of several empirical systems, including transportation, trade, migrations, and
brain networks. We show that cutting the heaviest connections may increase the
average communication efficiency of the system and hence, counterintuively, a
sparser network is not necessarily less efficient. Remarkably, our estimator
enables the comparison of communication efficiency of networks arising from
different fields, without the possible pitfalls deriving from the scale of
flow.

borehole data is a long-standing problem in hydrogeology and in petroleum

The thickness of each layer is modeled by a transformed latent Gaussian random
field allowing for null thickness thanks to a truncation process. Layers are
sequentially stacked above each other following the regional stratigraphic
sequence. By choosing adequately the variograms of these random fields, the
simulated surfaces separating two layers can be continuous and smooth. Borehole

address the problem of fisheye distortion rectification based on the classical
observation that straight lines in 3D space should be still straight in image
planes. Specifically, the proposed LaRecNet contains three sequential modules
to (1) learn the distorted straight lines from fisheye images; (2) estimate the
distortion parameters from the learned heatmaps and the image appearance; and
(3) rectify the input images via a proposed differentiable rectification layer.
To better train and evaluate the proposed model, we create a synthetic
line-rich fisheye (SLF) dataset that contains the distortion parameters and
well-annotated distorted straight lines of fisheye images. The proposed method
enables us to simultaneously calibrate the geometric distortion parameters and
rectify fisheye images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both geometric accuracy and
image quality on several evaluation metrics. In particular, the images
rectified by LaRecNet achieve an average reprojection error of 0.33 pixels on
the SLF dataset and produce the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and

power reserve of existing distributed energy resources (DERs) to mitigate these

different sites using the oscillation signals of the concerned mode as the
power commands. A theoretical basis for this decoupled modulating control is
provided. Technically, the desired sole modal oscillation signals are filtered
out by linearly combining the system-wide frequencies, which is determined by
the linear quadratic regulator based sparsity-promoting (LQRSP) technique. With
the proposed strategy, the modulation of each active power injection can be
effectively engineered considering the response limit and steady-state output
capability of the supporting device. The method is validated based on a

theory, to analyze the convergence of constant stepsize recursive stochastic
algorithms (RSAs). RSAs use randomization to efficiently compute expectations,
and so their iterates form a stochastic process. The key idea of our analysis
is to lift the RSA into an appropriate higher-dimensional space and then
express it as an equivalent Markov chain. Instead of determining the
convergence of this Markov chain (which may not converge under constant
stepsize), we study the convergence of the distribution of this Markov chain.
To study this, we define a new notion of Wasserstein divergence. We show that
if the distribution of the iterates in the Markov chain satisfy a contraction
property with respect to the Wasserstein divergence, then the Markov chain
admits an invariant distribution. We show that convergence of a large family of
constant stepsize RSAs can be understood using this framework, and we provide
several detailed examples.

proposed to provide dense and controlled coverage inside buildings. However,
all-digital C-RAN solutions are complex and expensive when indoor layout
constraints and device costs are considered. We discuss here an analog C-RAN
architecture, referred to as Analog MIMO Radio-over-Copper (A-MIMO-RoC), that
aims at distributing RF signals indoors over distances in the order of 50 m.
The all-analog passive-only design presented here proves the feasibility of
analog relaying of MIMO radio signals over LAN cables at frequency bandwidth
values up to 400 MHz for multi-RAT applications. After asserting the
feasibility of the A-MIMO-RoC platform, we present some experimental results

the A-MIMO-RoC system is a valid solution towards the design of dedicated 4G/5G

research by complementing the proton-proton collision programme with the
high-luminosity nucleus-nucleus one. Its numerous physics highlights include
studies of the exclusive Higgs-boson production in photon-photon collisions and
precision measurements of the electroweak (EW) parameters. There are two
principal ways to increase the LHC luminosity which do not require an upgrade
of the CERN injectors: (1) modification of the beam-collision optics and (2)
reduction of the transverse emittance of the colliding beams. The former scheme
is employed by the ongoing high-luminosity (HL-LHC) project. The latter one,
applicable only to ion beams, is proposed in this paper. It is based on laser
cooling of bunches of partially stripped ions at the SPS flat-top energy. For
isoscalar calcium beams, which fulfil the present beam-operation constrains and
which are particularly attractive for the EW physics, the transverse beam
emittance can be reduced by a factor of $5$ within the $8$ seconds long cooling
phase. The predicted nucleon-nucleon luminosity of $L_{NN}= 4.2 \times
10^{34}\,$s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ for collisions of the cooled calcium beams at the
LHC top energy is comparable to the levelled luminosity for the HL-LHC
proton-proton collisions, but with reduced pile-up background. The scheme
proposed in this paper, if confirmed by the future Gamma Factory
proof-of-principle experiment, could be implemented at CERN with minor
infrastructure investments.

adaptability and personalization in a cognitive framework will bring any
additional richness to the human-robot interaction (HRI), or if it will instead
bring uncertainty and unpredictability that would not be accepted by the
robot`s human peers. To this end, we designed a socially-adaptive framework for
the humanoid robot iCub which allows it to perceive and reuse the affective and
interactive signals from the person as input for the adaptation based on
internal social motivation. We propose a comparative interaction study with
iCub where users act as the robot's caretaker, and iCub's social adaptation is
guided by an internal comfort level that varies with the amount of stimuli iCub
receives from its caretaker. We investigate and compare how the internal
dynamics of the robot would be perceived by people in a condition when the
robot does not personalize its interaction, and in a condition where it is
adaptive. Finally, we establish the potential benefits that an adaptive

Then, taking into account the rotational speed, we analyze their topographic

environment around the bodies made it possible to construct zero-velocity
curves, which delimit the location of equilibrium points. The Alpha component
has a peculiar number of 12 equilibrium points, all of them located very close

points not so close to their surfaces. Then, performing numerical experiments

activity powered by the central IMBH. The existence of the large-scale jet

excited state energy and the ground state energy is an integer multiple of
$\hbar$ times the driving frequency. On the other hand, when a superconducting
phase difference is maintained between two superconductors, subgap states
appear which carry a Josephson current. A driven Josephson junction therefore
opens up an interesting avenue where the excitations due to applied driving
affect the current flowing from one superconductor to the other. Motivated by
this, we study charge transport in a superconductor-normal metal-superconductor
(SNS) junction where oscillating potentials are applied to the normal metal
region. We find that for small amplitudes of the oscillating potential, driving
at one site reverses the direction of current at the superconducting phase
differences when difference between the subgap eigenenergies of the undriven
Hamiltonian is integer multiple of $\hbar$ times the driving frequency. For
larger amplitudes of oscillating potential, driving at one site exhibits richer
features. We show that even when the two superconductors are maintained at same
superconducting phase, a current can be driven by applying oscillating
potentials to two sites in the normal metal differing by a phase. We find that
when there is a nonzero Josephson current in the undriven system, the local
peaks and valleys in current of the system driven with an amplitude of
oscillating potential smaller than the superconducting gap indicates sharp
excitations in the system. In the adiabatic limit, we find that charge
transferred in one time period diverges as a powerlaw with pumping frequency
when a Josephson current flows in the undriven system. Our calculations are
exact and can be applied to finite systems. We discuss possible experimental

the electromagnetic field is described by means of the polarization tensor in
the framework of Dirac model on the basis of first principles of thermal
quantum field theory in the Matsubara formulation. It is shown that the thermal
correction to the Casimir-Polder energy consists of three contributions. The
first of them is determined by the Matsubara summation using the polarization
tensor defined at zero temperature, whereas the second and third contributions
are caused by an explicit temperature dependence of the polarization tensor and
originate from the zero-frequency Matsubara term and the sum of all Matsubara
terms with nonzero frequencies, respectively. The asymptotic behavior for each

is still highly debated. Questions remain concerning the presence of nearby HII
regions changes the properties of early HMSF and whether HII regions promote or
inhibit the formation of high-mass stars. To characterize the role of HII
regions on the HMSF, we study the properties of a sample of candidates
high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs), of which about 90% have masses larger than
100 Msun. These high-mass objects probably represent the earliest stages of
HMSF; we search if (and how) their properties are modified by the presence of
an HII region. We took advantage of the recently published catalog of HMSC
candidates. By cross matching the HMSCs and HII regions, we classified HMSCs
into three categories: 1) The HMSCs associated with HII regions both in the
position in the projected plane of the sky and in velocity; 2) HMSCs associated
in the plane of the sky, but not in velocity; and 3) HMSCs far away from any
HII regions in the projected sky plane. We carried out comparisons between
associated and nonassociated HMSCs based on statistical analyses of
multiwavelength data from infrared to radio. Statistical analyses suggest that
HMSCs associated with HII regions are warmer, more luminous, more
centrally-peaked and turbulent. We also clearly show, for the first time, that
the ratio of bolometric luminosity to envelope mass of HMSCs (L/M) could not be
a reliable evolutionary probe for early HMSF due to the external heating
effects of the HII regions. More centrally peaked and turbulent properties of
HMSCs associated with HII regions may promote the formation of high-mass stars
by limiting fragmentation. High resolution interferometric surveys toward HMSCs
are crucial to reveal how HII regions impact the star formation process inside
HMSCs.

method for creating large concentrations of S vacancies in the inert basal
plane of MoS2 supported on semimetal CoMoP2. With a small applied potential, S
atoms can be removed in the form of H2S due to the optimized free energy of
formation. The existence of vacancies favors electron injection from the
electrode to the active site by decreasing the contact resistance. As a
consequence, the activity is increased by 221 % with the vacancy-rich MoS2 as
electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A small overpotential of
75 mV is needed to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is considered
among the best values achieved for MoS2. It is envisaged that this work may

Tuneable uniaxial stress may be applied using piezoelectric actuators, and so
far two methods have been developed to couple samples to actuators. In one,
actuators apply force along the length of a free, beam-like sample, allowing
very large strains to be achieved. In the other, samples are affixed directly
to piezoelectric actuators, allowing study of mechanically delicate materials.
Here, we describe an approach that merges the two: thin samples are affixed to
a substrate, that is then pressurized uniaxially using piezoelectric actuators.
Using this approach, we demonstrate application of large elastic strains to
mechanically delicate samples: the van der Waals-bonded material FeSe, and a

multi-faceted trust model to integrate local trust, represented by social
links, with various types of global trust evidence provided by social networks.
We aim at identifying general classes of data in order to make our model
applicable to different case studies. Then, we test the model by applying it to
a variant of User-to-User Collaborative filtering (U2UCF) which supports the
fusion of rating similarity, local trust derived from social relations, and
multi-faceted reputation for rating prediction. We test our model on two
datasets: the Yelp one publishes generic friend relations between users but
provides different types of trust feedback, including user profile
endorsements. The LibraryThing dataset offers fewer types of feedback but it
provides more selective friend relations aimed at content sharing. The results
of our experiments show that, on the Yelp dataset, our model outperforms both
U2UCF and state-of-the-art trust-based recommenders that only use rating
similarity and social relations. Differently, in the LibraryThing dataset, the
combination of social relations and rating similarity achieves the best
results. The lesson we learn is that multi-faceted trust can be a valuable type
of information for recommendation. However, before using it in an application
domain, an analysis of the type and amount of available trust evidence has to
be done to assess its real impact on recommendation performance.

too much information about individuals, but provide only general information
about the population. Thus they can be used safely without violating privacy of
individuals. It turned out however that providing a precise, formal analysis of
privacy parameters of probabilistic counters is surprisingly difficult and
needs advanced techniques and a very careful approach.
  We demonstrate also that probabilistic counters can be used as a privacy
protecion mechanism without any extra randomization. That is, the inherit
randomization from the protocol is sufficient for protecting privacy, even if
the probabilistic counter is used many times. In particular we present a
specific privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol based on a probabilistic

computer science community over the last decade. Plenty of well-performing
approximation algorithms have been designed for the maximization of (monotone
or non-monotone) submodular functions over a variety of constraints. In this
paper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which is
the submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP).
Roughly speaking, the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function
over multiple bins (knapsacks). Recently, Fairstein et al. (ESA20) presented a
tight $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation randomized algorithm for SMKP. Their
algorithm is based on the continuous greedy technique which inherently involves
randomness. However, the deterministic algorithm of this problem has not been
understood very well previously. In this paper, we present a tight
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$ deterministic algorithm for SMKP. Our algorithm is based on
reducing SMKP to an exponential-size submodular maximizaion problem over a
special partition matroid which enjoys a tight deterministic algorithm. We
develop several techniques to mimic the algorithm, leading to a tight
deterministic approximation for SMKP.

a rich and diverse avifauna threatened by an ever-expanding road network and a
road density among the highest in Europe. In this first island-wide study we
used data from 102 breeding birds recorded in 10 km x 10 km grid cells. Within

Most of the grid cells are subject to intense fragmentation and traffic noise
with combined impact hotspots located even within protected areas (such as Cape
Greco, and the Troodos Massif). Results from variance partitioning indicated
that road-related properties (total road extent and road length) accounted for
a combined 59% of variation in species richness, followed by
fragmentation-related properties and noise properties. The study posits the
need for further in-depth research on the effects of road networks on birds,

Taking this into account we populate the waveform with simplified LIGO noise
and put it through a matched filtering procedure where the template bank only
consists of uncharged templates, focusing on the charges' effect on the chirp

in two-dimensional many-body systems of free bosons and fermions by
\emph{dimensional reduction}. When the subsystem is translational invariant in
a transverse direction, this strategy allows us to reduce the initial
two-dimensional problem into decoupled one-dimensional ones in a mixed
space-momentum representation. While the idea straightforwardly applies to any
dimension $d$, here we focus on the case $d=2$ and derive explicit expressions
for two lattice models possessing a $U(1)$ symmetry, i.e., free
non-relativistic massless fermions and free complex (massive and massless)
bosons. Although our focus is on symmetry resolved entropies, some results for
the total entanglement are also new. Our derivation gives a transparent
understanding of the well known different behaviours between massless bosons
and fermions in $d\geq2$: massless fermions presents logarithmic violation of
the area which instead strictly hold for bosons, even massless. This is true
both for the total and the symmetry resolved entropies. Interestingly, we find
that the equipartition of entanglement into different symmetry sectors holds
also in two dimensions at leading order in subsystem size; we identify for both
systems the first term breaking it. All our findings are quantitatively tested
against exact numerical calculations in lattice models for both bosons and
fermions.

combines the equations for its extrema with arbitrary constraints on the vector

intervention on different individuals from data. For example, which customers
are persuadable by a product promotion? which patients should be treated with a
certain type of treatment? These are typical causal questions involving the
effect or the change in outcomes made by an intervention. The questions cannot
be answered with traditional classification methods as they only use
associations to predict outcomes. For personalised marketing, these questions
are often answered with uplift modelling. The objective of uplift modelling is
to estimate causal effect, but its literature does not discuss when the uplift
represents causal effect. Causal heterogeneity modelling can solve the problem,
but its assumption of unconfoundedness is untestable in data. So practitioners
need guidelines in their applications when using the methods. In this paper, we
use causal classification for a set of personalised decision making problems,
and differentiate it from classification. We discuss the conditions when causal
classification can be resolved by uplift (and causal heterogeneity) modelling
methods. We also propose a general framework for causal classification, by
using off-the-shelf supervised methods for flexible implementations.
Experiments have shown two instantiations of the framework work for causal
classification and for uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling, and are
competitive with the other uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling methods.

applications. Most existing LTR approaches follow a supervised learning
paradigm from offline labeled data collected from the online system. However,
it has been noticed that previous LTR models can have a good validation
performance over offline validation data but have a poor online performance,
and vice versa, which implies a possible large inconsistency between the
offline and online evaluation. We investigate and confirm in this paper that
such inconsistency exists and can have a significant impact on AliExpress
Search. Reasons for the inconsistency include the ignorance of item context
during the learning, and the offline data set is insufficient for learning the
context. Therefore, this paper proposes an evaluator-generator framework for
LTR with item context. The framework consists of an evaluator that generalizes
to evaluate recommendations involving the context, and a generator that
maximizes the evaluator score by reinforcement learning, and a discriminator
that ensures the generalization of the evaluator. Extensive experiments in
simulation environments and AliExpress Search online system show that, firstly,
the classic data-based metrics on the offline dataset can show significant
inconsistency with online performance, and can even be misleading. Secondly,
the proposed evaluator score is significantly more consistent with the online
performance than common ranking metrics. Finally, as the consequence, our
method achieves a significant improvement (\textgreater$2\%$) in terms of
Conversion Rate (CR) over the industrial-level fine-tuned model in online A/B

  Computer",,,,,"quant-ph cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Boltzmann Machines constitute a class of neural networks with applications to
image reconstruction, pattern classification and unsupervised learning in
general. Their most common variants, called Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs) exhibit a good trade-off between computability on existing silicon-based
hardware and generality of possible applications.
  Still, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited, since their training process
proves to be hard. The advent of commercial Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs)
raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices
could increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. To
date, however, the implementation of RBM networks on AQCs has been limited by
the low qubit connectivity when each qubit acts as a node of the neural
network.
  Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs, thanks to an
embedding that associates its nodes to virtual qubits, thus outperforming
previous implementations based on incomplete graphs.
  Moreover, to accelerate the learning, we implement a semantic quantum search
which, contrary to previous proposals, takes the input data as initial boundary
conditions to start each learning step of the RBM, thanks to a reverse
annealing schedule. Such an approach, unlike the more conventional forward
annealing schedule, allows sampling configurations in a meaningful neighborhood
of the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling
algorithm.
  We show that the learning based on reverse annealing quickly raises the
sampling probability of a meaningful subset of the set of the configurations.
Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM
semantically trained by reverse annealing achieves better scores on
reconstruction tasks.

presented in this paper. Embedding with the proposed structure, an efficient
classification model that accepts multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as input
is constructed. Methods: One-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN)
have proven to be effective in pervasive classification tasks, enabling the
automatic extraction of features while classifying targets. We implement the
Residual connection and design a structure which can learn the weights from the
information contained in different channels in the input feature map during the
training process. An indicator named mean square deviation is introduced to
monitor the performance of a particular model segment in the classification
task on the two out of the five ECG classes. The data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia
database is used and a series of control experiments is conducted. Results:
Utilizing both leads of the ECG signals as input to the neural network
classifier can achieve better classification results than those from using
single channel inputs in different application scenarios. Models embedded with
the channel-wise attention structure always achieve better scores on
sensitivity and precision than the plain Resnet models. The proposed model
exceeds the performance of most of the state-of-the-art models in ventricular
ectopic beats (VEB) classification, and achieves competitive scores for
supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB). Conclusion: Adopting more lead ECG
signals as input can increase the dimensions of the input feature maps, helping
to improve both the performance and generalization of the network model.
Significance: Due to its end-to-end characteristics, and the extensible
intrinsic for multi-lead heart diseases diagnosing, the proposed model can be
used for the real-time ECG tracking of ECG waveforms for Holter or wearable
devices.

eliminate negative influence of non-visible bands and erroneous information
from visible bands. In addition, generalized versions of the de Wolff figures
of merit are proposed as a new sorting criterion for the obtained unit-cell
parameters, which can be used in both orientation determination and ab-initio
indexing from Kikuchi patterns. Computational results show that the new figures
of merit work well, similarly to the original de Wolff $M_n$. Ambiguity of
indexing solutions is also pointed out, which happens in particular for
low-symmetric cells, and may generate multiple distinct solutions even if very
accurate positions of band center lines and the projection center are given.

objectively and dynamically assign the weight of attractions, and it can
estimate the weight of other attractions through training. Analysis, we can
clearly understand the connection relationship between roads; then we use
mathematical formulas to effectively combine the road network structure and
landscape attractions, which can correspond to the street network structure,
the distribution of attractions and pedestrian movement The ability to estimate
road congestion in low and inconsistent situations. We experimented with
Gulangyu Island in Xiamen. As a result, we found that 1.the attractions of
Gulangyu Island are mainly located on the edge of the island, and the
attraction of several attractions that sell tickets reaches above 0.9; 2.The
topological model of spatial syntax can better predict the walking results of
tourists in Gulangyu Island; 3.The road accessibility and the distribution of
scenic spots in Gulangyu Island have no great spatial correlation, but the
model can predict the degree of road congestion To bring it closer to the
truth. The results of our research can be used as a basis for future tourism
space management and can enrich the research of tourism space.

accelerating compute capabilities in the context of physics-based simulations.
Here, we propose EikoNet, a deep learning approach to solving the Eikonal
equation, which characterizes the first-arrival-time field in heterogeneous 3D
velocity structures. Our grid-free approach allows for rapid determination of
the travel time between any two points within a continuous 3D domain. These
travel time solutions are allowed to violate the differential equation - which
casts the problem as one of optimization - with the goal of finding network
parameters that minimize the degree to which the equation is violated. In doing
so, the method exploits the differentiability of neural networks to calculate
the spatial gradients analytically, meaning the network can be trained on its
own without ever needing solutions from a finite difference algorithm. EikoNet
is rigorously tested on several velocity models and sampling methods to
demonstrate robustness and versatility. Training and inference are highly
parallelized, making the approach well-suited for GPUs. EikoNet has low memory
overhead, and further avoids the need for travel-time lookup tables. The
developed approach has important applications to earthquake hypocenter
inversion, ray multi-pathing, and tomographic modeling, as well as to other
fields beyond seismology where ray tracing is essential.

Goldstone theorem for a quantum field formulation of molecules and solids.
Along with phonons two types of new quasiparticles appear: rotons and
translons. In full analogy with Lorentz covariance, combining space and time
coordinates, a new covariance is necessary, binding together the internal and
external degrees of freedom, without explicitly separating the centre-of-mass,
which normally applies in both classical and quantum formulations. The
generally accepted view regarding the lack of a simple correspondence between
the Goldstone modes and broken symmetries, has significant consequences: an
ambiguous BCS theory as well as a subsequent Higgs mechanism. The application
of the archetype of the classical spontaneous symmetry breaking, i.e. the
Mexican hat, as compared to standard quantum relations, i.e. the Jahn-Teller
effect, superconductivity or the Higgs mechanism, becomes a disparity. In
short, symmetry broken states have a microscopic causal origin, but transitions
between them have a teleological component. The different treatments of the
problem of the centre of gravity in quantum mechanics and in field theories
imply a second type of Bohr complementarity on the many-body level opening the
door for megascopic representations of all basic microscopic quantum axioms
with further readings for teleonomic megascopic quantum phenomena, which have
no microscopic rationale: isomeric transitions, Jahn-Teller effect, chemical
reactions, Einstein-de Haas effect, superconductivity-superfluidity, and
brittle fracture.
