studies, some of its drawbacks are inevitable, with unsuitable fluorescent

Consequently, the demand for and development of label-free methodologies to
classify cells is strong and its impact on precision medicine is relevant.
Towards this end, high-throughput techniques for cell mechanical phenotyping
have been proposed to get a multidimensional biophysical characterization of
single cells. With this motivation, our goal here is to investigate the extent
to which an unsupervised machine learning methodology, which is applied
exclusively on morpho-rheological markers obtained by real-time deformability
and fluorescence cytometry (RT-FDC), can address the difficult task of
providing label-free discrimination of reticulocytes from mature red blood
cells. We focused on this problem, since the characterization of reticulocytes
(their percentage and cellular features) in the blood is vital in multiple
human disease conditions, especially bone-marrow disorders such as anemia and
leukemia. Our approach reports promising label-free results in the
classification of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells, and it represents
a step forward in the development of high-throughput morpho-rheological-based
methodologies for the computational categorization of single cells. Besides,
our methodology can be an alternative but also a complementary method to
integrate with existing cell-labelling techniques.

make the learned feature maps being aware of the person and related body parts

maps obtained by backbone focus on persons so as to alleviate the influence of
background. Locally, a partial attention branch (PAB) makes the extracted
features be decoupled into several groups and be separately responsible for
different body parts (i.e., keypoints), thus increasing the robustness to pose
variation and partial occlusion. These two kinds of attentions are universal
and can be incorporated into existing ReID networks. We have tested its

position. We present an efficient algorithm for finding all the vertices of the
arrangement $A(L)$ of maximum level, where the level of a vertex $v$ is the
number of lines of $L$ that pass strictly below $v$. The problem, posed in
Exercise~8.13 in de Berg etal [BCKO08], appears to be much harder than it
seems, as this vertex might not be on the upper envelope of the lines.
  We first assume that all the lines of $L$ are distinct, and distinguish
between two cases, depending on whether or not the upper envelope of $L$
contains a bounded edge. In the former case, we show that the number of lines
of $L$ that pass above any maximum level vertex $v_0$ is only $O(\log n)$. In
the latter case, we establish a similar property that holds after we remove
some of the lines that are incident to the single vertex of the upper envelope.
We present algorithms that run, in both cases, in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time.
  We then consider the case where the lines of $L$ are not necessarily
distinct. This setup is more challenging, and the best we have is an algorithm
that computes all the maximum-level vertices in time $O(n^{4/3}\log^{3}n)$.
  Finally, we consider a related combinatorial question for degenerate
arrangements, where many lines may intersect in a single point, but all the
lines are distinct: We bound the complexity of the weighted $k$-level in such
an arrangement, where the weight of a vertex is the number of lines that pass
through the vertex. We show that the bound in this case is $O(n^{4/3})$, which
matches the corresponding bound for non-degenerate arrangements, and we use
this bound in the analysis of one of our algorithms.

challenging due to the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. In this paper, the
performance of UAV-based mmW links is investigated when UAVs are equipped with

the square array antenna. It is shown that the square array antenna is
sensitive to both horizontal and vertical angular vibrations of UAVs. In order
to explore the relationship between the vibrations of UAVs and their antenna
pattern, the UAV-based mmW channels are characterized by considering the large
scale path loss, small scale fading along with antenna patterns as well as the
random effect of UAVs' angular vibrations. To enable effective performance
analysis, tractable and closed-form statistical channel models are derived for

non-orthogonal multiple-access relay channel (MARC), where two sources transmit
their information simultaneously to the destination with the help of a relay.
Different from the conventional XOR-based network coding (CXNC), the relay in
our PANC generates network coded bits by considering the coefficients of the
source-to-relay channels, and forwards each bit with a pre-optimized power
level. Specifically, by defining a symbol pair as two symbols from the two
sources, we first derive the exact symbol pair error rate (SPER) of the system.
Noting that the generations of the exact SPER are complicated due to the
irregularity of the decision regions caused by random channel coefficients, we
propose a coordinate transform (CT) method to simplify the derivations of the
SPER. Next, we prove that with a power scaling factor at relay, our PANC scheme
can achieve full diversity gain, i.e., two-order diversity gain, of the system,
while the CXNC can only achieve one-order diversity gain due to multi-user
interference. In addition, we optimize the power levels at the relay to
equivalently minimize the SPER at the destination concerning the relationship
between SPER and minimum Euclidean distance of the received constellation.
Simulation results show that (1) the SPER derived based on our CT method can
well approximate the exact SPER with a much lower complexity; (2) the PANC
scheme with power level optimizations and power scaling factor design can
achieve full diversity, and obtain a much higher coding gain than the PANC
scheme with randomly chosen power levels.

intrinsic staggering properties of the model. In general, odd-frequency
correlations coexist with even-frequency correlations in both the trivial and
topological phases, with comparable and even larger odd-frequency amplitudes at
the topological phase transition points at low frequencies, due to the closing
of the energy gap at these points. Furthermore, we also discuss how bulk

Though great progress has been made, challenges remain in estimating 3D pose
for distant and occluded objects. In this paper, we present a novel framework
named ZoomNet for stereo imagery-based 3D detection. The pipeline of ZoomNet
begins with an ordinary 2D object detection model which is used to obtain pairs
of left-right bounding boxes. To further exploit the abundant texture cues in
RGB images for more accurate disparity estimation, we introduce a conceptually
straight-forward module -- adaptive zooming, which simultaneously resizes 2D
instance bounding boxes to a unified resolution and adjusts the camera
intrinsic parameters accordingly. In this way, we are able to estimate
higher-quality disparity maps from the resized box images then construct dense
point clouds for both nearby and distant objects. Moreover, we introduce to
learn part locations as complementary features to improve the resistance
against occlusion and put forward the 3D fitting score to better estimate the
3D detection quality. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI 3D detection
dataset indicate ZoomNet surpasses all previous state-of-the-art methods by
large margins (improved by 9.4% on APbv (IoU=0.7) over pseudo-LiDAR). Ablation
study also demonstrates that our adaptive zooming strategy brings an
improvement of over 10% on AP3d (IoU=0.7). In addition, since the official
KITTI benchmark lacks fine-grained annotations like pixel-wise part locations,
we also present our KFG dataset by augmenting KITTI with detailed instance-wise
annotations including pixel-wise part location, pixel-wise disparity, etc..
Both the KFG dataset and our codes will be publicly available at

the oscillator and the driving. The results facilitate using nanomechanical,

$12\rm{K}\lesssim T \lesssim 40\rm{K}$ collapse on a single curve independent

that the main sub-dominant scattering process is not electron-impurity but
electron-phonon. Here we demonstrate that the collapse of the data on a single

assuming that the suspended bilayer graphene is not a truly gapless system.
With a gap of $\sim 5$ meV, our theory produces excellent agreement with the

on the training dynamics and task performance. At present, the most effective
and widely-used activation function is ReLU. However, because of the non-zero
mean, negative missing and unbounded output, ReLU is at a potential
disadvantage during optimization. To this end, we introduce a novel activation
function to manage to overcome the above three challenges. The proposed
nonlinearity, namely ""Soft-Root-Sign"" (SRS), is smooth, non-monotonic, and
bounded. Notably, the bounded property of SRS distinguishes itself from most
state-of-the-art activation functions. In contrast to ReLU, SRS can adaptively
adjust the output by a pair of independent trainable parameters to capture
negative information and provide zero-mean property, which leading not only to
better generalization performance, but also to faster learning speed. It also
avoids and rectifies the output distribution to be scattered in the
non-negative real number space, making it more compatible with batch
normalization (BN) and less sensitive to initialization. In experiments, we
evaluated SRS on deep networks applied to a variety of tasks, including image
classification, machine translation and generative modelling. Our SRS matches

allows us to give a transparent approximation of the three-dimensional parental
problem. The resulting 6-parameter isotropic shell model combines membrane,
bending and curvature effects at the same time. The Cosserat shell model
naturally includes a frame of orthogonal directors, the last of which does not
necessarily coincide with the normal of the surface. This rotation-field is
coupled to the shell-deformation and augments the well-known Reissner-Mindlin
kinematics (one independent director) with so-called in-plane drill rotations,
the inclusion of which is a decisive for subsequent numerical treatment and
existence proofs. As a major novelty, we determine the constitutive
coefficients of the Cosserat shell model in dependence on the geometry of the
shell which are otherwise difficult to guess.

consensus algorithm which uses a communication map at the cyber layer to
estimate the corresponding change. During the transient time of reaching a
consensus, the delivered power may not match the load power demand. To
eliminate this mismatch, a control law is augmented that consists of a

class of quantum groups. However, our series of articles is purely
combinatorial. In Part I we introduced a class of parameters which gave rise to
many new non-hyperoctahedral categories of partitions. In the present article
we show that this class actually contains all possible parameter values of all
non-hyperoctahedral categories of partitions. This is an important step towards
the classification of all non-hyperoctahedral categories.

  RLBox supports efficient sandboxing through either software-based-fault

transient, and have only minor impact on page latency. We demonstrate this by
sandboxing performance-sensitive image decoding libraries ( libjpeg and libpng

symmetric key encryption (SKE), albeit restricted to a classical
indistinguishability phase. Gagliardoni et al. (CRYPTO'16) advanced the study
of quantum security by giving, for SKE, the first definition with a quantum
indistinguishability phase. For PKE, on the other hand, no notion of quantum
security with a quantum indistinguishability phase exists. Our main result is a
novel quantum security notion (qIND-qCPA) for PKE with a quantum
indistinguishability phase, which closes the aforementioned gap. We show a
distinguishing attack against code-based schemes and against LWE-based schemes
with certain parameters. We also show that the canonical hybrid PKE-SKE
encryption construction is qIND-qCPA-secure, even if the underlying PKE scheme
by itself is not. Finally, we classify quantum-resistant PKE schemes based on
the applicability of our security notion. Our core idea follows the approach of
Gagliardoni et al. by using so-called type-2 operators for encrypting the
challenge message. At first glance, type-2 operators appear unnatural for PKE,
as the canonical way of building them requires both the secret and the public
key. However, we identify a class of PKE schemes - which we call recoverable -
and show that for this class type-2 operators require merely the public key.
Moreover, recoverable schemes allow to realise type-2 operators even if they
suffer from decryption failures, which in general thwarts the reversibility
mandated by type-2 operators. Our work reveals that many real-world
quantum-resistant PKE schemes, including most NIST PQC candidates and the
canonical hybrid construction, are indeed recoverable.

as the interplay between structure and dynamics in supercooled liquids and

dramatically and become heterogeneous while the structure appears largely
unperturbed. Largely unperturbed, however, is not the same as unperturbed, and
many studies have attempted to identify ""slow"" local structures by exploiting
dynamical information. Nonetheless, the question remains open: is the key to
the slow dynamics imprinted in purely structural information? And if so, is
there a way to determine the relevant structures without any dynamical
information? Here, we use a newly developed unsupervised machine learning (UML)
algorithm to identify structural heterogeneities in three archetypical glass
formers. In each system, the UML approach autonomously designs an order
parameter based purely on structural variation within a single snapshot.
Impressively, this order parameter strongly correlates with the dynamical
heterogeneity. Moreover, the structural characteristics linked to slow
particles disappear as we move away from the glass transition. Our results
demonstrate the power of machine learning techniques to detect structural
patterns even in disordered systems, and provide a new way forward for
unraveling the structural origins of the slow dynamics of glassy materials.

Among the employed measurements, photoluminescence imaging has several
advantages, namely being a non-destructive, fast and thus cost-effective
measurement. On a photoluminescence measurement image of an LED wafer, every
pixel corresponds to an LED chip's brightness after photo-excitation, revealing
chip performance information. However, generating a chip-fine defect map of the
LED wafer, based on photoluminescence images, proves challenging for multiple
reasons: on the one hand, the measured brightness values vary from image to
image, in addition to local spots of differing brightness. On the other hand,
certain defect structures may assume multiple shapes, sizes and brightness
gradients, where salient brightness values may correspond to defective LED
chips, measurement artefacts or non-defective structures. In this work, we
revisit the creation of chip-fine defect maps using fully convolutional

be improved by the incorporation of densely connected convolutional blocks and

material softness. In this paper, a novel hybrid actuator design is presented
with bio-inspirations from the lobster, or crustaceans in a broader
perspective. We enclose a soft chamber with rectangular cross-section using a
series of articulated rigid shells to produce bending under pneumatic input. By
mimicking the shell pattern of lobsters' abdomen, foldable rigid shells are
designed to provide the soft actuator with full protection throughout the
motion range. The articulation of the rigid shells predefines the actuator's
bending motions. As a result, the proposed design enables one to analyze this
hybrid actuator with simplified quasi-static models and rigid-body kinematics,
which are further validated by mechanical tests. This paper demonstrates that
the proposed hybrid actuator design is capable of bridging the major design
drawbacks of the entirely rigid and soft robots while preserving their
engineering merits in performance.

Lorentz force. We develop a kinetic theory to include the stochastic force due
to random motions of electrons into our model. To demonstrate the efficacy of
our method, we apply it to various charge distributions and compare our results
to N-body simulations. We show that our method reproduces the well-known
emittance term in the envelope equation of uniform spherical and cylindrical
charge distributions with correct coefficients. We use our model for the
gravitational collapse of an ideal gas as well as the cyclotron dynamics of a
cylindrical charge distribution in a uniform magnetic field and propose a
method to measure the emittance of electron beams.

  movement","27 pages; 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.CB math.DS q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cancer cells exhibit increased motility and proliferation, which are
instrumental in the formation of tumours and metastases. These pathological
changes can be traced back to malfunctions of cellular signalling pathways, and
calcium signalling plays a prominent role in these. We formulate a new model
for cancer cell movement which for the first time explicitly accounts for the
dependence of cell proliferation and cell-cell adhesion on calcium. At the
heart of our work is a non-linear, integro-differential (non-local) equation
for cancer cell movement, accounting for cell diffusion, advection and
proliferation. We also employ an established model of cellular calcium
signalling with a rich dynamical repertoire that includes experimentally
observed periodic wave trains and solitary pulses. The cancer cell density
exhibits travelling fronts and complex spatial patterns arising from an
adhesion-driven instability (ADI). We show how the different calcium signals
and variations in the strengths of cell-cell attraction and repulsion shape the
emergent cellular aggregation patterns, which are a key component of the
metastatic process. Performing a linear stability analysis, we identify
parameter regions corresponding to ADI. These regions are confirmed by
numerical simulations, which also reveal different types of aggregation
patterns and these patterns are significantly affected by \ca. Our study
demonstrates that the maximal cell density decreases with calcium
concentration, while the frequencies of the calcium oscillations and the cell
density oscillations are approximately equal in many cases. Furthermore, as the
calcium levels increase the speed of the travelling fronts increases, which is
related to a higher cancer invasion potential. These novel insights provide a
step forward in the design of new cancer treatments that may rely on
controlling the dynamics of cellular calcium.

as a dynamic process that human transits between states (\eg, locations) over
time. In the human world where intelligent agents like humans or vehicles with
human drivers play an important role, the states of agents mostly describe
human activities, and the state transition is influenced by both the human
decisions and physical constraints from the real-world system (\eg, agents need
to spend time to move over a certain distance). Therefore, the modeling of
state transition should include the modeling of the agent's decision process
and the physical system dynamics. In this paper, we propose \ours to model
state transition in human movement from a novel perspective, by learning the
decision model and integrating the system dynamics. \ours learns the human
movement with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning and integrates the
stochastic constraints from system dynamics in the learning process. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn to model the state transition
of moving agents with system dynamics. In extensive experiments on real-world

similar to real-world ones, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods in
predicting the next location and generating long-term future trajectories.

describe atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations. Assuming point spread
functions induced by the atmospheric turbulence with the same profile belong to
the same manifold space, we propose a non-parametric point spread function --
PSF-NET. The PSF-NET has a cycle convolutional neural network structure and is
a statistical representation of the manifold space of PSFs induced by the

simulated and real observation data, we find that a well trained PSF--NET can
restore any short exposure images blurred by atmospheric turbulence with the

which can be viewed as the statistical mean PSF, to analyze interpretation
properties of the PSF-NET. We find that variations of statistical mean PSFs are
caused by variations of the atmospheric turbulence profile: as the difference
of the atmospheric turbulence profile increases, the difference between
statistical mean PSFs also increases. The PSF-NET proposed in this paper
provides a new way to analyze atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations, which
would be benefit to develop new observation methods for ground based optical

of gravity which contains quadratic in Ricci scalar and Weyl tensor terms with
analytic infinite derivative form-factors in the action. It is known that the
inflationary solution of the local $R+R^2$ gravity remains a particular exact
solution in this model. It was shown earlier that the power spectrum of scalar
perturbations generated during inflation in the non-local setup remains the
same as in the local $R+R^2$ inflation, whereas the power spectrum of tensor
perturbations gets modified due to the non-local Weyl tensor squared term. In
the present paper we go beyond 2-point correlators and compute the non-Gaussian
parameter $f_{NL}$ related to 3-point correlations generated during inflation,
which we found to be different from those in the original local inflationary
model and scenarios alike based on a local gravity. We evaluate non-local
corrections to the scalar bi-spectrum which give non-zero contributions to
squeezed, equilateral and orthogonal configurations. We show that $f_{NL}\sim
O(1)$ with an arbitrary sign is achievable in this model based on the choice of
form-factors and the scale of non-locality. We present the predictions for the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and the tensor tilt, $n_t$. In contrast to
standard inflation in a local gravity, here the possibility $n_t$>0 is not
excluded. Thus, future CMB data can probe non-local behaviour of gravity at
high space-time curvatures.

combinatorial problems (DRBCP) with stochastic costs, where the probability
distribution of the cost vector is contained in a ball of distributions
centered at the empirical distribution specified by the Wasserstein distance.
We study two distinct versions of DRBCP from different applications: (i)
Motivated by the multi-hop wireless network application, we first study the
uncertainty quantification of DRBCP (denoted by DRBCP-U), where decision-makers
would like to have an accurate estimation of the worst-case value of DRBCP. The
difficulty of DRBCP-U is to handle its max-min-max form. Fortunately, the
alternative forms of the bottleneck combinatorial problems from their blockers
allow us to derive equivalent deterministic reformulations, which can be
computed via mixed-integer programs. In addition, by drawing the connection
between DRBCP-U and its sampling average approximation counterpart under
empirical distribution, we show that the Wasserstein radius can be chosen in
the order of negative square root of sample size, improving the existing known
results; and (ii) Next, motivated by the ride-sharing application,
decision-makers choose the best service-and-passenger matching that minimizes
the unfairness. This gives rise to the decision-making DRBCP (denoted by
DRBCP-D). For DRBCP-D, we show that its optimal solution is also optimal to its
sampling average approximation counterpart, and the Wasserstein radius can be
chosen in a similar order as DRBCP-U. When the sample size is small, we propose
to use the optimal value of DRBCP-D to construct an indifferent solution space
and propose an alternative decision-robust model, which finds the best
indifferent solution to minimize the empirical variance. We further show that
the decision robust model can be recast as a mixed-integer program.

aggregating features from its neighbors in the graph. This ignores potentially
useful contributions from distant nodes. Identifying such useful distant
contributions is challenging due to scalability issues (too many nodes can
potentially contribute) and oversmoothing (aggregating features from too many
nodes risks swamping out relevant information and may result in nodes having
different labels but indistinguishable features). We introduce a global
attention mechanism where a node can selectively attend to, and aggregate
features from, any other node in the graph. The attention coefficients depend
on the Euclidean distance between learnable node embeddings, and we show that
the resulting attention-based global aggregation scheme is analogous to
high-dimensional Gaussian filtering. This makes it possible to use efficient
approximate Gaussian filtering techniques to implement our attention-based
global aggregation scheme. By employing an approximate filtering method based
on the permutohedral lattice, the time complexity of our proposed global
aggregation scheme only grows linearly with the number of nodes. The resulting
GCNs, which we term permutohedral-GCNs, are differentiable and trained

low power consumption and low memory usage, and thus provides complementariness

frame-based camera that reflects the whole appearance as scenes are, the event
camera casts away the detailed characteristics of objects, such as texture and
color. To take advantages of both modalities, the event camera and frame-based
camera are combined together for various machine vision tasks. Then the
cross-modal matching between neuromorphic events and color images plays a vital
and essential role. In this paper, we propose the Event-Based Image Retrieval
(EBIR) problem to exploit the cross-modal matching task. Given an event stream
depicting a particular object as query, the aim is to retrieve color images

large modality gap between neuromorphic events and color images. We address the
EBIR problem by proposing neuromorphic Events-Color image Feature Learning
(ECFL). Particularly, the adversarial learning is employed to jointly model
neuromorphic events and color images into a common embedding space. We also
contribute to the community N-UKbench and EC180 dataset to promote the

were focused on close-range objects and only a very few of the deep
learning-based methods were specifically designed for large-scale 3D urban

paper, we present a synthetic aerial dataset, called the WHU dataset, we
created for MVS tasks, which, to our knowledge, is the first large-scale
multi-view aerial dataset. It was generated from a highly accurate 3D digital
surface model produced from thousands of real aerial images with precise camera
parameters. We also introduce in this paper a novel network, called RED-Net,
for wide-range depth inference, which we developed from a recurrent
encoder-decoder structure to regularize cost maps across depths and a 2D fully
convolutional network as framework. RED-Net's low memory requirements and high
performance make it suitable for large-scale and highly accurate 3D Earth
surface reconstruction. Our experiments confirmed that not only did our method
exceed the current state-of-the-art MVS methods by more than 50% mean absolute
error (MAE) with less memory and computational cost, but its efficiency as
well. It outperformed one of the best commercial software programs based on

graphs are discrete, combinatorial, and the underlying data distribution is
invariant to the ordering of nodes. However, most of the existing generative
models for graphs are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to
an undesirable bias in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we
propose a permutation invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent
framework of score-based generative modeling. In particular, we design a
permutation equivariant, multi-channel graph neural network to model the
gradient of the data distribution at the input graph (a.k.a., the score
function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients implicitly defines a
permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this graph neural
network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin dynamics.
In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture
in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our

of 35 and 10, corresponding to a reduction in allowed SME parameter space
volume for these studies of 15 and 16 orders of magnitude, respectively.
Constraints from individual lines of sight can be significantly stronger using
spectropolarimetry. Nevertheless, due to the increased number of observations

elements as well as that of IRS-served users. To tackle this challenge, we
propose in this paper two efficient channel estimation schemes for different
channel setups in an IRS-assisted multi-user broadband communication system
employing the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The first
channel estimation scheme, which estimates the CSI of all users in parallel
simultaneously at the access point (AP), is applicable for arbitrary
frequency-selective fading channels. In contrast, the second channel estimation
scheme, which exploits a key property that all users share the same (common)
IRS-AP channel to enhance the training efficiency and support more users, is
proposed for the typical scenario with line-of-sight (LoS) dominant user-IRS
channels. For the two proposed channel estimation schemes, we further optimize
their corresponding training designs (including pilot tone allocations for all
users and IRS time-varying reflection pattern) to minimize the channel
estimation error. Moreover, we derive and compare the fundamental limits on the
minimum training overhead and the maximum number of supportable users of these
two schemes. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
channel estimation schemes and training designs, and show their significant
performance improvement over various benchmark schemes.

model-free fashion where no additional information about the underlying
distribution is available. In many applications, however, practitioners have
access to the underlying independence graph of the variables, either as a
Bayesian network or a Markov Random Field (MRF). We ask: how can one use this

theoretical foundations to answer this question by studying subadditivity
properties of probability divergences, which establish upper bounds on the
distance between two high-dimensional distributions by the sum of distances
between their marginals over (local) neighborhoods of the graphical structure

trimaximal mixing and $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which can help us shape
the forms of the neutrino mass matrix) in the minimal seesaw model (which
contains much fewer parameters than the general seesaw model) with two
TeV-scale right-handed neutrinos (for realizing a low-scale seesaw) of nearly
degenerate masses (for realizing a resonant leptogenesis). However, either for
the trimaximal mixing scenario (which is realized through the Form Dominance
approach here) or for the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry scenario,
leptogenesis cannot proceed. To address this issue, we consider the possibility
that the special forms of the neutrino mass matrix for the trimaximal mixing
and $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry are slightly broken by the renormalization
group evolution effect, thus allowing leptogenesis to proceed. It is found that
in the normal case of the neutrino mass ordering, the baryon asymmetry thus
generated can reproduce the observed value. For completeness, we have also
extended our analysis to the scenario that two right-handed neutrinos are not
nearly degenerate any more. Unfortunately, in this scenario the final baryon
asymmetry is smaller than the observed value by several orders of magnitude.

caused mostly by many missing values has attracted the attention of
researchers, who have attempted to find a better use of all available samples
for determining the solution of a primary target task through the defining a
secondary imputation problem. Methodologically, existing methods, either
deterministic or stochastic, have applied different assumptions to impute
missing values. However, once the missing values are imputed, most existing
methods do not consider the fidelity or confidence of the imputed values in the
modeling of downstream tasks. Undoubtedly, an erroneous or improper imputation
of missing variables can cause difficulties in modeling as well as a degraded
performance. In this study, we present a novel variational recurrent network
that (i) estimates the distribution of missing variables allowing to represent
uncertainty in the imputed values, (ii) updates hidden states by explicitly
applying fidelity based on a variance of the imputed values during a recurrence
(i.e., uncertainty propagation over time), and (iii) predicts the possibility
of in-hospital mortality. It is noteworthy that our model can conduct these
procedures in a single stream and learn all network parameters jointly in an
end-to-end manner. We validated the effectiveness of our method using the

outperforming other state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction

have the same Shannon entropy. In [arXiv:0902.0174] Bowen showed that the
$f$-invariant is a variant of sofic entropy; in particular it is the
exponential growth rate of the expected number of good models over a uniform

only the massless graviton but also massive particles carrying the
gravitational force. We study the cosmology in a quadratic gravity with
dynamical torsion where gravity may be interpreted as a gauge force associated
with the Poincar\'{e} group. In addition to the massless spin-2 graviton, the
model contains four non-ghost massive particle species: a couple of spin-0, a
spin-1 and a spin-2. Supposing the restoration of the local Weyl invariance in
the UV limit and the parity invariance, we find the most general minisuperspace
action describing a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a flat spatial
geometry. We then transform the minisuperspace action to a quasi-Einstein frame
in which the field space is a hyperboloid and the field potential is a
combination of those of a Starobinsky-like inflation and a natural inflation.
Remarkably, thanks to the multi-field dynamics, the Starobinsky-like
inflationary trajectory can be realized even if the initial condition is away
from the top of the Starobinsky-like potential. We also study linear tensor
perturbations and find qualitatively different features than the Starobinsky
inflation, spontaneous parity violation and mixing of the massless and massive
spin-2 modes, which might reveal the underlying nature of gravity through
inflationary observables.

methods (e.g. VO, SLAM, SfM) and vision systems (e.g. CNN, visual place
recognition-VPR) are often separately used for mapping and localization tasks.
Conversely, recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods for visual
navigation rely on the quality of GPS data reception, which may not be reliable
when directly using it as ground truth across multiple, month-spaced traversals
in large environments. In this paper, we propose a novel motion and visual
perception approach, dubbed MVP, that unifies these two sensor modalities for
large-scale, target-driven navigation tasks. Our MVP-based method can learn
faster, and is more accurate and robust to both extreme environmental changes
and poor GPS data than corresponding vision-only navigation methods. MVP
temporally incorporates compact image representations, obtained using VPR, with
optimized motion estimation data, including but not limited to those from VO or
optimized radar odometry (RO), to efficiently learn self-supervised navigation
policies via RL. We evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets,
Oxford Robotcar and Nordland Railway, over a range of weather (e.g. overcast,
night, snow, sun, rain, clouds) and seasonal (e.g. winter, spring, fall,
summer) conditions using the new CityLearn framework; an interactive
environment for efficiently training navigation agents. Our experimental
results, on traversals of the Oxford RobotCar dataset with no GPS data, show
that MVP can achieve 53% and 93% navigation success rate using VO and RO,
respectively, compared to 7% for a vision-only method. We additionally report a
trade-off between the RL success rate and the motion estimation precision.

it to be a contact binary. The existence of other contact binaries in the
1-10km range raises the question of how common these bodies are and how they
evolved into contact. Here we consider that the lobes of MU69 formed as a
binary in the Solar nebula, and calculate its orbital evolution in the presence
of gas. We find that the sub-Keplerian wind of the disk brings the drag
timescales for 10km bodies under 1 Myr for quadratic-velocity drag. In the
Kuiper belt, however, the drag is linear with velocity and the effect of the
wind cancels out as the angular momentum gained in half an orbit is lost in the
other half: the drag timescales for 10 km bodies remain over 10 Myr. In this
situation we find that a combination of drag and Kozai-Lidov oscillations is a
promising channel for collapse. We analytically solve the hierarchical
three-body problem with drag and implement it into a Kozai plus tidal friction
model. The permanent quadrupoles of the lobes make the Kozai oscillations
stochastic, and as drag shrinks the semimajor axis it more easily allows the
fluctuations to bring the system into contact. Evolution to contact happens
very rapidly (within $10^4$ yr) in the pure, double-average quadrupole, Kozai
region between $\approx 85-95^\circ$, and within 3 Myr in the drag-assisted
region beyond it. The synergy between $J_2$ and gas drag widens the window of
contact to 80-100$^\circ$ initial inclination, over a larger range of semimajor
axes. As such, the model predicts an initial contact binary fraction of about
10\% for the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt. The speed at contact deviates
from the escape velocity only because of the oblateness. For MU69, the contact
velocity should be 3.3-4.2 m/s, in line with the observational evidence from
the lack of deformation features and estimate of the tensile strength.

which it applies the optimization passes. Choosing a good order--often referred
to as the phase-ordering problem, is an NP-hard problem. As a result, existing
solutions rely on a variety of heuristics. In this paper, we evaluate a new
technique to address the phase-ordering problem: deep reinforcement learning.
To this end, we implement AutoPhase: a framework that takes a program and uses
deep reinforcement learning to find a sequence of compilation passes that
minimizes its execution time. Without loss of generality, we construct this
framework in the context of the LLVM compiler toolchain and target high-level
synthesis programs. We use random forests to quantify the correlation between
the effectiveness of a given pass and the program's features. This helps us
reduce the search space by avoiding phase orderings that are unlikely to
improve the performance of a given program. We compare the performance of
AutoPhase to state-of-the-art algorithms that address the phase-ordering
problem. In our evaluation, we show that AutoPhase improves circuit performance
by 28% when compared to using the -O3 compiler flag, and achieves competitive
results compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, while requiring fewer
samples. Furthermore, unlike existing state-of-the-art solutions, our deep
reinforcement learning solution shows promising result in generalizing to real
benchmarks and 12,874 different randomly generated programs, after training on

Transportation Ecosystem, they are required to guarantee a particular level of
safety. For that to happen a safe vehicle control algorithms need to be
developed, which include assessing the probability of a collision while driving
along a given trajectory and selecting control signals that minimize this
probability. In this paper, we propose a speed control system that estimates a
collision probability taking into account static and dynamic obstacles as well
as ego-pose uncertainty and chooses the maximum safe speed. For that, the
planned trajectory is converted by the control system into control signals that
form input for the dynamic vehicle model. The model predicts a real vehicle
path. The predicted trajectory is generated for each particle -- a weighted by
a probability hypothesis of the localization system about the vehicle pose.
Based on the predicted particles' trajectories, the probability of collision is
calculated, and a decision is made on the maximum safe speed. The proposed
algorithm was validated on the real autonomous vehicle. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed speed control system reduces the vehicle
speed to a safe value when performing maneuvers and driving through narrow
openings. Therefore the observed behavior of the system is mimicking a human
driver behavior when driving in difficult and ambiguous traffic situations.

incredibly long, exceeding ten years in some cases. An explanation for such
slow rotation is lacking. This paper attempts to provide an explanation of the
super-slow rotation of the magnetic and thermal patterns of Ap stars in terms
of the longitudinal drift of the unstable disturbances of the kink-type
(Tayler) instability of their internal magnetic field. The rates of drift and
growth were computed for eigenmodes of Tayler instability using stellar
parameters estimated from a structure model of an A star. The computations
refer to the toroidal background magnetic field of varied strength. The
non-axisymmetric unstable disturbances drift in a counter-rotational direction
in the co-rotating reference frame. The drift rate increases with the strength
of the background field. For a field strength exceeding the (equipartition)
value of equal Alfven and rotational velocities, the drift rate approaches the
proper rotation rate of a star. The eigenmodes in an inertial frame show very
slow rotation in this case. Patterns of magnetic and thermal disturbances of
the slowly rotating eigenmodes are also computed. The counter-rotational drift
of Tayler instability eigenmodes is a possible explanation for the observed
phenomenon of super-slowly rotating Ap stars.

(InSAR) requires that interferometric images should have a common spectral band
and the same resolution after proper preprocessing. For a high-resolution (HR)
image and a low-resolution (LR) one, the interferogram quality is limited by
the LR one since the non-common band (NCB) between two images is usually
discarded. In this article, we try to establish an InSAR method to improve
interferogram quality by means of exploiting the NCB. To this end, we first
define a new interferogram, which has the same resolution as the HR image. Then
we formulate the interferometric relationship between the two images into a
compressive sensing (CS) model, which contains the proposed HR interferogram.
With the sparsity of interferogram in appropriate domains, we model the
interferogram formation as a typical sparse recovery problem. Due to the
speckle effect in coherent radar imaging, the sensing matrix of our CS model is
inherently random. We theoretically prove that the sensing matrix satisfies
restricted isometry property, and thus the interferogram recovery performance
is guaranteed. Furthermore, we provide a fast interferogram formation algorithm
by exploiting computationally efficient structures of the sensing matrix.
Numerical experiments show that the proposed method provides better
interferogram quality in the sense of reduced phase noise and obtain
extrapolated interferogram spectra with respect to CB processing.

core very close to the star center. The density discontinuity at the

star. The shock has enough energy to combust nuclear matter to 2-flavor quark
matter in the star. The 2-flavor quark matter is not stable and settles to a
stable 3-flavor matter in the weakly interacting timescale. In this paper, we
study the conversion of 2-flavor matter to 3-flavor matter. We set up a
differential equation to convert the excess of down quarks to strange quarks
involving weak reaction and diffusion of quarks. Calculating the reaction rate,
we solve the differential equation to find the velocity of the conversion
front. As the conversion front moves out, the density profile changes, bringing
about a change in the star's quadrupole moment and thereby emitting
gravitational waves. We find that the GW signal depends strongly on the star
temperature and mass. The GW amplitude of a colder star is well within present
detector capability, but the frequency is slightly on the higher side.
Relatively hotter stars are on the boundary of present detectors and easily
detectable with future detectors, and their frequency is also within the

facial information. However, these pre-trained features cause performance
degradation due to the texture discrepancy with the visual domain. With this
motivation, we propose a graph-structured module called Relational Graph Module
(RGM) that extracts global relational information in addition to general facial
features. Because each identity's relational information between intra-facial
parts is similar in any modality, the modeling relationship between features
can help cross-domain matching. Through the RGM, relation propagation
diminishes texture dependency without losing its advantages from the

from locally correlated convolutional features to identify long-range

delivery of customer service. This creates the need for a robust and accurate
automated solution to what is formally known as the ticket routing problem.
This task is to match each unresolved service incident, or ""ticket"", to the
right group of service experts. Existing studies divide the task into two
independent subproblems - initial group assignment and inter-group transfer.
However, our study addresses both subproblems jointly using an end-to-end
modeling approach. We first performed a preliminary analysis of half a million
archived tickets to uncover relevant features. Then, we devised the UFTR, a
Unified Framework for Ticket Routing using four types of features (derived from
tickets, groups, and their interactions). In our experiments, we implemented
two ranking models with the UFTR. Our models outperform baselines on three
routing metrics. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis reveals that this superior
performance can largely be attributed to the features that capture the
associations between ticket assignment and group assignment. In short, our
results demonstrate that the UFTR is a superior solution to the ticket routing
problem because it takes into account previously unexploited interrelationships
between the group assignment and group transfer problems.

form of future spacecraft propulsion for some time. In contrast to ion
thrusters, which utilize the Coulomb force to accelerate positively charged
species, electromagnetic propulsion systems utilize the Lorentz force to
accelerate all species in a quasi-neutral state, providing significant
technological benefits over ion thrusters. Several forms of electromagnetic
propulsion have been researched and developed, such as the Variable Specific
Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, pulsed inductive thrusters, and the electrodeless
plasma thruster. One of the most promising forms of electromagnetic propulsion,
however, has been the magnetoplasmadynamic thruster. Whereas other
electromagnetic propulsion systems provide high specific impulse values but low
thrust capabilities, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters have demonstrated the
potential for both high specific impulse values and high thrust densities.
However, these thrusters are not without drawbacks and suffer from issues such
as electrode erosion. A proposed subtype of these thrusters, known as the
Lithium Lorentz Force Accelerator, has been shown to address some of these
issues. As is demonstrated in this paper, mission duration is not notably
improved by the use of Lithium Lorentz Force Accelerators except for mission
distances beyond the capabilities of current propulsion technology. It is also
shown that increasing the amount of batteries onboard a spacecraft does not
necessarily decrease mission duration due to the specific power of current
battery technology, which is on the order of 10^3 W/kg, but that new
developments in nuclear energy technology may allow these thrusters to become
efficacious for missions for which current propulsion technology is
insufficient.

enables one to apply model-free, off-the-shelf reinforcement learning

abstraction. The proposed approach is based on abstracting the system with a
finite MDP (without constructing it explicitly) with unknown transition
probabilities, synthesizing strategies over the abstract MDP, and then mapping
the results back over the concrete continuous-space MDP with approximate
optimality guarantees. The properties of interest for the system belong to a
fragment of linear temporal logic, known as syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic (scLTL), and the synthesis requirement is to maximize the
probability of satisfaction within a given bounded time horizon. A key
contribution of the paper is to leverage the classical convergence results for
reinforcement learning on finite MDPs and provide control strategies maximizing
the probability of satisfaction over unknown, continuous-space MDPs while
providing probabilistic closeness guarantees. Automata-based reward functions

the utilization of the tethered UAV (tUAV) to assist the cellular network,
where the tether provides power supply and connects the tUAV to the core
network through high capacity link. The tUAV however has a limited mobility due
to the limited tether length. A stochastic geometry-based analysis is provided

mobile users located within a circular hot-spot. For that setup, we analyze and

oldest-known pulsars, the highly variable PSR B0950+08, with the
Amsterdam-ASTRON Radio Transient Facility And Analysis Centre (AARTFAAC), a
parallel transient detection instrument operating as a subsystem of the LOw
Frequency ARray (LOFAR). During processing of our Northern Hemisphere survey
for low-frequency radio transients, a sample of 275 pulses with fluences
ranging from 42 to 177 kJy ms were detected in one-second snapshot images. The
brightest pulses are an order of magnitude brighter than those previously
reported at 42 and 74 MHz, on par with the levels observed in a previous
long-term study at 103 MHz. Both their rate and fluence distribution differ
between and within the various studies done to date. The GP rate is highly
variable, from 0 to 30 per hour, with only two three-hour observations
accounting for nearly half of the pulses detected in the 96 h surveyed. It does
not vary significantly within a few-hour observation, but can vary strongly one
from day to the next. The spectra appear strongly and variably structured, with
emission sometimes confined to a single 195.3 kHz subband, and the pulse
spectra changing on a timescale of order 10 min.

modeling polarization by non-spherical dust grains aligned by magnetic fields.
We describe the major challenges involved in preparing the code for these and
other extensions, as well as their resolution, including a completely new

$b$ with $1\leq a<b\leq n$, there is a Hamilton path in $G_n$ from $a$ to $b$

Hamiltonicity property of the prime difference graph in a sense that for any

that the prime difference graph contains considerably more about the cycle
structure than Hamiltonicity; precisely, for any integer $n\geq 7$, the prime
difference graph $G_n$ contains any 2-factor of the complete graph of order $n$

photovoltaic (PV) electricity in many countries, along with the recent strong

battery systems worldwide. The load profile of a property greatly affects the
self-consumption rate and, thus, the profitability of the system. Therefore,
insights from analyses of residential applications, which are well studied,
cannot simply be transferred to other types of properties. In comparison to
residential applications, PV is especially suitable for municipal buildings,
due to their better match of demand and supply. In order to analyze the value
of additional batteries, municipal PV battery systems of different sizes were
simulated, taking load profiles of 101 properties as inputs. It was found that
self-consumption differs significantly from households, while different types
of municipal buildings are largely similar in terms of the indicators analyzed.
The share of electricity consumed during summertime was found to have the most
significant impact on the self-consumption rate for most considered system
sizes. Due to lower electricity tariffs and lower increases in self-consumption
provided through batteries in municipal buildings, the investment into a
battery is not economically advantageous in most of the cases considered.

This paper explores a new approach to learning depth perception requiring
neither of those. Specifically, we train a specialized global-local network
architecture with what would be available to a robot interacting with the
environment: from extremely sparse depth measurements down to even a single
pixel per image. From a pair of consecutive images, our proposed network
outputs a latent representation of the observer's motion between the images and
a dense depth map. Experiments on several datasets show that, when ground truth
is available even for just one of the image pixels, the proposed network can
learn monocular dense depth estimation up to 22.5% more accurately than
state-of-the-art approaches. We believe that this work, despite its scientific
interest, lays the foundations to learn depth from extremely sparse
supervision, which can be valuable to all robotic systems acting under severe

takes into account the viscoelastic behavior of the material and the inelastic

used to fit experimental data obtained from tensile tests on two kind of metal

relaxes dependency on the number of surrounding vehicles by developing an

discrete Bayesian nonparametric model, integrating Dirichlet processes and

into interpretable granular patterns automatically. We then evaluate our
approach in the highway lane-change scenarios using the highD dataset collected

Monocular depth estimation, camera ego-motion estimation and optical flow
estimation in consecutive frames are high-profile concerns recently. By
analyzing tasks above, pixels in the middle frame are modeled into three parts:
the rigid region, the non-rigid region, and the occluded region. In joint
unsupervised training of depth and pose, we can segment the occluded region
explicitly. The occlusion information is used in unsupervised learning of
depth, pose and optical flow, as the image reconstructed by depth-pose and
optical flow will be invalid in occluded regions. A less-than-mean mask is
designed to further exclude the mismatched pixels interfered with by motion or
illumination change in the training of depth and pose networks. This method is
also used to exclude some trivial mismatched pixels in the training of the
optical flow network. Maximum normalization is proposed for depth smoothness
term to restrain depth degradation in textureless regions. In the occluded
region, as depth and camera motion can provide more reliable motion estimation,
they can be used to instruct unsupervised learning of optical flow. Our
experiments in KITTI dataset demonstrate that the model based on three regions,
full and explicit segmentation of the occlusion region, the rigid region, and
the non-rigid region with corresponding unsupervised losses can improve
performance on three tasks significantly. The source code is available at:

myocardial tissue in response to chronic alterations in loading conditions. One
such condition is pressure overload where elevated wall stresses stimulate the

hypertrophy at the organ scale, and promote fibrosis. The initial hypertrophic
response can be considered adaptive and beneficial by favoring myocyte
survival, but over time if pressure overload conditions persist, maladaptive
mechanisms favoring cell death and fibrosis start to dominate, ultimately
mediating the transition towards an overt heart failure phenotype. The
underlying mechanisms linking biological factors at the myocyte level to
biomechanical factors at the systemic and organ level remain poorly understood.
Computational models of G&R show high promise as a unique framework for
providing a quantitative link between myocardial stresses and strains at the

govern the hypertrophic response. However, microstructurally motivated,

strengthen the connection with dynamical systems and we improve the existing

period-specific width lower bounds that hold under the stronger notion of

second contribution is that we provide sharper width lower bounds, still
yielding meaningful exponential depth-width separations, in regimes where
previous results wouldn't apply. A byproduct of our results is that there
exists a universal constant characterizing the depth-width trade-offs, as long

period, its Lipschitz constant and the growth rate of the number of
oscillations arising under compositions of the function $f$ with itself.

investigated recently. Particularly, gait-related event-related brain
potentials (gERPs) may provide information about the functional role of
cortical brain regions in human gait control. The purpose of this paper is to
explore possible experimental and technical solutions for time-sensitive
analysis of human gait-related ERPs during spontaneous and instructed treadmill
walking. A solution (HW/SW) for synchronous recording of gait- and EEG data was
developed, tested and piloted. The solution consists of a custom-made USB
synchronization interface, a time-synchronization module and a data merging
module, allowing temporal synchronization of recording devices for
time-sensitive extraction of gait markers for analysis of gait-related ERPs and
for the training of artificial neural networks. In the present manuscript, the
hardware and software components were tested with the following devices: A
treadmill with an integrated pressure plate for gait analysis (zebris FDM-T)
and an Acticap non-wireless 32-channel EEG-system (Brain Products GmbH). The
usability and validity of the developed solution was tested in a pilot study (n
= 3 healthy participants, n=3 females, mean age = 22.75 years). Recorded EEG
data was segmented and analyzed according to the detected gait markers for the
analysis of gait-related ERPs. Finally, EEG periods were used to train a deep
learning artificial neural network as classifier of gait phases. The results
obtained in this pilot study, although preliminary, support the feasibility of
the solution for the application of gait-related EEG analysis..

Research 2, 043147 (2020)","10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043147",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurements in quantum theory exhibit incompatibility, i.e., they can fail
to be jointly measurable. An intuitive way to represent the (in)compatibility
relations among a set of measurements is via a hypergraph representing their
joint measurability structure: its vertices represent measurements and its
hyperedges represent (all and only) subsets of compatible measurements.
Projective measurements in quantum theory realize (all and only) joint
measurability structures that are graphs. On the other hand, general
measurements represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) can
realize arbitrary joint measurability structures. Here we explore the scope of
joint measurability structures realizable with qubit POVMs. We develop a
technique that we term marginal surgery to obtain nontrivial joint
measurability structures starting from a set of compatible measurements. We
show explicit examples of marginal surgery on a special set of qubit POVMs to
construct joint measurability structures such as $N$-cycle and $N$-Specker
scenarios for any integer $N\geq 3$. We also show the realizability of various
joint measurability structures with $N\in\{4,5,6\}$ vertices. In particular, we
show that all possible joint measurability structures with $N=4$ vertices are
realizable. We conjecture that all joint measurability structures are
realizable with qubit POVMs. This contrasts with the unbounded dimension
required in R. Kunjwal et al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 052126 (2014). Our results also
render this previous construction maximally efficient in terms of the required
Hilbert space dimension. We also obtain a sufficient condition for the joint
measurability of any set of binary qubit POVMs which powers many of our results
and should be of independent interest.

Numerical results indicate that in sub-relativistic, rarefied jets, the jet
plasma crossing the terminal shock forms a hot, two-temperature plasma in which
the ion temperature is higher than the electron temperature. The
two-temperature plasma expands and forms a backflow referred to as a cocoon, in
which the ion temperature remains higher than the electron temperature for
longer than 100 Myr. Electrons in the cocoon are continuously heated by ions
through Coulomb collisions, and the electron temperature thus remains at Te >
10^9 K in the cocoon. X-ray emissions from the cocoon are weak because the
electron number density is low. Meanwhile, soft X-rays are emitted from the
shocked intracluster medium surrounding the cocoon. Mixing of the jet plasma
and the shocked intracluster medium through the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability
at the interface enhances X-ray emissions around the contact discontinuity

required to have a transaction processed. As Bitcoin matures, the influx of
transactions increases and the block rewards become insignificant. We show that

miners would find it challenging to cover their mining costs as there would be
no more revenue from merely mining a block. It may cause miners not to continue
mining, threatening the blockchain's security. Further, as we show in this
paper using simulations, the cost of acting in favor of the health of the
blockchain, under MOC, is very high in Bitcoin, causing all miners to process
transactions greedily. It leads to stranded transactions, i.e., transactions
offering low transaction fees, experiencing unreasonably high processing
latency. To make matters worse, a compounding effect of these stranded
transactions is the rising price of consumption. Such phenomena not only induce
unfairness as experienced by the miners and the users but also deteriorate the
health of the blockchain.

effective modification to the existing Bitcoin protocol to fix these issues of
unfairness. BitcoinF resolves these issues of unfairness while preserving the

defined over a multi-agent network. Each agent possesses a time-varying local
objective function, and all agents aim to collaboratively track the drifting
global optimal solution that minimizes the summation of all local objective
functions. The decentralized dynamic optimization problem can be solved by
primal or primal-dual methods, and when the problem degenerates to be static,
it has been proved in literature that primal-dual methods are superior to
primal ones. This motivates us to ask: are primal-dual methods necessarily
better than primal ones in decentralized dynamic optimization?
  To answer this question, we investigate and compare convergence properties of
the primal method, diffusion, and the primal-dual approach, decentralized
gradient tracking (DGT). Theoretical analysis reveals that diffusion can
outperform DGT in certain dynamic settings. We find that DGT and diffusion are
significantly affected by the drifts and the magnitudes of optimal gradients,
respectively. In addition, we show that DGT is more sensitive to the network
topology, and a badly-connected network can greatly deteriorate its convergence
performance. These conclusions provide guidelines on how to choose proper
dynamic algorithms in various application scenarios. Numerical experiments are
constructed to validate the theoretical analysis.

in recent years. To date, the bulk of research activity has focused mainly on
static graphs. However, most real-world networks are dynamic since their
topology tends to change over time. Predicting the evolution of dynamic graphs
is a task of high significance in the area of graph mining. Despite its
practical importance, the task has not been explored in depth so far, mainly
due to its challenging nature. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts
the evolution of dynamic graphs. Specifically, we use a graph neural network
along with a recurrent architecture to capture the temporal evolution patterns
of dynamic graphs. Then, we employ a generative model which predicts the
topology of the graph at the next time step and constructs a graph instance
that corresponds to that topology. We evaluate the proposed model on several
artificial datasets following common network evolving dynamics, as well as on
real-world datasets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

to unfixed genus of Schaeffer's closing construction for planar Eulerian maps.
The inverse mapping relies on the existence of canonical orientations which
allow to equip the maps with canonical spanning trees, as proved by Bernardi.
Our bijection gives in particular (here in the Eulerian case) a combinatorial
explanation to the striking similarity between the (infinite) recursive system
of equations which determines the partition function of maps with unfixed genus
(as obtained via matrix models and orthogonal polynomials) and that determining
the partition function of planar maps. All the functions in the recursive
system get a combinatorial interpretation as generating functions for maps
endowed with particular multiple markings of their edges. This allows us in
particular to give a combinatorial proof of some differential identities
satisfied by these functions. We also consider face-colored Eulerian maps with
unfixed genus and derive some striking identities between their generating
functions and those of properly weighted marked maps. The same methodology is

However, point clouds obtained from LiDAR are fundamentally different. Most
detectors use shared filter kernels to extract features which do not take into
account the range dependent nature of the point cloud features. To show this,
different detectors are trained on two splits of the KITTI dataset: close range
(objects up to 25 meters from LiDAR) and long-range. Top view images are
generated from point clouds as input for the networks. Combined results
outperform the baseline network trained on the full dataset with a single

the network focuses on the shape and structure of the objects, rather than

spatial content, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. In this work,
we address the task of single frame super resolution with the presence of image
degradation, e.g., blur, haze, or rain streaks. Due to the limitations of frame
capturing and formation processes, image degradation is inevitable, and the
artifacts would be exacerbated by super resolution methods. To address this
problem, we propose a dual-branch convolutional neural network to extract base
features and recovered features separately. The base features contain local and
global information of the input image. On the other hand, the recovered
features focus on the degraded regions and are used to remove the degradation.
Those features are then fused through a recursive gate module to obtain sharp
features for super resolution. By decomposing the feature extraction step into
two task-independent streams, the dual-branch model can facilitate the training
process by avoiding learning the mixed degradation all-in-one and thus enhance
the final high-resolution prediction results. We evaluate the proposed method
in three degradation scenarios. Experiments on these scenarios demonstrate that
the proposed method performs more efficiently and favorably against the
state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets.

clinical decisions. However, when decision support tools are poorly implemented
they may actually confuse physicians and complicate clinical care. This paper
argues that information from decision support tools is often removed from the
clinical context of the targeted decisions. Physicians largely depend on
clinical context to handle the complexity of their day-to-day decisions.
Clinical context enables them to take into account all ambiguous information
and patient preferences. Decision support tools that provide analytic
information to physicians, without its context, may then complicate the
decision process of physicians. It is likely that the joint forces of
physicians and technology will produce better decisions than either of them
exclusively: after all, they do have different ways of dealing with the
complexity of a decision and are thus complementary. Therefore, the future
challenges of decision support do not only reside in the optimization of the
predictive value of the underlying models and algorithms, but equally in the
effective communication of information and its context to doctors.

termed DFT+$U$+$J$, in combination with parameters calculated using a recently
proposed linear-response theory, predicts fundamental band-gaps accurate to
well within the experimental uncertainty in rutile and anatase TiO$_2$. Our
approach builds upon established findings that Hubbard correction to both
titanium $3d$ and oxygen $2p$ subspaces in TiO$_2$, symbolically giving
DFT+$U^{d,p}$, is necessary to achieve acceptable band-gaps using DFT+$U$. This
requirement remains when the first-principles Hund's $J$ is included. We also
find that the calculated gap depends on the correlated subspace definition even
when using subspace-specific first-principles $U$ and $J$ parameters. Using the
simplest reasonable correlated subspace definition and underlying functional,
the local density approximation, we show that high accuracy results from using
a relatively uncomplicated form of the DFT+$U$+$J$ functional. For closed-shell
systems such as TiO$_2$, we describe how various DFT+$U$+$J$ functionals reduce
to DFT+$U$ with suitably modified parameters, so that reliable band gaps can be

effective radiation mechanisms in astrophysics. It not only accompanies the
process of particle acceleration but also has feedback on the formation of the
energy distribution of the parent electrons. The radiative cooling time of
electrons decreases with energy as $t_{\rm syn} \propto 1/E$; correspondingly
the overall radiation efficiency increases with energy. On the other hand, this
effect strictly limits the maximum energy of individual photons. Even in the
so-called extreme accelerators, where the acceleration proceeds at the highest
possible rate, $t_{\rm acc}^{-1} = eBc/E$, allowed in an ideal
magnetohydrodynamic plasma, the synchrotron radiation cannot extend well beyond
the characteristic energy determined by the electron mass and the
fine-structure constant: $h \nu^{\rm max} \sim m_e c^2/\alpha \sim 70
\rm\,MeV$.
  In this paper, we propose a model in which the formation of synchrotron
radiation takes place in compact magnetic blobs located inside the particle
accelerator and develop a formalism for calculations of synchrotron radiation
emerging from such systems. We demonstrate that for certain combinations of
parameters characterizing the accelerator and the magnetic blobs, the
synchrotron radiation can extend beyond this limit by a several orders of
magnitude. This scenario requires a weak magnetization of the particle
accelerator, and an efficient conversion of gas internal energy into magnetic
energy in sufficiently small blobs. The required size of the blobs is
constrained by the magnetic mirroring effect, that can prevent particle
penetration into the regions of strong magnetic field under certain conditions.

results are false. A high rate of false positives might arise accidentally,

institutional incentives that reward publication irrespective of veracity.
Recent models and discussion of scientific culture predict selection for
false-positive publications, as research labs that publish more positive
findings out-compete more diligent labs. There is widespread debate about how
scientific practices should be modified to avoid this degeneration. Some
analyses suggest that ""bad science"" will persist even when labs are
incentivized to undertake replication studies, and penalized for publications
that later fail to replicate. Here we develop a framework for modelling the
cultural evolution of research practices that allows labs to expend effort on
theory - enabling them, at a cost, to focus on hypotheses that are more likely
to be true on theoretical grounds. Theory restores the evolution of high effort
in laboratory practice, and it suppresses false-positive publications to a
technical minimum, even in the absence of replication. In fact, the mere
ability choose between two sets of hypotheses - one with greater chance of
being correct than the other - promotes better science than can be achieved by
having effortless access to the better set of hypotheses. Combining theory and
replication can have a synergistic effect in promoting good scientific
methodology and reducing the rate of false-positive publications. Based on our
analysis we propose four simple rules to promote good science in the face of

with a new dimension for manipulating light, which is potentially useful for
information communication and data storage. Especially, the quantum spin Hall
effect of light, where electromagnetic waves propagate along surfaces of
samples with strong spin-momentum locking, paves the way for achieving
topologically protected photonic spin transport. Recently, the conventional
bulk-edge correspondence of the band topology has been extended to higher-order
cases that enables the explorations of topological states with codimensions
larger than 1 such as hinge and corner states. Here, for the first time, we
demonstrate a higherorder quantum spin Hall effect of light by utilizing an
all-dielectric C6v-symmetric photonic crystal. We observe corner states with
opposite pseudospin polarizations at different corners owing to nontrivial
higher-order topology and finite spin-spin coupling. By applying the
spin-polarized excitation sources, we can selectively excite the corner states
at different spatial positions through spin-momentum-locked decaying edge
states, resembling the quantum spin Hall effect in a higher-order manner. Our
work which breaks the barriers between the spin photonics and higher-order
topology opens the frontiers for studying lower-dimensional spinful classical
surface waves and supports explorations in robust communications.

the AMA's functional ability and versatility which in turn causes moral
outcomes that a limited number of people agree with (thereby undermining an
AMA's ability to be moral in a human sense). As solution we design a
three-layer model for general normative ethical theories that can be used to
serialise the ethical views of people and businesses for an AMA to use during

application in clusterbased large-scale learning, federated learning, edge

assume no failure or attack. However, many unexpected cases, such as
communication failure and even malicious attack, may happen in real
applications. Hence, Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed
learning with failure or attack, has recently attracted much attention. Most
existing BL methods are synchronous, which are impractical in some applications
due to heterogeneous or offline workers. In these cases, asynchronous BL (ABL)
is usually preferred. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called buffered
asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (BASGD), for ABL. To the best of our
knowledge, BASGD is the first ABL method that can resist non-omniscient attacks
without storing any instances on server. Furthermore, we also propose an
improved variant of BASGD, called BASGD with momentum (BASGDm), by introducing
momentum into BASGD. BASGDm can resist both non-omniscient and omniscient
attacks. Compared with those methods which need to store instances on server,
BASGD and BASGDm have a wider scope of application. Both BASGD and BASGDm are
compatible with various aggregation rules. Moreover, both BASGD and BASGDm are
proved to be convergent and be able to resist failure or attack. Empirical
results show that our methods significantly outperform existing ABL baselines
when there exists failure or attack on workers.

of the 1960s and the growing role of relativistic astrophysics, Ludwig Biermann
and his collaborators at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich
became deeply involved in research related to such new horizons. At the end of
the 1960s, Joseph Weber's announcements claiming detection of gravitational
waves sparked the decisive entry of this group into the field, in parallel with
the appointment of the renowned relativist Juergen Ehlers. The Munich area
group of Max Planck institutes provided the fertile ground for acquiring a
leading position in the 1970s, facilitating the experimental transition from
resonant bars towards laser interferometry and its innovation at increasingly
large scales, eventually moving to a dedicated site in Hannover in the early
1990s. The Hannover group emphasized perfecting experimental systems at pilot
scales, and never developed a full-sized detector, rather joining the LIGO
Scientific Collaboration at the end of the century. In parallel, the Max Planck
Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) had been
founded in Potsdam, and both sites, in Hannover and Potsdam, became a unified
entity in the early 2000s and were central contributors to the first detection
of gravitational waves in 2015.

path homology in arbitrary dimension and applied it to several classes of

structured and unstructured control flow. We also compared path homology and
cyclomatic complexity on a set of disassembled binaries obtained from the grep
utility. There exist control flow graphs realizable at the assembly level with
nontrivial path homology in arbitrary dimension. We exhibit several classes of
examples in this vein while also experimentally demonstrating that path
homology gives identicial results to cyclomatic complexity for at least one
detailed notion of structured control flow. We also experimentally demonstrate
that the two notions differ on disassembled binaries, and we highlight an
example of extreme disagreement. Path homology empirically generalizes
cyclomatic complexity for an elementary notion of structured code and appears
to identify more structurally relevant features of control flow in general.
Path homology therefore has the potential to substantially improve upon

stability theory, the sufficient conditions (on the synaptic strengths and
magnetic gain parameters) for the chaotic synchronization of the improved model
are obtained. Based on Helmholtz's theorem, the Hamilton function of the
corresponding error dynamical system is also obtained. It is shown that the
time variation of this Hamilton function along trajectories can play the role
of the time variation of the Lyapunov function - in determining the asymptotic
stability of the synchronization manifold. Numerical computations indicate that
as the synaptic strengths and the magnetic gain parameters change, the time
variation of the Hamilton function is always non-zero (i.e., a relatively large
positive or negative value) only when the time variation of the Lyapunov
function is positive, and zero (or vanishingly small) only when the time
variation of the Lyapunov function is also zero. This clearly therefore paves
an alternative way to determine the asymptotic stability of synchronization
manifolds, and can be particularly useful for systems whose Lyapunov function

  Hand Gestures and a Real-Time Recognition Framework","Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and
  Gesture Recognition (FG 2020)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of hand gestures provides a natural alternative to cumbersome
interface devices for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems. However,
real-time recognition of dynamic micro hand gestures from video streams is
challenging for in-vehicle scenarios since (i) the gestures should be performed
naturally without distracting the driver, (ii) micro hand gestures occur within
very short time intervals at spatially constrained areas, (iii) the performed
gesture should be recognized only once, and (iv) the entire architecture should
be designed lightweight as it will be deployed to an embedded system. In this
work, we propose an HCI system for dynamic recognition of driver micro hand
gestures, which can have a crucial impact in automotive sector especially for
safety related issues. For this purpose, we initially collected a dataset named
Driver Micro Hand Gestures (DriverMHG), which consists of RGB, depth and
infrared modalities. The challenges for dynamic recognition of micro hand
gestures have been addressed by proposing a lightweight convolutional neural
network (CNN) based architecture which operates online efficiently with a
sliding window approach. For the CNN model, several 3-dimensional resource
efficient networks are applied and their performances are analyzed. Online
recognition of gestures has been performed with 3D-MobileNetV2, which provided
the best offline accuracy among the applied networks with similar computational
complexities. The final architecture is deployed on a driver simulator
operating in real-time. We make DriverMHG dataset and our source code publicly
available.

distribution over their weights instead of a single set, having significant
advantages in terms of, e.g., interpretability, multi-task learning, and
calibration. Because of the intractability of the resulting optimization
problem, most BNNs are either sampled through Monte Carlo methods, or trained
by minimizing a suitable Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) on a variational
approximation. In this paper, we propose a variant of the latter, wherein we
replace the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the ELBO term with a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) estimator, inspired by recent work in variational inference.
After motivating our proposal based on the properties of the MMD term, we
proceed to show a number of empirical advantages of the proposed formulation
over the state-of-the-art. In particular, our BNNs achieve higher accuracy on
multiple benchmarks, including several image classification tasks. In addition,
they are more robust to the selection of a prior over the weights, and they are
better calibrated. As a second contribution, we provide a new formulation for
estimating the uncertainty on a given prediction, showing it performs in a more
robust fashion against adversarial attacks and the injection of noise over
their inputs, compared to more classical criteria such as the differential
entropy.

efficient extraction of a schema from frames of streaming video. As such, a
stream of objects and their associated classes along with unique object
identifiers derived via object tracking can be generated, providing unique
objects as they are captured across frames. In this paper we initiate a study
of temporal queries involving objects and their co-occurrences in video feeds.
For example, queries that identify video segments during which the same two red
cars and the same two humans appear jointly for five minutes are of interest to
many applications ranging from law enforcement to security and safety. We take
the first step and define such queries in a way that they incorporate certain
physical aspects of video capture such as object occlusion. We present an
architecture consisting of three layers, namely object detection/tracking,
intermediate data generation and query evaluation. We propose two
techniques,MFS and SSG, to organize all detected objects in the intermediate
data generation layer, which effectively, given the queries, minimizes the
number of objects and frames that have to be considered during query
evaluation. We also introduce an algorithm called State Traversal (ST) that
processes incoming frames against the SSG and efficiently prunes objects and
frames unrelated to query evaluation, while maintaining all states required for
succinct query evaluation. We present the results of a thorough experimental
evaluation utilizing both real and synthetic data establishing the trade-offs
between MFS and SSG. We stress various parameters of interest in our evaluation
and demonstrate that the proposed query evaluation methodology coupled with the
proposed algorithms is capable to evaluate temporal queries over video feeds
efficiently, achieving orders of magnitude performance benefits.

potentially act as an important limiting mechanism for the luminosity
production of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its future High-Luminosity
upgrade (HL-LHC). In the presence of non-linearities, depending on the spectral
components of the power supply noise and the nature of the source, such a
mechanism can increase the diffusion of the particles in the distribution
through the excitation of sideband resonances in the vicinity of the ones
driven by the lattice non-linearities. For the HL-LHC, due to the reduction of
the beam size in the Interaction Points (IP) of the high luminosity experiments
(IP1 and 5), increased sensitivity to noise effects is anticipated for the
quadrupoles of the inner triplets. The modulation that may arise from the power
supply ripples will be combined with the tune modulation that intrinsically
emerges from the coupling of the transverse and longitudinal plane for
off-momentum particles through chromaticity. To this end, the aim of this paper
is to study the impact of tune modulation effects on the transverse beam motion
resulting from the interplay between quadrupolar power supply ripples and
synchro-betatron coupling. A power supply noise threshold for acceptable
performance is estimated with single-particle tracking simulations by
investigating the impact of different modulation frequencies and amplitudes on
the Dynamic Aperture. The excitation of sideband resonances due to the
modulation is demonstrated with frequency maps and the higher sensitivity to
specific modulation frequencies is explained. Finally, a power supply noise
spectrum consisting of several tones is considered in the simulations to
determine whether the presence of power supply ripples in the quadrupoles of
the inner triplet will limit the luminosity production in the HL-LHC era.

content, continued availability of these videos in other online spaces makes it
unclear whether this compromise actually reduces their spread. To assess this
impact, we apply interrupted time series models to measure whether different
types of YouTube sharing in Twitter and Reddit changed significantly in the
eight months around YouTube's announcement. We evaluate video sharing across
three curated sets of potentially harmful, anti-social content: a set of
conspiracy videos that have been shown to experience reduced recommendations in
YouTube, a larger set of videos posted by conspiracy-oriented channels, and a
set of videos posted by alternative influence network (AIN) channels. As a
control, we also evaluate effects on video sharing in a dataset of videos from
mainstream news channels. Results show conspiracy-labeled and AIN videos that
have evidence of YouTube's de-recommendation experience a significant
decreasing trend in sharing on both Twitter and Reddit. For videos from
conspiracy-oriented channels, however, we see no significant effect in Twitter
but find a significant increase in the level of conspiracy-channel sharing in
Reddit. For mainstream news sharing, we actually see an increase in trend on
both platforms, suggesting YouTube's suppressing particular content types has a
targeted effect. This work finds evidence that reducing exposure to anti-social
videos within YouTube, without deletion, has potential pro-social,
cross-platform effects. At the same time, increases in the level of
conspiracy-channel sharing raise concerns about content producers' responses to
these changes, and platform transparency is needed to evaluate these effects
further.

main-sequence masses in the range of 35--50~$M_\odot$ had mostly been
representing the failed supernova explosion branch. In contrast, it has been
demonstrated recently that the appearance of exotic phases of hot and dense
matter, associated with a sufficiently strong phase transition from nuclear
matter to the quark-gluon plasma at high baryon density, can trigger supernova
explosions of such massive supergiant. Here, we present the first results
obtained from an extensive nucleosynthesis analysis for material being ejected
from the surface of the newly born proto-neutron star of such supernova
explosions. These ejecta contain an early neutron-rich component and a
late-time high-entropy neutrino-driven wind. The nucleosynthesis robustly
overcomes the production of nuclei associated with the second $r$-process peak,
at nuclear mass number $A\simeq 130$, and proceeds beyond the formation of the
third peak ($A\simeq 195$) to the actinides. These yields may account for
metal-poor star observations concerning $r$-process elements such as strontium
and europium in the Galaxy at low metalicity, while the actinide yields
suggests that this source may be a candidate contributing to the abundances of
radioactive $^{244}$Pu measured in deep-sea sediments on Earth.

of the sources of randomness, namely the explicit randomness induced by the
noise distribution and the implicit randomness induced by the data-generation

with quantifiable risks. Thus, we propose privacy at risk that is a
probabilistic calibration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. We provide a
composition theorem that leverages privacy at risk. We instantiate the
probabilistic calibration for the Laplace mechanism by providing analytical
results. We also propose a cost model that bridges the gap between the privacy
level and the compensation budget estimated by a GDPR compliant business

of privacy level that minimises the compensation budget. We show its
effectiveness by illustrating a realistic scenario that avoids overestimation

We quantitatively show that composition using the cost optimal privacy at risk

not sufficient to simultaneously inform all of the parameters. Consequently,
the governing model typically contains parameters which are uncertain but must

learning, a new approach was recently proposed by Duetting et al. (2019) in
which the auction is modeled by a feed-forward neural network and the design
problem is framed as a learning problem. The neural architectures used in that

consider auction design problems that have permutation-equivariant symmetry and
construct a neural architecture that is capable of perfectly recovering the
permutation-equivariant optimal mechanism, which we show is not possible with
the previous architecture. We demonstrate that permutation-equivariant

The ideas to overcome the first type of the 'sign problem' of strongly

to select Lefschetz thimbles as the cycle approaching the critical point at the

constant. Since the imaginary part of the action is constant on each thimble,
the sign problem disappears and the integral can be calculated much more

establish the semi-closed form solution of the joint optimal BF design that

greater than for radio quiet quasars. We interpret these results in a context
in which the fraction of radio loud quasar formation is less than or equal to
that for radio quiet quasars for all environments and redshift. Because we
assume that post-merger cold gas onto large black holes produces either a radio
loud or a radio quiet quasar, we show that for largest black hole masses that
live in largest dark matter halos, fRLQ approaches 0.5 from below but does not
exceed it, such that in rich clusters the formation of a radio loud quasar
tends to be equally likely to occur as a radio quiet quasar. In dark matter
halos with smaller mass, by contrast, radio quiet quasars are more likely to
form and the likelihood increases inversely with dark matter halo mass. As a
result, averaging over a population of radio loud and radio quiet quasars will
necessarily generate lower average black hole masses for the radio quiet
subgroup. Hence, despite the fact that the formation of radio quiet quasars is
preferred over radio loud quasars in any environment, at any mass scale, at any
luminosity, or redshift, averaging over a range of radio loud quasars will give
the appearance they are preferred in cluster environments over radio quiet
quasars. We show how this also accounts for the order of magnitude difference

entanglement for different conditions. It is found that the entanglement
behaviors are dependent on vacuum fluctuation, spacetime topology, two-atom
separation and atomic polarization orientation. After a long time of evolution,
entanglement would vanish, which means entanglement affected by electromagnetic
fluctuation can not maintain for a long time. For different spacetime
topologies, entanglement presents different behaviors dependent on various
parameters. When deficit angle parameter $\nu=1$ and atom-string distance is
towards infinity, the results in flat spacetime are recovered. When atoms keep
close to the string, entanglement can be improved; specially, when two atoms
locate on the string and have no polarization of axial direction, atoms are not
affected by the electromagnetic fluctuation and entanglement can remain
unchanged. When two-atom separation is relatively large, entanglement exhibits
oscillation behavior as atom-string distance varies. This indicates that the
existence of string profoundly modifies on the vacuum fluctuation and
atom-field interaction. In addition, when two-atom separation is small,
entanglement gains better improvement. Many parameters and conditions provide
us with greater freedom to control the entanglement behaviors. In principle,

aerial vehicles (UAVs) is studied. In the considered model, UAVs are deployed
as flying base stations (BS) to offload heavy traffic from ground BSs. Due to
time-varying traffic distribution, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based
prediction algorithm is introduced to predict the future cellular traffic. To
predict the user service distribution, a KEG algorithm, which is a joint
K-means and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on Gaussian mixture
model (GMM), is proposed for determining the service area of each UAV. Based on
the predicted traffic, the optimal UAV positions are derived and three
multi-access techniques are compared so as to minimize the total transmit
power. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce up to 24\%
of the total power consumption compared to the conventional method without
traffic prediction. Besides, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) has the
lower required transmit power compared to frequency domain multiple access
(FDMA) and time domain multiple access (TDMA).

Most of the existing CNN-based methods described in the literature extract
features at a sequential level of abstraction with repetitive nonlinear
operations and involve densely connected layers for classification. However,
studies in neurophysiology have revealed that EEG signals carry information in
different ranges of frequency components. To better reflect these
multi-frequency properties in EEGs, we propose a novel deep multi-scale neural
network that discovers feature representations in multiple frequency/time
ranges and extracts relationships among electrodes, i.e., spatial
representations, for subject intention/condition identification. Furthermore,
by completely representing EEG signals with spatio-spectral-temporal
information, the proposed method can be utilized for diverse paradigms in both
active and passive BCIs, contrary to existing methods that are primarily
focused on single-paradigm BCIs. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed
method, we conducted experiments on various paradigms of active/passive BCI
datasets. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method
achieved performance improvements when judged against comparable

validate the multi-scale EEG signal information capturing ability, activation

networks and its variants for machine translation tasks. Transformer using
attention mechanism solely achieved state-of-the-art results in sequence
modeling. Neural machine translation based on the attention mechanism is
parallelizable and addresses the problem of handling long-range dependencies
among words in sentences more effectively than recurrent neural networks. One
of the key concepts in attention is to learn three matrices, query, key, and
value, where global dependencies among words are learned through linearly
projecting word embeddings through these matrices. Multiple query, key, value
matrices can be learned simultaneously focusing on a different subspace of the
embedded dimension, which is called multi-head in Transformer. We argue that
certain dependencies among words could be learned better through an
intermediate context than directly modeling word-word dependencies. This could
happen due to the nature of certain dependencies or lack of patterns that lend
them difficult to be modeled globally using multi-head self-attention. In this
work, we propose a new way of learning dependencies through a context in
multi-head using convolution. This new form of multi-head attention along with
the traditional form achieves better results than Transformer on the WMT 2014
