  https://github.com/fuxianghuang1/PWCF",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptive image retrieval includes single-domain retrieval and
cross-domain retrieval. Most of the existing image retrieval methods only focus
on single-domain retrieval, which assumes that the distributions of retrieval
databases and queries are similar. However, in practical application, the
discrepancies between retrieval databases often taken in ideal
illumination/pose/background/camera conditions and queries usually obtained in
uncontrolled conditions are very large. In this paper, considering the
practical application, we focus on challenging cross-domain retrieval. To
address the problem, we propose an effective method named Probability Weighted
Compact Feature Learning (PWCF), which provides inter-domain correlation
guidance to promote cross-domain retrieval accuracy and learns a series of
compact binary codes to improve the retrieval speed. First, we derive our loss
function through the Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP): Bayesian
Perspective (BP) induced focal-triplet loss, BP induced quantization loss and
BP induced classification loss. Second, we propose a common manifold structure
between domains to explore the potential correlation across domains.
Considering the original feature representation is biased due to the
inter-domain discrepancy, the manifold structure is difficult to be
constructed. Therefore, we propose a new feature named Histogram Feature of
Neighbors (HFON) from the sample statistics perspective. Extensive experiments
on various benchmark databases validate that our method outperforms many
state-of-the-art image retrieval methods for domain adaptive image retrieval.

  Taylor--Couette flow and arbitrary radius ratios",,,"10.1017/jfm.2020.739",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Taylor--Couette (TC) flow is the shear-driven flow between two coaxial
independently rotating cylinders. In recent years, high-fidelity simulations
and experiments revealed the shape of the streamwise and angular velocity
profiles up to very high Reynolds numbers. However, due to curvature effects,
so far no theory has been able to correctly describe the turbulent streamwise
velocity profile for given radius ratio, as the classical Prandtl--von
K\'arm\'an logarithmic law for turbulent boundary layers over a flat surface at
most fits in a limited spatial region.
  Here we address this deficiency by applying the idea of a Monin--Obukhov
curvature length to turbulent TC flow. This length separates the flow regions
where the production of turbulent kinetic energy is governed by pure shear from
that where it acts in combination with the curvature of the streamlines. We
demonstrate that for all Reynolds numbers and radius ratios, the mean
streamwise and angular velocity profiles collapse according to this separation.
We then derive the functional form of the velocity profile. Finally, we match
the newly derived angular velocity profile with the constant angular momentum
profile at the height of the boundary layer, to obtain the dependence of the
torque on the Reynolds number, or, in other words, of the generalized Nusselt
number (i.e., the dimensionless angular velocity transport) on the Taylor
number.

different levels ranging from acquisition characteristics, session, to
subject-level (within subjects and across subjects). These challenges render DL
models prone to overfitting and hence, models lack generalization on
prospective subjects' data. In this work, we address these problems in the

bugs without sacrificing much efficiency. The claimed property is very
attractive to developers, and many projects start using the language. However,
can Rust achieve the memory-safety promise? This paper studies the question by
surveying 186 real-world bug reports collected from several origins which
contain all existing Rust CVEs (common vulnerability and exposures) of
memory-safety issues by 2020-12-31. We manually analyze each bug and extract
their culprit patterns. Our analysis result shows that Rust can keep its
promise that all memory-safety bugs require unsafe code, and many memory-safety
bugs in our dataset are mild soundness issues that only leave a possibility to
write memory-safety bugs without unsafe code. Furthermore, we summarize three
typical categories of memory-safety bugs, including automatic memory reclaim,
unsound function, and unsound generic or trait. While automatic memory claim
bugs are related to the side effect of Rust newly-adopted ownership-based
resource management scheme, unsound function reveals the essential challenge of
Rust development for avoiding unsound code, and unsound generic or trait
intensifies the risk of introducing unsoundness. Based on these findings, we
propose two promising directions towards improving the security of Rust
development, including several best practices of using specific APIs and
methods to detect particular bugs involving unsafe code. Our work intends to
raise more discussions regarding the memory-safety issues of Rust and
facilitate the maturity of the language.

mixed variable optimization problems, in which the objective and constraint
functions can depend simultaneously on continuous and discrete variables.
Additionally, complex system design problems occasionally present a
variable-size design space. This results in an optimization problem for which
the search space varies dynamically (with respect to both number and type of
variables) along the optimization process as a function of the values of
specific discrete decision variables. Similarly, the number and type of
constraints can vary as well. In this paper, two alternative Bayesian
Optimization-based approaches are proposed in order to solve this type of
optimization problems. The first one consists in a budget allocation strategy
allowing to focus the computational budget on the most promising design
sub-spaces. The second approach, instead, is based on the definition of a
kernel function allowing to compute the covariance between samples
characterized by partially different sets of variables. The results obtained on
analytical and engineering related test-cases show a faster and more consistent
convergence of both proposed methods with respect to the standard approaches.

the delocalization of quantum information in strongly-interacting many-body

our understanding of black hole dynamics, transport in exotic non-Fermi
liquids, and many-body analogs of quantum chaos. To date, verified experimental
implementations of scrambling have dealt only with systems comprised of
two-level qubits. Higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, may exhibit
different scrambling modalities and are predicted to saturate conjectured speed
limits on the rate of quantum information scrambling. We take the first steps
toward accessing such phenomena, by realizing a quantum processor based on
superconducting qutrits (three-level quantum systems). We implement two-qutrit
scrambling operations and embed them in a five-qutrit teleportation algorithm
to directly measure the associated out of-time-ordered correlation functions.
Measured teleportation fidelities, Favg = 0.568 +- 0001, confirm the occurrence
of scrambling even in the presence of experimental imperfections. Our

staircase, which is the hallmark of multistate transport devices, have been
obtained. The source-drain voltage induced change in the occupation
probabilities of low-lying many-body states which are different in nature
towards carrier transport, directly control the net current flowing through the
molecular junctions. We further investigate the effect of different kinds of
perturbations such as gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, over
carrier-flow through this molecular bridge. Interestingly, we find that
depending on the strength of the applied perturbating field, several phenomena,
such as switching off of current, suppression of NDC appears in the devices.
Fundamentally, this applied perturbations modifies both the site charge density
as well as occupation probabilities of transport active channels, resulting in
a significant alteration in transport behavior of this molecular junction.

kinematic properties obtained from \textit{Gaia} DR2. By combining the age and
chemo-kinematical information, we dissect the Galactic disc stars into three
components, namely, the thick disc (old, high-[$\alpha$/Fe], [$\alpha$/Fe]
$\gtrsim$ 0.12), the thin disc (young, low-[$\alpha$/Fe]) and the Bridge, which
is a region between the thick and thin discs. Our results indicate that the
thick disc formed at an early epoch only in the inner region, and the inner
disc smoothly transforms to the thin disc. We found that the outer disc follows
a different chemical evolution pathway from the inner disc. The outer
metal-poor stars only start forming after the compact thick disc phase has
completed and the star-forming gas disc extended outwardly with metal-poor gas
accretion. We found that in the Bridge region the range of [Fe/H] becomes wider
with decreasing age, which suggests that the Bridge region corresponds to the
transition phase from the smaller chemically well-mixed thick to a larger thin

coronae of the Sun and solar-type stars mostly show enhancements of low- FIP
elements (the FIP effect) while more active stars such as M-dwarfs have coronae
generally characterized by the inverse-FIP effect (I-FIP). Here we observe
patches of I-FIP effect solar plasma in AR 12673, a highly complex
beta/gamma/delta active region. We argue that the umbrae of coalescing sunspots
and more specifically strong light bridges within the umbrae, are preferential
locations for observing I-FIP effect plasma. Furthermore, the magnetic
complexity of the active region and major episodes of fast flux emergence also
lead to repetitive and intense flares. The induced evaporation of the
chromospheric plasma in flare ribbons crossing umbrae enables the observation
of four localized patches of I-FIP effect plasma in the corona of AR 12673.
These observations can be interpreted in the context of the ponderomotive force
fractionation model which predicts that plasma with I-FIP effect composition is
created by the refraction of waves coming from below the chromosphere. We
propose that the waves generating the I-FIP effect plasma in solar active
regions are generated by sub-photospheric reconnection of coalescing flux
systems. Although we only glimpse signatures of I-FIP effect fractionation
produced by this interaction in patches on the Sun, on highly active M-stars it

domains and solving challenging reasoning problems. In ASP solving, a typical
strategy is to preprocess problem instances by rewriting complex rules into
simpler ones. Normalization is a rewriting process that removes extended rule
types altogether in favor of normal rules. Recently, such techniques led to
optimization rewriting in ASP, where the goal is to boost answer set
optimization by refactoring the optimization criteria of interest. In this
paper, we present a novel, general, and effective technique for optimization
rewriting based on comparator networks, which are specific kinds of circuits
for reordering the elements of vectors. The idea is to connect an ASP encoding
of a comparator network to the literals being optimized and to redistribute the
weights of these literals over the structure of the network. The encoding
captures information about the weight of an answer set in auxiliary atoms in a
structured way that is proven to yield exponential improvements during
branch-and-bound optimization on an infinite family of example programs. The
used comparator network can be tuned freely, e.g., to find the best size for a
given benchmark class. Experiments show accelerated optimization performance on
several benchmark problems.

of the positivity of the distance functions and the triangle inequalities.
Their classification is based on the decomposition of an associated polyhedral
cone, called the ""metric fan"". The complete classification of $n$-point metric
spaces is available only for $n\le 6$. As the number of classes increases
rapidly with the number of elements, it is desirable to have coarser
equivalence class decompositions based on certain invariants of finite metric
spaces. If $(X,d)$ is a finite metric space with elements $P_i$ and with
distance functions $d_{ij}$, the Gromov product at $P_i$ is defined as
$\Delta_{ijk}=1/2(d_{ij}+d_{ik}-d_{jk})$. Assuming that the set of Gromov
product at $P_i$ has a unique smallest element $\Delta_{ijk}$, the association
of the edge $P_jP_k$ to $P_i$ defines the ""Gromov product structure"". The
""pendant-free"" reduction of the finite metric space is the graph obtained by
removing the edges $P_jP_k$ corresponding to the minimal Gromov products
$\Delta_{ijk}$ at $P_i$. In the present work, we define a matrix representation
for a Gromov product structure $S$ on an $n$-point metric space, by $n\times n$
matrix $G_S$. We prove that if two metric spaces have Gromov product structures
that can be mapped to each other by a permutation of the indices, then their
matrices are similar via the corresponding permutation matrix. Matrix
invariants of $G_S$ are used to define subclasses of Gromov product structures
and their application to $n=5$ and $n=6$-point spaces are given.

frequent updates when a part of the data is added to or removed from the
original data set. In this case, conventional incremental learning, which
updates an existing classifier by explicitly modeling the data modification, is
more efficient than retraining a new classifier from scratch. However,
sometimes, we are more interested in determining whether we should update the
classifier or performing some sensitivity analysis tasks. To deal with these
such tasks, we propose an algorithm to make rational inferences about the
updated linear classifier without exactly updating the classifier.
Specifically, the proposed algorithm can be used to estimate the upper and
lower bounds of the updated classifier's coefficient matrix with a low
computational complexity related to the size of the updated dataset. Both
theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed approach is
superior to existing methods in terms of tightness of coefficients' bounds and
computational complexity.

modify their communication network. This gives rise to distributed algorithms
that apart from communication can also exploit network reconfiguration in order
to carry out a given task. At the same time, the distributed task itself may
now require global reconfiguration from a given initial network $G_s$ to a
target network $G_f$ from a family of networks having some good properties,
like small diameter. With reasonably powerful computational entities, there is
a straightforward algorithm that transforms any $G_s$ into a spanning clique in
$O(\log n)$ time. The algorithm can then compute any global function on inputs
and reconfigure to any target network in one round. We argue that such a
strategy is impractical for real applications. In real dynamic networks there
is a cost associated with creating and maintaining connections. To formally
capture such costs, we define three edge-complexity measures: the \emph{total
edge activations}, the \emph{maximum activated edges per round}, and the
\emph{maximum activated degree of a node}. The clique formation strategy
highlighted above, maximizes all of them. We aim at improved algorithms that
achieve (poly)log$(n)$ time while minimizing the edge-complexity for the
general task of transforming any $G_s$ into a $G_f$ of diameter (poly)log$(n)$.
We give three distributed algorithms. The first runs in $O(\log n)$ time, with
at most $2n$ active edges per round, an optimal total of $O(n\log n)$ edge
activations, a maximum degree $n-1$, and a target network of diameter 2. The
second achieves bounded degree by paying an additional logarithmic factor in
time and in total edge activations and gives a target network of diameter
$O(\log n)$. Our third algorithm shows that if we slightly increase the maximum
degree to polylog$(n)$ then we can achieve a running time of $o(\log^2 n)$.

the superradiance instability. Through processes such as annihilation, these
bosons can source continuous gravitational wave signals with frequencies within
the range of LIGO and Virgo. If boson annihilation occurs, then the Galactic
black hole population will give rise to many gravitational signals; we refer to
this as the ensemble signal. We characterize the ensemble signal as observed by
the gravitational-wave detectors; this is important because the ensemble signal
carries the primary signature that a continuous wave signal has a boson
annihilation origin. We explore how a broad set of black hole population
parameters affects the resulting spin-0 boson annihilation signal and consider
its detectability by recent searches for continuous gravitational waves. A
population of $10^8$ black holes with masses up to $30\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a
flat dimensionless initial spin distribution between zero and unity produces up
to a thousand signals loud enough to be in principle detected by these
searches. For a more moderately spinning population the number of signals drops
by about an order of magnitude, still yielding up to a hundred detectable
signals for some boson masses. A non-detection of annihilation signals at
frequencies between 100 and 1200 Hz disfavors the existence of scalar bosons
with rest energies between $2\times10^{-13}$ and $2.5\times10^{-12}$ eV.
Finally we show that, depending on the black hole population parameters, care
must be taken in assuming that the continuous wave upper limits from searches
for isolated signals are still valid for signals that are part of a dense
ensemble: Between 200 and 300 Hz, we urge caution when interpreting a null
result for bosons between 4 and $6\times10^{-13}$ eV.

penetrate the grain itself. We estimate the superconducting losses due to
vortices filling grain boundaries and compare with observed performance
degradation with higher magnetic fields. We estimate that the quality factor

inefficiency of star formation in galaxies. Although strong feedback can
promote the formation of galactic discs by limiting star formation at early
times and removing low angular momentum gas, it is not understood how the same
feedback can result in diverse objects such as elliptical galaxies or razor
thin spiral galaxies. We investigate this problem using cosmological zoom-in
simulations of two galaxies forming within $10^{12}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ halos
with almost identical mass accretion histories and halo spin parameters.
However, the two resulting galaxies end up with very different bulge-to-disc
ratios at $z = 0$. At $z>1.5$, the two galaxies feature a surface density of
star formation $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\simeq 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}~{\rm
kpc}^{-2}$, leading to strong outflows. After the last starburst episode, both
galaxies feature a dramatic gaseous disc growth from 1~kpc to 5~kpc during
1~Gyr, a decisive event we dub ""the Grand Twirl"". After this event, the
evolutionary tracks diverge strongly, with one galaxy ending up as a
bulge-dominated galaxy, whereas the other ends up as a disc-dominated galaxy.
The origins of this dichotomy are the angular momentum of the accreted gas, and
whether it adds constructively to the initial disc angular momentum. The
build-up of this extended disc leads to a rapid lowering of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$
by over two orders of magnitude with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \lesssim
0.1~\mathrm{M_\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}~{\rm kpc}^{-2}$, in remarkable agreement
with what is derived from Milky Way stellar populations. As a consequence,
supernovae explosions are spread out and cannot launch galactic outflows

to have built the majority of the inner stellar halo. We use the cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation Illustris to place this merger in the context of galaxy
assembly within $\Lambda$CDM. From $\sim$150 MW analogs, $\sim 80 \%$ have
experienced at least one merger of similar mass and infall time as GE/GS.
Within this sample, 37 have debris as radial as that of the GE/GS, which we dub
the Ancient Radial Mergers (ARMs). Counterrotation is not rare among ARMs, with
$43 \%$ having $>40 \%$ of their debris in counterrotating orbits. However, the
compactness inferred for the GE/GS debris, given its large $\beta$ and its
substantial contribution to the stellar halo, is more difficult to reproduce.
The median radius of ARM debris is r$_{*,deb}\simeq 45$kpc, while GE/GS is
thought to be mostly contained within $r\sim 30$ kpc. For most MW analogs, a
few mergers are required to build the inner stellar halo, and ARM debris only
accounts for $\sim 12 \%$ of inner accreted stars. Encouragingly, we find one
ARM that is both compact and dominates the inner halo of its central, making it
our best GE/GS analog. Interestingly, this merger deposits a significant number

demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces

evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by
backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving
directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques
emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized

different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is

quantitatively the strongest peak-trough asymmetries, near the 3:2 and 2:1

discs. Disc eccentricity damping captures bodies into resonance and clears the
trough, and when combined with disc-driven convergent migration, draws planets
initially wide of commensurability into the peak. The migration implied by the
magnitude of the peak is modest; reductions in orbital period are $\sim$10\%,
supporting the view that sub-Neptunes complete their formation more-or-less in

consequence of stellar clustering is an extremely broad Galaxy-wide
distribution of incident flux (spanning $>10$ decades), with half the Galactic

an interface between a homogeneous medium and a metamaterial. The relevant
eigenmodes in the two regions are calculated by solving a recently described
non self-adjoint eigenvalue problem particularly suited to scattering studies.
The method efficiently produces all propagating and evanescent modes consistent
with the application of Snell's law and is applicable to very general
scattering problems. In a model composite, we elucidate the emergence of a rich
spectrum of eigenvalue degeneracies. These degeneracies appear in both the
complex and real domains of the wave-vector. However, since this problem is non
self-adjoint, these degeneracies generally represent a coalescing of both the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors (exceptional points). Through explicit
calculations of Poynting vector, we point out an intriguing phenomenon: there
always appears to be an abrupt change in the sign of the refraction angle of
the wave on two sides of an exceptional point. Furthermore, the presence of
these degeneracies, in some cases, hints at fast changes in the scattered field
as the incident angle is changed by small amounts. We calculate these scattered
fields through a novel application of the Betti-Rayleigh reciprocity theorem.
We present several numerical examples showing a rich scattering spectrum. In
one particularly intriguing example, we point out wave behavior which may be
related to the phenomenon of resonance trapping. We also show that there exists
a deep connection between energy flux conservation and the biorthogonality
relationship of the non self-adjoint problem. The proof applies to the general
class of scattering problems involving elastic waves (under self-adjoint or non
self-adjoint operators).

By defining a total order on quasi-resonant triads, at a first stage we
construct quasi-resonant triads using auxiliary parameters of elliptic surfaces
in order to generate pseudo-random numbers. At a second stage, we employ an MEC
to construct a dynamic substitution box (S-box) for the plain image. The
generated pseudo-random numbers and S-box are used to provide diffusion and
confusion, respectively, in the tested image. We test the proposed scheme
against well-known attacks by encrypting all gray images taken from the

the newly developed scheme. Finally, via extensive comparisons we show that the
new scheme outperforms other popular schemes.

Einstein et. al. (1935) and Bell (1964) emphasized the apparent nonlocality
arising from entanglement correlations. While some interpretations embrace this
nonlocality, modern variations of the Everett-inspired many worlds
interpretation try to circumvent it. In this paper, we review Bell's ""no-go""
theorem and explain how it rests on three axioms, local causality, no
superdeterminism, and one world. Although Bell is often taken to have shown
that local causality is ruled out by the experimentally confirrmed entanglement
correlations, we make clear that it is the conjunction of the three axioms that
is ruled out by these correlations. We then show that by assuming local
causality and no superdeterminism, we can give a direct proof of many worlds.
The remainder of the paper searches for a consistent, local, formulation of
many worlds. We show that prominent formulations whose ontology is given by the
wave function violate local causality, and we critically evaluate claims in the
literature to the contrary. We ultimately identify a local many worlds
interpretation that replaces the wave function with a separable
Lorentz-invariant wave-field. We conclude with discussions of the Born rule,
and other interpretations of quantum mechanics.

SPARC observational sample and find broad agreement. In detail, however, Simba
is biased towards higher $V_{\rm circ}$ by up to 0.1 dex. We find evidence for
the flattening of the BTFR in $V_{\rm circ}>300$ km s$^{-1}$ galaxies, in

overly bulge-dominated dwarf galaxies in our sample. We investigate for

bosonic Hamiltonians are governed by a generally non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de
Gennes effective Hamiltonian. This underlying non-Hermiticity gives rise to a
dynamically stable regime, whereby all observables undergo bounded evolution in
time, and a dynamically unstable one, whereby evolution is unbounded for at
least some observables. We show that stability-to-instability transitions may
be classified in terms of a suitably generalized $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$
symmetry, which can be broken when diagonalizability is lost at exceptional
points in parameter space, but also when degenerate real eigenvalues split off
the real axis while the system remains diagonalizable. By leveraging tools from
Krein stability theory in indefinite inner-product spaces, we introduce an
indicator of stability phase transitions, which naturally extends the notion of
phase rigidity from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics to the bosonic setting. As
a paradigmatic example, we fully characterize the stability phase diagram of a
bosonic analogue to the Kitaev-Majorana chain under a wide class of boundary
conditions. In particular, we establish a connection between phase-dependent
transport properties and the onset of instability, and argue that stable
regions in parameter space become of measure zero in the thermodynamic limit.
Our analysis also reveals that boundary conditions that support Majorana zero
modes in the fermionic Kitaev chain are precisely the same that support
stability in the bosonic chain.

which topologically protected edge states between Landau levels (LLs) form
conducting channels at the edge of the sample. In periodic crystals, the LLs
are imprinted with lattice properties; plateaus in the transverse Hall
conductivity are not equidistant in energy anymore. Herein, crystals with a
polyatomic basis are considered. For a stripe arrangement of different atoms,
the band structure resorts nontrivially and exhibits strong oscillations that
form a salient pattern with very small bandgaps. The Hall conductivity strongly
decreases for energies within these bands, and only sharp peaks remain for
energies in the gap. These effects are traced back to open orbits in the
initial band structure; the corresponding LLs are formed from states with
positive and negative effective mass. The partial cancellation of transverse
charge conductivity also holds for different polyatomic stripe lattices and
even when the magnetic field is replaced by a topologically nontrivial spin
texture. The topological Hall effect is suppressed in the presence of magnetic
skyrmions. The discussion is complemented by calculations of Hofstadter

little work has been done in the area of {replenishing} credit links of users

important to keep users solvent, the network viable with enough liquidity, and
to prevent transaction failures. This is achieved by a process called
{rebalancing} that enables a poorly funded user to create incoming as well as

weights can create incoming links with existing, trusted users in the network,
in a procedure we call {balance transfer}, followed by creating outgoing links

Here, we consider a triple-dot system arranged in linear and triangular

due to symmetry reduction on the edges. In the presence of mirror symmetry, the
band topology of the edge states can be characterized by the Zak phase,

connect the topologically non-trivial insulator with the trivial one, being
consistent with their topological properties and physical robustness. Thanks to
this, we demonstrate that for three-dimensional topological insulators in

time step, the player observes an independently sampled context that determines

for a fixed and known number of future time steps. The above contextual
setting, which captures important scenarios such as recommendation systems or
ad placement with diverse users, invalidates greedy solution techniques that
are effective for its non-contextual counterpart (Basu et al., NeurIPS19).
Assuming knowledge of the context distribution and the mean reward of each

where the right-vertices (contexts) arrive stochastically and the left-vertices
(arms) are blocked for a finite number of rounds each time they are matched.
This problem has been recently studied in the full-information case, where
competitive ratio bounds have been derived. We focus on the bandit setting,
where the reward distributions are initially unknown; we propose a UCB-based
variant of the full-information algorithm that guarantees a $\mathcal{O}(\log

$\Omega(\log(T))$ regret lower bound in this setting. Due to the time
correlations caused by blocking, existing techniques for upper bounding regret
fail. For proving our regret bounds, we introduce the novel concepts of delayed
exploitation and opportunistic subsampling and combine them with ideas from
combinatorial bandits and non-stationary Markov chains coupling.

unexpected in current models for the formation of multiple populations and

extreme mass of both clusters, the expectation is that they should host rather
extreme abundance spreads, manifested through, e.g., high mean [Na/Fe]
abundances. However, we do not find evidence for a strong [Na/Fe] enhancement,
with the observations being consistent with the solar value. This suggests that
age is playing a key role, or alternatively that multiple populations only
manifest below a certain stellar mass, as the integrated light at all ages

an order of magnitude sensitivity increase with respect to currently operating

voltage on the grid of an inductive output tube (IOT). High-efficiency
inductive output tubes (IOTs) are typically characterized by efficiencies up to
70 - 75%. However, the achievement of efficiencies greater than 80% would
substantially reduce the operating costs of next-generation accelerators. In
order to achieve this goal, we consider the addition of a 3rd harmonic
component to the drive signal on the grid of an inductive output tube. The use
of a 3rd harmonic drive component in IOT guns has been considered in order to
apply such a gun as the injector [1] of radio frequency linear accelerators (RF
linacs). Here we consider that the IOT will be used to provide the rf power to
drive RF linacs and apply the 3rd harmonic with the intention of increasing the
efficiency of the RF output of the IOT. We consider a model IOT with a 700 MHz
resonant cavity and using an annular beam with a voltage of 30 kV, an average
current of 6.67 A yielding a perveance of about 1.3e-6 P. We simulate this IOT
using the NEMESIS simulation code [2] which has been successfully validated by
comparison with the K5H90W-2 IOT developed by Communications and Power
Industries. It is found that the effect of the 3rd harmonic on the efficiency
is greatest when the phase of the 3rd harmonic is shifted by pi radians with
respect to the fundamental drive signal and with 3rd harmonic powers greater
than about 50% that of the fundamental drive power. For the present example, we
show that efficiencies approaching 86% are possible by this means.

correlated with battery cycling behavior at high potentials. Using Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the hybrid PBE0 functional, and the (001)

solvent molecules are predicted to be readily oxidized on the Li(x)Mn(2)O(4)

reactions, involving first formation of CEI films and then further oxidization
of CEI at higher potentials, are most relevant to capacity fade. Mechanisms
associated with dissolution or oxidation of native Li2CO3 films, which is
removed before the electrolyte is in contact with oxide surfaces, are also

several mutant traits being present at the same time and competing for invading

existence of numerous long and narrow filamentary structures within a few
hundred parsecs of Sgr A$^{\star}$. While more than one than one hundred radio
filaments have been revealed by MeerKAT, about two dozens X-ray filaments have
been discovered so far. In this article, we report our analysis on the deep
Chandra and NuSTAR observations of a non-thermal X-ray filament, G0.13-0.11,
which is located adjacent to the Radio arc. Chandra revealed a unique
morphology of G0.13-0.11, which is an elongated (0.1 pc in width and 3.2 pc in
length) structure slightly bended towards the Radio arc. A pulsar candidate
($\Gamma \sim 1.4$) is detected in the middle of the filament, with a tail of
diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission on one side of the filament. The filament is
detected by NuSTAR up to 79 keV, with the hard X-ray centroid consistent with
the pulsar candidate. We found that the X-ray intensity decays along the
filament farther away from the pulsar candidate, dropping to half of its peak
value at 2.2 pc away. This system is mostly likely a Pulsar Wind Nebula
interacting with ambient interstellar magnetic field, where the filaments are
kinetic jets from PWN as recently proposed. The nature of this filament adds to
complex origin of the X-ray filaments, which serve as powerful tools to probe
local and global powerful particle accelerators in the Galactic center.

chosen action yields a stochastic reward. The agent seeks to maximize its
cumulative reward over a finite time budget, with the option of ""giving up"" on
a current action -- hence forfeiting any reward -- in order to choose another
action. We cast this problem as a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits
problem with stochastic consumption of resource. For this problem, we first
establish that the optimal arm is the one that maximizes the ratio of the
expected reward of the arm to the expected waiting time before the agent sees
the reward due to pulling that arm. Using a novel upper confidence bound on
this ratio, we then introduce an upper confidence based-algorithm, WAIT-UCB,
for which we establish logarithmic, problem-dependent regret bound which has an
improved dependence on problem parameters compared to previous works.
Simulations on various problem configurations comparing WAIT-UCB against the

insights. Common data analysis workflows additionally use clustering techniques
to identify groups of similar features. This usually leads to a two-stage
process, however, it would be desirable to construct a joint modelling
framework for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of features.
In this paper, we propose to achieve this through the BasisVAE: a combination
of the VAE and a probabilistic clustering prior, which lets us learn a one-hot
basis function representation as part of the decoder network. Furthermore, for
scenarios where not all features are aligned, we develop an extension to handle
translation-invariant basis functions. We show how a collapsed variational

observations of the new black hole X-ray binary candidate MAXI J1631-479 at two

dominant state and a power-law dominant state. Strong relativistic disk
reflection features are clearly detected, displaying significant variations in
the shape and strength of the broad iron emission line between the two states.
Spectral modeling of the reflection spectra reveals that the inner radius of
the optically-thick accretion disk evolves from $<1.9$ $r_{\rm g}$ to $12\pm1$
$r_{\rm g}$ (statistical errors at 90% confidence level) from the disk dominant
to the power-law dominant state. Assuming in the former case that the inner
disk radius is consistent with being at the ISCO, we estimate a black hole spin
of $a^*>0.94$. Given that the bolometric luminosity is similar in the two
states, our results indicate that the disk truncation observed in MAXI
J1631-479 in the power-law dominant state is unlikely to be driven by a global
variation in the accretion rate. We propose that it may instead arise from
local instabilities in the inner edge of the accretion disk at high accretion
rates. In addition, we find an absorption feature in the spectra centered at
$7.33\pm0.03$ keV during the disk dominant state, which is evidence for a rare
case that an extremely fast disk wind ($v_{\rm out}=0.067^{+0.001}_{-0.004}~c$)

of locally compact groups on $C^*$-algebras. Our definition extends the
definition of amenability for actions of discrete groups due to Claire
Anantharaman-Delaroche. We show that our definition has several
characterizations and permanence properties analogous to those known in the
discrete case. For example, for actions on commutative $C^*$-algebras, we show
that our notion of amenability is equivalent to measurewise amenability.
Combined with a recent result of Alex Bearden and Jason Crann, this also
settles a long standing open problem about the equivalence of topological
amenability and measurewise amenability for a second countable $G$-space $X$.
We use our new notion of amenability to study when the maximal and reduced
crossed products agree. One of our main results generalizes a theorem of
Matsumura: we show that for an action of an exact locally compact group $G$ on
a locally compact space $X$ the full and reduced crossed products
$C_0(X)\rtimes_\max G$ and $C_0(X)\rtimes_{\operatorname{red}} G$ coincide if
and only if the action of $G$ on $X$ is amenable. We also show that the
analogue of this theorem does not hold for actions on noncommutative
$C^*$-algebras. Finally, we study amenability as it relates to more detailed
structure in the case of $C^*$-algebras that fibre over an appropriate
$G$-space $X$, and the interaction of amenability with various regularity

These tools encourage code reuse, making it trivial for developers to import

uploading of a package with name similar to that of a highly popular package,
typically with the aim of capturing some of the popular package's installs.
Typosquatting has serious negative implications, resulting in developers
importing malicious packages, or -- as we show -- code clones which do not
incorporate recent security updates. In order to tackle this problem, we
present SpellBound, a tool for identifying and reporting potentially erroneous
imports to developers. SpellBound implements a novel typosquatting detection

leverages a model of lexical similarity between names, and further incorporates
the notion of package popularity. This approach flags cases where
unknown/scarcely used packages would be installed in place of popular ones with
similar names, before installation occurs. We evaluated SpellBound on both npm

generating limited warnings (0.5% of total package installs), and low overhead
(only 2.5% of package install time). Furthermore, SpellBound allowed us to
confirm known cases of typosquatting and discover one high-profile, unknown
case of typosquatting that resulted in a package takedown by the npm security

a prospective slice provides a stochastically driven physical basis for the
removal of material in fracture events. With a variety of quantitative
measures, in steady state we find a power law decay of deviations in a
toughness parameter $\gamma$ from a perfect spherical shape. We examine the
time evolution of shapes for stones initially in the form of cubes as well as
irregular fragments created by cleaving a regular solid many times along random

first involves the simultaneous loss of facets original to the parent solid,

Nevertheless, for mono-dispersed irregular solids, the loss of primordial
facets is not simultaneous but occurs in stages. In the case of initially

that salient times scale quadratically in $\gamma$. We use the universal

ignore 1) the feasibility of the vehicle's multi-modal state information for
prediction and 2) the mutual exclusive relationship between the global traffic
scene receptive fields and the local position resolution when modeling
vehicles' interactions, which may influence prediction accuracy. Therefore, we
propose a vehicle-descriptor based LSTM model with the dilated convolutional
social pooling (VD+DCS-LSTM) to cope with the above issues. First, each
vehicle's multi-modal state information is employed as our model's input and a
new vehicle descriptor encoded by stacked sparse auto-encoders is proposed to
reflect the deep interactive relationships between various states, achieving
the optimal feature extraction and effective use of multi-modal inputs.
Secondly, the LSTM encoder is used to encode the historical sequences composed
of the vehicle descriptor and a novel dilated convolutional social pooling is
proposed to improve modeling vehicles' spatial interactions. Thirdly, the LSTM
decoder is used to predict the probability distribution of future trajectories
based on maneuvers. The validity of the overall model was verified over the

the differences between intact-limbed and amputee cross-user electromyography
(EMG) patterns were examined. Previously collected EMG data from 20 intact
limbed and 10 amputee subjects for different wrist, finger, and grasping

amputees were consistently grouped into a different cluster than intact-limbed

there exist no-regret algorithms which perform no worse than the best ranking

computationally hard: Kanade and Steinke (2014) showed that achieving this
no-regret performance is at least as hard as PAC-learning DNFs, a notoriously
difficult problem. In the present work, we relax the original problem and study
computationally efficient no-approximate-regret algorithms: such algorithms may
exceed the optimal cost by a multiplicative constant in addition to the
additive regret. We give an algorithm that provides a no-approximate-regret

the velocity of the cell in a single shot with a short-term sensitivity of 5.5

creating quantum interference through an auxiliary transition for the probe

orders of magnitude and can be used to design a compact motional sensor based

use of resources in any communication system and one of the main factors that
determines the quality of communication. Although there is ample literature on
the optimum placement of BSs for sub-6 GHz bands, channel propagation
characteristics, such as penetration loss, are notably different in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands than in sub-6 GHz bands. Therefore, designated
solutions are needed for mmWave systems to have reliable quality of service
(QoS) assessment. This article proposes a multi-armed bandit (MAB) learning
approach for the mmWave BS placement problem. The proposed solution performs
viewshed analysis to identify the areas that are visible to a given BS location
by considering the 3D geometry of the outdoor environments. Coverage
probability, which is used as the QoS metric, is calculated using the
appropriate path loss model depending on the viewshed analysis and a
probabilistic blockage model and then fed to the MAB learning mechanism. The
optimum BS location is then determined based on the expected reward that the
candidate locations attain at the end of the training process. Unlike the
optimization-based techniques, this method can capture the time-varying
behavior of the channel and find the optimal BS locations that maximize
long-term performance.

perihelion passages. This asteroid is considered to be a source of the Geminid
meteor stream. It is reported that this asteroid is spinning at a rotation
period of $3.60 \ hr$ and has a top shape (an oblate body with an equatorial
ridge) with a mean equatorial diameter of $6.25 \ km$. Here, we report that
Phaethon's rotation state may be close to or above its critical rotation period
when the bulk density is $0.5 \ - \ 1.5 \ {g/cm^3}$ (a typical bulk density of
a B-type asteroid). We found that in this condition, the structure of Phaethon
is sensitive to failure unless the cohesive strength is ${\sim}50 \ Pa \ - \
{\sim}260 \ Pa$. This result implies that if there are some surface processes
driven by, for example, thermal waves, large-scaled deformation may happen and
cause mass shedding. From this interpretation, we propose the processes that
produced the Geminid meteor stream in the past and dust tails recently.
Phaethon initially rotated at a spin period shorter than the current period.
The magnitude of structural deformation at this stage was higher than the
present spin condition, and a large mass shedding event, i.e., the Geminid
meteor stream, occurred. After this deformation process, the body became more
oblate, and its spin slowed down. At this point, while the spin was high enough
for the body to have mass shedding events, the magnitude of these events became
small.

as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). To deal with
the curse of dimensionality associated with the MDP, we propose a novel
continuous-time perturbation approach and derive an asymptotically optimal
closed-form priority function for the MDP. Based on this, we derive a
closed-form first-order optimal dynamic MIMO AF precoding solution, and the

activates the strongest eigenchannel to deliver a dynamically weighted
combination of the plant states to the controller when the accumulated state

consider the case where the system state is known at each time step, and
present reciprocal and zero CBF constructions that guarantee safety with

incomplete state information environments, in which the state must be estimated

emotional information explicitly due to different possible causes. In this
paper, we propose a new task: Emotion-Cause Span-Pair extraction and

learning. Approximate inference provides powerful tools to Bayesian reasoning,
decision making, and Bayesian deep learning. The main goal is to estimate the
expectation of interested functions w.r.t. a target distribution. When it comes
to high dimensional probability models and large datasets, efficient
approximate inference becomes critically important. In this thesis, we propose
a new framework for approximate inference, which combines the advantages of
these three frameworks and overcomes their limitations. Our proposed four
algorithms are motivated by the recent computational progress of Stein's
method. Our proposed algorithms are applied to continuous and discrete
distributions under the setting when the gradient information of the target
distribution is available or unavailable. Theoretical analysis is provided to
prove the convergence of our proposed algorithms. Our adaptive IS algorithm
iteratively improves the importance proposal by functionally decreasing the KL
divergence between the updated proposal and the target. When the gradient of
the target is unavailable, our proposed sampling algorithm leverages the
gradient of a surrogate model and corrects induced bias with importance
weights, which significantly outperforms other gradient-free sampling
algorithms. In addition, our theoretical results enable us to perform the
goodness-of-fit test on discrete distributions. At the end of the thesis, we
propose an importance-weighted method to efficiently aggregate local models in
distributed learning with one-shot communication. Results on simulated and real
datasets indicate the statistical efficiency and wide applicability of our
algorithm.

improve the control quality from different optimization perspectives, the
problem still remains in determining the appropriate approach that satisfies
the fine motion constraints for the telemanipulation task and preference of the

assistance knowledge learning approach. An assistance preference model learns
what assistance is preferred by a human, and a stagewise model updating method
ensures the learning stability while dealing with the ambiguity of human
preference data. Such a preference-aware assistance knowledge enables a
teleoperated robot hand to provide more active yet preferred assistance toward
manipulation success. We also developed knowledge transfer methods to transfer
the preference knowledge across different robot hand structures to avoid
extensive robot-specific training. Experiments to telemanipulate a 3-finger

been conducted. Results demonstrated that the methods enabled the robots to

next-generation, high-fidelity mobility maps, they are cumbersome and

supercomputer and each map requires thousands of such simulations. Recent work
at the U.S. Army CCDC Ground Vehicle Systems Center has shown that trained

classifier efficiently is still an open problem. According to PAC learning
theory, data that can be separated by a classifier is expected to require
$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ randomly selected points (simulations) to train the
classifier with error less than $\epsilon$. In this paper, building on existing
algorithms, we introduce an active learning paradigm that substantially reduces
the number of simulations needed to train a machine learning classifier without

Si was also investigated. The depth of the tunnels formed by etching SiGe
layers between two Si layers was found in proportion to digital etching cycles.
And oxidation would also saturate and the saturated relative etched amount per
cycle (REPC) was 0.5 nm (4 monolayers). A corrected selectivity calculation
formula was presented. The oxidation model was also calibrated with
Si0.7Ge0.3/p+ Si stacks, and selectivity from model was the same with the
corrected formula. The model can also be used to analyze process variations and
repeatability. And it could act as a guidance for experiment design.
Selectivity and repeatability should make a trade-off.

observed frames. Current state-of-the-art approaches mainly resort to recurrent
neural networks to encode history information into hidden states, and predict
future actions from the hidden representations. It is well known that the
recurrent pipeline is inefficient in capturing long-term information which may
limit its performance in predication task. To address this problem, this paper
proposes a simple yet efficient Temporal Transformer with Progressive
Prediction (TTPP) framework, which repurposes a Transformer-style architecture
to aggregate observed features, and then leverages a light-weight network to
progressively predict future features and actions. Specifically, predicted
features along with predicted probabilities are accumulated into the inputs of
subsequent prediction. We evaluate our approach on three action datasets,
namely TVSeries, THUMOS-14, and TV-Human-Interaction. Additionally we also
conduct a comprehensive study for several popular aggregation and prediction
strategies. Extensive results show that TTPP not only outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods but also more efficient.

affirmative answer is provided to the question: whether the upper bound of
step-size ratios for the $l^\infty(0,T;H)$-stability of the BDF2 method for
linear and semilinear parabolic equations is identical with the upper bound for
the zero-stability. The $l^\infty(0,T;V)$-stability of the variable step-size

survival. The tumor heterogeneity is measured in terms of its mass by combining
information regarding the radiodensity obtained in images with the gross tumor
volume (GTV). We propose a novel feature called Tumor Mass within a GTV (TMG),
that improves the prediction of survivability, compared to existing models
which use GTV. Weekly variation in TMG of a patient is computed from the image
data and also estimated from a cell survivability model. The parameters
obtained from the cell survivability model are indicatives of changes in TMG
over the treatment period. We use these parameters along with other patient
metadata to perform survival analysis and regression. Cox's Proportional Hazard
survival regression was performed using these data. Significant improvement in
the average concordance index from 0.47 to 0.64 was observed when TMG is used
in the model instead of GTV. The experiments show that there is a difference in
the treatment response in responsive and non-responsive patients and that the
proposed method can be used to predict patient survivability.

modeling the semantic inter-dependencies along channel and spatial dimensions

(1926), can be proved from Chaitin's follow-up to Goedel's (first)
incompleteness theorem. In comparison, Bell's (1964) theorem as well as the
so-called free will theorem-originally due to Heywood and Redhead (1983)-left
two loopholes for deterministic hidden variable theories, namely giving up
either locality (more precisely: local contextuality, as in Bohmian mechanics)
or free choice (i.e. uncorrelated measurement settings, as in 't Hooft's
cellular automaton interpretation of quantum mechanics). The main point is that
Bell and others did not exploit the full empirical content of quantum
mechanics, which consists of long series of outcomes of repeated measurements
(idealized as infinite binary sequences): their arguments only used the
long-run relative frequencies derived from such series, and hence merely asked
hidden variable theories to reproduce single-case Born probabilities defined by
certain entangled bipartite states. If we idealize binary outcome strings of a
fair quantum coin flip as infinite sequences, quantum mechanics predicts that
these typically (i.e.\ almost surely) have a property called 1-randomness in
logic, which is much stronger than uncomputability. This is the key to my
claim, which is admittedly based on a stronger (yet compelling) notion of
determinism than what is common in the literature on hidden variable theories.

we propose the use of a hierarchical network with cascading outputs and maximum
a posteriori path estimation to predict the communicative function at each
level of the hierarchy, preserve the dependencies between the functions in the
path, and decide at which level to stop. Furthermore, since the amount of
dialogs in the DialogBank is reduced, we rely on transfer learning processes to
reduce overfitting and improve performance. The results of our experiments show
that the hierarchical approach outperforms a flat one and that each of its
components plays an important role towards the recognition of general-purpose

advantage of the PET output regulation is that the data transmission and
triggered condition are only needed to be monitored at discrete sampling
instants. It is assumed that only a small number of agents can have access to
the system matrix and states of the leader. Meanwhile, the PET mechanism is
considered not only in the communication between various agents, but also in
the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator transmission channels for
each agent. The above problem set-up will bring some challenges to the
controller design and stability analysis. Based on a novel PET distributed
observer, a PET dynamic output feedback control method is developed for each
follower. Compared with the existing works, our method can naturally exclude
the Zeno behavior, and the inter-event time becomes multiples of the sampling
period. Furthermore, for every follower, the minimum inter-event time can be
determined \textit{a prior}, and computed directly without the knowledge of the
leader information. An example is given to verify and illustrate the
effectiveness of the new design scheme.

simulate nodal-line semimetal, which can be achieved in experiment by attaching
one triangular optical lattice to a hexangonal optical lattice and periodically
modulating the intensity and position of the triangular lattice. By amplitude
shaking, a time-reversal-symmetry-unstable mode is introduced into the
bipartite optical lattice, and then the nodal-line semimetal is gotten by
adjusting the proportion of such mode and the trivial mode of hexagonal
lattice. Through calculating the energy spectrum of effective Hamiltonian, the
transformation from Dirac semimetal to nodal-line semimetal in pace with
changing shaking parameters is observed. We also study the change of Berry
curvature and Berry phase in the transformation, which provides guidance on
measuring the transformation in experiment. By analyzing the symmetry of the
system, the emergence of the time-reversal-symmetry-unstable mode is
researched. This proposal provides a way to research the pure nodal-line
semimetal without the influence of other bands, which may contribute to the
study of those unique features of surface states and bulk states of nodal-line

privacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a
global model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a
central server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts
machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these
models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be
transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication
costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary

convergence of quantization factors, unbiasedness of FTTQ, as well as a reduced

with integrated luminosities of $0.5~\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ and
$1.4~\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$, respectively. The kinematic selection for heavy-flavor

pseudorapidity $|\eta|<2.0$. The dominant sources of muons in this
$p_\mathrm{T}$ range are semi-leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons.
These heavy-flavor muons are separated from light-hadron decay muons and
punch-through hadrons using the momentum imbalance between the measurements in
the tracking detector and in the muon spectrometers. Azimuthal anisotropies,
quantified by flow coefficients, are measured via the event-plane method for
inclusive heavy-flavor muons as a function of the muon $p_\mathrm{T}$ and in
intervals of Pb+Pb collision centrality. Heavy-flavor muons are separated into
contributions from charm and bottom hadron decays using the muon transverse
impact parameter with respect to the event primary vertex. Non-zero elliptic
($v_{2}$) and triangular ($v_{3}$) flow coefficients are extracted for charm
and bottom muons, with the charm muon coefficients larger than those for bottom
muons for all Pb+Pb collision centralities. The results indicate substantial
modification to the charm and bottom quark angular distributions through
interactions in the quark-gluon plasma produced in these Pb+Pb collisions, with
smaller modifications for the bottom quarks as expected theoretically due to

transmission solutions, sender concurrently splits traffic on default routing
paths and has no flexibility to select paths. When default paths fall into
severe congestion and the available bandwidth decreases, sender has to decrease
video quality by reducing resolution or encoding bitrate. Deploying relay

algorithm adapted from BBR is implemented to probe bandwidth and to avoid link
congestion. To maintain throughput stability and fairness, a smaller probe up

the spectra accentuate differences in peak frequency, transition dipole moment

$\gamma^* p \to \phi p$, by employing a tree-level effective Lagrangian
approach in the kinematical ranges of $Q^2$ = (0$-$4) $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, $W$ =
(2$-$5) GeV, and $|t| \leq 2\,\mathrm{GeV}^2$. In addition to the universally
accepted Pomeron exchange, we consider various meson exchanges in the $t$
channel with the Regge method. Direct $\phi$-meson radiations in the $s$- and
$u$-channels are also taken into account. We find that the $Q^2$ dependence of
the transverse ($\sigma_{\mathrm{T}}$) and longitudinal ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L}}$)
cross sections are governed by Pomeron and $(a_0,f_0)$ scalar meson exchanges,
respectively. Meanwhile, the contributions of $(\pi,\eta)$ pseudoscalar- and
$f_1(1285)$ axial-vector-meson exchanges are much more suppressed. The results
of the interference cross sections ($\sigma_{\mathrm{LT}},
\sigma_{\mathrm{LT}}$) and the spin-density matrix elements indicate that
$s$-channel helicity conservation holds at $Q^2$ = (1$-$4) $\mathrm{GeV}^2$.
The result of the parity asymmetry yield $P \simeq 0.95$ at $W$ = 2.5 GeV,
meaning that natural-parity exchange dominates the reaction process. Our
numerical results are in fair agreement with the experimental data and thus the
use of our effective Reggeized model is justified over the considered
kinematical ranges of $Q^2$, $W$, and $t$.

integration. We start by revisiting (in the framework of
high-performance/high-accuracy computations) well-known GP-QT settings, based
on the analogy with classical vortical flows: Taylor-Green (TG) vortices and
Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flow. Two new settings are suggested to build
the initial condition for the QT simulation. They are based on the direct
manipulation of the wave function by generating a smoothed random phase (SRP)
field, or seeding random vortex rings (RVR) pairs. The new initial conditions
have the advantage to be simpler to implement than the TG and ABC approaches,
while generating statistically equivalent QT fields. Each of these four GP-QT
settings is described in detail by defining corresponding benchmarks that could
be used to validate/calibrate new GP codes. We offer a comprehensive
description of the numerical and physical parameters of each benchmark. We
analyze the results in detail and present values, spectra and structure
functions of main quantities of interest (energy, helicity, etc.) that are
useful to describe the turbulent flow. Some general features of QT are
identified, despite the variety of initial states.

higher pressures, when the homogeneous broadening becomes comparable to the

Furthermore, we verify the validity of the WCCC by the minimum values of the

channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) to achieve spatial
diversity and multiplexing gains. In a frequency division duplex (FDD)
multiuser massive MIMO network, each user needs to compress and feedback its
downlink CSI to the BS. The CSI overhead scales with the number of antennas,
users and subcarriers, and becomes a major bottleneck for the overall spectral
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based CSI
compression scheme, called DeepCMC, composed of convolutional layers followed
by quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous DL-based
CSI reduction structures, DeepCMC proposes a novel fully-convolutional neural
network (NN) architecture, with residual layers at the decoder, and
incorporates quantization and entropy coding blocks into its design. DeepCMC is
trained to minimize a weighted rate-distortion cost, which enables a trade-off
between the CSI quality and its feedback overhead. Simulation results
demonstrate that DeepCMC outperforms the state of the art CSI compression
schemes in terms of the reconstruction quality of CSI for the same compression
rate. We also propose a distributed version of DeepCMC for a multi-user MIMO
scenario to encode and reconstruct the CSI from multiple users in a distributed
manner. Distributed DeepCMC not only utilizes the inherent CSI structures of a
single MIMO user for compression, but also benefits from the correlations among
the channel matrices of nearby users to further improve the performance in
comparison with DeepCMC. We also propose a reduced-complexity training method
for distributed DeepCMC, allowing to scale it to multiple users, and suggest a
cluster-based distributed DeepCMC approach for practical implementation.

is an extension of CTL with second-order quantification over atomic

parameterising second-order quantifiers with observations. While the

operations due to the need for personalization and the availability of a large
variety of items. While this can be done when there are simplistic assortment
choices to be made, the optimization process becomes difficult when imposing
constraints on the collection of relevant assortments based on insights by
store-managers and historically well-performing assortments. We design fast and
flexible algorithms based on variations of binary search that find the
(approximately) optimal assortment in this difficult regime. In particular, we
revisit the problem of large-scale assortment optimization under the
multinomial logit choice model without any assumptions on the structure of the
feasible assortments. We speed up the comparison steps using advances in
similarity search in the field of information retrieval/machine learning. For
an arbitrary collection of assortments, our algorithms can find a solution in
time that is sub-linear in the number of assortments, and for the simpler case
of cardinality constraints - linear in the number of items (existing methods
are quadratic or worse). Empirical validations using a real world dataset (in
addition to experiments using semi-synthetic data based on the Billion Prices
dataset and several retail transaction datasets) show that our algorithms are
competitive even when the number of items is $\sim 10^5$ ($10\times$ larger
instances than previously studied).

number of entities which changes both between road networks, and over time as
vehicles traverse the network. We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement
Learning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the
structure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of
traffic-controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables
learning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being
trained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new
road networks, traffic distributions, and traffic regimes, with no additional
training and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability
compared to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the
granularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the
lane and the vehicle levels. The proposed method is tested on both road
networks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We compare
IG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific baselines. In

reported to deviate significantly from that in the bulk environment due to the
existence of sub-10nm pores. Though experiments and simulations have measured
the bubble/dew points and sorption isotherms of hydrocarbons confined in both
natural and synthetic nanopores, the confinement effects in terms of the
strength of fluid-pore interactions tuned by surface wettability and chemistry
have received comparably less discussion. More importantly, the underlying
physics of confinement-induced phenomena remain obfuscated. In this work, we
studied the phase behavior and capillary condensation of n-hexane to understand
the effects of confinement at the molecular level. To systematically
investigate the pore effects, we constructed two types of wall confinements;
one is a structureless virtual wall described by the Steele potential and the
other one is an all-atom amorphous silica structure with surface modified by
hydroxyl groups. Our numerical results demonstrated the importance of
fluid-pore interaction, pore size, and pore morphology effects in mediating the
pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) properties of hydrocarbons. The most
remarkable finding of this work was that the saturation pressure predicted from
the van der Waals-type adsorption isothermal loop could be elevated or
suppressed relative to the bulk phase, as illustrated in the graphical
abstract. As the surface energy (i.e., fluid-pore interaction) decreased, the
isothermal vapor pressure increased, indicating a greater preference for the
fluid to exist in the vapor state. Sufficient reduction of the fluid-pore
interactions could even elevate the vapor pressure above that of the bulk
fluid.

(CTR) prediction has been one of the most important tasks in E-commerce.
Although extensive CTR prediction models have been proposed, learning good
representation of items from multimodal features is still less investigated,
considering an item in E-commerce usually contains multiple heterogeneous
modalities. Previous works either concatenate the multiple modality features,
that is equivalent to giving a fixed importance weight to each modality; or
learn dynamic weights of different modalities for different items through
technique like attention mechanism. However, a problem is that there usually
exists common redundant information across multiple modalities. The dynamic
weights of different modalities computed by using the redundant information may
not correctly reflect the different importance of each modality. To address
this, we explore the complementarity and redundancy of modalities by
considering modality-specific and modality-invariant features differently. We
propose a novel Multimodal Adversarial Representation Network (MARN) for the
CTR prediction task. A multimodal attention network first calculates the
weights of multiple modalities for each item according to its modality-specific
features. Then a multimodal adversarial network learns modality-invariant
representations where a double-discriminators strategy is introduced. Finally,
we achieve the multimodal item representations by combining both
modality-specific and modality-invariant representations. We conduct extensive
experiments on both public and industrial datasets, and the proposed method
consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, the approach has been deployed in an operational E-commerce system
and online A/B testing further demonstrates the effectiveness.

strategy is adopted to generate offspring individuals and their fitness is
directly evaluated without training. To enhance the feature processing

  The problem of robot planning is formulated as a rooted min-max cycle cover
