sometimes be reinforced by social interactions. One prime bias in judgment and
decision-making is the human tendency to underestimate large quantities.
Previous research on social influence in estimation tasks has generally focused
on the impact of single estimates on individual and collective accuracy,
showing that randomly sharing estimates does not reduce the underestimation
bias. Here, we test a method of social information sharing that exploits the
known relationship between the true value and the level of underestimation, and
study if it can counteract the underestimation bias. We performed estimation
experiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities twice,
before and after receiving estimates from one or several group members. Our
purpose was threefold: to study (i) whether restructuring the sharing of social
information can reduce the underestimation bias, (ii) how the number of
estimates received affects the sensitivity to social influence and estimation
accuracy, and (iii) the mechanisms underlying the integration of multiple
estimates. Our restructuring of social interactions successfully countered the
underestimation bias. Moreover, we find that sharing more than one estimate
also reduces the underestimation bias. Underlying our results are a human
tendency to herd, to trust larger estimates than one's own more than smaller
estimates, and to follow disparate social information less. Using a
computational modelling approach, we demonstrate that these effects are indeed
key to explain the experimental results. Overall, our results show that
existing knowledge on biases can be used to dampen their negative effects and
boost judgment accuracy, paving the way for combating other cognitive biases
threatening collective systems.

Fe-pyroxene mineralogy of the dust disk to be stable throughout, and very
unusual compared to the ferromagnesian silicates typically found in primordial

Fe-bearing olivines, metal sulfides, and water ice in an initially comet-like
mineral mix and their replacement by Fe-bearing pyroxenes, amorphous pyroxene,

aqueous alteration, or giant hypervelocity impacts as unable to produce the
observed mineralogy. Scenarios involving unusually high Si abundances are at
odds with the normal stellar absorption near-infrared feature strengths for Mg,
Fe, and Si. Models involving intense space weathering of a thin surface patina
via moderate (T < 1300 K) heating and energetic ion sputtering due to a stellar
superflare from the F4V primary are consistent with the observations. The space
weathered patina should be reddened, contain copious amounts of nanophase Fe,

has attention turned to attacks that account for geographic information, which
are extremely common in the real world. The most well known in the media is
gerrymandering, in which district border-lines are changed to increase a
party's chance to win, but a different geographical manipulation involves
influencing the election by selecting the location of polling places, as many
people are not willing to go to any distance to vote. In this paper we initiate
the study of this manipulation. We find that while it is easy to manipulate the
selection of polling places on the line, it becomes difficult already on the
plane or in the case of more than two candidates. Moreover, we show that for
more than two candidates the problem is inapproximable. However, we find a few
restricted cases on the plane where some algorithms perform well. Finally, we
discuss how existing results for standard control actions hold in the
geographic setting, consider additional control actions in the geographic
setting, and suggest directions for future study.

from documents (text) that is built upon the well-studied framework of document
spanners for extracting structured data from text. While previously studied
formalisms for document spanners are mainly based on regular expressions, we
use an extension of context-free grammars, called {extraction grammars}, to
define the new class of context-free spanners. Extraction grammars are simply
context-free grammars extended with variables that capture interval positions
of the document, namely spans. While regular expressions are efficient for
tokenizing and tagging, context-free grammars are also efficient for capturing
structural properties. Indeed, we show that context-free spanners are strictly
more expressive than their regular counterparts. We reason about the expressive
power of our new class and present a pushdown-automata model that captures it.
We show that extraction grammars can be evaluated with polynomial data
complexity. Nevertheless, as the degree of the polynomial depends on the query,
we present an enumeration algorithm for unambiguous extraction grammars that,
after quintic preprocessing, outputs the results sequentially, without
repetitions, with a constant delay between every two consecutive ones.

merging their respective sets of observation data into a decision vector
containing the believed occupancy of each channel. A user can then use this
vector to find a vacant channel for its transmission. We introduce the concept
of nodes sharing these vectors with their peers, who then merge them into
super-decision vectors, allowing each node to better identify and select
transmission channels. We consider fading scenarios that substantially limit
the reliability of the users' observations, unless they cooperate to increase
the trustworthiness of their sensing data. We propose a pseudo-random channel

algorithms. Yet any level of abstraction away from the underlying hardware
incurs overhead. In the era of near-term, noisy, intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) hardware with severely restricted resources, this overhead may be
unjustifiable. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian
simulation ""one level below"" the circuit model, exploiting the underlying
control over qubit interactions available in principle in most quantum hardware
implementations. We then analyse the impact of these techniques under the
standard error model where errors occur per gate, and an error model with a
constant error rate per unit time.
  To quantify the benefits of this approach, we apply it to a canonical
example: time-dynamics simulation of the 2D spin Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive
analytic circuit identities for efficiently synthesising multi-qubit evolutions
from two-qubit interactions. Combined with new error bounds for Trotter product
formulas tailored to the non-asymptotic regime and a careful analysis of error
propagation under the aforementioned per-gate and per-time error models, we
improve upon the previous best methods for Hamiltonian simulation by multiple
orders of magnitude. By our calculations, for a 5$\mathbf\times$5 Fermi-Hubbard
lattice we reduce the circuit depth from 800,160 to 1460 in the per-gate error
model, or the circuit-depth-equivalent to 440 in the per-time error model. This
brings Hamiltonian simulation, previously beyond reach of current hardware for
non-trivial examples, significantly closer to being feasible in the NISQ era.

  the TimeLIME Defect Reduction Tool","11 pages, 7 figures, submitted to FSE",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AI algorithms are being used with increased frequency in SE research and
practice. Such algorithms are usually commissioned and certified using data
from outside the SE domain. Can we assume that such algorithms can be used
''off-the-shelf'' (i.e. with no modifications)? To say that another way, are
there special features of SE problems that suggest a different and better way
to use AI tools?
  To answer these questions, this paper reports experiments with TimeLIME, a
variant of the LIME explanation algorithm from KDD'16. LIME can offer
recommendations on how to change static code attributes in order to reduce the
number of defects in the next software release. That version of LIME used an
internal weighting tool to decide what attributes to include/exclude in those
recommendations. TimeLIME improves on that weighting scheme using the following
SE knowledge: software comes in releases; an implausible change to software is
something that has never been changed in prior releases; so it is better to use
plausible changes, i.e. changes with some precedent in the prior releases. By
restricting recommendations to just the frequently changed attributes, TimeLIME
can produce (a)~dramatically better explanations of what causes defects and
(b)~much better recommendations on how to fix buggy code.
  Apart from these specific results about defect reduction and TimeLIME, the
more general point of this paper is that our community should be more careful
about using off-the-shelf AI tools, without first applying SE knowledge. As
shown here, it may not be a complex matter to apply that knowledge. Further,
once that SE knowledge is applied, this can result in dramatically better
systems.

significant contribution from continuum emission between well separated

hottest plasma present through the continuum shape and emission line strengths.
Assuming a powerlaw emission measure distribution which has a high-temperature
cut-off, we find that the emission is consistent with a thermal spectrum having
a maximum temperature of 12 MK. This implies an effective wind shock velocity
of $900\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, well below the wind terminal speed of
$2250\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. For X-ray emission which forms close to the star,
the speed and X-ray flux are larger than can be easily reconciled with strictly
self-excited line-deshadowing-instability models, suggesting a need for a

Galerkin (DG) method is presented for the simulation of viscous incompressible
flows on unstructured triangular grids in two space dimensions. The staggered
DG scheme defines the discrete pressure on the primal triangular mesh, while
the discrete velocity is defined on a staggered edge-based dual quadrilateral
mesh. In this paper, a new pair of equal-order-interpolation velocity-pressure
finite elements is proposed. On the primary triangular mesh (the pressure
elements) the basis functions are piecewise polynomials of degree $N$ and are
allowed to jump on the boundaries of each triangle. On the dual mesh instead
(the velocity elements), the basis functions consist in the union of piecewise
polynomials of degree $N$ on the two subtriangles that compose each
quadrilateral and are allowed to jump only on the dual element boundaries,
while they are continuous inside. In other words, the basis functions on the
dual mesh are built by continuous finite elements on the subtriangles. This
choice allows the construction of an efficient, quadrature-free and memory
saving algorithm. In our coupled space-time pressure correction formulation for
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, arbitrary high order of accuracy in
time is achieved through the use of time-dependent test and basis functions, in
combination with simple and efficient Picard iterations. Several numerical
tests on classical benchmarks confirm that the proposed method outperforms
existing staggered semi-implicit space-time DG schemes, not only from a
computer memory point of view, but also concerning the computational time.

Early stages usually have more observations with general information
(easier/cheaper to collect), while later stages have fewer observations but
more specific data. This situation can be represented by a dual funnel
structure, in which the sample size decreases from one stage to the other while
the information increases. Training classifiers in this scenario is challenging
since information in the early stages may not contain distinct patterns to
learn (underfitting). In contrast, the small sample size in later stages can
cause overfitting. We address both cases by introducing a framework that
combines adversarial autoencoders (AAE), multi-task learning (MTL), and
multi-label semi-supervised learning (MLSSL). We improve the decoder of the AAE
with an MTL component so it can jointly reconstruct the original input and use
feature nets to predict the features for the next stages. We also introduce a
sequence constraint in the output of an MLSSL classifier to guarantee the

by vacancy diffusion -- it is often unclear whether MPEAs are truly stable, or
effectively stabilized by slow interdiffusion. The considerable composition
space afforded to these alloys makes optimizing for desired properties a
daunting task; theoretical and computational tools are necessary to guide alloy
development. For diffusion, such tools depend on both a knowledge of the
vacancy migration barriers within a given alloy and an understanding of how
these barriers influence vacancy diffusivity. We present a generalized theory
of vacancy diffusion in rugged energy landscapes, paired with Kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations of MPEA vacancy diffusion. The barrier energy statistics are
informed by nudged elastic band calculations in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn

MPEAs is not necessarily sluggish, but can potentially be tuned, and that trap
models are an insufficient explanation for sluggish diffusion in the CoNiCrFeMn

issues due to various non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear
I-V characteristics of the device etc. The non-idealities can have a
detrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational accuracy of
crossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using
analytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent
behavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models
thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy.
  To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality
in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately
captures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. We perform extensive
HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance
combinations. Following that, we train a neural network to learn the transfer
characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional
simulator which includes key architectural facets such as \textit{tiling}, and
\textit{bit-slicing} to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the
classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx
achieves \textit{low} root mean square errors (RMSE) of $0.25$ and $0.7$ for
low and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the
GENIEx errors are $7\times$ and $12.8\times$ better than an analytical model
which can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional
simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate
the degradation in classification accuracy by $\ge 10\%$ on CIFAR-100 and
$3.7\%$ on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.

motion predictions of all agents on the team. Next, HPP uses the prediction
models to propose and evaluate navigation subgoals for completing the

path planning, and heuristic-based baselines on challenging, unseen

the prediction models from sim to real world without any additional

thorough study of return words to bispecial factors of Sturmian sequences.
Using the formula for the critical exponent, we describe all complementary
symmetric Rote sequences with the critical exponent less than or equal to 3,
and we show that there are uncountably many complementary symmetric Rote
sequences with the critical exponent less than the critical exponent of the
Fibonacci sequence. Our study is motivated by a~conjecture on sequences rich in
palindromes formulated by Baranwal and Shallit. Its recent solution by Curie,

AI techniques, the issue on how to refine existing regulation, in order to
enforce that decisions made by automated systems are fair and

that the various existing metrics for fairness are statistically mutually
exclusive and the right choice mostly depends on the use case and the
definition of fairness.
  Recognizing that the solutions for implementing fair AI are not purely
mathematical but require the commitments of the stakeholders to define the
desired nature of fairness, this paper proposes to draft a toolbox which helps
practitioners to ensure fair AI practices. Based on the nature of the
application and the available training data, but also on legal requirements and
ethical, philosophical and cultural dimensions, the toolbox aims to identify
the most appropriate fairness objective. This approach attempts to structure
the complex landscape of fairness metrics and, therefore, makes the different

absence of a silver bullet solution for fair AI, this toolbox intends to
produce the fairest AI systems possible with respect to their local context.

multiple time-frequency RCs into a deep structure. The combination of RNN

variation in the seasonal temperature cycle. However, an often overlooked
feature of the climate seasonal cycle is the semi-annual harmonic, which can
account for a significant portion of the variance of the seasonal cycle and
varies in amplitude and phase across space. Together, the spatial variation in
the annual and semi-annual harmonics can play an important role in driving
processes that are tied to seasonality (e.g., ecological and agricultural
processes). We propose a multivariate spatio-temporal model to quantify the
spatial and temporal change in minimum and maximum temperature seasonal cycles
as a function of the annual and semi-annual harmonics. Our approach captures
spatial dependence, temporal dynamics, and multivariate dependence of these
harmonics through spatially and temporally-varying coefficients. We apply the
model to minimum and maximum temperature over North American for the years 1979

identification of regions experiencing significant changes in minimum and

determine the sources of fundamental and harmonic image degradation with
respect to aberration and reverberation. These simulations are based on Part I
of this two part paper, which established the Fullwave simulation methods to
generate realistic ultrasound images based directly on the first principles of
wave propagation in the human body. The ultasound images are generated based on
the first principles of propagation and reflection and they describe interplay
between distributed aberration and reverberation clutter. Three imaging
scenarios that would not be realizable in vivo are investigated in silico.
First, the ribs were completely removed and replaced with fat. Then, the ribs
were maintained in their anatomically correct configuration to yield a
reference image. Finally the ribs were placed closer together in elevation. The
propagation based B-mode images show that of these three scenarios the second,
anatomically correct configuration, has the best contrast-to-noise ratio. This
is due to two competing effects. First the ribs effectively apodize the
fundamental and harmonic beams by 3-5 dB. This effect alone would predict an
improvement in image quality. However, the B-mode image quality, measured by
the contrast-to-noise ratio degrades by 8%. To explain these changes, it is
shown that a second effect, multiple reverberation, must be taken into account.
A point spread function analysis shows that when the ribs are placed closer
together they generate significantly more reverberation clutter (by 2.4 to 2.9
dB), degrading the image quality even though the beamplot has lower sidelobes.
In this intercostal imaging scenario the effects of the ribs on beam shape and
reverberation are therefore in competition in terms of image quality and there
is an optimal acoustic window that balances them out.

media are computationally intensive due to the constraints arising from the
large size of the domain, which is on the order of hundreds of wavelengths, and
the small size of scatterers, which are much smaller than a wavelength.
Consequently, three dimensional ultrasound imaging simulations are currently
based on models that simplify the propagation physics. Here the full three
dimensional wave physics is simulated with finite differences to generate
ultrasound images of the human body based directly on the first principles of
propagation and backscattering. The Visible Human project, a 3D data set of the
human body that was generated with photographs of 0.33 mm cryosections, is
converted into 3D acoustical maps. A full-wave nonlinear acoustic simulation
tool is used to propagate ultrasound into the liver with a 2D intercostal
ultrasound array in a $93 \times 39 \times 22$ mm domain with $6\times10^8$
points. Imaging metrics, based on the beamplots, root-mean-square phase
aberration, spatial coherence lengths, and contrast-to-noise ratio are used to
characterize the image quality. It is shown that the harmonic image quality is
better than the fundamental image quality due, in part, to a narrower beam
profile. The root-mean-square estimate of aberration after propagation through
the simulated body wall is shown to be low (23.4 ns), consistently with
previous reports of aberration measured experimentally in a human body wall.
The spatial coherence measured at the transducer surface indicates that a
transducer array element size of $<0.81 \lambda$ would be required to fully
sample the acoustic field. These simulated three dimensional ultrasound images
based directly on propagation physics provide a platform to investigate the
sources of image degradation in three dimensions (included in Part II).

\mathcal{E}$ such that every vertex $v$ in $V$ belongs to at least $b_v$ edges
in $C$. Set Multicover is the problem of finding a minimum-cardinality set
multicover. Peleg, Schechtman and Wool conjectured that for any fixed $\Delta$
and $b:=\min_{v\in V}b_{v}$, the problem of \sbmultcov is not approximable
within a ratio less than $\delta:=\Delta-b+1$, unless $\mathcal{P}
=\mathcal{NP}$. Hence it's a challenge to explore for which classes of
hypergraph the conjecture doesn't hold.
  We present a polynomial time algorithm for the Set Multicover problem which
combines a deterministic threshold algorithm with conditioned randomized
rounding steps. Our algorithm yields an approximation ratio of $ \max\left\{
\frac{148}{149}\delta, \left(1- \frac{ (b-1)e^{\frac{\delta}{4}}}{94\ell}
\right)\delta \right\}$. Our result not only improves over the approximation
ratio presented by Srivastav et al (Algorithmica 2016) but it's more general
since we set no restriction on the parameter $\ell$. Moreover we present a
further polynomial time algorithm with an approximation ratio of
$\frac{5}{6}\delta$ for hypergraphs with $\ell\leq (1+\epsilon)\bar{\ell}$ for
any fixed $\epsilon \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]$, where $\bar{\ell}$ is the average
edge size. The analysis of this algorithm relies on matching/covering duality
due to Ray-Chaudhuri (1960), which we convert into an approximative form. The
second performance disprove the conjecture of peleg et al for a large subclass
of hypergraphs.

Osinga","A continuation approach to computing phase resetting curves","23 pages; 7 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase resetting is a common experimental approach to investigating the
behaviour of oscillating neurons. Assuming repeated spiking or bursting, a
phase reset amounts to a brief perturbation that causes a shift in the phase of
this periodic motion. The observed effects not only depend on the strength of
the perturbation, but also on the phase at which it is applied. The
relationship between the change in phase after the perturbation and the
unperturbed old phase, the so-called phase resetting curve, provides
information about the type of neuronal behaviour, although not all effects of
the nature of the perturbation are well understood. In this chapter, we present
a numerical method based on the continuation of a multi-segment boundary value
problem that computes phase resetting curves in ODE models. Our method is able
to deal effectively with phase sensitivity of a system, meaning that it is able
to handle extreme variations in the phase resetting curve, including resets
that are seemingly discontinuous. We illustrate the algorithm with two examples
of planar systems, where we also demonstrate how qualitative changes of a phase
resetting curve can be characterised and understood. A seven-dimensional
example emphasises that our method is not restricted to planar systems, and
illustrates how we can also deal with non-instantaneous, time-varying
perturbations.

complete raw lidar scans into dense depth maps with fine and complete scene
structures. Recent sparse depth completion for lidars only focuses on the lower
scenes and produces irregular estimations on the upper because existing
datasets, such as KITTI, do not provide groundtruth for upper areas. These
areas are considered less important since they are usually sky or trees of less
scene understanding interest. However, we argue that in several driving
scenarios such as large trucks or cars with loads, objects could extend to the
upper parts of scenes. Thus depth maps with structured upper scene estimation
are important for RGBD algorithms. SCADC adopts stereo images that produce
disparities with better scene completeness but are generally less precise than
lidars, to help sparse lidar depth completion. To our knowledge, we are the
first to focus on scene completeness of sparse depth completion. We validate
our SCADC on both depth estimate precision and scene-completeness on KITTI.
Moreover, we experiment on less-explored outdoor RGBD semantic segmentation
with scene completeness-aware D-input to validate our method.

significant advances in the last two decades or so. This has been possible due
to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine
and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new
disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a
faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can
be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical
modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account
simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure
of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous
mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account,
iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and
finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and
the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the
thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we
conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in
the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic
threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of
the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as
vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should
be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the
errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information
in terms of connectivity and age of the population.

attaching GR to supports coupled with naturally occurring internal defects in a

microscopy (CR-AFM) and ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM) approach to
characterise and map with nanoscale spatial resolution GR membrane properties
inaccessible to most conventional scanning probe characterisation techniques.
Using a multi-layer GR plate (membrane) suspended over a round hole we show
that this combined approach allows access to the mechanical properties,
internal structure and attachment geometry of the membrane providing
information about both the supported and suspended regions of the system. We
show that UFM allows the precise geometrical position of the supported

variation of its quality in the contact areas. At the same time, we show that
by mapping the position sensitive frequency and phase response of CR-AFM
response, one can reliably quantify the membrane stiffness, and image the
defects in the suspended area of the membrane. The phase and amplitude of
experimental CR-AFM measurements show excellent agreement with an analytical
model accounting for the resonance of the combined CR-AFM probe-membrane

neutrinos may be detectable in the next generation of neutrino oscillation
experiments and/or neutrino telescopes. If so this opens a new connection
between neutrinoless double beta decays and neutrino physics. We also noted the

Generative Adversarial Networks in a Distillation framework (DiBiGAN), for
synthesizing faces of an identity given that person's features. In order to
effectively address this problem, this work firstly introduces a bijective
metric so that the distance measurement and metric learning process can be
directly adopted in image domain for an image reconstruction task. Secondly, a
distillation process is introduced to maximize the information exploited from
the blackbox face recognition engine. Then a Feature-Conditional Generator
Structure with Exponential Weighting Strategy is presented for a more robust
generator that can synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation. Results on
several benchmarking datasets including CelebA, LFW, AgeDB, CFP-FP against

learning have been successfully applied to generate high-quality motions.
However, existing approaches typically rely on Gaussian distributions to
represent the action policy, which can prematurely commit to suboptimal actions
when solving high-dimensional continuous control problems for
highly-articulated characters. In this paper, to improve the learning
performance of physics-based character controllers, we propose a framework that
considers a particle-based action policy as a substitute for Gaussian policies.
We exploit particle filtering to dynamically explore and discretize the action
space, and track the posterior policy represented as a mixture distribution.
The resulting policy can replace the unimodal Gaussian policy which has been
the staple for character control problems, without changing the underlying
model architecture of the reinforcement learning algorithm used to perform
policy optimization. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on
various motion capture imitation tasks. Baselines using our particle-based
policies achieve better imitation performance and speed of convergence as
compared to corresponding implementations using Gaussians, and are more robust
to external perturbations during character control. Related code is available

graphical models (GGMs) in an online fashion is of interest, due to new
applications in biology, economics and social sciences. The offline version of
the problem, where all the data are a priori available, has led to a number of
methods and associated algorithms involving regularized loss functions.
However, for the online version, there is currently only a single work in the
literature that develops a sequential testing procedure and also studies its
asymptotic false alarm probability and power. The latter test is best suited
for the detection of change points driven by global changes in the structure of
the precision matrix of the GGM, in the sense that many edges are involved.
Nevertheless, in many practical settings the change point is driven by local
changes, in the sense that only a small number of edges exhibit changes. To
that end, we develop a novel test to address this problem that is based on the
$\ell_\infty$ norm of the normalized covariance matrix of an appropriately
selected portion of incoming data. The study of the asymptotic distribution of
the proposed test statistic under the null (no presence of a change point) and
the alternative (presence of a change point) hypotheses requires new technical
tools that examine maxima of graph-dependent Gaussian random variables, and
that of independent interest. It is further shown that these tools lead to the
imposition of mild regularity conditions for key model parameters, instead of
more stringent ones required by leveraging previously used tools in related
problems in the literature. Numerical work on synthetic data illustrates the
good performance of the proposed detection procedure both in terms of
computational and statistical efficiency across numerous experimental settings.

OmniTact is designed to be used as a fingertip for robotic manipulation with
robotic hands, and uses multiple micro-cameras to detect multi-directional
deformations of a gel-based skin. This provides a rich signal from which a
variety of different contact state variables can be inferred using modern image

OmniTact on a challenging robotic control task that requires inserting an
electrical connector into an outlet, as well as a state estimation problem that
is representative of those typically encountered in dexterous robotic
manipulation, where the goal is to infer the angle of contact of a curved
finger pressing against an object. Both tasks are performed using only touch
sensing and deep convolutional neural networks to process images from the
sensor's cameras. We compare with a state-of-the-art tactile sensor that is
only sensitive on one side, as well as a state-of-the-art multi-directional
tactile sensor, and find that OmniTact's combination of high-resolution and

laws with scaling exponents modified from their inertial range values. In local
regions, even within a fully developed turbulent flow, the turbulence is not
isotropic nor scale invariant due to the influence of larger turbulent
structures (or their absence). For this reason, turbulence that is not fully
developed is an important issue which inertial range study can not address. In
the ranges of partially developed turbulence, the flow can be far from
universal, so that standard inertial range turbulence scaling models become
inapplicable. The model proposed here serves as a replacement.Details of the

distribution systems, which at any real-time operation instance decides about
matching -- or delaying the supply of -- flexible loads with available
renewable generation with the objective of maximizing the social welfare of the
exchange in the system. More specifically, two online matching algorithms are
proposed for the following generation-load scenarios: (i) when the mean of
renewable generation is greater than the mean of the flexible load, and (ii)
when the condition (i) is reversed. With the intuition that the performance of
such algorithms degrades with increasing randomness of the supply and demand,
two properties are proposed for assessing the performance of the algorithms.
First property is convergence to optimality (CO) as the underlying randomness
of renewable generation and customer loads goes to zero. The second property is
deviation from optimality, is measured as a function of the standard deviation
of the underlying randomness of renewable generation and customer loads. The
algorithm proposed for the first scenario is shown to satisfy CO and a
deviation from optimal that varies linearly with the variation in the standard
deviation. But the same algorithm is shown to not satisfy CO for the second
scenario. We then show that the algorithm proposed for the second scenario
satisfies CO and a deviation from optimal that varies linearly with the
variation in standard deviation plus an offset.

networks (DNNs). One of the most effective adversarial defense methods is
adversarial training (AT) through minimizing the adversarial risk $R_{adv}$,
which encourages both the benign example $x$ and its adversarially perturbed
neighborhoods within the $\ell_{p}$-ball to be predicted as the ground-truth
label. In this work, we propose a novel defense method, the robust training
(RT), by jointly minimizing two separated risks ($R_{stand}$ and $R_{rob}$),
which is with respect to the benign example and its neighborhoods respectively.
The motivation is to explicitly and jointly enhance the accuracy and the
adversarial robustness. We prove that $R_{adv}$ is upper-bounded by $R_{stand}
+ R_{rob}$, which implies that RT has similar effect as AT. Intuitively,
minimizing the standard risk enforces the benign example to be correctly
predicted, and the robust risk minimization encourages the predictions of the
neighbor examples to be consistent with the prediction of the benign example.
Besides, since $R_{rob}$ is independent of the ground-truth label, RT is
naturally extended to the semi-supervised mode ($i.e.$, SRT), to further
enhance the adversarial robustness. Moreover, we extend the $\ell_{p}$-bounded
neighborhood to a general case, which covers different types of perturbations,
such as the pixel-wise ($i.e.$, $x + \delta$) or the spatial perturbation
($i.e.$, $ AX + b$). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets not only
verify the superiority of the proposed SRT method to state-of-the-art methods
for defensing pixel-wise or spatial perturbations separately, but also
demonstrate its robustness to both perturbations simultaneously. The code for

manipulating its current environment to achieve another environment
configuration. This paper is a step towards this challenge, focusing on the
visual understanding of the task. Our approach trains a deep neural network to
represent images as measurable features that are useful to estimate the
progress (or phase) of a task. The training uses numerous variations of images
of identical tasks when taken under the same phase index. The goal is to make
the network sensitive to differences in task progress but insensitive to the
appearance of the images. To this end, our method builds upon Time-Contrastive
Networks (TCNs) to train a network using only discrete snapshots taken at
different stages of a task. A robot can then solve long-horizon tasks by using
the trained network to identify the progress of the current task and by
iteratively calling a motion planner until the task is solved. We quantify the
granularity achieved by the network in two simulated environments. In the
first, to detect the number of objects in a scene and in the second to measure
the volume of particles in a cup. Our experiments leverage this granularity to
make a mobile robot move a desired number of objects into a storage area and to
control the amount of pouring in a cup.

under the equality assumption that it is identical to the level splitting.
Here, we for the first time reveal that the equality assumption is not valid.
It is the invalidity that results in the relativity and diversity of the strong
coupling characterized by the spectral Rabi-splitting to the measured
subsystems, highly correlated with their dissipative decays. The strong
coupling is easier to be observed from the subsystem with larger decay, and can
be classified into pseudo-, dark-, middle-, and super-strong interaction
regimes. We also suggest a prototype of coupled plasmon-exciton system for
possibly future experiment observations on these novel predictions. Our work
brings new fundamental insight to the light-matter interaction in
nanostructures, which will stimulate further researches in this field.

substitutes utility PV, but slightly less so as additional household batteries

decentralisation and high performance (transaction throughput) for blockchain.
The main challenge of Blockchain sharding systems is how to reach a decision on
a statement among a sub-group (shard) of people while ensuring the whole
population recognises this statement. Namely, the challenge is to prevent an
adversary who does not have the majority of nodes globally but have the
majority of nodes inside a shard. Most Blockchain sharding approaches can only
reach a correct consensus inside a shard with at most $n/3$ evil nodes in a $n$
node system. There is a blockchain sharding approach which can prevent an
incorrect decision to be reached when the adversary does not have $n/2$ nodes
globally. However, the system can be stopped from reaching consensus (become
deadlocked) if the adversary controls a smaller number of nodes.
  In this paper, we present an improved Blockchain sharding approach that can
withstand $n/2$ adversarial nodes and recover from deadlocks. The recovery is
made by dynamically adjusting the number of shards and the shard size. A
performance analysis suggests our approach has a high performance (transaction
throughput) while requiring little bandwidth for synchronisation.

  Text Detection with Graph Convolutional Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new arbitrary-shaped text detection approach named ReLaText by
formulating text detection as a visual relationship detection problem. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of this new formulation, we start from using a
""link"" relationship to address the challenging text-line grouping problem
firstly. The key idea is to decompose text detection into two subproblems,
namely detection of text primitives and prediction of link relationships
between nearby text primitive pairs. Specifically, an anchor-free region
proposal network based text detector is first used to detect text primitives of
different scales from different feature maps of a feature pyramid network, from
which a text primitive graph is constructed by linking each pair of nearby text
primitives detected from a same feature map with an edge. Then, a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) based link relationship prediction module is used
to prune wrongly-linked edges in the text primitive graph to generate a number
of disjoint subgraphs, each representing a detected text instance. As GCN can
effectively leverage context information to improve link prediction accuracy,
our GCN based text-line grouping approach can achieve better text detection
accuracy than previous text-line grouping methods, especially when dealing with
text instances with large inter-character or very small inter-line spacings.
Consequently, the proposed ReLaText achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five public text detection benchmarks, namely RCTW-17, MSRA-TD500, Total-Text,
CTW1500 and DAST1500.

offers unique challenges compared to conventional novel object detection such

distinguishing novel classes from the background. To address these challenges,
we propose a unified any-shot detection model, that can concurrently learn to

class semantics as prototypes for object detection, a formulation that
naturally minimizes knowledge forgetting and mitigates the class-imbalance in

difficult few-shot cases but avoids overfitting on the novel classes to allow

due to selfish behavior of the participants, has been an important area of
research. In this paper, we study this phenomenon in the context of a game
modeling queuing systems: routers compete for servers, where packets that do
not get service will be resent at future rounds, resulting in a system where
the number of packets at each round depends on the success of the routers in
the previous rounds. We model this as an (infinitely) repeated game, where the
system holds a state (number of packets held by each queue) that arises from
the results of the previous round. We assume that routers satisfy the no-regret
condition, e.g. they use learning strategies to identify the server where their
packets get the best service.
  Classical work on repeated games makes the strong assumption that the
subsequent rounds of the repeated games are independent (beyond the influence
on learning from past history). The carryover effect caused by packets
remaining in this system makes learning in our context result in a highly
dependent random process. We analyze this random process and find that if the
capacity of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeable
scheduler to get all packets served even with double the packet arrival rate,
and queues use no-regret learning algorithms, then the expected number of
packets in the queues will remain bounded throughout time, assuming older
packets have priority. This paper is the first to study the effect of selfish
learning in a queuing system, where the learners compete for resources, but
rounds are not all independent: the number of packets to be routed at each
round depends on the success of the routers in the previous rounds.

represent scenarios, familiar from recent events, in which external actors seek
to destabilize communities through sophisticated information warfare tactics
via fake news and bots. In many instances, the intrinsic goals of these efforts
are not necessarily to shift the overall sentiment of the network, but rather
to induce discord. These perturbations diffuse via opinion dynamics on the
underlying network, through mechanisms that have been analyzed and abstracted
through work in computer science and the social sciences. We investigate the
properties of such attacks, considering optimal strategies both for the
adversary seeking to create disagreement and for the entities tasked with
defending the network from attack. We show that for different formulations of
these types of objectives, different regimes of the spectral structure of the
network will limit the adversary's capacity to sow discord; this enables us to
qualitatively describe which networks are most vulnerable against these
perturbations. We then consider the algorithmic task of a network defender to
mitigate these sorts of adversarial attacks by insulating nodes
heterogeneously; we show that, by considering the geometry of this problem,
this optimization task can be efficiently solved via convex programming.
Finally, we generalize these results to allow for two network structures, where
the opinion dynamics process and the measurement of disagreement become
uncoupled, and determine how the adversary's power changes; for instance, this
may arise when opinion dynamics are controlled an online community via social
media, while disagreement is measured along ""real-world"" connections.

modern operations management, such as dynamic pricing, inventory control, and

However, the research on uncertainty quantification on the underlying true
model function (e.g., demand function), a critical problem for practitioners,
has not been well explored. In this paper, using the problem of demand function
prediction in dynamic pricing as the motivating example, we study the problem
of constructing accurate confidence intervals for the demand function. The main
challenge is that sequentially collected data leads to significant
distributional bias in the maximum likelihood estimator or the empirical risk
minimization estimate, making classical statistics approaches such as the
Wald's test no longer valid. We address this challenge by developing a debiased
approach and provide the asymptotic normality guarantee of the debiased
estimator. Based this the debiased estimator, we provide both point-wise and
uniform confidence intervals of the demand function.

  Super-Resolution","This paper is accepted by CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks have exhibited promising performance in image
super-resolution (SR) by learning a nonlinear mapping function from
low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, there are
two underlying limitations to existing SR methods. First, learning the mapping
function from LR to HR images is typically an ill-posed problem, because there
exist infinite HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As a
result, the space of the possible functions can be extremely large, which makes
it hard to find a good solution. Second, the paired LR-HR data may be
unavailable in real-world applications and the underlying degradation method is
often unknown. For such a more general case, existing SR models often incur the
adaptation problem and yield poor performance. To address the above issues, we
propose a dual regression scheme by introducing an additional constraint on LR
data to reduce the space of the possible functions. Specifically, besides the
mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping
estimates the down-sampling kernel and reconstruct LR images, which forms a
closed-loop to provide additional supervision. More critically, since the dual
regression process does not depend on HR images, we can directly learn from LR
images. In this sense, we can easily adapt SR models to real-world data, e.g.,
raw video frames from YouTube. Extensive experiments with paired training data
and unpaired real-world data demonstrate our superiority over existing methods.

enhance these subspace acoustic embeddings with a learnable attention scheme.
To validate the robustness of proposed multi-modal separation model in

folding and multi-grained learning. It first temporally folds the time series
and constructs a two-dimensional matrix as the network input, such that both
the real-time traffic conditions and past traffic patterns are well considered;
then with a series of convolutions over the input matrix, it is able to model
the local temporal dependency and multiscale traffic patterns. In particular,
the global trend of congestion can be addressed at the macroscale; whereas more
details and variations of the congestion can be captured at the microscale.
Experimental results on a real-world urban traffic dataset confirm that folding
time series data into a two-dimensional matrix is effective and PCNN
outperforms the baselines significantly for the task of short-term congestion

demonstrated that the thermodynamic stability of magnetic skyrmions is enhanced

consider three candidates for the carrier qubit: a coherent-state qubit, a

that teleportation with the vacuum-and-single-photon qubit tolerates about 10
times greater photon losses than with the multiphoton qubit of the photon

coherent-state qubit encoding may be even better than the
vacuum-and-single-photon qubit as the carrier when its amplitude is as small as
$\alpha<0.78$. We further point out that the fidelity of the teleported state

probability depends on loss only in the multiphoton qubit to be teleported. Our

propose one uplink-aided high mobility downlink channel estimation scheme for

domain massive MIMO-OTFS signal model along the uplink and adopt the
expectation maximization based variational Bayesian (EM-VB) framework to
recover the uplink channel parameters including the angle, the delay, the
Doppler frequency, and the channel gain for each physical scattering path.
Correspondingly, with the help of the fast Bayesian inference, one low complex
approach is constructed to overcome the bottleneck of the EM-VB. Then, we fully
exploit the angle, delay and Doppler reciprocity between the uplink and the
downlink and reconstruct the angles, the delays, and the Doppler frequencies
for the downlink massive channels at the base station. Furthermore, we examine
the downlink massive MIMO channel estimation over the delay-Doppler-angle
domain. The channel dispersion of the OTFS over the delay-Doppler domain is
carefully analyzed. Various numerical examples are presented to confirm the
validity and robustness of the proposed scheme.

  Implications of the ac field amplitude","10 pages",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a double quantum dot whose energy detuning is controlled by an ac
electric field. We demonstrate an energy configuration for which the ac-induced
current flowing through the double dot directly probes the spin-orbit
anticrossing point for small ac field amplitudes. On the contrary, as the ac
amplitude increases a current antiresonance is formed, and the direct
information about the spin-orbit interaction is lost. This result indicates
that a large ac amplitude is not necessarily advantageous for the spectroscopy
of spin-orbit coupled two-spin states. Moreover, we investigate the ac-induced
current peaks versus the ac amplitude and show a current suppression when the
ac field forms spin blocked states. This effect gives rise to a characteristic
pattern for the current which can be controlled at will by tuning the ac
amplitude. Our results can be explored by performing electronic transport
measurements in the spin blockade regime.

properties (such as monotonicity and submodularity), which naturally lends
itself to a number of real-world domains. We use these properties to our
advantage; first, we show that when agent valuations are matroid rank
functions, a socially optimal (i.e. utilitarian social welfare-maximizing)
allocation that achieves envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) exists and is
computationally tractable. We also prove that the Nash welfare-maximizing and
the leximin allocations both exhibit this fairness/efficiency combination, by
showing that they can be achieved by minimizing any symmetric strictly convex
function over utilitarian optimal outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first valuation function class not subsumed by additive valuations for
which it has been established that an allocation maximizing Nash welfare is
EF1. Moreover, for a subclass of these valuation functions based on maximum
(unweighted) bipartite matching, we show that a leximin allocation can be
computed in polynomial time. Additionally, we explore possible extensions of
our results to fairness criteria other than EF1 as well as to generalizations

downsampled short-time Fourier transform (STFT) are proposed. By controlling
the downsampling factor both in time and frequency, combined with the proposed
selective reassignment and frequency subdivision scheme, one can keep a balance
between efficiency and accuracy according to practical needs. Moreover, the
reconstruction property is available, accomplished by an approximate but direct
inverse formula under downsampling. The effects of parameters on the
concentration, computing efficiency, and reconstruction accuracy are also
investigated quantitatively, followed by a mathematic model of reassignment

emission extends smoothly up to r~400 au. At the radius of the C$^{18}$O dips,
the rotational axis of the outer portion appears to be tilted by ~15 degrees

range of complex control tasks. However, the agent's decision-making process is
generally not transparent. The lack of interpretability hinders the
applicability of RL in safety-critical scenarios. While several methods have
attempted to interpret vision-based RL, most come without detailed explanation
for the agent's behavior. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised
interpretable framework, which can discover interpretable features to enable
easy understanding of RL agents even for non-experts. Specifically, a
self-supervised interpretable network (SSINet) is employed to produce
fine-grained attention masks for highlighting task-relevant information, which
constitutes most evidence for the agent's decisions. We verify and evaluate our
method on several Atari 2600 games as well as Duckietown, which is a
challenging self-driving car simulator environment. The results show that our
method renders empirical evidences about how the agent makes decisions and why
the agent performs well or badly, especially when transferred to novel scenes.
Overall, our method provides valuable insight into the internal decision-making
process of vision-based RL. In addition, our method does not use any external
labelled data, and thus demonstrates the possibility to learn high-quality mask
through a self-supervised manner, which may shed light on new paradigms for
label-free vision learning such as self-supervised segmentation and detection.

different datasets. In this work, we present the Conditional Domain
Normalization (CDN) to bridge the domain gap. CDN is designed to encode
different domain inputs into a shared latent space, where the features from
different domains carry the same domain attribute. To achieve this, we first
disentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from one
domain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to
characterize the corresponding domain attribute information. Then this
domain-vector is used to encode the features from another domain through a
conditional normalization, resulting in different domains' features carrying
the same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages
of an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different
level's representation. In contrast to existing adaptation works that conduct
domain confusion learning on semantic features to remove domain-specific
factors, CDN aligns different domain distributions by modulating the semantic
features of one domain conditioned on the learned domain-vector of another
domain. Extensive experiments show that CDN outperforms existing methods
remarkably on both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation benchmarks,

as a classical atlas-based segmentation problem, where voxel-wise
correspondence from the atlas to the unlabelled data is learned. Subsequently,
segmentation label of the atlas can be transferred to the unlabelled data with
the learned correspondence. However, since ground truth correspondence between
images is usually unavailable, the learning system must be well-supervised to
avoid mode collapse and convergence failure. To overcome this difficulty, we
resort to the forward-backward consistency, which is widely used in
correspondence problems, and additionally learn the backward correspondences
from the warped atlases back to the original atlas. This cycle-correspondence
learning design enables a variety of extra, cycle-consistency-based supervision
signals to make the training process stable, while also boost the performance.
We demonstrate the superiority of our method over both deep learning-based
one-shot segmentation methods and a classical multi-atlas segmentation method

that use a linear minimization oracle, which, for a given vector $p \in

that have a linear convergence rate in a strongly convex case. However, in all
these methods, the dimension of the problem is included in the rate of
convergence, which in modern applications can be very large. In this paper, we
prove that in the strongly convex case, the convergence rate of the conditional
gradient methods in the best case depends on the dimension of the problem $ n $
as $ \widetilde {\Omega} (\sqrt {n}) $. Thus, the conditional gradient methods
may turn out to be ineffective for solving strongly convex optimization
problems of large dimensions. Also, the application of conditional gradient
methods to minimization problems of a quadratic form is considered.
  The effectiveness of the Frank-Wolfe method for solving the quadratic
optimization problem in the convex case on a simplex (PageRank) has already
been proved. This work shows that the use of conditional gradient methods to
solve the minimization problem of a quadratic form in a strongly convex case is
ineffective due to the presence of dimension in the convergence rate of these
methods. Therefore, the Shrinking Conditional Gradient method is considered.
Its difference from the conditional gradient methods is that it uses a modified
linear minimization oracle. The convergence rate of such an algorithm does not
depend on dimension. Using the Shrinking Conditional Gradient method the
complexity of solving the minimization problem of quadratic form on a $ \infty
$-ball is obtained. The resulting evaluation of the method is comparable to the
complexity of the gradient method.

information that spreads faster than the epidemic itself is an unprecedented
phenomenon that has put millions of lives in danger. Mitigating this Infodemic
requires strong health messaging systems that are engaging, vernacular,
scalable, effective and continuously learn the new patterns of misinformation.
  Objective: We created WashKaro, a multi-pronged intervention for mitigating
misinformation through conversational AI, machine translation and natural
language processing. WashKaro provides the right information matched against
WHO guidelines through AI, and delivers it in the right format in local
languages.
  Methods: We theorize (i) an NLP based AI engine that could continuously
incorporate user feedback to improve relevance of information, (ii) bite sized
audio in the local language to improve penetrance in a country with skewed
gender literacy ratios, and (iii) conversational but interactive AI engagement
with users towards an increased health awareness in the community. Results: A
total of 5026 people who downloaded the app during the study window, among
those 1545 were active users. Our study shows that 3.4 times more females
engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of
AI-filtered news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning,
and the prudence of integrated AI chatbot Satya increased thus proving the
usefulness of an mHealth platform to mitigate health misinformation.
  Conclusion: We conclude that a multi-pronged machine learning application
delivering vernacular bite-sized audios and conversational AI is an effective
approach to mitigate health misinformation.

is built to learn the commonalities using the common features of all instances.
Different from the training of conventional boosted tree model, we proposed a
regularization strategy and an early-stopping mechanism to optimize the
multi-task learning process. In stage two, started by fitting the residual
error of the common model, a specific model is constructed with the
task-specific instances to further boost the performance. Experiments on both

main reasons result in such a problem: 1). weak visual cues of heavily occluded
instances can hardly provide sufficient information for accurate detection; 2).
heavily occluded instances are easier to be suppressed by
Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS). To address these two issues, we introduce a
variant of two-stage detectors called PS-RCNN. PS-RCNN first detects
slightly/none occluded objects by an R-CNN module (referred as P-RCNN), and
then suppress the detected instances by human-shaped masks so that the features
of heavily occluded instances can stand out. After that, PS-RCNN utilizes
another R-CNN module specialized in heavily occluded human detection (referred
as S-RCNN) to detect the rest missed objects by P-RCNN. Final results are the
ensemble of the outputs from these two R-CNNs. Moreover, we introduce a High
Resolution RoI Align (HRRA) module to retain as much of fine-grained features
of visible parts of the heavily occluded humans as possible. Our PS-RCNN
significantly improves recall and AP by 4.49% and 2.92% respectively on
CrowdHuman, compared to the baseline. Similar improvements on Widerperson are

In aggregation systems, a central entity (e.g., Uber, Food Panda, Ofo)
aggregates supply (e.g., drivers, delivery personnel) and matches demand to
supply on a continuous basis (sequential decisions). Due to the objective of
the central entity to maximize its profits, individual suppliers get sacrificed
thereby creating incentive for individuals to leave the system. In this paper,
we consider the problem of learning approximate equilibrium solutions (win-win
solutions) in aggregation systems, so that individuals have an incentive to
remain in the aggregation system.
  Unfortunately, such systems have thousands of agents and have to consider
demand uncertainty and the underlying problem is a (Partially Observable)
Stochastic Game. Given the significant complexity of learning or planning in a
stochastic game, we make three key contributions: (a) To exploit
infinitesimally small contribution of each agent and anonymity (reward and
transitions between agents are dependent on agent counts) in interactions, we
represent this as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem that
builds on insights from non-atomic congestion games model; (b) We provide a
novel variance reduction mechanism for moving joint solution towards Nash
Equilibrium that exploits the infinitesimally small contribution of each agent;
and finally (c) We provide detailed results on three different domains to
demonstrate the utility of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art

close to an integral multiple of 180$^\circ$. There are multiple examples of
this in the literature, and our analysis here, of the optical polarization data
from the RoboPol monitoring program, strengthens the evidence by showing that
$n\pi$ rotations occur more frequently than expected by chance. We explain this
with a model consisting of two polarized emission components: a ""jet"" that is
constant in time, and a ""burst"" that is variable. The EVPA of the combination
is $\rm EVPA_{jet}$ at both the beginning and the end of the burst, so the net
rotation across the burst must be $n\pi$. Examples are analyzed on the Stokes
plane, where the winding number for the Stokes vector of the combination gives
the value of $n$. The main conclusion is that the EVPA rotation can be much
larger than the physical rotation of the emission region around the axis of the
jet, but this requires the EVPAs of the jet and the burst to be nearly
orthogonal. A shock-in-jet calculation by Zhang et al. can provide a physical
model for our toy model, and in addition automatically gives the needed
orthogonality. The model is illustrated with data on OJ287 published by
Myserlis et al., and we suggest that the large rapid EVPA rotation seen there
might be a phase effect and not representative of a physical rotation.

we selected spectral atlases observed shortly after the launch of the mission.
One spectral atlas contains an observation of an active region, while the other
is an off-limb quiet Sun region. To minimize the uncertainties of the
diagnostics, we rely only on strong lines and we average the signal over a
spatial area within selected structures. Multiple plasma parameters are
diagnosed, such as the electron density, differential emission measure, and the
non-Maxwellian parameter $\kappa$. To do that, we use a simple, well-converging
iterative scheme based on refining the initial density estimates via the DEM
and $\kappa$. We find that while the quiet Sun spectra are consistent with a
Maxwellian distribution, the coronal loops and moss observed within active
region are strongly non-Maxwellian with $\kappa$ $\lessapprox$ 3. These results
were checked by calculating synthetic ratios using DEMs obtained as a function
of $\kappa$. Ratios predicted using the DEMs assuming $\kappa$-distributions
converged to the ratios observed in the quiet Sun and coronal loops. To our

conventional direct current (DC) electronic transportations (e.g.
metal-to-insulator transitions, bad metal, thermistors), their respective
influences to the alternation current (AC) transport are largely overlooked.
Herein, we demonstrate active regulations in the electronic functionalities of
d-band correlated rare-earth nickelate (ReNiO3) thin films, by simply utilizing
their electronic responses to AC-frequencies (fAC). Assisted by temperature
dependent near edge X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, we discovered
positive temperature dependences in Coulomb viscosity of ReNiO3 that moderates
their AC impedance. Distinguished crosslinking among R(Real)-fAC measured in
nearby temperatures is observed that differs to conventional oxides. It enables
active adjustability in correlated transports of ReNiO3, among NTCR-, TDelta-
and PTCR- thermistors, via fAC from the electronic perspective without varying
materials or device structures. The TDelta-fAC relationship can be further
widely adjusted via Re composition and interfacial strains. The AC-frequency
sensitivity discovered in ReNiO3 brings in a new freedom to regulating and
switching the device working states beyond the present semiconductor
technologies. It opens a new paradigm for enriching novel electronic
applications catering automatic transmission or artificial intelligence in
sensing temperatures and frequencies.

analysis has also fueled the development of Koopman operator-based control
frameworks. In order to preserve the relatively low data requirements for an
approximation via Dynamic Mode Decomposition, a quantization approach was
recently proposed in [Peitz \& Klus, Automatica 106, 2019]. This way, control
of nonlinear dynamical systems can be realized by means of switched systems
techniques, using only a finite set of autonomous Koopman operator-based
reduced models. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently
from data. The main idea is to transform a control system into a set of
autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed.
In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using
relaxation. This way, we combine the advantages of the data efficiency of
approximating a finite set of autonomous systems with continuous controls. We
show that when using the Koopman generator, this relaxation --- realized by
linear interpolation between two operators --- does not introduce any error for
control affine systems. This allows us to control high-dimensional nonlinear
systems using bilinear, low-dimensional surrogate models. The efficiency of the
proposed approach is demonstrated using several examples with increasing
complexity, from the Duffing oscillator to the chaotic fluidic pinball.

differential genetic variations between these disorders may reveal how the
disorders differ biologically and help to guide more personalized treatment.
  Here we presented a comprehensive analysis to identify genetic markers
differentially associated with various psychiatric disorders/traits based on
GWAS summary statistics, covering 18 psychiatric traits/disorders and 26
comparisons. We also conducted comprehensive analysis to unravel the genes,
pathways and SNP functional categories involved, and the cell types and tissues
implicated. We also assessed how well one could distinguish between psychiatric
disorders by polygenic risk scores (PRS).
  SNP-based heritabilities (h2SNP) were significantly larger than zero for most
comparisons. Based on current GWAS data, PRS have mostly modest power to
distinguish between psychiatric disorders. For example, we estimated that AUC
for distinguishing schizophrenia from major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar
disorder (BPD) from MDD and schizophrenia from BPD were 0.694, 0.602 and 0.618
respectively, while the maximum AUC (based on h2SNP) were 0.763, 0.749 and
0.726 respectively. We also uncovered differences in each pair of studied
traits in terms of their differences in genetic correlation with comorbid
traits. For example, clinically-defined MDD appeared to more strongly
genetically correlated with other psychiatric disorders and heart disease, when
compared to non-clinically-defined depression in UK Biobank.
  Our findings highlight genetic differences between psychiatric disorders and

endeavors have failed to identify any such states. To remedy this discrepancy
between QCD, which has proven to be a successful theory for strong
interactions, and the failure of experimental searches for glueballs, one is
tempted to accept the promising interpretation that the glueballs mix with
regular $q\bar q$ states of the same quantum numbers. The lattice estimate of
the masses of pure $0^{++}$ glueballs ranges from 1 to 2 GeV, which is the
region of the $f_0$ family. Thus many authors suggest that the $f_0$ mesonic
series is an ideal place to study possible mixtures of glueballs and $q\bar q$.
In this paper, following the strategy proposed by Close, Farrar and Li, we try
to determine the fraction of glueball components in $f_0$ mesons using the
measured mass spectra and the branching ratios of $J/\psi$ radiative decays
into $f_0$ mesons. Since the pioneering papers by Close et al., more than 20
years has elapsed and more accurate measurements have been done by several
experimental collaborations, so it is time to revisit this interesting topic
using new data. We suppose $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ to be pure quark states,
while for $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$, to fit both the
experimental data of $J/\psi$ radiative decay and their mass spectra, glueball
components are needed. Moreover, the mass of the pure $0^{++}$ glueball is
phenomenologically determined.

paper proposes a novel framework with INformation FUsion and Neighborhood

component, a novel graph neural network, to produce adaptive neighborhood
embeddings that reflect the overlapping degree of neighborhoods of varying
candidate user pairs. The importance of node embeddings and neighborhood
embeddings are weighted for final prediction. The proposed method is evaluated

from indistinguishable fermions to distinguishable qubits. The non-local
structure of fermionic Fock space necessitates encodings that either map local
fermionic operators to non-local qubit operators, or encode the fermionic
representation in a long-range entangled code space. In this latter case, there
is an unavoidable trade-off between two desirable properties of the encoding:
low weight representations of local fermionic operators, and a high distance
code space. Here it is argued that despite this fundamental limitation,
fermionic encodings with low-weight representations of local fermionic
operators can still exhibit error mitigating properties which can serve a
similar role to that played by high code distances. In particular when
undetectable errors correspond to ""natural"" fermionic noise. We illustrate this
point explicitly for two fermionic encodings: the Verstraete-Cirac encoding,
and an encoding appearing in concurrent work by Derby and Klassen. In these
encodings many, but not all, single-qubit errors can be detected. However we
show that the remaining undetectable single-qubit errors map to local,
low-weight fermionic phase noise. We argue that such noise is natural for
fermionic lattice models. This suggests that even when employing low-weight
fermionic encodings, error rates can be suppressed in a similar fashion to high
distance codes, provided one is willing to accept simulated natural fermionic
noise in their simulated fermionic system.

kinetic terms, whose coefficients are in general arbitrary functions of LL and
diffeomorphism invariants. In particular, all the kinetic terms are prohibited

kinetic terms, including those of the LL gauge field and the vierbein, are

Tier solutions address the digital assets registration, transactions, data

peer-to-peer networks, ledger replication, and consensus-based state
validation. Scaling Tier solutions address the scalability problems in terms of

network models in real applications. In this paper, an explainable neural
network based on generalized additive models with structured interactions
(GAMI-Net) is proposed to pursue a good balance between prediction accuracy and
model interpretability. GAMI-Net is a disentangled feedforward network with
multiple additive subnetworks; each subnetwork consists of multiple hidden
layers and is designed for capturing one main effect or one pairwise
interaction. Three interpretability aspects are further considered, including
a) sparsity, to select the most significant effects for parsimonious
representations; b) heredity, a pairwise interaction could only be included
when at least one of its parent main effects exists; and c) marginal clarity,
to make main effects and pairwise interactions mutually distinguishable. An
adaptive training algorithm is developed, where main effects are first trained
and then pairwise interactions are fitted to the residuals. Numerical
experiments on both synthetic functions and real-world datasets show that the
proposed model enjoys superior interpretability and it maintains competitive
prediction accuracy in comparison to the explainable boosting machine and other
classic machine learning models.

around the world while users may be unaware of the risks associated with owning
these devices. Previous work showed that these devices can threaten
individuals' privacy and security by exposing information online to a large

shows that many of these Internet connections (and the information they expose)
are neither critical, nor even essential to the operation of these devices.
However, automatically separating out critical from non-critical network
traffic for an IoT device is nontrivial, and requires expert analysis based on
manual experimentation in a controlled setting. In this paper, we investigate
whether it is possible to automatically classify network traffic destinations
as either critical (essential for devices to function properly) or not, hence
allowing the home gateway to act as a selective firewall to block undesired,
non-critical destinations. Our initial results demonstrate that some IoT
devices contact destinations that are not critical to their operation, and
there is no impact on device functionality if these destinations are blocked.
We take the first steps towards designing and evaluating IoTrimmer, a framework
for automated testing and analysis of various destinations contacted by
devices, and selectively blocking the ones that do not impact device
functionality.

Identifying the same target vehicle in large datasets from non-overlapping

technology is a challenging task since vehicles of the same design or
manufacturer show similar appearance. To fill these gaps, we tackle this
challenge by proposing Triplet Center Loss based Part-aware Model (TCPM) that
leverages the discriminative features in part details of vehicles to refine the
accuracy of vehicle re-identification. TCPM base on part discovery is that
partitions the vehicle from horizontal and vertical directions to strengthen
the details of the vehicle and reinforce the internal consistency of the parts.
In addition, to eliminate intra-class differences in local regions of the
vehicle, we propose external memory modules to emphasize the consistency of
each part to learn the discriminating features, which forms a global dictionary
over all categories in dataset. In TCPM, triplet-center loss is introduced to
ensure each part of vehicle features extracted has intra-class consistency and
inter-class separability. Experimental results show that our proposed TCPM has
an enormous preference over the existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets VehicleID and VeRi-776.

topological phase boundary of the system is identical to that of Haldane model
of graphene but the phase diagram is richer than the latter due to existence of
a distorted flat band. The system supports phases which have a ""gapped-out""
valence (conduction) band and an indirect overlap between the conduction
(valence) band and the distorted flat band. The overlap of bands imparts
metallic character to the system. These phases may be further divided into
topologically trivial and nontrivial ones depending on the Chern number of the
""gapped-out"" band. The semimetallic phases exist as distinct points that are
well separated from each other in the phase diagram and exhibit spin-1
Dirac-Weyl dispersion at low energies. The Chern numbers of the bands in the
Chern-insulating phases are $0$ and $\pm2$. This qualifies the system to be
candidate for quantum anomalous Hall effect with two chiral channels per edge.
Counterpropagating edge states emanate from the flat band in certain
topologically trivial phases. The system displays beating pattern in Shubnikov
de Haas oscillations for unequal magnitude of mass terms in the two valleys. We

and technology, but improving the spin-phonon as well as the spin-spin
couplings of such systems remains a crucial challenge. Here, we propose and
analyze an experimentally feasible and simple method for exponentially
enhancing the spin-phonon, and the phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions in a
hybrid spin-mechanical setup, using only \emph{ linear resources}. Through
modulating the spring constant of the mechanical cantilever with a
time-dependent pump, we can acquire a tunable and nonlinear (two-phonon) drive
to the mechanical mode, thus amplifying the mechanical zero-point fluctuations
and directly enhancing the spin-phonon coupling. Our method allows the
spin-mechanical system to be driven from the weak-coupling regime to the
strong-coupling regime, and even the ultrastrong coupling regime. In the
dispersive regime, this method gives rise to a large enhancement of the
phonon-mediated spin-spin interaction between distant solid-state spins,
typically\emph{two orders of magnitude larger} than that without modulation. As
an example, we show that the proposed scheme can apply to generating entangled
states of multiple spins with high fidelities even in the presence of large
dissipations.

that the center of mass motion follows: $\langle x^2_c(t) \rangle \sim

$\langle x^2_c(t) \rangle \sim \dot{\gamma}^2t^3 ~(\alpha = 1)$. Motion of the
relative coordinate, on the other hand, is quite intriguing in that $\langle
x^2_r(t) \rangle \sim t^\beta$ with $\beta = 2(1-\alpha)$ for small $\alpha$.
This implies nonexistence of the steady state. We remedy this pathology by
introducing a nonlinear spring with FENE-LJ interaction and study tumbling
dynamics of the dumbbell. The overall effect of viscoelasticity is to slow down
the dynamics in the experimentally observed ranges of the Weissenberg number.
We numerically obtain the characteristic time of tumbling and show that small
changes in $\alpha$ result in large changes in tumbling times.

of the convective term, and adaptive time-stepping. The Navier-Stokes equations
with ALE transport term are solved on the deformed geometry storing one
instance of the mesh that is updated from one time step to the next.
Discretization in space is applied to the time discrete equations so that all
weak forms and mass matrices are evaluated at the end of the current time step.
This design ensures that the proposed formulations fulfill the geometric
conservation law automatically, as is shown theoretically and demonstrated
numerically by the example of the free-stream preservation test. We discuss the
peculiarities related to the imposition of boundary conditions in intermediate
steps of projection-type methods and the ingredients needed to preserve
high-order accuracy. We show numerically that the formulations proposed in this

it has been conjectured that any consistent effective field theory should keep
TP modes `hidden' behind the Hubble horizon, so as to prevent them from turning
classical and thereby affecting macroscopic observations. In this paper we
present two arguments against the Hubble horizon being a scale of singular
significance as has been put forward in the TP Censorship Conjecture (TCC).
First, refinements of TCC are presented that allow for the TP modes to grow
beyond the horizon while still keeping the de-Sitter conjecture valid. Second,
we show that TP modes can turn classical even well within the Hubble horizon,
which, as such, negates this rationale behind keeping them from crossing it.
The role of TP modes is known to be less of a problem in warm inflation,
because fluctuations start out usually as classical. This allows warm inflation
to be more resilient to the TP problem compared to cold inflation. To
understand how robust this is, we identity limits where quantum modes can
affect the primordial power spectrum in one specific case.

subject to an intractable likelihood if the observables and observations span a
high-dimensional input space. Typically the problem is solved by reducing the
dimensionality using feature engineering and histograms, whereby the latter
technique allows to build the likelihood using Poisson statistics. However, in
the presence of systematic uncertainties represented by nuisance parameters in
the likelihood, the optimal dimensionality reduction with a minimal loss of
information about the parameters of interest is not known. This work presents a
novel strategy to construct the dimensionality reduction with neural networks
for feature engineering and a differential formulation of histograms so that
the full workflow can be optimized with the result of the statistical
inference, e.g., the variance of a parameter of interest, as objective. We
discuss how this approach results in an estimate of the parameters of interest
that is close to optimal and the applicability of the technique is demonstrated
with a simple example based on pseudo-experiments and a more complex example
from high-energy particle physics.

abundances of SDSS$J$142947, a Green Pea galaxy at redshift z$\sim$0.17 with
strong, double-peak Ly$\alpha$ emission and indirect evidence of Lyman
continuum (LyC) leakage. Using high-dispersion spectroscopy, we perform a
multi-component analysis of emission-line profiles. Our model consistently fits
all lines as a narrow component with intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma
\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$, and two broader blue-shifted components with $\sigma
\sim$90 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$250 km s$^{-1}$. We find electron densities and
temperatures, ionisation conditions, and direct O/H and N/O abundances for each
component. A highly ionised, metal-poor, young and compact starburst dominates
narrow emission, showing evidence of hard radiation fields and elevated N/O.
The blue-shifted broader components are consistent with highly turbulent,
possibly clumpy ionised gas at the base of a strong photoionised outflow, which
accounts for $\gtrsim$50% of the integrated emission-line fluxes. The outflow
is dense and metal-enriched compared to the HII regions, with expansion
velocities larger than those obtained from UV interstellar absorption lines
under standard assumptions. Some of these metals may be able to escape, with
outflows loading factors comparable to those found in high-$z$ galaxies of
similar SFR/Area. Our findings depict a two-stage starburst picture; hard
radiation fields from young star clusters illuminate a turbulent and clumpy ISM
that has been eroded by SNe feedback. While UV data suggest an extended
Ly$\alpha$ halo with high average HI column density, LyC photons could only
escape from SDSS$J$142947 through low HI density channels or filaments in the
ISM approaching density-bounded conditions, traced by outflowing gas.

Ly$\alpha$ lines of Ca and Fe. The line flux images of W49B indicate high
emission measures of the central bar-like region for almost all the emission
lines, while the equivalent width maps reveal a stratified structure for the
metal abundance distributions. The global spectrum of W49B is well reproduced
by a model containing one collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma
component and two recombining plasma (RP) components. The CIE plasma represents
the shocked interstellar medium, which dominates the X-ray emitting volume in
W49B with a mass $\sim450M_\odot$. The two RP components with a total mass
$\sim4.6M_\odot$ are both dominated by the ejecta material, but characterized
by different electron temperatures ($\sim1.60$ keV and $\sim0.64$ keV). The
recombination ages of the RP components are estimated as $\sim6000$ yr and
$\sim3400$ yr, respectively. We then reveal the possibility of a thermal
conduction origin for the high-temperature RP in W49B by calculating the
conduction timescale. The metal abundance ratios of the ejecta in W49B are
roughly consistent with a core-collapse explosion model with a
$\lesssim15M_\odot$ progenitor, except for a rather high Mn/Fe. A Type Ia

for positioning. Second, we formulate a WiFi-inertial sensor fusion model that
fuses the AoA and the odometry measured by inertial sensors to optimize MAV
poses. Considering the practicality of MAVs, our system is designed to be
real-time and initialization-free for the need of agile flight in unknown

of pose estimation with the position error of $61.7$ cm and the attitude error

  Stochastic Model Predictive Control","Submitted as Contributed Paper to IFAC2020 Congress",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a stochastic Model Predictive Control able to
account for effects of additive stochastic disturbance with unbounded support,
and requiring no restrictive assumption on either independence nor Gaussianity.
We revisit the rather classical approach based on penalty functions, with the
aim of designing a control scheme that meets some given probabilistic
specifications. The main difference with previous approaches is that we do not
recur to the notion of probabilistic recursive feasibility, and hence we do not
consider separately the unfeasible case. In particular, two probabilistic
design problems are envisioned. The first randomization problem aims to design
\textit{offline} the constraint set tightening, following an approach inherited
from tube-based MPC. For the second probabilistic scheme, a specific
probabilistic validation approach is exploited for tuning the penalty
parameter, to be selected \textit{offline} among a finite-family of possible
values. The simple algorithm here proposed allows designing a \textit{single}
controller, always guaranteeing feasibility of the online optimization problem.
The proposed method is shown to be more computationally tractable than previous
schemes. This is due to the fact that the sample complexity for both
probabilistic design problems depends on the prediction horizon in a
logarithmic way, unlike scenario-based approaches which exhibit linear
dependence. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a
numerical example.

that can benefit from better understanding the laws of nature that are expected
to hold in regimes currently inaccessible to experiment. Such fundamental laws
can be found by considering the classical counterparts of a quantum theory. For
example, conservation laws in a quantum theory often stem from conservation
laws of the corresponding classical theory. In order to construct such laws,
this thesis is concerned with the interplay between symmetries and conservation
laws of classical field theories and their application to asymptotically flat
spacetimes.
  This work begins with an explanation of symmetries in field theories with a
focus on variational symmetries and their associated conservation laws.
Boundary conditions for general relativity are then formulated on
three-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes at null infinity using the
method of conformal completion. Conserved quantities related to asymptotic
symmetry transformations are derived and their properties are studied. This is
done in a manifestly coordinate independent manner. In a separate step a
coordinate system is introduced, such that the results can be compared to
existing literature. Next, asymptotically flat spacetimes which contain both
future as well as past null infinity are considered. Asymptotic symmetries
occurring at these disjoint regions of three-dimensional asymptotically flat
spacetimes are linked and the corresponding conserved quantities are matched.
Finally, it is shown how asymptotic symmetries lead to the notion of distinct
Minkowski spaces that can be differentiated by conserved quantities.

effects of a mechanical pre-stress applied on its lateral faces and an electric
field applied through its thickness under charge control. The electric field is
created by spraying charges on the major faces of the plate: although in
practice this mode of actuation is harder to achieve than a voltage-driven
deformation, here we find that it turns out to be much more stable in theory
and in simulations.
  First we show that the electromechanical instability based on the Hessian
criterion associated with the free energy of the system does not occur at all
for charge-driven dielectrics for which the electric displacement is linear in
the electric field. Then we show that the geometric instability associated with
the formation of small-amplitude wrinkles on the faces of the plate that arises
under voltage control does not occur either under charge control. This is in
complete contrast to voltage-control actuation, where Hessian and wrinkling
instabilities can occur once certain critical voltages are reached.
  For the mechanical pre-stresses, two modes that can be implemented in
practice are used: equi-biaxial and uni-axial. We confirm the analytical and
numerical stability results of homogeneous deformation modes with Finite
Element simulations of real actuations, where inhomogeneous fields may develop.
We find complete agreement in the equi-biaxial case, and very close agreement
in the uni-axial case, when the pre-stress is due to a dead-load weight. In the
latter case, the simulations show that small inhomogeneous effects develop near
the clamps, and eventually a compressive lateral stress emerges, leading to a
breakdown of the numerics.

lack of an objective and commonly accepted quality measure for heatmaps, it was
debatable which XAI method performs best and whether explanations can be
trusted at all. In the present work, we tackle the problem by proposing a
ground truth based evaluation framework for XAI methods based on the CLEVR
visual question answering task. Our framework provides a (1) selective, (2)
controlled and (3) realistic testbed for the evaluation of neural network
explanations. We compare ten different explanation methods, resulting in new
insights about the quality and properties of XAI methods, sometimes
contradicting with conclusions from previous comparative studies. The CLEVR-XAI

in VO2 films, and the lines' performance are characterized up to 50 GHz. The
measured results are used to develop a transmission-line based model and an

a tunable dipole from 2.13 to 9.07 GHz and a tunable triple-stub matching

traditional access control models have become inadequate in terms of capturing

  In this paper, we present a methodology for automatically learning ABAC

process. The proposed approach employs an unsupervised learning-based algorithm
for detecting patterns in access logs and extracting ABAC authorization rules

the bulk spin Hall effect in the Pt layer, a sizable damping-like torque is
generated by the interface in the Pt/Fe bilayer due to the stronger interfacial
spin-orbit coupling. In contrast to the damping-like torque, whose magnitude

torque strongly depends on the choice of the ferromagnetic layer. The sign of
the field-like torque originating from the bulk spin Hall effect in the Pt

ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

control of displacement and velocity are constructively proposed into an

subject to colored noise and the periodic excitation. Using the improved
stochastic averaging procedure based on energy-dependent frequency, the
expressions of stationary probability density (SPD) and signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are obtained analytically. Then, the efficiency of time-delayed feedback
control on the stationary response and stochastic resonance (SR) for the
delay-controlled VEH is explored in detail theoretically. Results show that
both noise-induced SR and delay-induced SR can occur. Time delay is able to not
only enhance the SR behavior but also weaken it. Furthermore, a larger negative
feedback gain of displacement and a larger positive feedback gain of velocity
are more beneficial for VEH. Interesting finding is that the optimal
combination of time delay in maximizing the harvested performance, such as the
harvest power, the output RMS voltage and the power conversion efficiency, is
almost perfectly consistent with that in maximizing SNR. Compared with the
uncontrolled VEH, the delay-controlled VEH can achieve certain desirable
optimization in harvesting energy by choosing the appropriate combination of
time delays and feedback gains.

network flows and topology and assess their impact into individual traces.
Discrete flow-based descriptors are used to classify and understand human
mobility patterns at multiple scales. This framework is suitable to assess
urban planning, optimize transportation, measure the impact of external events
and conditions, monitor internal dynamics and profile users according to their

Conversely, when electron-positron annihilation process is inactive,
thermalization process in such degenerate plasma is strongly affected by Pauli
blocking. This is possible either in a nonrelativistic plasma, with equilibrium
temperature $k_B T\leq 0.3 m_e c^2$, or in photon-electron plasma. In these
cases all reaction rates are strongly suppressed by Pauli blocking and
thermalization does not occur until electrons can populate energy states above
the Fermi energy. Soon after this happens thermalization proceeds suddenly in
an avalanche-like process.

companions (WD+AFGK binaries) to refine our understanding about compact binary
evolution and the nature of Supernova Ia progenitors. These close WD+AFGK
binary stars are expected to form through common envelope evolution, in which
tidal forces tend to circularize the orbit. However, some of the identified
WD+AFGK binary candidates show eccentric orbits, indicating that these systems
are either formed through a different mechanism or perhaps they are not close
WD+AFGK binaries. We observed one of these eccentric WD+AFGK binaries with
SPHERE and find that the system TYC 7218-934-1 is in fact a triple system where
the WD is a distant companion. The inner binary likely consists of the G-type
star plus an unseen low mass companion in an eccentric orbit. Based on this
finding, we estimate the fraction of triple systems that could contaminate the
WD+AFGK sample. We find that less than 15 per cent of our targets with orbital
periods shorter than 100 days might be hierarchical triples.

shock fronts traveling at relativistic speeds. While the basic concepts of
shock formation and particle acceleration in their vicinity are known, many
details on a micro-physical scope are still under discussion. In recent years
the hybrid kinetic simulation approach has allowed to study the dynamics and
acceleration of protons and heavier ions in great detail. However,
Particle-in-Cell codes allow to study the process including also electron
dynamics and the radiation pressure. Additionally a further numerical method
allows for crosschecking results. We therefore investigate shock formation and
particle acceleration with a fully kinetic particle-in-cell code. Besides
electrons and protons we also include helium and carbon ions in our simulations
of a quasi-parallel shock. We are able to reproduce characteristic features of
the energy spectra of the particles, such as the temperature ratios of the
different ion species in the downstream which scale with the ratio of particle
mass to charge. We also find that approximately 12-15% of the energy of the
unperturbed upstream is transferred to the accelerated particles escaping the
shock.

problem of pseudo-focusing of low energy protons from the mirrors towards the
focal plane. Those protons constitute a variable, unpredictable component of
the non X-ray background that strongly affects astronomical observations and a
correct estimation of their flux at the focal plane is then essential. For this
reason, we investigate how they are scattered from the mirror surfaces when
impacting with grazing angles. We compare the non-elastic model of reflectivity
of particles at grazing incidence proposed by Remizovich et al. (1980) with the
few available experimental measurements of proton scattering from X-ray
mirrors. We develop a semi-empirical analytical model based on the fit of those
experimental data with the Remizovich solution. We conclude that the scattering
probability weakly depends on the energy of the impinging protons and that the
relative energy losses are necessary to correctly model the data. The model we
propose assumes no dependence on the incident energy and can be implemented in
particle transport simulation codes to generate, for instance, proton response
matrices for specific X-ray missions. Further laboratory measurements at lower
energies and on other mirror samples, such as ATHENA Silicon Pore Optics, will
improve the resolution of the model and will allow us to build the proper
proton response matrices for a wider sample of X-ray observatories.

Petabyte scale for SKA. Modern proximal optimization algorithms have shown a
potential to significantly outperform CLEAN thanks to their ability to inject
complex image models to regularize the inverse problem for image formation from
visibility data. They were also shown to be parallelizable over large data
volumes thanks to a splitting functionality enabling the decomposition of the
data into blocks, for parallel processing of block-specific data-fidelity terms
involved in the objective function. Focusing on intensity imaging, the
splitting functionality is further exploited in this work to decompose the
image cube into spatio-spectral facets, and enable parallel processing of
facet-specific regularization terms in the objective function, leading to the
""Faceted HyperSARA"" algorithm. Reliable heuristics enabling an automatic
setting of the regularization parameters involved in the objective are also
introduced, based on estimates of the noise level, transferred from the
visibility domain to the domains where the regularization is applied.
Simulation results based on a MATLAB implementation and involving synthetic
image cubes and data close to Gigabyte size confirm that faceting can provide a
major increase in parallelization capability when compared to the non-faceted
approach (HyperSARA).

Proper Orthogonal Decomposition applied to a series of snapshots of the

proposed, with interpolation taking place on the reduced coefficient matrix
mapping local bases to a global one. We demonstrate the performance of this

to model Nitrogen c(2x2) Atom islands on Cu(001). Oscillating interactions
between adatom monomers or dimers are considered. Attractive pair interactions
of adatoms are able to describe agglomeration but fail to explain the size of
islands. Multisite interactions created by dimers, however, can explain the
size of islands if an interaction parameter is adjusted properly. Finite size
islands are formed when repulsive monomer interactions are balanced by
attractive monomer-dimer interactions. A simple model of nearest neighbour
attraction and s-3 repulsion is used as an example for the interaction
parameter search. Previous experimental studies have shown that in the low
coverage region Nitrogen atoms agglomerate to isolated square islands of about
5 nm x 5 nm size with a c(2x2) structure. With increasing coverage those
islands form regular patterns but do not touch below about 0.4 monolayers.
Previous experiments and calculations have shown that the square island pattern
show significant elastic effects. Different adatom structures within the
Nitrogen islands have been analyzed, a dimer step model is able to reproduce
the experimentally found island size. This model requires a molecular bond
between dimers formed by Nitrogen adatoms. The model is also used to compute
elastic interactions between islands and to check it against the experimentally
found island pattern. Shortcomings and limitations of the model are discussed
and open questions are formulated.

been in search of an objective method for assessing fabric hand, which can then
be used to engineer fabrics with a desired hand. Recognizing textures and

recognition and scene understanding. In this paper, we explore how to
computationally characterize apparent or latent properties (e.g., surface
smoothness) of materials, i.e., computational material surface
characterization, which moves a step further beyond material recognition. We
formulate the problem as a very fine-grained texture classification problem,
and study how deep learning-based texture representation techniques can help
tackle the task. We introduce a new, large-scale challenging microscopic
material surface dataset (CoMMonS), geared towards an automated fabric quality
assessment mechanism in an intelligent manufacturing system. We then conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods for
texture classification using CoMMonS. Additionally, we propose a multi-level
texture encoding and representation network (MuLTER), which simultaneously
leverages low- and high-level features to maintain both texture details and
spatial information in the texture representation. Our results show that, in
comparison with the state-of-the-art deep texture descriptors, MuLTER yields
higher accuracy not only on our CoMMonS dataset for material characterization,
but also on established datasets such as MINC-2500 and GTOS-mobile for material

In existing studies, a common approach to next location prediction is to learn
the sequential transitions with massive historical trajectories based on
conditional probability. Unfortunately, due to the time and space complexity,
these methods (e.g., Markov models) only use the just passed locations to
predict next locations, without considering all the passed locations in the
trajectory. In this paper, we seek to enhance the prediction performance by
considering the travel time from all the passed locations in the query
trajectory to a candidate next location. In particular, we propose a novel
method, called Travel Time Difference Model (TTDM), which exploits the
difference between the shortest travel time and the actual travel time to
predict next locations. Further, we integrate the TTDM with a Markov model via
a linear interpolation to yield a joint model, which computes the probability
of reaching each possible next location and returns the top-rankings as
results. We have conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets: the
vehicle passage record (VPR) data and the taxi trajectory data. The
experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction
accuracy over existing solutions. For example, compared with the Markov model,
the top-1 accuracy improves by 40% on the VPR data and by 15.6% on the Taxi

interactions for the case of generic one-dimensional photonic baths under the
typical assumptions, that are, having finite range hoppings for the photonic
bath plus local and rotating-wave light-matter couplings. In that case, we show
how, irrespective of the system's parameter, the coherent photon-mediated
interactions can always be written as a finite sum of exponentials, and thus
can not display a power-law asymptotic scaling. As an outlook, we show how by
relaxing some of these conditions, e.g., going beyond local light-matter
couplings (e.g., giant atoms) or with longer-range photon hopping models,
power-law interactions can be obtained within certain distance windows, or even
in the asymptotic regime for the latter case.

study the kinematics, dynamics, and brightness of the quasi-stationary feature
of the jet in BL Lacertae based on VLBA monitoring with submilliarcsecond
resolution (subparsec-scales) over 17 years. Methods. We analysed position
uncertainties and flux leakage effects of the innermost quasi-stationary
feature and developed statistical tools to distinguish the motions of the
stationary feature and the radio core. We constructed a toy model to simulate
the observed emission of the quasi-stationary component. Results. We find that
trajectories of the quasi-stationary component are aligned along the jet axis,
which can be interpreted as evidence of the displacements of the radio core.
The intrinsic motions of the core and quasi-stationary component have a
commensurate contribution to the apparent motion of the stationary component.
During the jet-stable state, the core shift significantly influences the
apparent displacements of the stationary component, which shows orbiting motion
with reversals. The quasi-stationary component has low superluminal speeds on
time scales of months. On time-scales of few years, the apparent mean speeds
are subrelativistic, of about 0.15 the speed of light. We find that the
brightness profile of the quasi-stationary component is asymmetric along and
transverse to the jet axis, and this effect remains unchanged regardless of
epoch. Conclusions. Accurate positional determination, a high cadence of
observations, and a proper accounting for the core shift are crucial for the
measurement of the trajectories and speeds of the quasi-stationary component.

  Ultrasound Videos, Landmarks instead of Contours","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One usage of medical ultrasound imaging is to visualize and characterize
human tongue shape and motion during a real-time speech to study healthy or
impaired speech production. Due to the low-contrast characteristic and noisy
nature of ultrasound images, it might require expertise for non-expert users to
recognize tongue gestures in applications such as visual training of a second
language. Moreover, quantitative analysis of tongue motion needs the tongue
dorsum contour to be extracted, tracked, and visualized. Manual tongue contour
extraction is a cumbersome, subjective, and error-prone task. Furthermore, it
is not a feasible solution for real-time applications. The growth of deep
learning has been vigorously exploited in various computer vision tasks,
including ultrasound tongue contour tracking. In the current methods, the
process of tongue contour extraction comprises two steps of image segmentation
and post-processing. This paper presents a new novel approach of automatic and
real-time tongue contour tracking using deep neural networks. In the proposed
method, instead of the two-step procedure, landmarks of the tongue surface are
tracked. This novel idea enables researchers in this filed to benefits from
available previously annotated databases to achieve high accuracy results. Our
experiment disclosed the outstanding performances of the proposed technique in
terms of generalization, performance, and accuracy.

exploration of an area with UAVs, sweeping mines with robots, cleaning ground
with robots in large shopping malls, mowing lawn in a large area etc. The
problem has versions such as area coverage with a single unmanned vehicle, area
coverage with multiple unmanned vehicles, on-line area coverage (The map of the
area that will be covered is not known before starting the coverage) with
unmanned vehicles etc. In addition, the area may have obstacles that the
vehicles cannot move over. Naturally, many researches are working on the
problem and a lot of researches have been done on the problem until today.
Spanning tree coverage is one of the major approaches to the problem. In this
approach, at the basic level, the planar area is divided into identical squares
according to the range of sight of the vehicle, and centers of these squares
are assumed to be vertexes of a graph. The vertexes of this graph are connected
with the edges with unit costs and after finding the minimum spanning tree of
the graph, the vehicle strolls around the spanning tree. The method we propose
suggests a way to cover a non-planar area with unmanned vehicles. The method we
propose also takes advantage of the spanning-tree coverage approach, but
instead of assigning unit costs to the edges, we assigned a weight to each edge
using slopes between vertexes those the edges connect. We have gotten
noticeably better results than the results we got when we did not consider the
slope between two squares and used the classical spanning tree approach.

sales forecasting for business, rainfall forecasting for agriculture and many
others. Though this problem has been extensively studied for years, it is still
considered a challenging problem due to complex and evolving nature of time
series data. Typical methods proposed for time series forecasting modeled
linear or non-linear dependencies between data observations. However it is a
generally accepted notion that no one method is universally effective for all
kinds of time series data. Attempts have been made to use dynamic and weighted
combination of heterogeneous and independent forecasting models and it has been
found to be a promising direction to tackle this problem. This method is based
on the assumption that different forecasters have different specialization and
varying performance for different distribution of data and weights are
dynamically assigned to multiple forecasters accordingly. However in many
practical time series data-set, the distribution of data slowly evolves with
time. We propose to employ a re-weighting based method to adjust the assigned
weights to various forecasters in order to account for such distribution-drift.
An exhaustive testing was performed against both real-world and synthesized
time-series. Experimental results show the competitiveness of the method in
comparison to state-of-the-art approaches for combining forecasters and
handling drift.

framework include an offline volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere
grid, improvements to the CNN architecture, and the minimization of the loss
function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere
remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution
operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding
in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely
stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks
and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly
outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical
numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are
worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP
system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface
temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time
scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the
prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it is
currently less accurate than operational weather forecasting models, our
data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine
learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.

  Training?","13 pages, Accepted at ACM ASIACCS 2020",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new collaborative learning, called split learning, was recently introduced,
aiming to protect user data privacy without revealing raw input data to a
server. It collaboratively runs a deep neural network model where the model is
split into two parts, one for the client and the other for the server.
Therefore, the server has no direct access to raw data processed at the client.
Until now, the split learning is believed to be a promising approach to protect
the client's raw data; for example, the client's data was protected in
healthcare image applications using 2D convolutional neural network (CNN)
models. However, it is still unclear whether the split learning can be applied
to other deep learning models, in particular, 1D CNN.
  In this paper, we examine whether split learning can be used to perform
privacy-preserving training for 1D CNN models. To answer this, we first design
and implement an 1D CNN model under split learning and validate its efficacy in
detecting heart abnormalities using medical ECG data. We observed that the 1D
CNN model under split learning can achieve the same accuracy of 98.9\% like the
original (non-split) model. However, our evaluation demonstrates that split
learning may fail to protect the raw data privacy on 1D CNN models. To address
the observed privacy leakage in split learning, we adopt two privacy leakage
mitigation techniques: 1) adding more hidden layers to the client side and 2)
applying differential privacy. Although those mitigation techniques are helpful
in reducing privacy leakage, they have a significant impact on model accuracy.
Hence, based on those results, we conclude that split learning alone would not
be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality of raw sequential data in 1D CNN
models.

frequency where the plasmon branch merges with the single-electron excitation
region, the collective energy of the plasmon dissipates into single
electron-hole excitations. The jellium model provides a reasonable description
of the electron-energy-loss spectrum (EELS) of metals close to the
free-electron limit. The random phase approximation (RPA) is exact in the
high-density limit but can capture the plasmonic dispersion reasonably even for
densities with rs > 1. RPA and all beyond-RPA methods investigated here, result
in a wrong infinite plasmon lifetime for a wavevector smaller than the critical
one where the plasmon dispersion curve runs into particle-hole excitations.
Exchange-correlation kernel corrections to RPA modify the plasmon dispersion
curve. There is however a large difference in the construction and form of the
kernels investigated earlier. Our current work introduces recent model
exchange-only and exchange-correlation kernels and discusses the relevance of
some exact constraints in the construction of the kernel. We show that, because
the plasmon dispersion samples a range of wavevectors smaller than the range
sampled by the correlation energy, different kernels can make a strong
difference for the correlation energy and a weak difference for the plasmon
dispersion. This work completes our understanding about the plasmon dispersion
in realistic metals, such as Cs, where a negative plasmon dispersion has been
observed. We find only positive plasmon dispersion in jellium at the density
