behavior of Allen-Cahn energy functionals in periodic media and the sharp
interface limit of the associated $L^{2}$ gradient flows. By introducing a
Percival-type Lagrangian in the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^{d}$, we
establish a link between the $\Gamma$-convergence results of Anisini, Braides,
and Chiad\`{o} Piat and the sharp interface limit results of Barles and
Souganidis. In laminar media, we prove a sharp interface limit in a graphical
setting, making no assumptions other than sufficient smoothness of the

tension satisfy an Einstein relation. A number of pathologies are presented to
highlight difficulties that do not arise in the spatially homogeneous setting.

given to intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), and more particularly to

intersections, which makes theme a critical areas. In this paper, we
investigate the improvement when implementing maximum ratio combining (MRC) in
cooperative VCs transmission schemes using non-orthogonal multiple access
scheme (NOMA) at road intersections. We consider that a source transmits a
message to two destinations with a aid of a relay. The transmission undergoes
interference generated from a set of vehicles on the roads. We obtained closed
form outage probability expressions, and we extend the derivation for a
scenario involving K destination nodes and several road lanes. The performance
of MRC cooperative NOMA is compared with the standard cooperative NOMA, and we
show that implementing MRC with NOMA offers a significant improvement over the
standard cooperative NOMA. Also, we compare the performance of MRC using NOMA
with MRC cooperative orthogonal multiple access (OMA), and demonstrate that
NOMA significantly outperforms OMA. We conclude that it is always beneficial to
use MRC and NOMA even at the cost of implementation complexity. Finally, we
demonstrate that the outage probability increases drasticallyen the vehicles
are closer to the road intersection, and that using MRC with NOMA improves
significantly the performance in this context. To verify the correctness of our
analysis, extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out.

a few annotated training images are available for training detectors. A popular
approach to handle this problem is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a
detector pretrained on a source-domain benchmark. However, such transferred
detector often fails to recognize new objects in the target domain, due to low
data diversity of training samples. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
Context-Transformer within a concise deep transfer framework. Specifically,
Context-Transformer can effectively leverage source-domain object knowledge as
guidance, and automatically exploit contexts from only a few training images in
the target domain. Subsequently, it can adaptively integrate these relational
clues to enhance the discriminative power of detector, in order to reduce
object confusion in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, Context-Transformer is
flexibly embedded in the popular SSD-style detectors, which makes it a
plug-and-play module for end-to-end few-shot learning. Finally, we evaluate
Context-Transformer on the challenging settings of few-shot detection and
incremental few-shot detection. The experimental results show that, our

tasks, but is notoriously difficult to use due to instability and sensitivity
to hyperparameters. The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard
supervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides
""hard negatives"" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions
that the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon ""corrective
feedback."" We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not
necessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the
experience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in
the Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit
pathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by
the agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to
potential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning
from noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this
problem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific
correction to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these
observations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an
approximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the
transitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range

indicate that there was no significant advantage in calibrating with embedded

specifying a design (values of all controllable variables) to maximise the
expected utility function (expectation with respect to the distribution of
responses and parameters). For most common utility functions, the expected
utility is rarely available in closed form and requires a computationally
expensive approximation which then needs to be maximised over the space of all
possible designs. This hinders practical use of the Bayesian approach to find
experimental designs. However, recently, a new utility called Fisher
information gain has been proposed. The resulting expected Fisher information
gain reduces to the prior expectation of the trace of the Fisher information
matrix. Since the Fisher information is often available in closed form, this
significantly simplifies approximation and subsequent identification of optimal
designs. In this paper, it is shown that for exponential family models,
maximising the expected Fisher information gain is equivalent to maximising an
alternative objective function over a reduced-dimension space, simplifying even
further the identification of optimal designs. However, if this function does
not have enough global maxima, then designs that maximise the expected Fisher
information gain lead to non-identifiablility.

and their impact were shown to negatively affect group coordination and
success, no information is available about timing uncertainty, i.e. how
uncertainty about when the target needs to be reached affects the outcome as
well as the decision-making. Here we show experimentally, through a collective
dilemma wherein groups of participants need to avoid a tipping point under the
risk of collective loss, that timing uncertainty prompts not only early
generosity but also polarized contributions, in which participants' total
contributions are distributed more unfairly than when there is no uncertainty.
Analyzing participant behavior reveals, under uncertainty, an increase in
reciprocal strategies wherein contributions are conditional on the previous
donations of the other participants, a group analogue of the well-known
Tit-for-Tat strategy. Although large timing uncertainty appears to reduce
collective success, groups that successfully collect the required amount show
strong reciprocal coordination. This conclusion is supported by a game
theoretic model examining the dominance of behaviors in case of timing
uncertainty. In general, timing uncertainty casts a shadow on the future that
leads participants to respond early, encouraging reciprocal behaviors, and
unequal contributions.

proposed to deal with a class of distributed nonsmooth resource allocation
problems. In these problems, the global cost function is the summation of local
convex and nonsmooth cost functions, each of which consists of one twice
differentiable function and multiple nonsmooth functions. Communication graphs
of underling multi-agent systems are directed and strongly connected but not
necessarily weighted-balanced. The multi-proximal splitting is designed to deal
with the difficulty caused by the unproximable property of the summation of
those nonsmooth functions. Moreover, it can also guarantee the smoothness of
proposed algorithms. Auxiliary variables in the multi-proximal splitting are
introduced to estimate subgradients of nonsmooth functions. Theoretically, the
convergence analysis is conducted by employing Lyapunov stability theory and
integral input-to-state stability (iISS) theory with respect to set. It shows
that proposed algorithms can make states converge to the optimal point that
satisfies resource allocation conditions.

calculation of the simplest Feynman diagram with a single loop in the scalar
{\phi}^3 theory. The calculation of the contribution of such a diagram to the
scattering amplitude requires the calculation of a fourfold integral over the
four-momenta components circulating in a loop. The essence of the Laplace
method for the calculation of multiple integrals lies in the fact that if the
module of an integrand has a point of sufficiently sharp maximum inside the
integration domain, then the integral can be replaced by a Gaussian integral by
representing the integrand in the form of an exponent from the logarithm and
expanding this logarithm into Taylor series in the vicinity of a maximum point
up to the second degree terms. We show that there are two-dimensional and
non-intersecting surfaces inside the four-dimensional region of integration, on
which the maximum of the module of integrand is reached. This leads to a
problem that the integrand is non-analytically dependent on the parameters
responsible for bypassing the poles. Also the derivatives of logarithm of the
scattering amplitude are non-analytically dependent on these parameters.
However, in the paper we show that these non-analyticities compensate each
other. As a result of such a procedure, three of the four integrations can be
done analytically, and the calculation of the contribution of the diagram to
the scattering amplitude is reduced to a numerical calculation of the single
integral in finite bounds from an expression that does not contain
non-analyticities. The described calculation method is used to construct a
model dependence of elastic scattering differential cross section
d{\sigma}_elastic/dt on the square of the transmitted four-momentum t
(Mandelstam variable).

phonons mediate a long-distance force gives rise to the phenomenologically
well-established regularities of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Superfluid
dark matter, therefore, has emerged as a promising explanation for
astrophysical observations by combining the benefits of both particle dark
matter and MOND, or its relativistic completions, respectively. We here
investigate whether superfluid dark matter can reproduce the observed Milky Way
rotation curve for $ R < 25\,\rm{kpc}$ and are able to answer this question in
the affirmative. Our analysis demonstrates that superfluid dark matter fits the
data well with parameters in reasonable ranges. The most notable difference
between superfluid dark matter and MOND is that superfluid dark matter requires
about $ 20\% $ less total baryonic mass (with a suitable interpolation
function). The total baryonic mass is then $5.96 \cdot 10^{10}\,M_\odot$, of
which $1.03\cdot10^{10}\,M_\odot$ are from the bulge,
$3.95\cdot10^{10}\,M_\odot$ are from the stellar disk, and
$0.98\cdot10^{10}\,M_\odot$ are from the gas disk. Our analysis further allows
us to estimate the radius of the Milky Way's superfluid core (concretely, the
so-called NFW and thermal radii) and the total mass of dark matter in both the
superfluid and the normal phase. By varying the boundary conditions of the
superfluid to give virial masses $M_{200}^{\rm{DM}}$ in the range
$0.5-3.0\cdot10^{12}\,M_\odot$, we find that the NFW radius $R_{\rm{NFW}}$
varies between $65\,\rm{kpc}$ and $73\,\rm{kpc}$, while the thermal radius
$R_T$ varies between about $67\,\rm{kpc}$ and $105\,\rm{kpc}$. This is the
first such treatment of a non-spherically-symmetric system in superfluid dark
matter.

an ensemble, they can leverage complementary information from each other to be
more effective for an unseen target domain. To this end, each source domain is
used in turn as a pseudo-target-domain with its own expert providing
supervisory signal to the ensemble of non-experts learned from the other
sources. For unlabeled target data under the UDA setting where real expert does
not exist, DAEL uses pseudo-label to supervise the ensemble learning. Extensive

confidence will exit early from the network without being further processed.
Meanwhile, high-resolution paths in the network maintain the capability to
recognize the ""hard"" samples. Therefore, RANet can effectively reduce the
spatial redundancy involved in inferring high-resolution inputs. Empirically,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RANet on the CIFAR-10,

versions of local minimax lower bounds for policy evaluation, thereby providing
an instance-dependent baseline by which to compare algorithms. Theory-inspired
simulations show that the widely-used temporal difference (TD) algorithm is
strictly suboptimal when evaluated in a non-asymptotic setting, even when
combined with Polyak-Ruppert iterate averaging. We remedy this issue by
introducing and analyzing variance-reduced forms of stochastic approximation,
showing that they achieve non-asymptotic, instance-dependent optimality up to
logarithmic factors.

person contained in multiple images taken across different cameras. Existing
methods for re-ID tend to rely heavily on the assumption that both query and
gallery images of the same person have the same clothing. Unfortunately, this
assumption may not hold for datasets captured over long periods of time (e.g.,
weeks, months or years). To tackle the re-ID problem in the context of clothing
changes, we propose a novel representation learning model which is able to
generate a body shape feature representation without being affected by clothing
color or patterns. We call our model the Color Agnostic Shape Extraction
Network (CASE-Net). CASE-Net learns a representation of identity that depends
only on body shape via adversarial learning and feature disentanglement. Due to
the lack of large-scale re-ID datasets which contain clothing changes for the
same person, we propose two synthetic datasets for evaluation. We create a
rendered dataset SMPL-reID with different clothes patterns and a synthesized
dataset Div-Market with different clothing color to simulate two types of
clothing changes. The quantitative and qualitative results across 5 datasets
(SMPL-reID, Div-Market, two benchmark re-ID datasets, a cross-modality re-ID

differs in two important ways: (i) we have no additional requirement like
positive semidefiniteness; (ii) our symmetric Grothendieck constant is

our symmetric Grothendieck inequality is a ""conic Grothendieck inequality"" for

two dimensional domain. The impact of the flapping Strouhal number, foil
spacing and phasing on wake interaction is investigated. Our primary finding is
that the back foil is capable of cancelling the wake deflection and mean side
force of the front foil, even when located up to 5 chord lengths downstream.
This is achieved by attracting the incoming dipoles and disturbing their
cohesion within the limits of the back foil's range of flapping motion. We also
show that the impact on cycle averaged thrust varies from high augmentation to
drag generation depending on the wake patterns downstream of the back foil.
These findings provide new insights towards the design of biomimetic tandem
propulsors, as they expand their working envelope and ability to rapidly
increase or decrease the forward speed by manipulating the size of the shed

constant, $H_0$, derived from early and late-universe measurements. One
proposed solution is to introduce a new component in the early universe, which
initially acts as ""early dark energy"" (EDE), thus decreasing the physical size
of the sound horizon imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and
increasing the inferred $H_0$. Previous EDE analyses have shown this model can
relax the $H_0$ tension, but the CMB-preferred value of the density fluctuation
amplitude, $\sigma_8$, increases in EDE as compared to $\Lambda$CDM, increasing
tension with large-scale structure (LSS) data. We show that the EDE model fit
to CMB and SH0ES data yields scale-dependent changes in the matter power
spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM, including $10\%$ more power at $k =
1~h$/Mpc. Motivated by this observation, we reanalyze the EDE scenario,
considering LSS data in detail. We also update previous analyses by including
$Planck$ 2018 CMB likelihoods, and perform the first search for EDE in $Planck$
data alone, which yields no evidence for EDE. We consider several data set
combinations involving the primary CMB, CMB lensing, SNIa, BAO, RSD, weak
lensing, galaxy clustering, and local distance-ladder data (SH0ES). While the
EDE component is weakly detected (3$\sigma$) when including the SH0ES data and
excluding most LSS data, this drops below 2$\sigma$ when further LSS data are
included. Further, this result is in tension with strong constraints imposed on
EDE by CMB and LSS data without SH0ES, which show no evidence for this model.
We also show that physical priors on the fundamental scalar field parameters
further weaken evidence for EDE. We conclude that the EDE scenario is, at best,
no more likely to be concordant with all current cosmological data sets than

The subsequent stage estimates a closed perimeter, parameterized by a simple

all such room perimeters in the global co-ordinate system. The Scan2Plan

the contribution to the full covariance matrix of systematic uncertainties due
to the choice of initial mass function, stellar library, and metallicity,
exploring a variety of stellar population synthesis models. Through simulations
in the redshift range 0<z<1.5 we find that the choice of the stellar population
synthesis model dominates the total error budget on $H(z)$, with contributions
at a level of ~4.5%, discarding the most discordant model. The contribution due
to the choice of initial mass function is <0.5%, while that due to the stellar
library is ~6.6% on average. We also assess the impact of an uncertainty in the
stellar metallicity determination, finding that an error of ~10% (5%) on the
stellar metallicity propagates to a 9% (4%) error on $H(z)$. These results are
used to provide the combined contribution of these systematic effects on the
error budget. For current $H(z)$ measurements, where the uncertainties due to
metallicity and star formation history were already included, we show that,
using the more modern stellar libraries, the additional systematic uncertainty
is between 5.4% (at z=0.2) and 2.3% (at z=1.5). To reach the goal of keeping
the systematic error budget below the 1% level we discuss the efforts needed to
obtain higher resolution and signal-to-noise spectra and improvements in the

$n_{\rm tr}$ for trough) and sharp clipping ($n_{\rm pix}$) statistics support
the Gaussianity hypothesis for all component separations. However, the pixel at
the threshold reveals a more consistent treatment with respect to end-to-end
simulations. A very tiny deviation from associated simulations in the context
of trough density, in the threshold range $\theta\in [-2-0]$ for NILC and CR
component separations, are detected. The unweighted two-point correlation
function, of the local extrema, illustrates good consistency between different
component separations and corresponding Gaussian simulations for almost all
available thresholds. However, for high thresholds, a small deficit in the
clustering of peaks is observed with respect to the Planck fiducial

and beyond. This will offer an unrivalled opportunity to investigate several
key questions for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. The first step
for many of these studies will be the selection of a sample of quiescent and
star-forming galaxies, as is often done in the literature by using well known
colour techniques such as the `UVJ' diagram. However, given the limited number
of filters available for the Euclid telescope, the recovery of such rest-frame
colours will be challenging. We therefore investigate the use of observed
Euclid colours, on their own and together with ground-based u-band
observations, for selecting quiescent and star-forming galaxies. The most
efficient colour combination, among the ones tested in this work, consists of
the (u-VIS) and (VIS-J) colours. We find that this combination allows users to
select a sample of quiescent galaxies complete to above $\sim70\%$ and with
less than 15$\%$ contamination at redshifts in the range $0.75<z<1$. For
galaxies at high-z or without the u-band complementary observations, the
(VIS-Y) and (J-H) colours represent a valid alternative, with $>65\%$
completeness level and contamination below 20$\%$ at $1<z<2$ for finding
quiescent galaxies. In comparison, the sample of quiescent galaxies selected
with the traditional UVJ technique is only $\sim20\%$ complete at $z<3$, when
recovering the rest-frame colours using mock Euclid observations. This shows
that our new methodology is the most suitable one when only Euclid bands, along
with u-band imaging, are available.

Virgo enables us to probe the polarization content of gravitational waves. In
general relativity, only tensor modes are present, while in a variety of
alternative theories one can also have vector or scalar modes. Recently test
were performed which compared Bayesian evidences for the hypotheses that either
purely tensor, purely vector, or purely scalar polarizations were present.
Indeed, with only three detectors in a network and allowing for mixtures of
tensor polarizations and alternative polarization states, it is not possible to
identify precisely which non-standard polarizations might be in the signal and
by what amounts. However, we demonstrate that one can still infer whether, in
addition to tensor polarizations, alternative polarizations are present in the
first place, irrespective of the detailed polarization content. We develop two
methods to do this for sources with electromagnetic counterparts, both based on
the so-called null stream. Apart from being able to detect mixtures of tensor
and alternative polarizations, these have the added advantage that no waveform
models are needed, and signals from any kind of transient source with known sky
position can be used. Both formalisms allow us to combine information from

without resorting to dark matter. RG is a classical theory of gravity where the
standard Poisson equation is modified by the gravitational permittivity,
$\epsilon$, a universal monotonic function of the local mass density. We use
the rotation curves and the vertical velocity dispersions of 30 galaxies in the
DiskMass Survey (DMS) to determine $\epsilon$. RG describes the kinematic
profiles with mass-to-light ratios consistent with SPS models, and disk
thicknesses in agreement with observations, once observational biases are
considered. Our results rely on setting the three free parameters of $\epsilon$
for each galaxy. However, we show that the differences of these parameters from
galaxy to galaxy could be ascribed to statistical fluctuations. We adopt an
approximate method to find a single set of parameters that may properly
describe the kinematics of the entire sample and suggest the universality of
$\epsilon$. Finally, we show that the RG models of the individual rotation
curves can only partly describe the radial acceleration relation (RAR).
Evidently, the RG models underestimate the observed accelerations of 0.1-0.3
dex at low Newtonian accelerations. Another problem is the strong correlation,
at much more than 5$\sigma$, between the residuals of the RAR models and three
radially-dependent properties of galaxies, whereas the DMS data show a
considerably less significant correlation, at more than 4$\sigma$, for only two
of them. These correlations might originate the non-null intrinsic scatter of
the RG models, at odds with the observed intrinsic scatter of galaxy samples
different from DMS, which is consistent with 0. Further studies are required to
assess if these discrepancies in the RAR originate from the DMS sample, which
might not be ideal for deriving the RAR, or if they are genuine failures of RG.

naturally mods out projective transformations. It is inherently algebraic,
arising as the positive part of a variety of a saturated determinantal ideal,
and provides a new computational tool to study classical realizability problems
for polytopes. We introduce the package SlackIdeals for Macaulay2, that
provides methods for creating and manipulating slack matrices and slack ideals
of convex polytopes and matroids. Slack ideals are often difficult to compute.
To improve the power of the slack model, we develop two strategies to simplify
computations: we scale as many entries of the slack matrix as possible to one;
we then obtain a reduced slack model combining the slack variety with the more
compact Grassmannian realization space model. This allows us to study slack
ideals that were previously out of computational reach. As applications, we
show that the well-known Perles polytope does not admit rational realizations

significantly more challenging than for most other photovoltaics. This is for a
variety of reasons, of which the most significant are the mixed
ionic-electronic conduction properties of metal halide perovskites and the
difficulty in fabricating stable, and reproducible, devices. Experimental
studies, conducted on a variety of PSCs, produce a variety of impedance spectra
shapes. However, they all possess common features, the most noteworthy of which
is that they have at least two signals, at high and low frequency, with
different characteristic responses to temperature, illumination and electrical
bias. It is shown, by a combination of experiment and drift-diffusion modelling
of the ion and charge carrier transport and recombination within the cell, that
these common features are well reproduced by the simulation. In addition, we
show that the high frequency response contains all the key information relating
to the steady-state performance of a PSC, i.e. it is a signature of the
recombination mechanisms and provides a measure of charge collection
efficiency. Moreover, steady-state performance is significantly affected by the
distribution of mobile ionic charge within the perovskite layer. Comparison
between the electrical properties of different devices should therefore be made
using high frequency impedance measurements performed in the steady-state
voltage regime in which the cell is expected to operate.

computing their atmospheric parameters both from the photometry and from

the photometric ones and this discrepancy increases decreasing the metallicity,
reaching, at [Fe/H]~-2.5 dex, differences of ~350 K in effective temperature
and ~1 dex in surface gravity. We demonstrate that the spectroscopic parameters
are inconsistent with the position of the stars in the colour-magnitude

stars are up to about 2.5 magnitudes brighter than the observed magnitudes. The
parameter discrepancy is likely due to the inadequacies of the adopted physics,
in particular the assumption of 1-dimensional geometry can be the origin of the
observed slope between iron abundances and excitation potential that leads to
low temperatures. However, the current modelling of 3D/NLTE radiative transfer
for giant stars seems to be not able to totally erase this slope. We conclude
that the spectroscopic parameters are wrong for metallicity lower than -1.5 dex

according to which beliefs about the hidden environmental states are
dynamically updated following the logic of Bayesian inference. Our
computational model maps distinct cognitive processes into separable,
neurobiologically plausible, information-theoretic constructs underlying
observed response patterns. We assess model identification and expressiveness
in accounting for meaningful human performance through extensive simulation

user experiences. Our data shows that many JS libraries are only partially
utilized during a page load, and therefore, contain superfluous code that is
never executed. Many top-ranked websites contain up to hundreds of kilobytes of
compressed superfluous code and a JS resource on a median page contains 31%
superfluous code. Superfluous JS code inflates the page weight, and thereby,
the time to download, parse, and compile a JS resource. It is therefore
important to monitor the usage and optimize the payload of JS resources to
improve Web performance. However, given that the webpage design and
functionality could depend on a user's preferences or device, among many other
factors, actively loading webpages in controlled environments cannot cover all
possible conditions in which webpage content and functionality changes. In this
paper, we show that passive measurement techniques, such as real user
monitoring systems (RUM), that monitor the performance of real user page loads
under different conditions can be leveraged to identify superfluous code. Using
a custom man-in-the-middle proxy (similar to a content delivery network's proxy
server), we designed a systematic approach for website developers that relies
on pages loaded by real users to passively identify superfluous code on JS
resources. We then elide any superfluous code from JS resources before
subsequent page load requests. Our data shows that eliding superfluous JS code
improves the median page load time by 5% and by at least 10% for pages in the
long tail. Through results presented in this paper, we motivate for the need
for rigorous monitoring of the usage of JS resources under different real world
conditions, with the goal to improve Web performance.

system design? This paper addresses this question in the context of graphical
coordination games where an adversary can indirectly influence the behavior of
agents by modifying their payoffs. We study a situation in which a system
operator must select a graph topology in anticipation of the action of an
unknown adversary. The designer can limit her worst-case losses by playing a
security strategy, effectively planning for an adversary which intends maximum
harm. However, fine-grained information regarding the adversary's intention may
help the system operator to fine-tune the defenses and obtain better system
performance. In a simple model of adversarial behavior, this paper asks how
much a system operator can gain by fine-tuning a defense for known adversarial
intent. We find that if the adversary is weak, a security strategy is
approximately optimal for any adversary type; however, for moderately-strong
adversaries, security strategies are far from optimal.

across imputations, optimization is then performed jointly over all imputed

that the metallicity distribution of galaxies in the local Universe along with
the relative amount of mergers forming in the field or in star clusters
determine the main properties of the BBH population. Our fiducial model
predicts that the heaviest merger to date, GW170729, originated from a

a galactic nucleus. The model predicts that at least one merger remnant out of

well tuned systems exhibit significant instability both within a trial and

source of the problem is known as catastrophic interference: when later
training decreases performance by overriding previous learning. Interestingly,
the powerful generalization that makes Neural Networks (NN) so effective in
batch supervised learning might explain the challenges when applying them in
reinforcement learning tasks. In this paper, we explore how online NN training
and interference interact in reinforcement learning. We find that simply
re-mapping the input observations to a high-dimensional space improves learning

  SRP is a widely deployed Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol

protocols, two participants use knowledge of a pre-shared password to
authenticate each other and establish a session key. SRP aims to resist
dictionary attacks, not store plaintext-equivalent passwords on the server,
avoid patent infringement, and avoid export controls by not using encryption.
Formal analysis of SRP is challenging in part because existing tools provide no
simple way to reason about its use of the mathematical expression $v + g^b \mod

  Modeling $v + g^b$ as encryption, we complete an exhaustive study of all
possible execution sequences of SRP. Ignoring possible algebraic attacks, this

any secrets. We do uncover one notable weakness of SRP, which follows from its
design constraints. It is possible for a malicious server to fake an
authentication session with a client, without the client's participation. This
action might facilitate an escalation of privilege attack, if the client has
higher privileges than does the server. We conceived of this attack before we

  Generalization, and Hardness of Examples at Scale",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Coherent Gradients (CGH) is a recently proposed hypothesis to explain why
over-parameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent generalize
well even though they have sufficient capacity to memorize the training set.
The key insight of CGH is that, since the overall gradient for a single step of
SGD is the sum of the per-example gradients, it is strongest in directions that
reduce the loss on multiple examples if such directions exist. In this paper,
we validate CGH on ResNet, Inception, and VGG models on ImageNet. Since the
techniques presented in the original paper do not scale beyond toy models and
datasets, we propose new methods. By posing the problem of suppressing weak
gradient directions as a problem of robust mean estimation, we develop a
coordinate-based median of means approach. We present two versions of this
algorithm, M3, which partitions a mini-batch into 3 groups and computes the
median, and a more efficient version RM3, which reuses gradients from previous
two time steps to compute the median. Since they suppress weak gradient
directions without requiring per-example gradients, they can be used to train
models at scale. Experimentally, we find that they indeed greatly reduce
overfitting (and memorization) and thus provide the first convincing evidence
that CGH holds at scale. We also propose a new test of CGH that does not depend
on adding noise to training labels or on suppressing weak gradient directions.
Using the intuition behind CGH, we posit that the examples learned early in the
training process (i.e., ""easy"" examples) are precisely those that have more in
common with other training examples. Therefore, as per CGH, the easy examples
should generalize better amongst themselves than the hard examples amongst
themselves. We validate this hypothesis with detailed experiments, and believe
that it provides further orthogonal evidence for CGH.

of Sgr B2. Our updated chemical models can reproduce most observed NC:CN ratios
reasonably well depending on the physical parameters chosen. The model that
performs best has an extinction-dependent cosmic-ray ionization rate that
varies from ~2 $\times$ 10$^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$ at the edge of the cloud to ~1
$\times$ 10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ in the center. Models with higher
extinction-dependent $\zeta$ than this model generally do not agree as well,

are run using results of the best-fit chemical model. Column densities produced
by the radiative transfer models are significantly lower than those determined

temperature profiles is a possible explanation. Excitation temperatures are

adequate choice of the variables of the phase space. Our results indicate that,
although single-field inflation is generic in the sense that the corresponding
critical point in the phase space exists for a wide class of potentials, along
given phase space orbits -- representing potential cosmic histories -- the
occurrence of the inflationary stage is rather dependent on the initial
conditions. We have been able to give quantitative estimates of the relative
probability (RP) for initial conditions leading to slow-roll inflation. For the
non-minimal coupling model with the $\phi^2$-potential our rough estimates
yield to an almost vanishing relative probability: $10^{-13}\,\%\lesssim RP\ll
10^{-8}\,\%$. These bonds are greatly improved in the scalar-tensor models,
including the Brans-Dicke theory, where the relative probability $1\,\%\lesssim
RP\leq 100\,\%$. Hence slow-roll inflation is indeed a natural stage of the
cosmic expansion in Brans-Dicke models of inflation. It is confirmed as well

performance and improve availability of relational databases but past
approaches have suffered from various issues including limited scalability,
performance versus consistency tradeoffs, and requirements for database or
application modifications. This paper presents Hihooi, a replication-based
middleware system that is able to achieve workload scalability, strong
consistency guarantees, and elasticity for existing transactional databases at
a low cost. A novel replication algorithm enables Hihooi to propagate database
modifications asynchronously to all replicas at high speeds, while ensuring
that all replicas are consistent. At the same time, a fine-grained routing
algorithm is used to load balance incoming transactions to available replicas
in a consistent way. Our thorough experimental evaluation with several
well-established benchmarks shows how Hihooi is able to achieve almost linear
workload scalability for transactional databases.

clinicians, we explore the big question, can twitter posts provide enough
information to fill up clinical PTSD assessment surveys that have been
traditionally trusted by clinicians? To answer the above question, we propose,
LAXARY (Linguistic Analysis-based Exaplainable Inquiry) model, a novel
Explainable Artificial Intelligent (XAI) model to detect and represent PTSD
assessment of twitter users using a modified Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count

collecting clinical PTSD assessment data from real twitter users and develop a
PTSD Linguistic Dictionary using the PTSD assessment survey results. Then, we
use the PTSD Linguistic Dictionary along with machine learning model to fill up
the survey tools towards detecting PTSD status and its intensity of
corresponding twitter users. Our experimental evaluation on 210 clinically
validated veteran twitter users provides promising accuracies of both PTSD

Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the

medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost, taking
time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is
proposed to detect COVID-19 using built-in smartphone sensors. The proposal
provides a low-cost solution, since most of radiologists have already held
smartphones for different daily-purposes. Not only that but also ordinary
people can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection

SQL are natural language interfaces (NLIs) and programming-by-example (PBE).
Both of these alternatives face certain pitfalls: natural language queries

approaches require either low-complexity queries, user schema knowledge, exact
example tuples from the user, or a closed-world assumption to be tractable.
Consequently, we propose dual-specification query synthesis, which consumes

results from user studies in which Duoquest demonstrates a 62.5% absolute

comparable accuracy to a PBE system on a more limited workload supported by the
PBE system. In a simulation study on the prominent Spider benchmark, Duoquest
demonstrates a >2x increase in top-1 accuracy over both NLI and PBE.

the most efficient choice. Standard auto-encoder pretraining for deep learning
tasks is done by comparing the input image and the reconstructed image. Recent
work shows that predictions based on embeddings generated by image autoencoders
can be improved by training with perceptual loss, i.e., by adding a loss
network after the decoding step. So far the autoencoders trained with loss
networks implemented an explicit comparison of the original and reconstructed
images using the loss network. However, given such a loss network we show that
there is no need for the time-consuming task of decoding the entire image.
Instead, we propose to decode the features of the loss network, hence the name
""feature prediction loss"". To evaluate this method we perform experiments on
three standard publicly available datasets (LunarLander-v2, STL-10, and SVHN)
and compare six different procedures for training image encoders (pixel-wise,
perceptual similarity, and feature prediction losses; combined with two
variations of image and feature encoding/decoding). The embedding-based
prediction results show that encoders trained with feature prediction loss is
as good or better than those trained with the other two losses. Additionally,
the encoder is significantly faster to train using feature prediction loss in

robust method for high-dimensional data regression tasks. In part, the
popularity of these models arises from the fact that they require little
hyperparameter tuning and are not very susceptible to overfitting. Random
forest regression models are comprised of an ensemble of decision trees that
independently predict the value of a (continuous) dependent variable;
predictions from each of the trees are ultimately averaged to yield an overall
predicted value from the forest. Using a suite of representative real-world
datasets, we find a systematic bias in predictions from random forest models.
We find that this bias is recapitulated in simple synthetic datasets,
regardless of whether or not they include irreducible error (noise) in the
data, but that models employing boosting do not exhibit this bias. Here we
demonstrate the basis for this problem, and we use the training data to define
a numerical transformation that fully corrects it. Application of this

this way, SpGAT can better capture global patterns of graphs in an efficient
manner with much fewer learned parameters than that of GAT. Further, to reduce
the computational cost of SpGAT brought by the eigen-decomposition, we propose
a fast approximation variant SpGAT-Cheby. We thoroughly evaluate the

based on the Reuter fixed point, a non-trivial fixed point of the gravitational

The sample includes all the galaxies with reliable direct measurement of their
bar pattern speed based on long-slit or integral-field stellar spectroscopy
using the Tremaine-Weinberg method. We limited our analysis to the galaxies
with a relatively small relative error on the bar pattern speed (smaller than
50 per cent) and not hosting an ultrafast bar. For each galaxy, we collected
the radius, strength, pattern speed, corotation radius, and rotation rate for
the bar and we also collected the Hubble type and absolute SDSS r-band
magnitude. We also used literature bulge-to-total luminosity ratio for a
subsample of 53 galaxies with an available photometric decomposition. We
confirmed earlier observational findings that longer bars rotate with lower bar
pattern speeds, shorter bars are weaker, and bars with a small bar rotation
rate rotate with higher bar pattern speeds and have smaller corotation radii.
In addition, we found that stronger bars rotate with lower bar pattern speeds,
as predicted from the interchange of angular momentum during bar evolution,
which in turn may depend on different galaxy properties. Moreover, we report
that brighter galaxies host longer bars, which rotate with lower bar pattern
speeds and have larger corotation radii. This result is in agreement with a
scenario of downsizing in bar formation, if more massive galaxies formed
earlier and had sufficient time to slow down, grow in length, and push
corotation outwards.

elucidating the origin of the of the large degree of rotational excitation and

reduced average angular momentum ($\Lambda$) and reduced angular velocities
($\Omega$) similar to that of 4He droplets. Given the different physical nature
of 3He and 4He, this similarity in $\Lambda$ and $\Omega$ may be surprising and
suggest that similar mechanisms induce rotation regardless of the isotope. We
hypothesized that the observed distribution of droplet sizes and angular
momenta stem from processes in the dense region close to the nozzle. In this
region, the significant velocity spread and collisions between the droplets
induce excessive rotation followed by droplet fission. The process may repeat
itself several times before the droplets enter the collision-fee high vacuum

is deployed to enhance the performance of the secondary network while helping
to mitigate the interference caused to the primary users (PUs). The DL transmit
beamforming vectors and the UL receive beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the
transmit power of the UL users, and the phase shift matrix at the IRS are
jointly optimized for maximization of the total sum rate of the secondary
system. The design task is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem
taking into account the imperfect knowledge of the PUs' channel state
information (CSI) and their maximum interference tolerance. Since the maximum
interference tolerance constraint is intractable, we apply a safe approximation
to transform it into a convex constraint. To efficiently handle the resulting
approximated optimization problem, which is still non-convex, we develop an
iterative block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm. This algorithm
exploits semidefinite relaxation, a penalty method, and successive convex
approximation and is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
approximated optimization problem. Our simulation results do not only reveal
that the proposed scheme yields a substantially higher system sum rate for the
secondary system than several baseline schemes, but also confirm its robustness
against CSI uncertainty. Besides, our results illustrate the tremendous
potential of IRS for managing the various types of interference arising in FD

(CNNs) results in the large consumption of memories and computational
resources. In this work, we design a novel Slim Convolution (SlimConv) module
to boost the performance of CNNs by reducing channel redundancies. Our SlimConv
consists of three main steps: Reconstruct, Transform and Fuse, through which
the features are splitted and reorganized in a more efficient way, such that
the learned weights can be compressed effectively. In particular, the core of
our model is a weight flipping operation which can largely improve the feature
diversities, contributing to the performance crucially. Our SlimConv is a
plug-and-play architectural unit which can be used to replace convolutional
layers in CNNs directly. We validate the effectiveness of SlimConv by
conducting comprehensive experiments on ImageNet, MS COCO2014, Pascal VOC2012
segmentation, and Pascal VOC2007 detection datasets. The experiments show that
SlimConv-equipped models can achieve better performances consistently, less
consumption of memory and computation resources than non-equipped conterparts.
For example, the ResNet-101 fitted with SlimConv achieves 77.84% top-1
classification accuracy with 4.87 GFLOPs and 27.96M parameters on ImageNet,
which shows almost 0.5% better performance with about 3 GFLOPs and 38%
parameters reduced.

spectral observations consisted in cross-correlating the spectra with a binary
mask, that is, a simple stellar template that contains information on the
position and strength of stellar absorption lines. The cross-correlation
function (CCF) profiles also provide several indicators of stellar activity. We
present a methodology to first build weighted binary masks and, second, to
compute the CCF of spectral observations with these masks from which we derive
radial velocities and activity indicators. These methods are implemented in a
python code that is publicly available. To build the masks, we selected a large
number of sharp absorption lines based on the profile of the minima present in
high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectrum templates built from observations of
reference stars. We computed the CCFs of observed spectra and derived RVs and
the following three standard activity indicators: full-width-at-half-maximum as
well as contrast and bisector inverse slope.We applied our methodology to
CARMENES high-resolution spectra and obtain RV and activity indicator time
series of more than 300 M dwarf stars observed for the main CARMENES survey.
Compared with the standard CARMENES template matching pipeline, in general we
obtain more precise RVs in the cases where the template used in the standard
pipeline did not have enough S/N. We also show the behaviour of the three
activity indicators for the active star YZ CMi and estimate the absolute RV of
the M dwarfs analysed using the CCF RVs.

investigated image qualities using ALMA receiver Bands 7, 8, 9, and 10 (285-875
GHz) by adopting band-to-band (B2B) phase referencing in which a phase
calibrator is tracked at a lower frequency. For B2B phase referencing, it is
expected that a closer phase calibrator to a target can be used, comparing to
standard in-band phase referencing. In the first step, it is ensured that an
instrumental phase offset difference between low- and high-frequency Bands can
be removed using a differential gain calibration in which a phase calibrator is
certainly detected while frequency switching. In the next step, comparative
experiments are arranged to investigate the image quality between B2B and
in-band phase referencing with phase calibrators at various separation angles.
In the final step, we conducted long baseline imaging tests for a quasar at 289

VY CMa at ~670 GHz in Band 9. The B2B phase referencing was successfully

products are non-zero whenever the total charges of the two charge

actually display two different frameworks for these same coherent states, in
the second of which Gauss's law only holds in expectation value. We propose an
experiment capable of ruling that out. The first framework leads to a 'product
picture' for full QED -- i.e. a reformulation of standard QED in which it has a
total Hamiltonian, arising as a sum of a free electromagnetic Hamiltonian, a
free charged-matter Hamiltonian and an interaction term, acting on a 'physical
subspace' of the full tensor product of charged-matter and
electromagnetic-field Hilbert spaces. (The traditional Coulomb gauge
formulation of QED isn't a product picture because, in it, the longitudinal
part of the electric field is a function of the charged matter operators.) We
do this for both Maxwell-Dirac and Maxwell-Schr\""odinger QED. For all states in
the physical subspace of each of these systems, the charged matter is entangled
with longitudinal photons and Gauss's law holds on the physical subspace as an
operator equation; albeit the electric field operator and the Hamiltonian,
while self-adjoint on the physical subspace, fail to be self-adjoint on the
full tensor-product Hilbert space. Analogues of our coherent state inner
products and of the product picture play a role in the author's matter-gravity
entanglement hypothesis. Also, the product picture amounts to a temporal gauge
quantization of QED which appears to be free from the difficulties of previous
versions.

low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the
typical linear memory growth with depth. Fully reversible networks enable the
training of deep neural networks that take in entire data volumes, and create
semantic segmentations in one go. This approach avoids the need to work in
small patches or map a data patch to the class of just the central pixel. The
cross-entropy loss function requires small modifications to work in conjunction

imperative. Classic stability methods are not well-suited for these dynamic
systems as they involve centralized gathering of information and computation of
the system's eigenvalues, processes which are oftentimes not privacy-preserving
and computationally burdensome. System operators (SOs) would nowadays have to
be able to quickly and efficiently assess small-signal stability as the power
grid operating conditions change more dynamically while also respect the
privacy of the distributed energy resources (DERs). Motivated by all these, in
this paper we introduce a framework that comprises a computationally efficient,
privacy-preserving, distributed and compositional stability assessment method.
Our proposed method first calls for representative agents at various buses to
exchange information with their neighbors and design their local controls in
order to meet some local stability conditions. Following that, the agents are
required to notify the SO whether their local conditions are satisfied or not.
In case the agents cannot verify their local conditions they can augment their
local controls using a global control input. The SO can then warrant stability
of the interconnected power grid by assembling the local stability guarantees,
established by the agents, in a compositional manner. We analytically derive
the local stability conditions and prove that when they are collectively
satisfied stability of the interconnected system ensues. We illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DSA method via a numerical example centered
around a three-bus power grid.

profile derived from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect pressure data. The gas mass

indicates a non-thermal pressure component, p_{nth}, in the cluster outskirts.
The SuperModel analysis shows a ratio alpha(R) (about 50%) of p_{nth} to the
total pressure greater than the values found by simulations, highlighting the
possible presence of accreting substructures and inhomogeneities in the gas
density profile. Once that this profile is corrected for clumpiness, the level
of p_{nth} is considerably reduced. However, a significant turbulence (alpha(R)

strategy with sequence-level teacher-student learning. To obtain low latency,
we design a two-head cltLSTM, in which one head has zero latency and the other
head has a small latency, compared to an LSTM. When trained with Microsoft's 65

numerous high-speed ball catching experiments, where we show a success rate of
85.33%. To the best of our knowledge, this success rate exceeds the reported
performance of existing related systems and sets a new state of the art.

high-level language where the domain-specialist simply specifies the workload
in terms of high-level operations (e.g., matrix-multiply(A, B)), and the
compiler identifies the best implementation fully utilizing the heterogeneous
platform. For creating a compiler that supports productivity, portability, and

available implementations (variants) of the dominant operations (kernels)
contained in the workload on various hardware to decide (a) which variant
should be chosen for each kernel in the workload, and (b) on which hardware
resource the variant should run. To enable the performance prediction, we
propose lightweight augmented neural networks for arbitrary combinations of
kernel-variant-hardware. A key innovation is utilizing the mathematical
complexity of the kernels as a feature to achieve higher accuracy. These models
are compact to reduce training time and fast inference during compile-time and
run-time. Using models with less than 75 parameters, and only 250 training data
instances, we are able to obtain a low MAPE of 3%, significantly outperforming
traditional feed-forward neural networks on 48 kernel-variant-hardware

nonlinearity can be tuned by making purposive samples of different food dyes.
In particular, with appropriately mixing of dye solutions, nonlinear response
arises for otherwise inactive wavelengths, leading to interaction between two

solve linear algebra systems arising from partial differential equations, but
we have recently shown that they are also effective at solving structured
optimization problems. In the proposed scheme, we consider QPs whose algebraic
structure can be represented by graphs. The graph domain is partitioned into
overlapping subdomains (yielding a set of coupled subproblems), solutions for
the subproblems are computed in parallel, and convergence is enforced by
updating primal-dual information in the overlapping regions. We show that
convergence is guaranteed if the overlap is sufficiently large and that the
convergence rate improves exponentially with the size of the overlap.
Convergence results rely on a key property of graph-structured problems that is
known as exponential decay of sensitivity. Here, we establish conditions under
which this property holds for constrained QPs (as those found in network
optimization and optimal control), thus extending existing work that addresses
unconstrained QPs. The numerical behavior of the Schwarz scheme is demonstrated
by using a DC optimal power flow problem defined over a network with 9,241

the use of approximation mechanisms. Such mechanisms in general make extensive
use of the Bayesian priors. In this work, we investigate a question of
increasing theoretical and practical importance: how much prior information is
required to design mechanisms with near-optimal approximations?
  Our first contribution is a more general impossibility result stating that no
meaningful approximation is possible without any prior information, expanding
the famous impossibility result of Myerson and Satterthwaite.
  Our second contribution is that one {\em single sample} (one number per

prove matching upper and lower bounds on the best approximation that can be
obtained with one single sample for subadditive buyers and additive sellers,

  Our third contribution is the design of computationally efficient blackbox
reductions that turn any one-sided mechanism into a two-sided mechanism with a
small loss in the approximation, while using only one single sample from each

are able to host close-in rocky planets. Low-mass stars are the most abundant
stars in the Galaxy and the formation efficiency of their planetary systems is
relevant in the computation of a global probability of finding Earth-like
planets inside habitable zones. Tidal forces and relativistic effects are
relevant in the latest dynamical evolution of planets around low-mass stars and
their effect on the planetary formation efficiency still needs to be addressed.
Our goal is to evaluate the impact of tidal forces and relativistic effects on
the formation of rocky planets around a star close to the substellar mass
limit, in terms of the resulting planetary architectures and its distribution
according to the corresponding evolving habitable zone. Thus, we performed a
set of $N$-body simulations spanning the first 100~Myr of the evolution of two
systems composed respectively by 224 embryos with a total mass 0.25M$_\oplus$
and 74 embryos with a total mass 3 M$_\oplus$ around a central object of
0.08~M$_\odot$. For these two scenarios, we compared the planetary
architectures that result from simulations that are purely gravitational with
those from simulations that include the early contraction and spin-up of the
central object, the distortions and dissipation tidal terms and general
relativistic effects. We found that including these effects allows the
formation and survival of a close-in population located in the habitable zone
of the system. This means that both effects are relevant during the formation
of rocky planets and their early evolution around stars close to the substellar
mass limit, in particular when low-mass planetary embryos are involved.

any alternative proposal $q$. For most voter sets a plurality point does not

the assumption that the completely observed skeletons will be provided. This

is to train a model by maximizing the mutual information between normal and
noisy skeletons using a predictive coding manner. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments about skeleton-based action recognition with defected
skeletons using NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that our approach achieves outstanding performance when
skeleton samples are noised compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

compensate the loss of information. We take the design of parallel structure
for reverse compensation. Meanwhile, the overall computational complexity does
not increase. We further define an Attention Partial Module (APM) operator to
extract weighted features from different scale feature maps generated by the
parallel pyramid structure. Compared with refining through upsampling operator,
APM can better capture the relationship between channels. At last, we proposed
a differentiable auto data augmentation method to further improve estimation
accuracy. We define a new pose search space where the sequences of data
augmentations are formulated as a trainable and operational CNN component.

a user-centric focus, looking for explanations to consider trustworthiness,
comprehensibility, explicit provenance, and context-awareness. In this chapter,
we leverage our survey of explanation literature in Artificial Intelligence and

achieves stable walking without the need for additional sensors on the human.
The key idea is to extract the nominal gait and the human interaction
information from motion capture data, and reconstruct the walking behavior with
a dynamic model of the human-prosthesis system. The walking behavior of a human
wearing a powered prosthesis is obtained through motion capture, which yields
the limb and joint trajectories. Then a nominal trajectory is obtained by
solving a gait optimization problem designed to reconstruct the walking
behavior observed by motion capture. Moreover, the interaction force profiles
between the human and the prosthesis are recovered by simulating the model
following the recorded gaits, which are then used to construct a force tube
that covers all the interaction force profiles. Finally, a robust Control
Lyapunov Function (CLF) Quadratic Programming (QP) controller is designed to
guarantee the convergence to the nominal trajectory under all possible
interaction forces within the tube. Simulation results show this controller's
improved tracking performance with a perturbed force profile compared to other
control methods with less model information.

Hamiltonian, which is fully compatible with quantum annealers. The new control
method is compared with a conventional local control method for a large
50-by-50 city, and the results exhibit the superiority of our global control
method in suppressing traffic imbalance over wide parameter ranges.
Furthermore, the solutions to the global control method obtained with the
quantum annealing machine are better than those obtained with conventional
simulated annealing. In addition, we prove analytically that the local and the
global control methods converge at the limit where cars have equal
probabilities for turning and going straight. These results are verified with

gaps, yielding sticking, and irreversible pore closure. To address the
prospective of functionalization of carbon nanostructure and for accomplishing
this objective, herein, we have studied the performance of functionalized
closed end cap carbon nanotube CNT nanogap embedded electrodes which can
improve the coupling through nonbonding electrons and may provide the
possibility of N and O and H pi interaction with nucleotides, as single

functionalizing the closed end cap CNT6,6 electrodes with purine adenine,
guanine and pyrimidine thymine, cytosine molecules. Weak hydrogen bonds formed
between the probe molecule and target DNA nucleobase enhance the electronic
coupling and temporarily stabilize the translocating nucleobase against the

experimental measurements. The findings of our density functional theory and
non equilibrium Greens function based study indicates that this modeled setup
could allow DNA nucleotide sequencing with a better and reliable yield, giving
current traces that differ by at least 1 order of current magnitude for all

downlink joint transmission (JT) network MIMO systems with imperfect backhaul

mean square errors (MSE), which dominates the average bit error rate (BER)
performance of the system. In the proposed scheme,we first optimize the
precoder at the serving base station (BS), and then sequentially optimize the
precoders of non-serving BSs in the JT set according to the descending order of
their probabilities of participating in JT. The BS-wise sequential optimization
process can improve the system performance when some BSs have to temporarily
quit the JT operations because of poor instant backhaul conditions. Besides,
the precoder of an additional BS is derived in an incremental way, i.e., the
sequentially optimized precoders of previous BSs are fixed, thus the additional
precoder plays an incremental part in the multi-BS JT operations. An iterative
algorithm is designed to jointly optimize the sub-stream precoder and
sub-stream power allocation for each additional BS in the proposed sequential
and incremental optimization scheme. Simulations show that, under the practical
backhaul link conditions, our scheme significantly outperforms the autonomous
global precoding (AGP) scheme in terms of BER performance.

this misalignment can be resolved by a very simple operator called task-aware

TSD decouples them from the spatial dimension by generating two disentangled

attention fusion features for monaural speaker-independent speech separation.
At first, a time-frequency domain speech separation method is applied as the
pre-separation stage. The aim of pre-separation stage is to separate the
mixture preliminarily. Although this stage can separate the mixture, it still
contains the residual interference. In order to enhance the pre-separated
speech and improve the separation performance further, the end-to-end
post-filter (E2EPF) with deep attention fusion features is proposed. The E2EPF
can make full use of the prior knowledge of the pre-separated speech, which
contributes to speech separation. It is a fully convolutional speech separation
network and uses the waveform as the input features. Firstly, the 1-D
convolutional layer is utilized to extract the deep representation features for
the mixture and pre-separated signals in the time domain. Secondly, to pay more
attention to the outputs of the pre-separation stage, an attention module is
applied to acquire deep attention fusion features, which are extracted by
computing the similarity between the mixture and the pre-separated speech.
These deep attention fusion features are conducive to reduce the interference
and enhance the pre-separated speech. Finally, these features are sent to the
post-filter to estimate each target signals. Experimental results on the
WSJ0-2mix dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art speech separation method. Compared with the pre-separation
method, our proposed method can acquire 64.1%, 60.2%, 25.6% and 7.5% relative

recommendations (actions) in order to optimize outcomes (rewards). We focus on
using available historical data for offline learning with unknown data
collection procedures, where a key challenge is the non-random assignment of
recommendations. Moreover, in many business and medical applications,
interpretability of a policy is essential. We study the class of policies with
linear decision boundaries to ensure interpretability, and propose learning
algorithms using tools from causal inference to address unbalanced treatments.
We study several optimization schemes to solve the associated non-convex,
non-smooth optimization problem, and find that a Bayesian optimization
algorithm is effective. We test our algorithm with extensive simulation studies
and apply it to an anonymized online marketplace customer purchase dataset,
where the learned policy outputs a personalized discount recommendation based

coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) should match that of silicon and SiC
composites to reduce the stored elastic strain energy, and thus risk of failure
of these systems. The physical, mechanical, thermodynamic and thermal transport
properties of hafnon have been investigated using a combination of both density
functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental assessments. The average
linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) calculated using the
quasi-harmonic approximation increase from 3.06 10-6 K-1 to 6.36 10-6 K-1, as
the temperature increases from 300 to 1500 K, in agreement with both X-ray
diffraction lattice parameter and dilatometry measurements. The predicted
thermal conductivity from Boltzmann transport theory was approximately 18 W/m.K
at 300K. Both hot disk and laser flash measurements gave a thermal conductivity
of 13.3 W/m.K. This slightly lower value is indicative of residual disorder in
the experimental samples that was absent in the theoretical analysis.

assess the ambient temperature elastic constants and bulk modulus respectively.
The elastic properties obtained by both approaches agreed to within 5%

flows around a bluff body whose shape is defined using a combination of
trigonometric functions with random amplitudes. The present ML-ROMs are trained
on a set of 80 bluff body shapes and tested on a different set of 20 bluff body
shapes not used for training, with both training and test shapes chosen from
the same random distribution. The flow fields are confirmed to be well
reproduced by the present ML-ROM in terms of various statistics. We also focus
on the influence of two main parameters: (1) the latent vector size in the
CNN-AE, and (2) the time step size between the mapped vectors used for the
LSTM. The present results show that the ML-ROM works well even for unseen
shapes of bluff bodies when these parameters are properly chosen, which implies
great potential for the present type of ML-ROM to be applied to more complex
flows

investigate the primary breakup of a gasoline surrogate jet under
non-evaporative ""Spray G"" operating conditions. The Spray G injector and
operating conditions, developed by the Engine Combustion Network (ECN),
represent the early phase of spray-guided gasoline injection. To focus the
computational resources on resolving the primary breakup, simplifications have
been made on the injector geometry. The effect of the internal flow on the
primary breakup is modeled by specifying a nonzero injection angle at the
inlet. The nonzero injection angle results in an increase of the jet
penetration speed and also a deflection of the liquid jet. A parametric study
on the injection angle is performed, and the numerical results are compared to
the experimental data to identify the injection angle that best represents the
Spray G conditions. The nonzero injection angle introduces an azimuthally
non-uniform velocity in the liquid jet, which in turn influences the
instability development on the jet surfaces and also the deformation and
breakup of the jet head. The asymmetric primary breakup dynamics eventually
lead to an azimuthal variation of droplet size distributions. The number of
droplets varies significantly with the azimuthal angle, but interestingly, the
probability density functions (PDF) of droplet size for different azimuthal
angles collapse to a self-similar profile. Analysis has also been conducted to
estimate the percentage and statistics of the tiny droplets that are under
resolved in the present simulation. The PDF of the azimuthal angle is also
presented, which is also shown to exhibit a self-similar form that varies
little over time. Finally, a model is developed to predict the droplet number
as a function of droplet diameter, azimuthal angle where a droplet is located,
and time.

shared feature at the end of the backbone is not appropriate for both
classification and regression, which greatly limits the performance of both
single stage detector and Faster RCNN \cite{ren2015faster} based detector. In
this competition, we observe that even with a shared feature, different
locations in one object has completely inconsistent performances for the two
tasks. \textit{E.g. the features of salient locations are usually good for
classification, while those around the object edge are good for regression.}

classification and regression via the self-learned optimal feature extraction,
which leads to a great improvement. Furthermore, we adjust the soft-NMS
algorithm to adj-NMS to obtain stable performance improvement. Finally, a
well-designed ensemble strategy via voting the bounding box location and

computer vision since skeleton data is more robust to the dynamic circumstance
and complicated background than other modalities. Recently, many researchers
have used the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model spatial-temporal
features of skeleton sequences by an end-to-end optimization. However,
conventional GCNs are feedforward networks which are impossible for low-level
layers to access semantic information in the high-level layers. In this paper,
we propose a novel network, named Feedback Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN).
This is the first work that introduces the feedback mechanism into GCNs and
action recognition. Compared with conventional GCNs, FGCN has the following
advantages: (1) a multi-stage temporal sampling strategy is designed to extract
spatial-temporal features for action recognition in a coarse-to-fine
progressive process; (2) A dense connections based Feedback Graph Convolutional
Block (FGCB) is proposed to introduce feedback connections into the GCNs. It
transmits the high-level semantic features to the low-level layers and flows
temporal information stage by stage to progressively model global
spatial-temporal features for action recognition; (3) The FGCN model provides
early predictions. In the early stages, the model receives partial information
about actions. Naturally, its predictions are relatively coarse. The coarse
predictions are treated as the prior to guide the feature learning of later
stages for a accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the datasets,
NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D120 and Northwestern-UCLA, demonstrate that the proposed
FGCN is effective for action recognition. It achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on the three datasets.

straw tubes. Where data exist in the literature (at 200 and 270 MeV), excellent
agreement of the angular shape was found. The beam polarization of the
presented data was deduced by fitting the absolute scale of the analyzing power
to these references. Our results extend the world data set and are necessary
for polarimetry of future electric dipole moment searches at storage rings.
They will as well serve as an input for theoretical description of polarized

the Schwarzschild spacetime in order to take into account the light bending

appears since the observed luminosity, which exceeds the Eddington luminosity
for the stellar-mass black holes, periodically changes via precession of the
column caused by the rotation of the NS. The PF tends to increase as
$\theta_{\rm obs}$ approaching to $\theta_{\rm B}$, where $\theta_{\rm obs}$
and $\theta_{\rm B}$ are the observer's viewing angle and the polar angle of
the magnetic axis measured from the rotation axis. The maximum PF is around 50

consistent with observations of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) with few

Several PML solutions have been proposed to combat with the prone misled by the
irrelevant labels concealed in the candidate labels, but they generally focus
on the smoothness assumption in feature space or low-rank assumption in label
space, while ignore the negative information between features and labels.
Specifically, if two instances have largely overlapped candidate labels,
irrespective of their feature similarity, their ground-truth labels should be
similar; while if they are dissimilar in the feature and candidate label space,
their ground-truth labels should be dissimilar with each other. To achieve a
credible predictor on PML data, we propose a novel approach called PML-LFC
(Partial Multi-label Learning with Label and Feature Collaboration). PML-LFC
estimates the confidence values of relevant labels for each instance using the
similarity from both the label and feature spaces, and trains the desired
predictor with the estimated confidence values. PML-LFC achieves the predictor

bandwidth consumption can be reduced. In this paper, we propose OFB-VR (Optical
Flow Based VR), an interactive method of VR streaming that can make use of VR
users' QoE awareness to ease the bandwidth pressure. The Just-Noticeable
Difference through Optical Flow Estimation (JND-OFE) is explored to quantify
users' awareness of quality distortion in 360-degree videos. Accordingly, a

proposed. With the help of PSNR-OF, OFB-VR proposes a versatile-size tiling
scheme to lessen the tiling overhead. A Reinforcement Learning(RL) method is
implemented to make use of historical data to perform Adaptive BitRate(ABR).
For evaluation, we take two prior VR streaming schemes, Pano and Plato, as
baselines. Vast evaluations show that our system can increase the mean PSNR-OF
score by 9.5-15.8% while maintaining the same rebuffer ratio compared with Pano

datasets. In this paper, we focus on extending deep SNNs to object tracking, a
more advanced vision task with embedded applications and energy-saving
requirements, and present a spike-based Siamese network called SiamSNN.
Specifically, we propose an optimized hybrid similarity estimation method to
exploit temporal information in the SNNs, and introduce a novel two-status
coding scheme to optimize the temporal distribution of output spike trains for
further improvements. SiamSNN is the first deep SNN tracker that achieves short
latency and low precision loss on the visual object tracking benchmarks
OTB2013/2015, VOT2016/2018, and GOT-10k. Moreover, SiamSNN achieves notably low
energy consumption and real-time on Neuromorphic chip TrueNorth.

of tissue repair due to increasing health demands. Improved non-invasive
methods are required for monitoring tissue development assisted by
bioelastomers. In this paper, we present a novel theory of fluid-solid coupling
in a porous medium for application to the ultrasonic evaluation of tissue
remodeling using bioelastomers. The common assumption of equal solid and liquid
displacements used in the conventional description of a fluid-saturated porous
solid cannot be applied to soft media, such as bioelastomers. We revise the
geoacoustic theory of Biot to allow for relative motion between a fluid and a
solid in an aggregate and derive an expression for a characteristic fluid-solid
coupling parameter. Unlike the conventional method, the propagation speed of
shear waves observed by ultrasound shear wave elastography is considered a
known quantity in the novel theory, and the calculated value of the coupling
parameter is used to evaluate the status of tissue repair. The model is
validated by analyzing selected cases. The conditions under which the model can
be applied are identified. However, further development of the theory is
required to extract dynamic parameters that can be used to monitor the entire
tissue remodeling process. In this paper, a theoretical approach is developed
that can be used to analyze the mechanics of tissue repair. The theory has
potential applications in the field of acellular in situ tissue engineering for
non-invasive monitoring of the complex mechanical remodeling process of tissue
regeneration and bioelastomer degradation.

spin qubits made in semiconductor quantum dots. At variance with other
mechanisms such as charge noise, phonons are intrinsic to the device and can
hardly be mitigated. They set, therefore fundamental limits to the relaxation
time of the qubits. Here we introduce a general framework for the calculation
of the spin (and charge) transition rates induced by bulk (3D) and strongly
confined 1D or 2D phonons. We discuss the particular case of hole spin-orbit
qubits described by the 6 bands kp model. We next apply this theory to a hole
qubit in a silicon-on-insulator device. We show that spin relaxation in this
device is dominated by a band mixing term that couples the holes to transverse
acoustic phonons through the valence band deformation potential d, and optimize
the bias point and magnetic field orientation to maximize the number of Rabi
oscillations Q that can be achieved within on relaxation time T1. Despite the
strong spin-orbit coupling in the valence band, the phonon-limited Q can reach
a few tens of thousands. We next explore the effects of phonon confinement in
1D and 2D structures, and the impact of the encapsulation materials on the
relaxation rates. We show that the spin lifetimes can depend on the structure
of the device over micrometer-long length scales and that they improve when the
materials around the qubit get harder. Phonon engineering in semiconductor
qubits may therefore become relevant once the extrinsic sources of relaxation

dimensionality of multivariate B-splines by representing the high-dimensional
weight tensor as a low-rank approximation. An iterative algorithm based on the
alternating linear scheme is developed to directly estimate the low-rank tensor
network approximation, removing the need to ever explicitly construct the
exponentially large weight tensor. This reduces the computational and storage
complexity significantly, allowing the identification of NARX systems with a
large number of inputs and lags. The proposed algorithm is numerically stable,
robust to noise, guaranteed to monotonically converge, and allows the
straightforward incorporation of regularization. The TNBS-NARX model is
validated through the identification of the cascaded watertank benchmark
nonlinear system, on which it achieves state-of-the-art performance while
identifying a 16-dimensional B-spline surface in 4 seconds on a standard

critically analyze headlines regarding their trustworthiness. Further, the game
follows a ""learning by doing strategy"": by generating own fake headlines, users

low threshold, hydrogen diffuses out of the lattice. Thus showing a dynamic
behavior on the time scale of the $^{57}$Fe 14.4 keV state. The surrounding
oxygen vacancies favor the high-spin Fe$^{2+}$ state. The sample treated at
room temperature shows two distinct processes of hydrogen motion. The motion
commences with the interstitial hydrogen, followed by switching to the
covalently bound state. Hydrogen out-diffusion is hindered by bulk defects,
which could cause both processes to overlap. Supplementary UV-Vis and
electrical conductivity measurements show an improved electrical conductivity
and higher optical absorption after the hydrogenation. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy at room temperature reveals that the sample hydrogenated at 573 K

dissipation due to the interaction with the environment, under Kibble-Zurek
(KZ) protocols in which one Hamiltonian parameter is slowly, and linearly in
time, driven across the critical value of a zero-temperature quantum
transition. In particular we address whether, and under which conditions, open
quantum systems can develop a universal dynamic scaling regime similar to that
emerging in closed systems. We focus on a class of dissipative mechanisms whose
dynamics can be reliably described through a Lindblad master equation governing
the time evolution of the system's density matrix. We argue that a dynamic
scaling limit exists even in the presence of dissipation, whose main features
are controlled by the universality class of the quantum transition. This
requires a particular tuning of the dissipative interactions, whose decay rate
$u$ should scale as $u\sim t_s^{-\kappa}$ with increasing the time scale $t_s$
of the KZ protocol, where the exponent $\kappa = z/(y_\mu+z)$ depends on the
dynamic exponent $z$ and the renormalization-group dimension $y_\mu$ of the
driving Hamiltonian parameter. Our dynamic scaling arguments are supported by
numerical results for KZ protocols applied to a one-dimensional fermionic wire
undergoing a quantum transition in the same universality class of the quantum
Ising chain, in the presence of dissipative mechanisms which include local
pumping, decay, and dephasing.

each time step, which in real-time applications makes it important to solve
these optimization problems efficiently and to have good upper bounds on
worst-case solution time. Often for linear MPC problems, the optimization
problem in question is a quadratic program (QP) that depends on parameters such
as system states and reference signals. A popular class of methods for solving
such QPs is active-set methods, where a sequence of linear systems of equations
is solved. We propose an algorithm for computing which sequence of subproblems
an active-set algorithm will solve, for every parameter of interest. By knowing
these sequences, a worst-case bound on how many iterations, and ultimately the
maximum time, the active-set algorithm requires to converge can be determined.
The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated on a set of QPs,
originating from MPC problems, by computing the exact worst-case number of
iterations primal and dual active-set algorithms require to reach optimality.

conclude by comparing the performance of our three-level quantum heat engine in

attention for fast and accurate virtual screening systems. For decision makings

classification system as probability, since such interpretation allows them to
filter out more desirable compounds. However, probabilistic interpretation
cannot be correct for models that hold over-parameterization problems or
inappropriate regularizations, leading to unreliable prediction and decision
making. In this regard, we concern the reliability of neural prediction models
on molecular properties, especially when models are trained with sparse data
points and imbalanced distributions. This work aims to propose guidelines for
training reliable models, we thus provide methodological details and ablation
studies on the following train principles. We investigate the effects of model
architectures, regularization methods, and loss functions on the prediction
performance and reliability of classification results. Moreover, we evaluate
prediction reliability of models on virtual screening scenario. Our result
highlights that correct choice of regularization and inference methods is
evidently important to achieve high success rate, especially in data imbalanced
situation. All experiments were performed under a single unified model
implementation to alleviate external randomness in model training and to enable

difficulty adds up further when objects are represented by 3D point clouds,

unknown category. In order to do so, we model shapes defined by the keypoints,
within a category, using the symmetric linear basis shapes without assuming the
plane of symmetry to be known. The usage of symmetry prior leads us to learn
stable keypoints suitable for higher misalignments. To the best of our

password-based authentication. RBA monitors additional implicit features during
password entry such as device or geolocation information, and requests
additional authentication factors if a certain risk level is detected. RBA is
recommended by the NIST digital identity guidelines, is used by several large
online services, and offers protection against security risks such as password
database leaks, credential stuffing, insecure passwords and large-scale
guessing attacks. Despite its relevance, the procedures used by
RBA-instrumented online services are currently not disclosed. Consequently,
there is little scientific research about RBA, slowing down progress and deeper
understanding, making it harder for end users to understand the security
provided by the services they use and trust, and hindering the widespread
adoption of RBA.
  In this paper, with a series of studies on eight popular online services, we
(i) analyze which features and combinations/classifiers are used and are useful
in practical instances, (ii) develop a framework and a methodology to measure
RBA in the wild, and (iii) survey and discuss the differences in the user
interface for RBA. Following this, our work provides a first deeper
understanding of practical RBA deployments and helps fostering further research
in this direction.

  In the first fold, a new notion which we call weighted federated learning

The weighted federated learning concept formalized in this paper differs from
that presented in McMahan et al.'s paper since both addition and multiplication

decoupling formulation may benefit machine learning developers to select their
best security practices from the state-of-the-art security tool sets;

guaranteed by the security composition theorem assuming that the underlying

gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken, they can be generated through the
Yukawa couplings to newly introduced particles, such as vector-like lepton
doublets and singlet, and scalar singlets. It is found that the same Yukawa
couplings combined with the new scalar couplings to the Higgs can induce the

$g-2$, where the lepton $g-2$ is proportional to $m_{\ell}$. When Majorana
fermions and a scalar singlet are further added into the model, the active

an order of $10^{-9}$. In addition, when the $\mu\to e \gamma$ decay is

universal within the Milky Way galaxy, it is strongly suspected to be different
in the primordial Universe, where molecular hydrogen cooling is less efficient
and the gas temperature can be higher by a factor of 30. In between these
extreme cases, the gas temperature varies depending on the environment,
metallicity and radiation background. In this paper we explore if changes of
the gas temperature affect the IMF of the stars considering fragmentation and
accretion. The fragmentation behavior depends mostly on the Jeans mass at the
turning point in the equation of state where a transition occurs from an
approximately isothermal to an adiabatic regime due to dust opacities. The
Jeans mass at this transition in the equation of state is always very similar,
independent of the initial temperature, and therefore the initial mass of the
fragments is very similar. Accretion on the other hand is strongly temperature
dependent. We argue that the latter becomes the dominant process for star
formation efficiencies above 5 - 7 %, increasing the average mass of the stars.

been proposed to reconstruct intensity images from event streams. However, the
outputs are still in low resolution (LR), noisy, and unrealistic. The
low-quality outputs stem broader applications of event cameras, where high
spatial resolution (HR) is needed as well as high temporal resolution, dynamic
range, and no motion blur. We consider the problem of reconstructing and
super-resolving intensity images from LR events, when no ground truth (GT) HR
images and down-sampling kernels are available. To tackle the challenges, we
propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that reconstructs LR images from event
streams, enhances the image qualities and upsamples the enhanced images, called
EventSR. For the absence of real GT images, our method is primarily
unsupervised, deploying adversarial learning. To train EventSR, we create an
open dataset including both real-world and simulated scenes. The use of both
datasets boosts up the network performance, and the network architectures and
various loss functions in each phase help improve the image qualities. The
whole pipeline is trained in three phases. While each phase is mainly for one
of the three tasks, the networks in earlier phases are fine-tuned by respective
loss functions in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that EventSR
reconstructs high-quality SR images from events for both simulated and

we additionally enlarge the boundaries between confusing positive samples and
normal ones, between confusing negative samples and normal ones with predefined
margins, by exploiting the structured information of all samples in each
modality.Moreover, a cross-modality constraint is employed to reduce the
difference between modalities and push positive samples closer to the anchor
than negative ones from two modalities.In addition, to achieve quality-aware
RGB and thermal feature fusion, we introduce the modality attentions and learn
them using a feature fusion module in our network. Extensive experiments on

multiplexing scenario of two distinct 5G services, namely Ultra-Reliable Low
Latency Communications (URLLC) and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB). While eMBB
services focus on high data rates, URLLC is very strict in terms of latency and
reliability. In view of this, the resource slicing problem is formulated as an
optimization problem that aims at maximizing the eMBB data rate subject to a
URLLC reliability constraint, while considering the variance of the eMBB data
rate to reduce the impact of immediately scheduled URLLC traffic on the eMBB
reliability. To solve the formulated problem, an optimization-aided Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework is proposed, including: 1) eMBB
resource allocation phase, and 2) URLLC scheduling phase. In the first phase,
the optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems and then each
subproblem is transformed into a convex form to obtain an approximate resource
allocation solution. In the second phase, a DRL-based algorithm is proposed to
intelligently distribute the incoming URLLC traffic among eMBB users.
Simulation results show that our proposed approach can satisfy the stringent
URLLC reliability while keeping the eMBB reliability higher than 90%.

edges represent comparisons of treatments in trials. Outcomes of Bayesian NMA
include estimates of treatment effects, and the probabilities that each
treatment is ranked best, second best and so on. How exactly network geometry
affects the accuracy and precision of these outcomes is not fully understood.
Here we carry out a simulation study and find that disparity in the number of
trials involving different treatments leads to a systematic bias in estimated
rank probabilities. This bias is associated with an increased variation in the
precision of treatment effect estimates. Using ideas from the theory of complex
networks, we define a measure of `degree irregularity' to quantify asymmetry in
the number of studies involving each treatment. Our simulations indicate that
more regular networks have more precise treatment effect estimates and smaller
bias of rank probabilities. We also find that degree regularity is a better
indicator of NMA quality than both the total number of studies in a network and
the disparity in the number of trials per comparison. These results have
implications for planning future trials. We demonstrate that choosing trials

the well-known drone simulator, AirSim, with a cinematic camera as well as
extended its API to control all of its parameters in real time, including
various filming lenses and common cinematographic properties. In this paper, we

lattice spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, focus on the
intermediate parameter region, where a quantum paramagnetic phase sets in, and
consider the columnar valence-bond solid phase. Within the bond-operator

of triplet operators $t$. The effective boson model is studied at the harmonic
approximation and the energy of the triplons and the expansion of the triplon
operators $b$ in terms of the triplet operators $t$ are determined. Such an
expansion allows us to performed a second mapping, and therefore, determine an
effective interacting boson model in terms of the triplon operators $b$. We
then consider systems with a fixed number of triplons and determined the
ground-state energy and the spectrum of elementary excitations within a
mean-field approximation. We show that many-triplon states are stable, the
lowest-energy ones are constituted by a small number of triplons, and the
excitation gaps are finite. For $J_2=0.48 J_1$ and $J_2=0.52 J_1$, we also
calculate spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlation functions, dimer order
parameters, and the bipartite von Neumann entanglement entropy within our
mean-field formalism in order to determine the properties of the many-triplon
state as a function of the triplon number. We find that the spin and the dimer
correlations decay exponentially and that the entanglement entropy obeys an
area law, regardless the triplon number. Moreover, only for $J_2=0.48 J_1$, the
spin correlations indicate that the many-triplon states with large triplon

the singlet fermion, which is the dark matter candidate, annihilates via this

lepton-specific 2HDM and a suitable high value of $\tan\beta$. We identify the
model parameter space which explains the muon g-2 anomaly while evading the
experimental constraints. After establishing the viability of the singlet
fermion to be a dark matter candidate, we calculate the positron excess
produced from its annihilation to the light bosons which primarily decay to
muons. Incorporating the Sommerfeld effect caused by the light mediator and an
appropriate boost factor, we find that our proposed model can satisfactorily
explain the positron fraction excess as well as the positron spectrum data

linked to the vertical profile of optical turbulence. Firstly, a sufficient
number of discrete turbulent layers must be reconstructed to model the true
continuous turbulence profile. Secondly over the course of an observation, the
profile as seen by the telescope changes and the tomographic reconstructor must
be updated. These changes can be due to the unpredictable evolution of
turbulent layers on meteorological timescales as short as minutes. Here we
investigate the effect of changing atmospheric conditions on the quality of
tomographic reconstruction by coupling fast analytical adaptive optics
simulation to a large database of 10 691 high resolution turbulence profiles
measured over two years by the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at ESO Paranal, Chile.
This work represents the first investigation of these effects with a large,
statistically significant sample of turbulence profiles. The statistical nature
of the study allows us to assess not only the degradation and variability in
tomographic error with a set of system parameters (e.g. number of layers,
temporal update period) but also the required parameters to meet some error
threshold. In the most challenging conditions where the profile is rapidly
changing, these parameters must be far more tightly constrained in order to
meet this threshold. By providing estimates of these constraints for a wide
range of system geometries as well as the impact of different temporal

data by scribbles, which only costs 1$\sim$2 seconds to label one image.
However, using scribble labels to learn salient object detection has not been
explored. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised salient object
detection model to learn saliency from such annotations. In doing so, we first
relabel an existing large-scale salient object detection dataset with
scribbles, namely S-DUTS dataset. Since object structure and detail information
is not identified by scribbles, directly training with scribble labels will
lead to saliency maps of poor boundary localization. To mitigate this problem,
we propose an auxiliary edge detection task to localize object edges
explicitly, and a gated structure-aware loss to place constraints on the scope
of structure to be recovered. Moreover, we design a scribble boosting scheme to
iteratively consolidate our scribble annotations, which are then employed as
supervision to learn high-quality saliency maps. As existing saliency
evaluation metrics neglect to measure structure alignment of the predictions,
the saliency map ranking metric may not comply with human perception. We
present a new metric, termed saliency structure measure, to measure the
structure alignment of the predicted saliency maps, which is more consistent
with human perception. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing
weakly-supervised/unsupervised methods, but also is on par with several
fully-supervised state-of-the-art models. Our code and data is publicly

available. To extend the study to a wider parameter range, we derived the
properties of flicker noise using Kepler observations and studied their
dependence on stellar parameters. Finally, we predicted the limiting stellar
apparent magnitude for which the properties of the flicker noise can be
extracted using high-precision CHEOPS and PLATO observations. Stellar
granulation is a stochastic colored noise, and is stationary with respect to
the stellar magnetic cycle. Both the flicker correlation timescales and
amplitudes increase with the stellar mass and radius. If these correlations are
not taken into account when fitting for the parameters of transiting
exoplanets, this can bias the inferred parameters. In particular, we find
errors of up to 10$\%$ on $R_p/R_s$ for an Earth-sized planet orbiting a
Sun-like star. For F and G stars, flicker will significantly affect the
inferred parameters of transits observed with CHEOPS and PLATO. Dedicated
modeling strategies need to be developed to accurately characterize both the
star and the transiting exoplanets.

specific voter cohort or demographic (factor). Like the hierarchical Dirichlet
process, NDMs rely on two tiers of Dirichlet processes to explain the data with
an unknown number of latent factors; each observation is modeled as a weighted
average of these latent factors. Unlike existing models, NDMs recover how
factor distributions vary locally for each observation. This uniquely allows
NDMs both to deconvolve each observation into its constituent factors, and also
to describe how the factor distributions specific to each observation vary
across observations and deviate from the corresponding global factors. We
present variational inference techniques for this family of models and study
its performance on simulated data and voting data from California. We show that

LiDAR-based systems typically try to match the last measurements obtained with
a previously recorded map of the area. If the existing map is not updated along
time, there is a good chance that the measures will not match the environment
well enough, causing the vehicle to lose track of its location. In this paper,
we present and analyze experimental results regarding the robustness and
precision of a map-matching based localization system over a certain period of
time in the following three cases: (1) without any update of the initial map,
(2) updating the map as the vehicle moves and (3) with map updates that take
into account surrounding structures labeled as ""fixed"" which are treated
differently. The environment of the tests is a busy parking area, which ensures
drastic changes from one day to the next. The precision is obtained by
comparing the positions computed using the map with the ones provided by a
Real-Time Kinematic GPS system. The experimental results reveal a positioning
error of about 6cm which remains stable even after 23 days when using fixed

  Real Response Approximation",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Obtaining a realistic and accurate model of the longitudinal dynamics is key
for a good speed control of a self-driving car. It is also useful to simulate
the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle with high fidelity. In this paper, a
straightforward and generic method for obtaining the friction, braking and
propulsion forces as a function of speed, throttle input and brake input is
proposed. Experimental data is recorded during tests over the full speed range
to estimate the forces, to which the corresponding curves are adjusted. A
simple and direct balance of forces in the direction tangent to the ground is
used to obtain an estimation of the real forces involved. Then a model composed
of approximate spline curves that fit the results is proposed. Using splines to
model the dynamic response has the advantage of being quick and accurate,
avoiding the complexity of parameter identification and tuning of non-linear
responses embedding the internal functionalities of the car, like ABS or
regenerative brake. This methodology has been applied to LS2N's electric
Renault Zoe but can be applied to any other electric car. As shown in the
experimental section, a comparison between the estimated acceleration of the
car using the model and the real one over a wide range of speeds along a trip
of about $10km/h$ reveals only $0.35m/s^2$ of error standard deviation in a
range of $\pm{2}m/s^2$ which is very encouraging.

reconstruct images from accelerated magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition.
Although these approaches provide significant performance gain compared to
compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI), it is not clear how to choose a suitable
network architecture to balance the trade-off between network complexity and
performance. Recently, it was shown that an encoder-decoder convolutional
neural network (CNN) can be interpreted as a piecewise linear basis-like
representation, whose specific representation is determined by the ReLU
activation patterns for a given input image. Thus, the expressivity or the
representation power is determined by the number of piecewise linear regions.
As an extension of this geometric understanding, this paper proposes a
systematic geometric approach using bootstrapping and subnetwork aggregation
using an attention module to increase the expressivity of the underlying neural

inference model that infers likely latent codes for each data point (Kingma and
Welling, 2013). Recent work shows that traditional training methods tend to
yield solutions that violate modeling desiderata: (1) the learned generative
model captures the observed data distribution but does so while ignoring the
latent codes, resulting in codes that do not represent the data (e.g. van den
Oord et al. (2017); Kim et al. (2018)); (2) the aggregate of the learned latent
codes does not match the prior p(z). This mismatch means that the learned
generative model will be unable to generate realistic data with samples from
p(z)(e.g. Makhzani et al. (2015); Tomczak and Welling (2017)). In this paper,
we demonstrate that both issues stem from the fact that the global optima of
the VAE training objective often correspond to undesirable solutions. Our
analysis builds on two observations: (1) the generative model is unidentifiable
- there exist many generative models that explain the data equally well, each
with different (and potentially unwanted) properties and (2) bias in the VAE
objective - the VAE objective may prefer generative models that explain the
data poorly but have posteriors that are easy to approximate. We present a
novel inference method, LiBI, mitigating the problems identified in our
analysis. On synthetic datasets, we show that LiBI can learn generative models
that capture the data distribution and inference models that better satisfy
modeling assumptions when traditional methods struggle to do so.

untrimmed video and producing textual description (captions) for each localized
event. Most of the previous works in dense video captioning are solely based on
visual information and completely ignore the audio track. However, audio, and
speech, in particular, are vital cues for a human observer in understanding an
environment. In this paper, we present a new dense video captioning approach
that is able to utilize any number of modalities for event description.
Specifically, we show how audio and speech modalities may improve a dense video
captioning model. We apply automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to obtain
a temporally aligned textual description of the speech (similar to subtitles)
and treat it as a separate input alongside video frames and the corresponding
audio track. We formulate the captioning task as a machine translation problem
and utilize recently proposed Transformer architecture to convert multi-modal
input data into textual descriptions. We demonstrate the performance of our
model on ActivityNet Captions dataset. The ablation studies indicate a
considerable contribution from audio and speech components suggesting that
these modalities contain substantial complementary information to video frames.
Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the ActivityNet Caption results
by leveraging the category tags obtained from original YouTube videos. Code is

$D^{0}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\eta$. The analysis is performed on a data set
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 953 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ collected by
the Belle detector at the asymmetric-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ KEKB collider. The
Dalitz plot is well described by a combination of the six resonant decay
channels $\bar{K}^{*}(892)^0\eta$, $K^{-}a_0(980)^+$, $K^{-}a_2(1320)^+$,
$\bar{K}^{*}(1410)^0\eta$, $K^{*}(1680)^-\pi^{+}$ and $K_2^{*}(1980)^-\pi^{+}$,
together with $K\pi$ and $K\eta$ S-wave components. The decays
$K^{*}(1680)^{-}\to K^{-}\eta$ and $K_{2}^{*}(1980)^{-}\to K^{-}\eta$ are
observed for the first time. We measure ratio of the branching fractions,
$\frac{\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\eta)}{\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\to
K^{-}\pi^{+})}=0.500\pm0.002{\rm(stat)}\pm0.020{\rm(syst)}\pm0.003{\rm

$\frac{\mathcal{B}(K^{*}(1680)\to K\eta)}{\mathcal{B}(K^{*}(1680)\to K\pi)}$ is
measured to be
$0.11\pm0.02{\rm(stat)}^{+0.06}_{-0.04}{\rm(syst)}\pm0.04{\rm(\mathcal{B}_{\text{PDG}})}$;
this is much lower than the theoretical expectations ($\approx1$) made under
the assumption that $K^{*}(1680)$ is a pure $1^{3}D_1$ state. The product
branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D^0\to [K_2^{*}(1980)^-\to
K^{-}\eta]\pi^{+})=(2.2^{+1.7}_{-1.9})\times10^{-4}$ is determined. In
addition, the $\pi\eta^{\prime}$ contribution to the $a_0(980)^{\pm}$ resonance
shape is confirmed with 10.1$\sigma$ statistical significance using the
three-channel Flatt\'{e} model. We also measure
$\mathcal{B}(D^0\to\bar{K}^{*}(892)^0\eta)=(1.41^{+0.13}_{-0.12})\%$. This is
consistent with, and more precise than, the current world average
$(1.02\pm0.30)\%$, deviates with a significance of more than $3\sigma$ from the
theoretical predictions of (0.51-0.92)%.

provides significant benefits for correctness and manageability. Unfortunately,
the adoption of strongly-consistent replication protocols has been curbed due
to their limited scalability and performance. To alleviate the leader
bottleneck in strongly-consistent replication protocols, we introduce Pig, an
in-protocol communication aggregation and piggybacking technique. Pig employs
randomly selected nodes from follower subgroups to relay the leader's message
to the rest of the followers in the subgroup, and to perform in-network
aggregation of acknowledgments back from these followers. By randomly
alternating the relay nodes across replication operations, Pig shields the
relay nodes as well as the leader from becoming hotspots and improves
throughput scalability.
  We showcase Pig in the context of classical Paxos protocols employed for
strongly consistent replication by many cloud computing services and databases.
We implement and evaluate PigPaxos, in comparison to Paxos and EPaxos protocols
under various workloads over clusters of size 5 to 25 nodes. We show that the
aggregation at the relay has little latency overhead, and PigPaxos can provide
more than 3 folds improved throughput over Paxos and EPaxos with little latency
deterioration. We support our experimental observations with the analytical
modeling of the bottlenecks and show that the rotating of the relay nodes
provides the most benefit for reducing the bottlenecks and that the throughput
is maximized when employing only 1 randomly rotating relay node.

expensive and cumbersome procedure. Consequently, image denoising algorithms
are mostly developed and evaluated on synthetic data that is usually generated
with a widespread assumption of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While the
CNNs achieve impressive results on these synthetic datasets, they do not
perform well when applied on real camera images, as reported in recent
benchmark datasets. This is mainly because the AWGN is not adequate for
modeling the real camera noise which is signal-dependent and heavily
transformed by the camera imaging pipeline. In this paper, we present a
framework that models camera imaging pipeline in forward and reverse
directions. It allows us to produce any number of realistic image pairs for
denoising both in RAW and sRGB spaces. By training a new image denoising
network on realistic synthetic data, we achieve the state-of-the-art
performance on real camera benchmark datasets. The parameters in our model are
~5 times lesser than the previous best method for RAW denoising. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the proposed framework generalizes beyond image denoising

accreting black holes. They are launched with a significant amount of magnetic
energy, which can be dissipated to accelerate nonthermal particles and give
rise to electromagnetic radiation at larger scales. Kink instabilities can be
an efficient mechanism to trigger dissipation of jet magnetic energy. While
previous works have studied the conditions required for the growth of kink
instabilities in relativistic jets, the radiation signatures of these
instabilities have not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we aim to
self-consistently study radiation and polarization signatures from kink
instabilities in relativistic jets. We combine large-scale relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations with polarized radiation transfer of a
magnetized jet, which emerges from the central engine and propagates through
the surrounding medium. We observe that a localized region at the central spine
of the jet exhibits the strongest kink instabilities, which we identify as the
jet emission region. Very interestingly, we find quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) signatures in the light curve from the emission region. Additionally, the
polarization degree appears to be anti-correlated to flares in the light
curves. Our analyses show that these QPO signatures are intrinsically driven by
kink instabilities, where the period of the QPOs is associated to the kink
growth time scale. The latter corresponds to weeks to months QPOs in blazars.
The polarization signatures offer unique diagnostics for QPOs driven by kink
instabilities.

black hole solution by using the Newman-Janis algorithm, and then study the
shadow cast by non-rotating and rotating Gauss-Bonnet black holes. The result
indicates that positive Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter shrinks the shadow,
while negative one enlarges it. Meanwhile, both the distortion and ratio of two
diameters of the shadow are found to increase with the coupling parameter for
certain spin. Comparing with the Kerr black hole, the shadow gets more
distorted for positive coupling parameter, and less distorted for negative one.
Furthermore, we calculate angular diameter of the shadow by making use of the
observation of M87*. The result indicates that negative dimensionless
Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter in (-4.5, 0) is more favored. Therefore, our
result gives a first constraint to the Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We believe further

properties and the dynamics of a single anharmonic vibrational mode interacting
with a quantized infrared cavity field in the strong and ultrastrong coupling
regimes. By comparing multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH)
simulations for a Morse oscillator in a cavity, with an equivalent formulation
of the problem in Hilbert space, we describe for the first time the essential
role of permanent dipole moments in the femtosecond dynamics of vibrational
polariton wavepackets. We show that depending on the shape of the electric
dipole function $d_e(q)$ along the vibrational mode coordinate $q$, molecules
can be classified into three general families. For molecules that are polar and
have a positive slope of the dipole function at equilibrium, we show that an
initial diabatic light-matter product state without vibrational or cavity
excitations can evolve into a polariton wavepacket with a large number of
intracavity photons, for interaction strengths at the onset of ultrastrong
coupling. This build up of intracavity photon amplitude is accompanied by an
effective $lengthening$ of the vibrational mode of nearly $10\%$, comparable
with a laser-induced vibrational excitation in free space. In contrast,
molecules that are also polar at equilibrium but have a negative slope of the
dipole function, experience an effective mode $shortening$ under equivalent
coupling conditions. Our model predictions are numerically validated using
realistic $ab$-$initio$ potentials and dipole functions for HF and CO$_2$
molecules in their ground electronic states. We finally propose a non-adiabatic
state preparation scheme to generate vibrational polaritons using nanoscale
infrared antennas and UV-vis photochemistry or electron tunneling, to enable
the far-field detection of spontaneously generated infrared quantum light.

reflectance spectra are the key spectral parameters in its mineralogical
studies. Generally, these spectral parameters can be obtained by exploiting the
Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) with a proper continuum removal. However,
different continua may change the deconvolution results of these parameters.
This paper investigates the diagnostic spectral features of olivine with
diverse chemical compositions. Four different continuum removal methods with
MGM for getting the deconvolution results are presented and the regression
equations for predicting the Mg-number (Fo#) are introduced. The results show
that different continua superimposed on the mineral absorption features will
make the absorption center shift, as well as the obvious alterations in shape,
width, and strength of the absorption band. Additionally, it is also found that
the logarithm of a second-order polynomial continuum can match the overall
shape of the spectrum in logarithmic space, and the improved regression
equations applied to estimate the chemical composition of olivine-dominated
spectra also have a better performance. As an application example, the improved
approach is applied to pulse laser irradiated olivine grains to simulate and
study the space weathering effects on olivine diagnostic spectral features. The
experiments confirm that space weathering can make the absorption band center
shift toward longer wavelength. Therefore, the Fo# estimated from remote
sensing spectra may be less than its actual chemical composition. These results
may provide valuable information for revealing the difference between the
spectra of olivine grains and olivine-dominated asteroids.

fixed start and end times. A vehicle must be used for a full trip of a user
from depot to depot. We aim at assigning vehicles to user trips so as to

system dynamics, various spatial and temporal couplings as well as multiple

integrated. The upper level computes zone mass flow rates for maintaining zone
thermal comfort with minimal energy cost, and then the lower level
strategically regulates zone mass flow rates and the ventilation rate to
achieve IAQ while preserving the near energy saving performance of upper level.
As both the upper and lower level computation are deployed in a distributed
manner, the proposed method is scalable and computationally efficient. The
near-optimal performance of the method in energy cost saving is demonstrated
through comparison with the centralized method. In addition, the comparisons
with the existing distributed method show that our method can provide IAQ with

demonstrate our method outperforms the demand controlled ventilation strategies

  Aims. We investigate the effect of the obliquity of a mixed (poloidal and
toroidal) dipolar internal fossil magnetic field with respect to the rotation
axis on the frequency of gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars.
  Methods. We use the traditional approximation of rotation to compute
non-magnetic modes, and a perturbative treatment of the magnetic field to
compute the corresponding frequency shifts. We apply the new formalism to HD
43317, a magnetic, rapidly rotating, slowly pulsating B-type star, whose field
has an obliquity angle of about 80{\deg}.
  Results. We find that frequency shifts induced by the magnetic field on
high-radial-order gravity modes are larger with increasing obliquity angle,
when the magnetic axis is closer to the equatorial region, where these modes
are trapped. The maximum value is reached for an obliquity angle of 90{\deg}.
This trend is observed for all mode geometries.
  Conclusions. Our results predict that the signature of an internal oblique
dipolar magnetic field is detectable using asteroseismology of gravity modes.

increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for

with atmospheres. The Shapeshifter is a collection of simple and affordable
robotic units, called Cobots, comparable to personal palm-size quadcopters. By
attaching and detaching with each other, multiple Cobots can shape-shift into
novel structures, capable of (a) rolling on the surface, to increase the
traverse range, (b) flying in a flight array formation, and (c) swimming on or
under liquid. A ground station complements the robotic platform, hosting
science instrumentation and providing power to recharge the batteries of the
Cobots. Our Phase I study had the objective of providing an initial assessment
of the feasibility of the proposed robotic platform architecture, and in
particular (a) to characterize the expected science return of a mission to the
Sotra-Patera region on Titan; (b) to verify the mechanical and algorithmic
feasibility of building a multi-agent platform capable of flying, docking,
rolling and un-docking; (c) to evaluate the increased range and efficiency of
rolling on Titan w.r.t to flying; (d) to define a case-study of a mission for
the exploration of the cryovolcano Sotra-Patera on Titan, whose expected
variety of geological features challenges conventional mobility platforms.

two steps. In the prediction step, an approximation of the pseudospectral

bisection algorithm relies on checking the presence of the imaginary axis
eigenvalues of a complex matrix, similar to the delay free case. In the

been the conventional Kitaev wire and its realizations. In this work, we study
the edge states in coupled p-wave platforms in 1D, in the presence of
experimentally relevant perturbations, like a Zeeman field and s-wave SC.
Firstly, we show that the unperturbed coupled p-wave setup by itself can have
two types of Majorana edge states, depending on the value of the effective
onsite potential. We show that additional components like Zeeman field and
s-wave term can cause transitions to different symmetry classes, both
topologically trivial or non-trivial, and change the nature of these edge
states. In the presence of the perturbations, we show that there are 3 symmetry
classes when the effective p-wave pairing is equal between the spin species,
and 6 for the second kind, when the pairing differs by a phase $\pi$ between
the two. Some of these classes are topologically non-trivial. Further, we
explore the nature of subgap states when we have a junction between two such
topological setups and their corresponding behaviour with the phase of the
p-wave order parameter. Our work provides a theoretical framework of the
different ways to get non-trivial topological classes in coupled p-wave

advances in edge computing have enabled processing to be spread across the

trade-off, arising when a sensor has to decide whether to transmit raw data
(incurring communication delay) or preprocess them (incurring computational
delay) in order to compute an accurate estimate of the state of the phenomenon

of $processing$ $network$. Contrarily to $sensor$ $and$ $communication$
$networks$, where the designer is concerned with the design of a suitable
communication policy, in a processing network one can also control when and

provide analytical results on the optimal preprocessing delay ($i.e.$, the
optimal time spent on computations at each sensor) for the case with a single
sensor and multiple homogeneous sensors. Numerical results substantiate our
claims that accounting for computation latencies (both at sensor and estimator
side) and communication delays can largely impact the estimation accuracy.

that only considered multicast transmission without deadlines, we enforce a
deadline for the service time of each multicast status update, taking into
account both the fixed and randomly distributed deadlines. In particular, a
status update is dropped when either its deadline expires or it is successfully
received by a certain number of IoT devices. Considering deadlines is important
for many emerging IoT applications, where the outdated status updates are of no
use to IoT devices. We evaluate the timeliness of the status update delivery by
applying a recently proposed metric, named the age of information (AoI), which
is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most recently
received status update. After deriving the distributions of the service time
for all possible reception outcomes at IoT devices, we manage to obtain the
closed-form expressions of both the average AoI and the average peak AoI.
Simulations validate the performance analysis, which reveals that the multicast
transmission with deadlines achieves a lower average AoI than that without
deadlines and there exists an optimal value of the deadline that can minimize
the average (peak) AoI. Results also show that the fixed and random deadlines
have respective advantages in different deadline regimes.

dynamic point clouds are often perturbed by noise due to hardware, software or
other causes. While a plethora of methods have been proposed for static point
cloud denoising, few efforts are made for the denoising of dynamic point
clouds, which is quite challenging due to the irregular sampling patterns both
spatially and temporally. In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds
naturally on spatial-temporal graphs, and exploit the temporal consistency with
respect to the underlying surface (manifold). In particular, we define a
manifold-to-manifold distance and its discrete counterpart on graphs to measure
the variation-based intrinsic distance between surface patches in the temporal
domain, provided that graph operators are discrete counterparts of functionals
on Riemannian manifolds. Then, we construct the spatial-temporal graph
connectivity between corresponding surface patches based on the temporal
distance and between points in adjacent patches in the spatial domain.
Leveraging the initial graph representation, we formulate dynamic point cloud
denoising as the joint optimization of the desired point cloud and underlying
graph representation, regularized by both spatial smoothness and temporal
consistency. We reformulate the optimization and present an efficient
algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly
outperforms independent denoising of each frame from state-of-the-art static

detection-based Mask R-CNN is adapted for mitotic nuclei detection that
initially selects the candidate mitotic region with maximum recall. However, in

challenge in capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of time-series
signals. In this regard, the existing recurrent or convolutional or their
hybrid models for activity recognition struggle to capture spatio-temporal
context from the feature space of sensor reading sequence. To address this
complex problem, we propose a self-attention based neural network model that
foregoes recurrent architectures and utilizes different types of attention
mechanisms to generate higher dimensional feature representation used for
classification. We performed extensive experiments on four popular publicly
available HAR datasets: PAMAP2, Opportunity, Skoda and USC-HAD. Our model
achieve significant performance improvement over recent state-of-the-art models
in both benchmark test subjects and Leave-one-subject-out evaluation. We also
observe that the sensor attention maps produced by our model is able capture
the importance of the modality and placement of the sensors in predicting the
different activity classes.

perfusion and oxygen delivery. Current efforts on modeling blood flow have
primarily focused on the flow properties of blood with red blood cells (RBCs)
having a viscosity ratio $C$ of unity between the cytosol and suspending
medium, while under physiological conditions the cytosol viscosity is about
five times larger than the plasma viscosity (i.e., $C\approx 5$). The
importance of $C$ for the behavior of single RBCs in fluid flow has already
been demonstrated, while the effect of $C$ on blood flow has only been sparsely
studied. We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations to perform a systematic
investigation of flow properties of RBC suspensions with different cytosol
viscosities for various flow conditions in cylindrical microchannels. Our main
aim is to link macroscopic flow properties such as flow resistance to single
cell deformation and dynamics as a function of $C$. Starting from a dispersed
cell configuration, we find that the flow convergence and the development of a
RBC-free layer (RBC-FL) depend only weakly on $C$, and require a convergence
length in the range of $25D-50D$, where $D$ is the channel diameter. The flow
resistance for $C=5$ is nearly the same as that for $C=1$, which is facilitated
by a slightly larger RBC-FL thickness for $C=5$. This effect is due to the
suppression of membrane motion and dynamic shape deformations by a more viscous
cytosol for $C=5$, resulting in a more compact cellular core of the flow in
comparison to $C=1$. The weak effect of cytosol viscosity on the flow
resistance and RBC-FL explains why cells can have a high concentration of
hemoglobin for efficient oxygen delivery, without a pronounced increase in the
flow resistance.

Continuously understanding the state of
our health and modeling how it evolves is essential if we wish to improve it.
Given the opportunity that people live with more data about their life today
than any other time in history, the challenge rests in interweaving this data
with the growing body of knowledge to compute and model the health state of an
individual continually. This dissertation presents an approach to build a
personal model and dynamically estimate the health state of an individual by
fusing multi-modal data and domain knowledge. The system is stitched together
from four essential abstraction elements: 1. the events in our life, 2. the
layers of our biological systems (from molecular to an organism), 3. the
functional utilities that arise from biological underpinnings, and 4. how we
interact with these utilities in the reality of daily life. Connecting these
four elements via graph network blocks forms the backbone by which we
instantiate a digital twin of an individual. Edges and nodes in this graph
structure are then regularly updated with learning techniques as data is
continuously digested. Experiments demonstrate the use of dense and
heterogeneous real-world data from a variety of personal and environmental
sensors to monitor individual cardiovascular health state. State estimation and
individual modeling is the fundamental basis to depart from disease-oriented
approaches to a total health continuum paradigm. Precision in predicting health
requires understanding state trajectory. By encasing this estimation within a
navigational approach, a systematic guidance framework can plan actions to
transition a current state towards a desired one. This work concludes by
presenting this framework of combining the health state and personal graph
model to perpetually plan and assist us in living life towards our goals.

is often the case with news sources, whose topics evolve over time). We show
how to address this problem by providing a statistical measure of similarity

regions should be a central concern of both citizens and public officials.
Remote sensing can contribute to the management and monitoring of coastal water
and pollutants. Algal blooms are a coastal pollutant that is a cause of
concern. Many satellite data, such as MODIS, have been used to generate
water-quality products to detect the blooms such as chlorophyll a (Chl-a), a
photosynthesis index called fluorescence line height (FLH), and sea surface
temperature (SST). It is important to characterize the spatial and temporal
variations of these water quality products by using the mathematical models of
these products. However, for monitoring, pollution control boards will need
nowcasts and forecasts of any pollution. Therefore, we aim to predict the
future values of the MODIS Chl-a, FLH, and SST of the water. This will not be
limited to one type of water but, rather, will cover different types of water
varying in depth and turbidity. This is very significant because the temporal
trend of Chl-a, FLH, and SST is dependent on the geospatial and water
properties. For this purpose, we will decompose the time series of each pixel
into several components: trend, intra-annual variations, seasonal cycle, and
stochastic stationary. We explore three such time series machine learning
models that can characterize the non-stationary time series data and predict
future values, including the Seasonal ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving
Average) (SARIMA), regression, and neural network. The results indicate that
all these methods are effective at modelling Chl-a, FLH, and SST time series
and predicting the values reasonably well. However, regression and neural
network are found to be the best at predicting Chl-a in all types of water
(turbid and shallow). Meanwhile, the SARIMA model provides the best prediction
of FLH and SST.

of cache misses, the memory reuse time and data entropy, from various
compute-intensive, caching and analytics benchmarks. We apply several
supervised learning methods to construct the DRAM error behavior model for 72

hydrogen atoms in graphdiyne structure. Our DFT calculations exhibit poor
selectivity and good permeances for $H_2$/$CO_2$ gases passing through this

increased from 5.65 to completely purified $H_2$ gas. Furthermore, GDY-H
membrane represents excellent permeance, about $10^8$ gas permeation unit

much higher than the value of the usual industrial limits. Moreover, our
proposed approach shows a good balance between the selectivity and permeance
parameters for the gas separation which is an essential factor for $H_2$
purification and $CO_2$ capture processes in the industry.

  to Electrostatic Discharge","To appear in proceedings of RTEST2020",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observing, understanding, and mitigating the effects of failure in embedded
systems is essential for building dependable control systems. We develop a
software-based monitoring methodology to further this goal. This methodology
can be applied to any embedded system peripheral and allows the system to
operate normally while the monitoring software is running. We use software to
instrument the operating system kernel and record indicators of system
behavior. By comparing those indicators against baseline indicators of normal
system operation, faults can be detected and appropriate action can be taken.
  We implement this methodology to detect faults caused by electrostatic
discharge in a USB host controller. As indicators, we select specific control
registers that provide a manifestation of the internal execution of the host
controller. Analysis of the recorded register values reveals differences in
system execution when the system is subject to interference. %We also develop a
classifier capable of predicting whether or not the system's behavior is being
affected by such shocks. This improved understanding of system behavior may
lead to better hardware and software mitigation of electrostatic discharge and
assist in root-cause analysis and repair of failures.

  with SER Analysis","Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)
  2020",,,,"cs.IT cs.PF math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we analyze the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) enabled three-node
differential decode-and-forward (DDF) relay networks, which adopt the power
splitting (PS) protocol at the relay. The use of non-coherent differential
modulation eliminates the need for sending training symbols to estimate the
instantaneous channel state informations (CSIs) at all network nodes, and
therefore improves the power efficiency, as compared with the coherent
modulation. However, performance analysis results are not yet available for the
state-of-the-art detectors such as the approximate maximum-likelihood detector.
Existing works rely on Monte-Carlo simulation to show that there exists an
optimal PS ratio that minimizes the overall SER. In this work, we propose a
near-optimal detector with linear complexity with respect to the modulation
size. We derive an accurate approximate SER expression, based on which the
optimal PS ratio can be accurately estimated without requiring any Monte-Carlo
simulation.
