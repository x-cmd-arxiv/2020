  Complex Flight Networks","17 pages, 9 figures, manuscript submitted for review in a refereed
  journal",,,,"cs.AI math.CO math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Crew pairing optimization (CPO) is critically important for any airline,
since its crew operating costs are second-largest, next to the fuel-cost. CPO
aims at generating a set of flight sequences (crew pairings) covering a
flight-schedule, at minimum-cost, while satisfying several legality
constraints. For large-scale complex flight networks, billion-plus legal
pairings (variables) are possible, rendering their offline enumeration
intractable and an exhaustive search for their minimum-cost full
flight-coverage subset impractical. Even generating an initial feasible
solution (IFS: a manageable set of legal pairings covering all flights), which
could be subsequently optimized is a difficult (NP-complete) problem. Though,
as part of a larger project the authors have developed a crew pairing optimizer
(AirCROP), this paper dedicatedly focuses on IFS-generation through a novel
heuristic based on divide-and-cover strategy and Integer Programming. For
real-world large and complex flight network datasets (including over 3200
flights and 15 crew bases) provided by GE Aviation, the proposed heuristic
shows upto a ten-fold speed improvement over another state-of-the-art approach.
Unprecedentedly, this paper presents an empirical investigation of the impact
of IFS-cost on the final (optimized) solution-cost, revealing that too low an
IFS-cost does not necessarily imply faster convergence for AirCROP or even
lower cost for the optimized solution.

  disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest
possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to
model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level.
Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the
first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern
Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series
mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been
implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the
phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide
reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three
subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the
evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission
of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the
effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of
nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in
Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on
the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an
error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level,
instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces
first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the
effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are
currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the
spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed
model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while
controlling for delayed reporting.

$1$ or $5$) examples per novel class (unseen during training), has received a
lot of attention and significant performance advances in the recent literature.
While number of techniques have been proposed for FSL, several factors have
emerged as most important for FSL performance, awarding SOTA even to the
simplest of techniques. These are: the backbone architecture (bigger is
better), type of pre-training on the base classes (meta-training vs regular
multi-class, currently regular wins), quantity and diversity of the base
classes set (the more the merrier, resulting in richer and better adaptive
features), and the use of self-supervised tasks during pre-training (serving as
a proxy for increasing the diversity of the base set). In this paper we propose
yet another simple technique that is important for the few shot learning
performance - a search for a compact feature sub-space that is discriminative
for a given few-shot test task. We show that the Task-Adaptive Feature
Sub-Space Learning (TAFSSL) can significantly boost the performance in FSL
scenarios when some additional unlabeled data accompanies the novel few-shot
task, be it either the set of unlabeled queries (transductive FSL) or some
additional set of unlabeled data samples (semi-supervised FSL). Specifically,
we show that on the challenging miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks,
TAFSSL can improve the current state-of-the-art in both transductive and
semi-supervised FSL settings by more than $5\%$, while increasing the benefit
of using unlabeled data in FSL to above $10\%$ performance gain.

two, and three are well-known, and methods for constructing the ELWFs

  Applications, Accepted",,,,"math.CO cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose the concepts of intersection distribution and non-hitting index,
which can be viewed from two related perspectives. The first one concerns a
point set $S$ of size $q+1$ in the classical projective plane $PG(2,q)$, where
the intersection distribution of $S$ indicates the intersection pattern between
$S$ and the lines in $PG(2,q)$. The second one relates to a polynomial $f$ over
a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where the intersection distribution of $f$
records an overall distribution property of a collection of polynomials
$\{f(x)+cx \mid c \in \mathbb{F}_q\}$. These two perspectives are closely
related, in the sense that each polynomial produces a $(q+1)$-set in a
canonical way and conversely, each $(q+1)$-set with certain property has a
polynomial representation. Indeed, the intersection distribution provides a new
angle to distinguish polynomials over finite fields, based on the geometric
property of the corresponding $(q+1)$-sets. Among the intersection
distribution, we identify a particularly interesting quantity named non-hitting
index. For a point set $S$, its non-hitting index counts the number of lines in
$PG(2,q)$ which do not hit $S$. For a polynomial $f$ over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$, its non-hitting index gives the summation of the sizes of $q$
value sets $\{f(x)+cx \mid x \in \mathbb{F}_q\}$, where $c \in \mathbb{F}_q$.
We derive bounds on the non-hitting index and show that the non-hitting index
contains much information about the corresponding set and the polynomial. More
precisely, using a geometric approach, we show that the non-hitting index is
sufficient to characterize the corresponding point set and the polynomial when
it is close to the lower and upper bounds. Moreover, we employ an algebraic
approach to derive the intersection distribution of several families of point
sets and polynomials, and compute the sizes of related Kakeya sets in affine
planes.

approach; (ii) extending it for use with agents that have higher-order,
heterogeneous dynamics, and (iii) developing stability conditions for the
DSR-based method. With DSR, each agent uses current and past information from
neighbors to infer the overall goal and modifies the update law to improve
cohesion. The advantages of the proposed DSR approach are that it only requires
already-available information from a given network to improve the cohesion and
does not require network-connectivity modifications (which might not be always
feasible) nor increases in the system's overall response speed (which can
require larger input). Moreover, illustrative simulation examples are used to
comparatively evaluate the performance with and without DSR. The simulation
results show substantial improvement in cohesion with DSR.

color variations from Voyager data into sine and cosine terms, we find no

reached with two observational models of discoloration: one representing an
actively discoloring surface, and the other assuming that the present-day
exogenic discoloration on the surface is in steady-state. Magnitudes of the
expected signature are presented as functions of the age of the crater Pwyll,
which is used to constrain the timescale of discoloration. Furthermore, we
develop a physical model of discoloration to validate the geometric models,
producing consistent results. The failure to identify a signature of NSR using
Europa's hemispheric color dichotomy magnifies the outstanding problem of the
origin of the stress to explain Europa's pervasive tectonic features.

$\mathcal{U} \subset \Omega$ then graph$(u\rfloor_\mathcal{U})$ does not
contain extreme points of the convex body $C_u = \{ (x,y,z) :\, (x,y) \in
\Omega,\ 0 \le z \le u(x,y) \}$. As a consequence, we have $C_u = \text{\rm
Conv} (\overline{\text{\rm Sing$C_u$}})$, where Sing$C_u$ denotes the set of
singular points of $\partial C_u$. We prove a similar result for a generalized
Newton's problem.

compact and planar form factor. Analysis and design of metasurfaces require
methods for modeling their interactions with waves. Conventional modeling
techniques assume that metasurfaces are locally periodic structures excited by
plane waves, restricting their applicability to gradually varying metasurfaces
that are illuminated with plane waves. Here we introduce the discrete-space
impulse response concept that enables the development of accurate and general
models for metasurfaces. According to the proposed model, discrete impulse
responses are assigned to metasurface unit cells and are used to determine the
metasurface response to any arbitrary incident waves. We verify the accuracy of
the model by comparing its results with full-wave simulations. The proposed
concept and modeling technique are applicable to linear metasurfaces with
arbitrary meta-atoms, and the resulting system-level models can be used to
accurately incorporate metasurfaces into simulation and design tools that use
wave or ray optics.

proposed for simple and composite null hypotheses involving general
multivariate distributions. For group families, the procedure is to be
implemented after preliminary reduction of the data via invariance.This
property allows for calculation of exact critical values and p-values at finite
sample sizes. Applications include testing for location--scale families and
testing for families arising from affine transformations, such as elliptical
distributions with given standard radial density and unspecified location
vector and scatter matrix. A novel test for multivariate normality with
unspecified mean vector and covariance matrix arises as a special case. For
more general parametric families, we propose a parametric bootstrap procedure
to calculate critical values. The lack of asymptotic distribution theory for
the empirical Wasserstein distance means that the validity of the parametric
bootstrap under the null hypothesis remains a conjecture. Nevertheless, we show
that the test is consistent against fixed alternatives. To this end, we prove a
uniform law of large numbers for the empirical distribution in Wasserstein
distance, where the uniformity is over any class of underlying distributions
satisfying a uniform integrability condition but no additional moment
assumptions. The calculation of test statistics boils down to solving the
well-studied semi-discrete optimal transport problem. Extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate the practical feasibility and the excellent performance
of the proposed tests for the Wasserstein distance of order p = 1 and p = 2 and
for dimensions at least up to d = 5. The simulations also lend support to the
conjecture of the asymptotic validity of the parametric bootstrap.

discerned by measuring counter-propagating solitons. Their relative motion

node in a network, and chooses a distinct port number from $\{1,\ldots,d\}$ for
every edge outgoing from a node of degree $d$. Then, given the labels of $u$
and $w$ and no other information about the network, it should be possible to
determine the port number corresponding to the first edge on the shortest path
from $u$ to $w$. In their seminal paper, Thorup and Zwick [SPAA 2001] designed
several routing methods for general weighted networks. An important technical
ingredient in their paper that according to the authors ``may be of independent
practical and theoretical interest'' is a routing labeling scheme for trees of
arbitrary degrees. For a tree on $n$ nodes, their scheme constructs labels
consisting of $(1+o(1))\log n$ bits such that the sought port number can be
computed in constant time. Looking closer at their construction, the labels
consist of $\log n + O(\log n\cdot \log\log\log n / \log\log n)$ bits. Given
that the only known lower bound is $\log n+\Omega(\log\log n)$, a natural
question that has been asked for other labeling problems in trees is to
determine the asymptotics of the smaller-order term.
  We make the first (and significant) progress in 19 years on determining the
correct second-order term for the length of a label in a routing labeling
scheme for trees on $n$ nodes. We design such a scheme with labels of length
$\log n+O((\log\log n)^{2})$. Furthermore, we modify the scheme to allow for
computing the port number in constant time at the expense of slightly
increasing the length to $\log n+O((\log\log n)^{3})$.

thermodynamically stable potassium stoichiometry. Beyond this threshold
concentration the domains disappear, while the alkali metal and charge carrier

matrices is developed, with a single assumption that the input matrix, of order
$n$, admits such a decomposition into the product of a unitary, a non-negative
diagonal, and a $J$-unitary matrix, where $J$ is a given diagonal matrix of
positive and negative signs. When $J=\pm I$, the proposed algorithm computes
the ordinary SVD. The paper's most important contribution -- a derivation of
formulas for the HSVD of $2\times 2$ matrices -- is presented first, followed
by the details of their implementation in floating-point arithmetic. Next, the
effects of the hyperbolic transformations on the columns of the iteration
matrix are discussed. These effects then guide a redesign of the dynamic pivot
ordering, being already a well-established pivot strategy for the ordinary
Kogbetliantz algorithm, for the general, $n\times n$ HSVD. A heuristic but
sound convergence criterion is then proposed, which contributes to high
accuracy demonstrated in the numerical testing results. Such a $J$-Kogbetliantz
algorithm as presented here is intrinsically slow, but is nevertheless usable
for matrices of small orders.

investigated in the presence of a floating elastic plate which rests on the top
surface of the flow. Linear instability of the system with respect to
infinitesimal disturbances is captured using normal-mode analysis. The critical
conditions for instability are obtained analytically utilizing the long-wave
approximation and small film aspect ratio. Further, the bifurcation of the
nonlinear evolution equation is analyzed using weakly nonlinear stability
analysis. The Orr-Sommerfeld system for the perturbed flow is derived, and it
is solved numerically using the spectral collocation method. The behaviour of
the marginal stability curves and temporal growth of the unstable waves are
portrayed for a range of dimensionless flow parameters. Moreover, the pressure
acting on the surface and shearing stress are calculated and analysed for
various structural and flow configurations. The study reveals that critical
structural parameters such as rigidity and mass per unit length play a crucial
role in suppressing and facilitating the unstable surface waves of the flow.
Numerical observations imply that the floating elastic plate helps to stabilize
the surface flow and to damp the high amplitude waves.

method for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning in both discrete and
continuous action spaces. Like MADDPG, a popular multi-agent actor-critic
method, our approach uses deep deterministic policy gradients to learn
policies. However, FACMAC learns a centralised but factored critic, which
combines per-agent utilities into the joint action-value function via a
non-linear monotonic function, as in QMIX, a popular multi-agent Q-learning
algorithm. However, unlike QMIX, there are no inherent constraints on factoring
the critic. We thus also employ a nonmonotonic factorisation and empirically
demonstrate that its increased representational capacity allows it to solve
some tasks that cannot be solved with monolithic, or monotonically factored
critics. In addition, FACMAC uses a centralised policy gradient estimator that
optimises over the entire joint action space, rather than optimising over each
agent's action space separately as in MADDPG. This allows for more coordinated
policy changes and fully reaps the benefits of a centralised critic. We
evaluate FACMAC on variants of the multi-agent particle environments, a novel
multi-agent MuJoCo benchmark, and a challenging set of StarCraft II
micromanagement tasks. Empirical results demonstrate FACMAC's superior
performance over MADDPG and other baselines on all three domains.

equations.
  First we investigate the relation of quantitative bounds to the behaviour of
critical norms near a potential singularity with Type I bound
$\|u\|_{L^{\infty}_{t}L^{3,\infty}_{x}}\leq M$. Namely, we show that if $T^*$
is a first blow-up time and $(0,T^*)$ is a singular point then
$$\|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^{3}(B_{0}(R))}\geq
C(M)\log\Big(\frac{1}{T^*-t}\Big),\,\,\,\,\,\,R=O((T^*-t)^{\frac{1}{2}-}).$$ We
demonstrate that this potential blow-up rate is optimal for a certain class of
potential non-zero backward discretely self-similar solutions.
  Second, we quantify the result of Seregin (2012), which says that if $u$ is a
smooth finite-energy solution to the Navier-Stokes equations on
$\mathbb{R}^3\times (0,1)$ with
$$\sup_{n}\|u(\cdot,t_{(n)})\|_{L^{3}(\mathbb{R}^3)}<\infty\,\,\,\textrm{and}\,\,\,t_{(n)}\uparrow
1,$$ then $u$ does not blow-up at $t=1$.
  To prove our results we develop a new strategy for proving quantitative
bounds for the Navier-Stokes equations. This hinges on local-in-space smoothing
results (near the initial time) established by Jia and \v{S}ver\'{a}k (2014),
together with quantitative arguments using Carleman inequalities given by Tao
(2019).
  Moreover, the technology developed here enables us in particular to give a
quantitative bound for the number of singular points in a Type I blow-up

suggests that data might be kept in pointer-rich ""in-memory"" format across
program runs and even process and system crashes. For full generality, such
data requires dynamic memory allocation, and while the allocator could in
principle ""rolled into"" each data structure, it is desirable to make it a
separate abstraction.
  Toward this end, we introduce recoverability, a correctness criterion for
persistent allocators, together with a nonblocking allocator, Ralloc, that
satisfies this criterion. Ralloc is based on the LRMalloc of Leite and Rocha,
with three key innovations. First, we persist just enough information during
normal operation to permit correct reconstruction of the heap after a
full-system crash. Our reconstruction mechanism performs garbage collection
(GC) to identify and remedy any failure-induced memory leaks. Second, we
introduce the notion of filter functions, which identify the locations of
pointers within persistent blocks to mitigate the limitations of conservative
GC. Third, to allow persistent regions to be mapped at an arbitrary address, we
employ position-independent (offset-based) pointers for both data and metadata.
  Experiments show Ralloc to be performance-competitive with both Makalu, the
state-of-the-art lock-based persistent allocator, and such transient allocators
as LRMalloc and JEMalloc. In particular, reliance on GC and offline metadata
reconstruction allows Ralloc to pay almost nothing for persistence during
normal operation.

that precede full structural relaxation in ultra-dense particle liquids
interacting via strong short range attractive forces. Our approach is based on
a microscopic theory formulated at the particle trajectory level built on the
dynamic free energy concept and an explicit treatment of how attractions
control physical bonding. Mean time scales for bond breaking, the early stage
of cage escape, and a fixed non-Fickian displacement are analyzed in the
repulsive glass, bonded repulsive (attractive) glass, fluid, and dense gel
regimes. The theory predicts a strong length-scale-dependent growth of these
time scales with attractive force strength at fixed packing fraction, a much
weaker slowing down with density at fixed attraction strength, and a strong
decoupling of the shorter bond breaking time with the other two time scales
that are controlled mainly by perturbed steric caging. All results are in good
accord with simulations, and additional testable predictions are made. The
classic statistical mechanical projection approximation of replacing all bare
attractive and repulsive forces with a single effective force determined by
pair structure incurs major errors for describing processes associated with
thermally activated escape from transiently localized states.

transferring knowledge from a labeled source dataset to an unlabeled target

the source domain is large and diverse, and the target label space is a subset

classes between the domains and promote learning transferable knowledge from
these classes. In this paper, we propose a multi-class adversarial architecture
for PDA. The proposed approach jointly aligns the marginal and
class-conditional distributions in the shared label space by minimaxing a novel
multi-class adversarial loss function. Furthermore, we incorporate effective
regularization terms to encourage selecting the most relevant subset of source
domain classes. In the absence of target labels, the proposed approach is able
to effectively learn domain-invariant feature representations, which in turn
can enhance the classification performance in the target domain. Comprehensive

kilonova lightcurves. The calculated peak luminosity of a BH-NS merger kilonova
is typically about a few times $10^{41}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$, which is always
$\lesssim4.5\times10^{41}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$. This corresponds to the AB
absolute magnitudes fainter than $\sim -15\ {\rm mag}$ in optical and $\sim
-16\ {\rm mag}$ in infrared. Since the projected photosphere area of the
dynamical ejecta is much larger than that of the disk wind outflows, the
dynamical ejecta usually contribute to the majority of the kilonova emission
from BH-NS mergers. The fitted blackbody temperature and the shape of the
observed multi-band lightcurves are insensitive to the line of sight. The peak
time of the observed multi-band lightcurves, affected by the light propagation
effect, is related to the relative motion direction between the dynamical
ejecta and the observer. The observed luminosity varies with the projected
photosphere area determined by the viewing angles. However, the predicted peak
luminosity only varies by a factor of $\sim (2 - 3)$ (or by $\sim1\ {\rm mag}$)
for different viewing angles. When the short-duration gamma-ray burst afterglow

universality when the $s$-wave scattering length diverges. A prominent example
of universal phenomena is the emergence of an infinite tower of three-body
bound states obeying discrete scale invariance, known as the Efimov effect,
which has been subject to extensive research in chemical, atomic, nuclear and

nonlocal autonomous PDE operator $\Phi_t$. Because the emergent dynamics is
autonomous, in future work one will be able to apply PDE techniques to analyze
bifurcations in $\Phi_t$. Preliminary numerical results for the SK Glauber
dynamics suggest that the `glassy dynamical phase transition' occurs when a
stable fixed point of the flow operator $\Phi_t$ destabilizes.

and answers queries in $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon}n + k\log^{\varepsilon} n)$ time,
where $k$ is the number of reported points, $n$ is the number of points in the
data structure, and $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant.
Our second data structure uses $O(n \log^{\varepsilon} n)$ space and answers
queries in $O(\log n+k)$ time.
  These are the first data structures for this problem that use linear (resp.
$O(n\log^{\varepsilon} n)$) space and answer queries in poly-logarithmic time.
For comparison the fastest previously known linear-space or
$O(n\log^{\varepsilon} n)$-space data structure supports queries in
$O(n^{\varepsilon} + k)$ time (Bentley and Mauer, 1980). Our results can be
generalized to $d\ge 4$ dimensions. For example, we can answer $d$-dimensional
dominance range reporting queries in $O(\log\log n (\log n/\log\log n)^{d-3} +

  Movable Objects","2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Use of physics-based simulation as a planning model enables a planner to
reason and generate plans that involve non-trivial interactions with the world.
For example, grasping a milk container out of a cluttered refrigerator may
involve moving a robot manipulator in between other objects, pushing away the
ones that are movable and avoiding interactions with certain fragile
containers. A physics-based simulator allows a planner to reason about the
effects of interactions with these objects and to generate a plan that grasps
the milk container successfully. The use of physics-based simulation for
planning however is underutilized. One of the reasons for it being that
physics-based simulations are typically way too slow for being used within a
planning loop that typically requires tens of thousands of actions to be
evaluated within a matter of a second or two. In this work, we develop a
planning algorithm that tries to address this challenge. In particular, it
builds on the observation that only a small number of actions actually need to
be simulated using physics, and the remaining set of actions, such as moving an
arm around obstacles, can be evaluated using a much simpler internal planning
model, e.g., a simple collision-checking model. Motivated by this, we develop
an algorithm called Planning with Selective Physics-based Simulation that
automatically discovers what should be simulated with physics and what can
utilize an internal planning model for pick-and-place tasks.

have recently proposed state-interaction pair-density functional theory
(SI-PDFT) to treat nearly degenerate states; although this method is
successful, it is inconvenient because two SCF calculations and two sets of
orbitals are required and because it puts the ground state on an unequal
footing with the excited states. Here we propose two new methods, called
extended-multi-state-PDFT (XMS-PDFT) and variational-multi-state-PDFT
(VMS-PDFT), that generate the intermediate states in a balanced way with a
single set of orbitals. The former uses the intermediate states proposed by
Granovsky for extended multiconfiguration quasidegenerate perturbation theory
(XMC-QDPT); the latter obtains the intermediate states by maximizing the sum of
the MC-PDFT energies for the intermediate states. We also propose a Fourier
series expansion to make the variational optimizations of the VMS-PDFT method
convenient, and we implement this method (FMS-PDFT) both for conventional
configuration-interaction solvers and for density-matrix-renormalization-group
solvers. The new methods are tested for eight systems exhibiting avoided
crossings among two to six states. The FMS-PDFT method is successful for all
eight test cases studied in the paper, and XMS-PDFT is successful for all of

navigation, vision-dialog navigation also requires to handle well with the
language intentions of a series of questions about the temporal context from
dialogue history and co-reasoning both dialogs and visual scenes. In this
paper, we propose the Cross-modal Memory Network (CMN) for remembering and
understanding the rich information relevant to historical navigation actions.
Our CMN consists of two memory modules, the language memory module (L-mem) and
the visual memory module (V-mem). Specifically, L-mem learns latent
relationships between the current language interaction and a dialog history by
employing a multi-head attention mechanism. V-mem learns to associate the
current visual views and the cross-modal memory about the previous navigation
actions. The cross-modal memory is generated via a vision-to-language attention
and a language-to-vision attention. Benefiting from the collaborative learning
of the L-mem and the V-mem, our CMN is able to explore the memory about the
decision making of historical navigation actions which is for the current step.
Experiments on the CVDN dataset show that our CMN outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art model by a significant margin on both seen and unseen

where inflation is repeated several times (multi-phase inflation) can be easily

the single inflation for the large scale perturbations to only continue at
least around 10 e-folds. In this context, we then investigate if a spectator
field can be a source of the almost scale-invariant primordial perturbations on
the large scale. As a consequence of such an isocurvature contribution, the
resultant perturbations exhibit the non-vanishing non-Gaussianity in general.
Also the perturbation amplitude on smaller scales can be completely different
from that on the large scale due to the multiplicity of inflationary phases.
These signatures will be a smoking gun of this scenario by the future
observations.

the expressive power of the fully convolutional network (FCN). SiamBAN views
the visual tracking problem as a parallel classification and regression
problem, and thus directly classifies objects and regresses their bounding
boxes in a unified FCN. The no-prior box design avoids hyper-parameters
associated with the candidate boxes, making SiamBAN more flexible and general.
Extensive experiments on visual tracking benchmarks including VOT2018, VOT2019,
OTB100, NFS, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrate that SiamBAN achieves
state-of-the-art performance and runs at 40 FPS, confirming its effectiveness

strategically add the latent edges to the original networks according to the
potential influence of each latent edge. Numerical simulations verify the

several static strategies, namely, adding the latent edges between nodes with
the largest degree or eigenvector centrality. This study provides an effective
way of promoting the spreading of the susceptible-infected-recovered model by
modifying the network structure slightly and helps in understanding what a
better network structure for the spreading dynamics is. Besides, the
theoretical framework established in this study provides inspirations for the
further investigations of edge-based promoting strategies for other spreading

sub-carriers maybe reserved and/or prohibited to transmit signals, leading to
the so-called \emph{spectral null constraint} (SNC) design problem. For
example, the DC sub-carrier is reserved to avoid the offsets in D/A and A/D
converter in the LTE systems. While most of the current research focus on the
design of low PAPR CSSs to improve the code-rate, few works address the
aforementioned SNC in their designs. This motivates us to investigate CSSs with
SNC as well as low PAPR property. In this paper, we present systematic
constructions of CSSs under SNCs and low PAPR. First, we show that mutually
orthogonal complementary sets (MOCSs) can be used as \emph{seed sequences} to
generate new CSSs with SNC and low PAPR, and then provide an iterative
technique for the construction of MOCSs which can be further used to generate
complementary sets (CSs) with low PAPRs and spectral nulls at \emph{varying}
positions in the designed sequences. Next, inspired by a recent idea of Chen,
we propose a novel construction of these \emph{seed} MOCSs with
non-power-of-two lengths from generalized Boolean functions.

to analyze the MWD of concatenated polar codes by introducing the parity-check
equations of outer codes. Moreover, due to the distance property of codewords,
the proposed three methods can exactly enumerate all the codewords belonging to
the MWD. The enumeration results show that the SCREM can enumerate the MWD of
polar codes with code length up to $2^{14}$ and the PC-SCEM can be used to

the measuring accuracy of the Rabi frequency in some parameter regions and
underestimate the precision in other regimes with Fisher information tools'
help. Notably, a specific choice of the initial Gaussian state's variance in
position space will improve the measuring accuracy when we take the kinetic
energy term into account. We also study the realistic measurement of the Rabi
frequency for cases with and without the kinetic energy.

propose a method named GMM-UNIT, which is based on a content-attribute

Each GMM component represents a domain, and this simple assumption has two
prominent advantages. First, it can be easily extended to most multi-domain and
multi-modal image-to-image translation tasks. Second, the continuous domain

version, image restoration enjoys numerous applications, such as in

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved dramatic
improvements over conventional approaches for image restoration task. Existing
CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on
progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatially
precise but contextually less robust results are achieved, while in the latter
case, semantically reliable but spatially less accurate outputs are generated.
In this paper, we present a novel architecture with the collective goals of
maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the
entire network and receiving strong contextual information from the
low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale
residual block containing several key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution
convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information
exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) spatial and channel attention
mechanisms for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based
multi-scale feature aggregation. In a nutshell, our approach learns an enriched
set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales,
while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive

localization and recognition jointly. We use dense correlation matching of

transformation model to align features and bilinear resampling of the
correlation tensor to compute the detection score of the aligned features. All
the components are differentiable, which allows end-to-end training.
Experimental evaluation on several challenging domains (retail products, 3D

Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of the University of Patras, and the publically
available database called Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection

instances and to inspect the performance of the developed networks.
Classification accuracy of 91% and 93% on the PET/CT dataset and on a selection
of nodule images form the LIDC-IDRI dataset, is achieved accordingly. The
results demonstrate that CNNs are a trustworth method for nodule
classification. Also, the experiment confirms that data augmentation enhances

The proposed method is applicable to various channels and ensembles. The focus
is on both spherical and Gaussian random codes on the additive white Gaussian
noise channel as well as binary random codes on both the binary symmetric
channel and the binary erasure channel.
  While for the uniform spherical ensemble Shannon, in 1959, argued with solid
angles in $N$-dimensional space, the presented approach projects the problem
into two dimensions and applies standard trigonometry. This simplifies the
derivation and also allows for the analysis of the independent identically
distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian ensemble which turns out to perform better for
short blocklengths and high rates. Moreover, a new lower bound on the average
block error probability of the uniform spherical ensemble is found. For codes
with more than three codewords, it is tighter than the sphere packing bound,
but requires exactly the same computing effort. Furthermore, tight
approximations are proposed to simplify the computation of both the exact
average error probability and the two bounds.
  For the binary symmetric channel and the binary erasure channel, bounds on
the average block error probability for i.i.d.\ random coding are derived and

also cast shadows which provide their possible observable signatures. We
examine the relevant question here as to how to distinguish then these entities

black holes always admit timelike bound orbits having positive perihelion
precession. Also, while a naked singularity with a photon sphere can cast a
shadow, it could also admit positive perihelion precession for such orbits,
thereby mimicking a black hole. This indicates that compact objects with photon
spheres (shadows) always admit positive perihelion precession of timelike bound
orbits around them. On the other hand, a naked singularity without a photon
sphere could admit both positive and negative perihelion precession but need
not have a shadow. In this paper, we construct a spacetime configuration which
has a central naked singularity but no photon sphere, and it can give both
shadow and a negative perihelion precession. Our results imply that, whereas
the presence of a shadow and a positive perihelion precession implies either a
black hole or a naked singularity, the presence of a shadow and a negative
perihelion precession simultaneously would imply a naked singularity only. We
discuss our results in the context of stellar motions (motion of the `S' stars)

  Networks","NeurIPS 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting calibrated confidence scores for multi-class deep networks is
important for avoiding rare but costly mistakes. A common approach is to learn
a post-hoc calibration function that transforms the output of the original
network into calibrated confidence scores while maintaining the network's
accuracy. However, previous post-hoc calibration techniques work only with
simple calibration functions, potentially lacking sufficient representation to
calibrate the complex function landscape of deep networks. In this work, we aim
to learn general post-hoc calibration functions that can preserve the top-k
predictions of any deep network. We call this family of functions intra
order-preserving functions. We propose a new neural network architecture that
represents a class of intra order-preserving functions by combining common
neural network components. Additionally, we introduce order-invariant and
diagonal sub-families, which can act as regularization for better
generalization when the training data size is small. We show the effectiveness
of the proposed method across a wide range of datasets and classifiers. Our
method outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc calibration methods, namely
temperature scaling and Dirichlet calibration, in several evaluation metrics
for the task.

jet substructure variables capturing the new features, we demonstrate that
Higgs from gluon fusion constrains invisible Higgs decays the most, over vector
boson fusion traditionally known as the most constraining, and the limit on the
branching ratio is significantly improved. We summarize with emphasizing that
our method has wider implications in search for new resonances from gluon

coins), ring signature schemes have been widely used to protect a sender's
identity of a transaction in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, like Monero
and Bytecoin. However, recent works point out that the existing ring signature
scheme is vulnerable to the ""chain-reaction"" analysis (i.e., the spent coin in
a given ring signature can be deduced through elimination). Especially, when
the diversity of mixins is low, the spent coin will have a high risk to be
detected. To overcome the weakness, the ring signature should be consisted of a
set of mixins with high diversity and produce observations having ""similar""
distributions for any two coins. In this paper, we propose a notion, namely
$\epsilon$-coin-indistinguishability ($\epsilon$-CI), to formally define the
""similar"" distribution guaranteed through a differential privacy scheme. Then,
we formally define the CI-aware mixins selection problem with disjoint-superset
constraint (CIA-MS-DS), which aims to find a mixin set that has maximal
diversity and satisfies the constraints of $\epsilon$-CI and the budget. In
CIA-MS-DS, each ring signature is either disjoint with or the superset of its
preceding ring signatures. We prove that CIA-MS-DS is NP-hard and thus
intractable. To solve the CIA-MS-DS problem, we propose two approximation
algorithms, namely the Progressive Algorithm and the Game Theoretic Algorithm,
with theoretic guarantees. Through extensive experiments on both real data sets

our approaches.

seed metric is also described in terms of a piecewise mass function with three
different conditions. Specializing in the non-trivial case where the observer
resides inside the dark matter shell, we analyzed how the effective mass of the
black hole environment affects the basic black hole properties. A high
concentration of dark matter near the rotating black hole is needed to have
considerable deviations on the horizons, ergosphere, and photonsphere radius.
The time-like geodesic, however, shows more sensitivity to deviation even at
very low dark matter density. Further, the location of energy extraction via
the Penrose process is also shown to remain unchanged. With how the dark matter
distribution is described in the mass function, and the complexity of how the
shadow radius is defined for a Kerr black hole, deriving an analytic expression
for $\Delta r_{s}$ as a condition for notable dark matter effects to occur

setting of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) where the local
operations commute with a global onsite symmetry group $G$, which we call
$G$-LOCC, and we define the inaccessible entanglement $E_{inacc}$ as the
entanglement that cannot be used for distillation under $G$-LOCC. We derive a
tight bound on $E_{inacc}$ which demonstrates a direct relation between
inaccessible entanglement and the SPT phase, namely $\log(D_\omega^2) \leq
E_{inacc} \leq \log(|G|)$, where $D_\omega$ is the topologically protected edge
mode degeneracy of the SPT phase $\omega$ with symmetry $G$. For particular
phases such as the Haldane phase, $D_\omega = \sqrt{|G|}$ so the bound becomes
an equality. We numerically investigate the distribution of states throughout
the bound, and show that typically the region near the upper bound is highly
populated, and also determine the nature of those states lying on the upper and

considerable attention in the entertainment industry. So far a few 3D
caricature generation methods exist and all of them require some caricature
information (e.g., a caricature sketch or 2D caricature) as input. This kind of
input, however, is difficult to provide by non-professional users. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network model that generates
high-quality 3D caricatures directly from a normal 2D face photo. The most
challenging issue for our system is that the source domain of face photos
(characterized by normal 2D faces) is significantly different from the target
domain of 3D caricatures (characterized by 3D exaggerated face shapes and
textures). To address this challenge, we: (1) build a large dataset of 5,343 3D
caricature meshes and use it to establish a PCA model in the 3D caricature
shape space; (2) reconstruct a normal full 3D head from the input face photo
and use its PCA representation in the 3D caricature shape space to establish
correspondences between the input photo and 3D caricature shape; and (3)
propose a novel character loss and a novel caricature loss based on previous
psychological studies on caricatures. Experiments including a novel two-level
user study show that our system can generate high-quality 3D caricatures
directly from normal face photos.

resolved.
  Methods: We analyse an imaging line survey covering the area of OMC-1 to
OMC-3 from 200.2 to 281.8 GHz obtained with the PI230 receiver at the APEX
telescope. Masks are used to define regions with distinct properties (e.g.
column density or temperature ranges) from which we obtain averaged spectra.
Lines of 29 molecular species (55 isotopologues) are fitted for each region to
obtain the respective total intensity.
  Results: We find that strong sources like Orion KL have a clear impact on the
emission on larger scales. Although not spatially extended, their line emission
contributes substantially to spectra averaged over large regions. Conversely,
the emission signatures of dense, cold regions like OMC-2 and OMC-3 (e.g.
enhanced N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission and low HCN/HNC ratio) seem to be difficult to
pick up on larger scales, where they are eclipsed by signatures of stronger
sources. In all regions, HCO$^{+}$ appears to contribute between 3% and 6% to
the total intensity, the most stable value for all bright species.
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ shows the strongest correlation with column density, but not
with typical high-density tracers like HCN, HCO$^{+}$, H$_{2}$CO, or HNC.
Common line ratios associated with UV illumination, CN/HNC and CN/HCO$^{+}$,
show ambiguous results on larger scales, suggesting that the identification of
UV illuminated material may be more challenging. The HCN/HNC ratio may be
related to temperature over varying scales.

single-frame supervision, for temporal action localization (TAL). To obtain the
single-frame supervision, the annotators are asked to identify only a single
frame within the temporal window of an action. This can significantly reduce
the labor cost of obtaining full supervision which requires annotating the
action boundary. Compared to the weak supervision that only annotates the
video-level label, the single-frame supervision introduces extra temporal
action signals while maintaining low annotation overhead. To make full use of
such single-frame supervision, we propose a unified system called SF-Net.
First, we propose to predict an actionness score for each video frame. Along
with a typical category score, the actionness score can provide comprehensive
information about the occurrence of a potential action and aid the temporal
boundary refinement during inference. Second, we mine pseudo action and
background frames based on the single-frame annotations. We identify pseudo
action frames by adaptively expanding each annotated single frame to its
nearby, contextual frames and we mine pseudo background frames from all the
unannotated frames across multiple videos. Together with the ground-truth
labeled frames, these pseudo-labeled frames are further used for training the
classifier. In extensive experiments on THUMOS14, GTEA, and BEOID, SF-Net
significantly improves upon state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods in terms
of both segment localization and single-frame localization. Notably, SF-Net
achieves comparable results to its fully-supervised counterpart which requires
much more resource intensive annotations. The code is available at

of a quantum liquid. Because it is an entropy wave, it probes the thermodynamic
properties of the quantum liquid which are determined, e.g., by the interaction
strength between the particles of the quantum liquid and their temperature.
Here, we study second sound propagation for a large range of interaction
strengths within the crossover between a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid. In particular, we investigate the
strongly-interacting regime where currently theoretical predictions only exist
in terms of an interpolation between the BEC, BCS and unitary regimes. Working
with a quantum gas of ultracold fermionic $^6$Li atoms with tunable
interactions, we show that the second sound speed varies only slightly in the
crossover regime. We gain deeper insights into sound propagation and excitation
of second sound by varying the excitation procedure which ranges from a sudden
force pulse to a gentle heating pulse at the cloud center. These measurements
are accompanied by classical-field simulations which help with the
interpretation of the experimental data. Furthermore, we determine the spatial
extension of the superfluid phase and estimate the superfluid density. In the
future, this may be used to construct the so far unknown equation of state

calculating the expectation value of a circular Wilson loop, the pair

constant magnetic field are present. The aforementioned result obtained from
the potential analysis is also confirmed here when no magnetic fields are

to the direction of the electric field suppresses the rate of producing the
quark pairs and accordingly increases the critical electric field below which
the Schwinger effect does not occur. Interestingly, the presence of a parallel
magnetic field alone does not change the response of the system to the external
electric field, although it enhances the creation rate when a perpendicular

sequence of scalar-valued loss functions $f_k(\cdot)$ at sampling times
$\tau_k$ or to locate the root of a sequence of vector-valued functions
$g_k(\cdot)$ at $\tau_k$ with respect to a parameter $\theta\in R^p$. The
available information is the noise-corrupted observation(s) of either
$f_k(\cdot)$ or $g_k(\cdot)$ evaluated at one or two design points only. Given
the time-varying stochastic approximation setup, we apply stochastic
approximation algorithms with non-decaying gains, so that the recursive
estimate denoted as $\hat{\theta}_k$ can maintain its momentum in tracking the
time-varying optimum denoted as $\theta_k^*$.
  Chapter 3 provides a bound for the root-mean-squared error $
\sqrt{E(\|\hat{\theta}_k-\theta_k^*\|^2})$. Overall, the bounds are applicable
under a mild assumption on the time-varying drift and a modest restriction on
the observation noise and the bias term. After establishing the tracking
capability in Chapter 3, we also discuss the concentration behavior of
$\hat{\theta}_k $ in Chapter 4. The weak convergence limit of the continuous
interpolation of $\hat{\theta}_k$ is shown to follow the trajectory of a
non-autonomous ordinary differential equation. Both Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 are
probabilistic arguments and may not provide much guidance on the gain-tuning
strategies useful for one single experiment run. Therefore, Chapter 5 discusses
a data-dependent gain-tuning strategy based on estimating the Hessian
information and the noise level. Overall, this work answers the questions ""what

is considered to be a single degree of freedom that is characterized by the
local Stokes parameters over the transverse plane. Based on such a description,
vector vortex beams are considered to be entangled in polarization and spatial
mode. Here we show that there is not any entanglement in a large class of
representative vector vortex beams, including the well-known cylindrical-vector
beams. This is achieved by developing an approach to exactly characterize the
polarization of a general beam. It is found that the Stokes parameters, when
generalized rigorously to a general beam in momentum space, are physical
quantities with respect to a natural coordinate system. The so-called Stratton
vector determining the natural coordinate system fixes a natural representation
for the polarization in which the Pauli matrices represent the intrinsic degree
of freedom of the polarization with respect to the natural coordinate system.
As a result, the Stratton vector itself shows up as another degree of freedom
of the polarization. From this point of view, the light beams specified by a
Stratton vector parallel to the propagation axis as well as by the eigenvalues
of the Pauli matrix $\hat{\sigma}_1$ are precisely vector vortex beams. They
are not endowed with any entanglement.

methods and their widespread applications ranging from sociology and biology to
transportation and communications. In this context of graph-aware methods, the
present paper introduces a tensor-graph convolutional network (TGCN) for
scalable semi-supervised learning (SSL) from data associated with a collection
of graphs, that are represented by a tensor. Key aspects of the novel TGCN
architecture are the dynamic adaptation to different relations in the tensor
graph via learnable weights, and the consideration of graph-based regularizers
to promote smoothness and alleviate over-parameterization. The ultimate goal is
to design a powerful learning architecture able to: discover complex and highly
nonlinear data associations, combine (and select) multiple types of relations,
scale gracefully with the graph size, and remain robust to perturbations on the
graph edges. The proposed architecture is relevant not only in applications
where the nodes are naturally involved in different relations (e.g., a
multi-relational graph capturing family, friendship and work relations in a
social network), but also in robust learning setups where the graph entails a
certain level of uncertainty, and the different tensor slabs correspond to
different versions (realizations) of the nominal graph. Numerical tests
showcase that the proposed architecture achieves markedly improved performance
relative to standard GCNs, copes with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, and
leads to remarkable SSL performance over protein-to-protein interaction
networks.

problem is obtained by solving one or more related initial value problems.
Therefore, a transformation method, like a shooting method, is an initial value
method. The main difference between a transformation and a shooting method is
that the former is conceived and derive its formulation from the scaling
invariance theory. This paper is concerned with the application of the
iterative transformation method to several problems in the boundary layer
theory. The iterative method is an extension of the T{\""o}pfer's non-iterative
algorithm developed as a simple way to solve the celebrated Blasius problem.
This iterative method provides a simple numerical test for the existence and
uniqueness of solutions. Here we show how the method can be applied to problems
with a homogeneous boundary conditions at infinity and in particular we solve
the Sakiadis problem of boundary layer theory. Moreover, we show how to couple
our method with Newton's root-finder. The obtained numerical results compare
well with those available in the literature. The main aim here is that any
method developed for the Blasius, or the Sakiadis, problem might be extended to
more challenging or interesting problems. In this context, the iterative
transformation method has been recently applied to compute the normal and

using a neural network model that is trained by wire-mesh sensor (WMS)
experimental data. The WMS is an experimental tool that records high-resolution
high-frequency 3D void fraction distributions in gas-liquid flows. The
experimental database utilized spans over two orders of superficial velocity
magnitude and multiple flow regimes for a vertical small-diameter pipe. Our
findings indicate that a single network can provide accurate and precise
inference with below a 7.5% MAP error across all flow regimes. The best
performing networks have a combination of a 3D-Convolution head, and an LSTM
tail. The finding indicates that the spatiotemporal features observed in
gas-liquid flows can be systematically decomposed and used for inferring
phase-wise flowrate. Our method does not involve any complex pre-processing of
the void fraction matrices, resulting in an evaluation time that is negligible
when contrasted to the input time-span. The efficiency of the model manifests
in a response time two orders of magnitude lower than the current
state-of-the-art.

the lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses,
even after mutations, and thus these closely-related viruses will be
disinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same concentration. Existing
experimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v% is
sufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author
suggests that it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v%
concentration for this disinfection process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water
dilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available and safe
(non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\circ$C (122~140$^\circ$F)
through the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside
the respiratory tract; mainly in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration
will be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which is enough to disinfect
the corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more
moisture into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal
cavity by stimulating blowing of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator
work actively so that the self-clearing mechanism in the trachea will remove
viruses faster. An alternative prompt method is also discussed. We use 40 v/v%
whisky or similar alcohol, dripping on a gauze, inhale the vapor slowly at room
temperature. This method works well for the front part of the nasal cavity.

contained in the precipitate shapes. However, the computational cost of LER
estimation can be high because the accurate computation of the model is
required many times to better explore parameters. To overcome this difficulty,
we used a Gaussian-process-based multifidelity modeling, in which training data
can be sampled from multiple computations with different accuracy levels

computational cost is lower than that for higher-fidelity samples. Our proposed
