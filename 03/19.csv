calculate the frequency-dependent shear viscosity of pure water and
water-glycerol mixtures. In agreement with recent experiments, we find
deviations from Newtonian-fluid behavior in the THz regime. Based on an
extension of the Maxwell model, we introduce a viscoelastic model to describe
the observed viscosity spectrum of pure water. We find four relaxation modes in
the spectrum which we attribute to i) hydrogen-bond network topology changes,
ii) hydrogen-bond stretch vibrations of water pairs, iii) collective vibrations
of water molecule triplets, and iv) librational excitations of individual water
molecules. Our model quantitatively describes the viscoelastic response of
liquid water on short timescales, where the hydrodynamic description via a
Newtonian-fluid model breaks down.

orientations of a collection of cameras from their images of a 3D scene. The
problem has been studied using a variety of distances and robustifiers. The
intrinsic (or geodesic) distance on SO(3) is geometrically meaningful; but
while some extrinsic distance-based solvers admit (conditional) guarantees of
correctness, no comparable results have been found under the intrinsic metric.
  In this paper, we study the spatial distribution of local minima. First, we
do a novel empirical study to demonstrate sharp transitions in qualitative
behavior: as problems become noisier, they transition from a single
(easy-to-find) dominant minimum to a cost surface filled with minima. In the
second part of this paper we derive a theoretical bound for when this
transition occurs. This is an extension of the results of [24], which used
local convexity as a proxy to study the difficulty of problem. By recognizing
the underlying quotient manifold geometry of the problem we achieve an n-fold
improvement over prior work. Incidentally, our analysis also extends the prior
$l_2$ work to general $l_p$ costs. Our results suggest using algebraic
connectivity as an indicator of problem difficulty.

vulnerable to co-channel interference. One possibility to address this issue is
the use of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. However, due to a
potentially very long duty cycle, OMA is not well suited for such schemes.
Instead, random medium access (RMA) appears more promising. An RMA scheme is
based on transmission of short data packets with random scheduling, which is
typically unknown to the receiver. The received signal, which consists of the
overlapping packets, can be used for energy harvesting and powering of a relay
device. Such an energy harvesting relay may utilize the energy for further
information processing and uplink transmission. In this paper, we address the
design of a simultaneous information and power transfer scheme based on
randomly scheduled packet transmissions and reliable symbol detection. We
formulate a prediction problem with the goal to maximize the harvested power
for an RMA scenario. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new
prediction method, which shows a significant performance improvement compared
to the straightforward baseline scheme. Furthermore, we investigate the
complexity of the proposed method and its vulnerability to imperfect channel

adequately described by the classical Helfrich Hamiltonian. However, various
local membrane heterogeneities can result in a lipids tilt relative to the
membrane surface normal. On the basis of the classical elasticity theory of 3D
bodies, Hamm and Kozlov [Eur. Phys. J. E 3, 323 (2000)] derived the most
general energy functional, taking into account the tilt and bending. Recently,
Terzi and Deserno [J. Chem. Phys. 147, 084702 (2017)] showed that Hamm and
Kozlov's derivation was incomplete because the tilt-curvature coupling term had
been missed. However, the energy functional derived by Terzi and Deserno
appeared to be unstable, thereby being invalid for applications. Here, we
derive a stable elastic energy functional, showing that the squared gradient of
the curvature was missed in both of these works. This change in the energy
functional arises from a more accurate consideration of the transverse shear
deformation terms and their influence on the membrane stability. We also
consider the influence of the prestress terms on the stability of the energy
functional, and we show that the effective Gaussian curvature should be
neglected because of the stability requirements. We further generalize the
theory, including the stretching-compressing deformation modes, and we provide
the geometrical interpretation of the terms that were previously missed by Hamm

of a membrane-mediated interaction of two amphipathic peptides located in the

$\Omega_{m0}=0.288\pm 0.012$ and $H_{0}=69.652\pm 1.698~{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ at the
$1\sigma$ CL. We also find that the LDF model shows a smooth transition from
the deceleration phase to acceleration phase of the universe in the recent
past. We notice that the redshift of this transition $z_{t}=0.706\pm 0.048$
($1\sigma$ error) and is well consistent with the present observations.
Interestingly, we find that the Universe will settle down to a $\Lambda$CDM
model in future and there will not be any future singularity in the LDF model.
Furthermore, we notice that there is no significant difference between the LDF
and $\Lambda$CDM models at the present epoch, but the difference (at the
percent level) between these models is found as the redshift increases. We have
also studied the generalized second law of thermodynamics at the dynamical
apparent horizon for the LDF model with the Bekenstein and Viaggiu entropies.

employing an Eulerian Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) methodology. We
demonstrate the robustness of our feature on both synthetic 3D shapes and

thresholding algorithm (LISTA)---design deep neural networks as learned
variations of optimization methods. These networks have been shown to achieve
faster convergence and higher accuracy than the original optimization methods.
In this line of research, this paper develops a novel deep recurrent neural
network (coined reweighted-RNN) by the unfolding of a reweighted
$\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ minimization algorithm and applies it to the task of
sequential signal reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first deep unfolding method that explores reweighted minimization. Due to the
underlying reweighted minimization model, our RNN has a different
soft-thresholding function (alias, different activation functions) for each
hidden unit in each layer. Furthermore, it has higher network expressivity than
existing deep unfolding RNN models due to the over-parameterizing weights.
Importantly, we establish theoretical generalization error bounds for the
proposed reweighted-RNN model by means of Rademacher complexity. The bounds
reveal that the parameterization of the proposed reweighted-RNN ensures good
generalization. We apply the proposed reweighted-RNN to the problem of video
frame reconstruction from low-dimensional measurements, that is, sequential
frame reconstruction. The experimental results on the moving MNIST dataset
demonstrate that the proposed deep reweighted-RNN significantly outperforms
existing RNN models.

are useful but still limited due to the lack of annotated data. Using a weakly
supervised learning is a promising way to address this problem, however, it is
challenging to train one model to detect and locate efficiently different type
of lesions due to the huge variation in images. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to locate different type of lesions in positron emission
tomography (PET) images using only a class label at the image-level. First, a
simple convolutional neural network classifier is trained to predict the type
of cancer on two 2D MIP images. Then, a pseudo-localization of the tumor is
generated using class activation maps, back-propagated and corrected in a
multitask learning approach with prior knowledge, resulting in a tumor
detection mask. Finally, we use the mask generated from the two 2D images to
detect the tumor in the 3D image. The advantage of our proposed method consists
of detecting the whole tumor volume in 3D images, using only two 2D images of
PET image, and showing a very promising results. It can be used as a tool to
locate very efficiently tumors in a PET scan, which is a time-consuming task
for physicians. In addition, we show that our proposed method can be used to

to use high speed, high resolution sampling electronics located very close to

predictions from machine learning models to streamline operations, yet need to
externally acquire training data to fit such models. One aspect that has
received limited consideration is the externality a firm faces when data is
allocated to competing firms. Such externalities couple firms' optimal
allocations, despite the inherent free replicability of data. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the presence of externalities increases the optimal revenue of
a monopolistic data seller by letting firms pay to prevent allocations to other
competing firms. This is shown by first reducing the combinatorial problem of
allocating and pricing multiple datasets to the auction of a single digital
good. We achieve this by modeling utility for data solely through the increase
in prediction accuracy it provides. Then, we find the welfare and revenue
maximizing mechanisms, highlighting how the form of firms' private information
- whether they know the externalities they exert on others or vice-versa -
affects their overall structures. In all cases, the optimal allocation rule is
a single threshold (one per firm), where either all data is allocated or none

labels as opposed to expensive bounding box annotations required by fully

target classes with weakly supervised image labels, helped by a fully annotated
source dataset. Typically, a WSOL model is first trained to predict class
generic objectness scores on an off-the-shelf fully supervised source dataset
and then it is progressively adapted to learn the objects in the weakly
supervised target dataset. In this work, we argue that learning only an
objectness function is a weak form of knowledge transfer and propose to learn a
classwise pairwise similarity function that directly compares two input
proposals as well. The combined localization model and the estimated object
annotations are jointly learned in an alternating optimization paradigm as is
typically done in standard WSOL methods. In contrast to the existing work that
learns pairwise similarities, our approach optimizes a unified objective with
convergence guarantee and it is computationally efficient for large-scale
applications. Experiments on the COCO and ILSVRC 2013 detection datasets show
that the performance of the localization model improves significantly with the
inclusion of pairwise similarity function. For instance, in the ILSVRC dataset,
the Correct Localization (CorLoc) performance improves from 72.8% to 78.2%

decision-making. For example, self-driving vehicles and robotic manipulation
systems often forecast future object poses by first detecting and tracking
objects. However, this detect-then-forecast pipeline is expensive to scale, as
pose forecasting algorithms typically require labeled sequences of object
poses, which are costly to obtain in 3D space. Can we scale performance without
requiring additional labels? We hypothesize yes, and propose inverting the
detect-then-forecast pipeline. Instead of detecting, tracking and then
forecasting the objects, we propose to first forecast 3D sensor data (e.g.,
point clouds with $100$k points) and then detect/track objects on the predicted
point cloud sequences to obtain future poses, i.e., a forecast-then-detect
pipeline. This inversion makes it less expensive to scale pose forecasting, as
the sensor data forecasting task requires no labels. Part of this work's focus
is on the challenging first step -- Sequential Pointcloud Forecasting (SPF),
for which we also propose an effective approach, SPFNet. To compare our
forecast-then-detect pipeline relative to the detect-then-forecast pipeline, we
propose an evaluation procedure and two metrics. Through experiments on a
robotic manipulation dataset and two driving datasets, we show that SPFNet is
effective for the SPF task, our forecast-then-detect pipeline outperforms the
detect-then-forecast approaches to which we compared, and that pose forecasting
performance improves with the addition of unlabeled data.

phenomenon which has been accelerated and amplified by social media such as

specific agenda, it has also been widely documented that others aim to simply
disrupt the network by increasing disagreement and polarization across the
network and thereby destabilizing society. Popular social networks are also
vulnerable to large-scale attacks. Motivated by this reality, we introduce a
simple model of network disruption where an adversary can take over a limited
number of user profiles in a social network with the aim of maximizing
disagreement and/or polarization in the network.
  We investigate this model both theoretically and empirically. We show that
the adversary will always change the opinion of a taken-over profile to an
extreme in order to maximize disruption. We also prove that an adversary can
increase disagreement / polarization at most linearly in the number of user
profiles it takes over. Furthermore, we present a detailed empirical study of
several natural algorithms for the adversary on both synthetic networks and
real world (Reddit and Twitter) data sets. These show that even simple,
unsophisticated heuristics, such as targeting centrists, can disrupt a network
effectively, causing a large increase in disagreement / polarization. Studying
the problem of network disruption through the lens of an adversary thus
highlights the seriousness of the problem.

Project Page: https://www.ye-yuan.com/dlow",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are
able to model multi-modal data distributions and characterize diverse human
behavior. While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep
generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep
generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem.
To obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative
human motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes
and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is
not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent
sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based
solely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the
major modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a
novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse
set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random
(independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single
random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a
set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded
into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a
diversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent
mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly
flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features
(e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments
demonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of
sample diversity and accuracy. Our code is released on the project page:

demand-side response (DSR) and facilitate use of local energy storage. We find
that with the flexibility of SLES present, variable renewables such as offshore
wind can displace firm but more expensive low-carbon sources such as CCS.
Considering a 100 gCO2/kWh emissions target in 2030, a 10% penetration of SLES
could reduce total costs by {\pounds}1.2bn/year relative to no SLES, while at
higher penetration of 50% SLES, savings increase twofold to
{\pounds}2.8bn/year. Under a more stringent emissions limit of 25 gCO2/kWh in
2040, the savings rise to {\pounds}2.9bn/year for 10% SLES uptake and rise
threefold to {\pounds}8.7bn/year at 50% uptake. These results hold for costs of
enabling DSR of less than {\pounds}100/kW and it is not until an unlikely
{\pounds}5,000/kW that the savings are nullified. The savings from substituting
wind for CCS remain substantial even if the anticipated reduction of cost of
wind in 2040 does not materialise. Cost savings from the flexibility provided
by SLES are affected by realisation of domestic DSR through other means. A 20%
uptake level of non-SLES DSR in 2040 still allows SLES to create cost savings
of {\pounds}6.8bn/year at 50% penetration (a 20% fall from

incompleteness, and/or interloper populations, as this is crucial to tests of

We find that requiring parallax determinations of high precision induces
sampling biases, so that we eschew such requirements and exclude, e.g., regions
around the lines of sight to the Magellanic clouds, along with their
mirror-image lines of sight, to ensure well-matched data sets. After making
conservative cuts, we demonstrate the existence of azimuthal asymmetries, and

often cools rapidly. The energy lost to cooling is balanced by the advection of
hot high enthalpy gas into the mixing layer, resulting in growth and
acceleration of the cold phase. This process may play a major role in
determining the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium phase structure,
and accelerating cold gas in galactic winds and cosmic filaments. Cooling in
these mixing layers occurs in a thin corrugated sheet, which we argue has an
area with fractal dimension $D=5/2$ and a thickness that adjusts to match the
hot phase mixing time to the cooling time. These cooling sheet properties form
the basis of a new model for how the cooling rate and hot gas inflow velocity
depend on the size $L$, cooling time $t_{\rm cool}$, relative velocity $v_{\rm

Entrainment is expected to be enhanced in environments with short $t_{\rm

there is a tight mathematical relationship between the radial mass profile and
the angular structure, as is true of ellipsoids, an Einstein ring can appear to
strongly distinguish radial mass distributions with the same xi2. This problem
is beautifully illustrated by the ellipsoidal models in Millon et al. (2019).
When using Einstein rings to constrain the radial mass distribution, the
angular structure of the models must contain all the degrees of freedom
expected in nature (e.g., external shear, different ellipticities for the stars
and the dark matter, modest deviations from elliptical structure, modest twists
of the axes, modest ellipticity gradients, etc.) that work to decouple the
radial and angular structure of the gravity. Models of Einstein rings with too
few angular degrees of freedom will lead to strongly biased likelihood
distinctions between radial mass distributions and very precise but inaccurate

  The key idea of our approach is to learn a patch-based conditional

  Our discriminator takes a synthesized view and a real image, and evaluates
whether the synthesized one is realistic, under a broadened definition of
realism.
  We train the discriminator by providing as `real' examples pairs of input
views and their misaligned versions -- so that the learned adversarial loss
will tolerate errors from the scans.
  Experiments on synthetic and real data under quantitative or qualitative
evaluation demonstrate the advantage of our approach in comparison to state of
the art. Our code is publicly available with video demonstration.

reconstruction using light-cone cuts and propose a prescription to obtain the
full higher-dimensional metric of generic spacetimes up to an overall conformal
factor. We first extend the definition of light-cone cuts to include
information about the asymptotic compact dimensions, and show that the full
conformal metric can be recovered from these extended cuts. We then give a
prescription for obtaining these extended cuts from the dual field theory. The
location of the usual cuts can still be obtained from bulk-point singularities
of correlators, and the new information in the extended cut can be extracted by
using appropriate combinations of operators dual to Kaluza-Klein modes of the
higher-dimensional bulk fields.

with the tidal disruption of differentiated asteroids with bulk densities $< 4$
g cm$^{-3}$ and bulk masses $\lesssim 10^{21}$ kg (Veras et al., 2017;
arXiv:1610.06926). We use the open-source N-body code REBOUND (Rein and Liu,
2011; arXiv:1110.4876) to simulate this disruption with different internal
structures: varying the core volume fraction, mantle/core density ratio, and
the presence/absence of a thin low-density crust. We allow the rubble pile to
partially disrupt and capture lightcurves at a specific point during the
disruption at cadences comparable to those from ground-based photometry. As a
proof-of-concept we show that varying these structural parameters have
observationally distinguishable effects on the transit light curve as the
asteroid is disrupted and compare the simulation-generated lightcurves to data
from Gary et al., 2017 (arXiv:1608.00026). With the caveat that our simulations
do not model the sublimation in detail or account for its effects on orbital
evolution, we find that a low core fraction and low mantle/core density ratio
asteroid is most consistent with the stable transit feature present for
multiple weeks circa April 2016 (referred to as G6121 in Gary et al., 2017

panoramic view to help dentists observe the invisible disease inside the gum.
However, it provides limited 2D information compared with cone-beam computed
tomography (CBCT), another dental imaging method that generates a 3D picture of
the oral cavity but with more radiation dose and a higher price. Consequently,
it is of great interest to reconstruct the 3D structure from a 2D X-ray image,
which can greatly explore the application of X-ray imaging in dental surgeries.
In this paper, we propose a framework, named Oral-3D, to reconstruct the 3D
oral cavity from a single PX image and prior information of the dental arch.
Specifically, we first train a generative model to learn the cross-dimension
transformation from 2D to 3D. Then we restore the shape of the oral cavity with
a deformation module with the dental arch curve, which can be obtained simply
by taking a photo of the patient's mouth. To be noted, Oral-3D can restore both
the density of bony tissues and the curved mandible surface. Experimental
results show that Oral-3D can efficiently and effectively reconstruct the 3D
oral structure and show critical information in clinical applications, e.g.,
tooth pulling and dental implants. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to explore this domain transformation problem between these two imaging

extensive work in geometric deep learning, focusing on designing network
architectures that ensure neuron activations conform to regularity patterns

accounted for by considering the similarity of activations between adjacent
nodes, which limits the capabilities of such methods to discriminate between
nodes in a graph. Here, we propose to augment conventional GCNs with geometric
scattering transforms and residual convolutions. The former enables band-pass
filtering of graph signals, thus alleviating the so-called oversmoothing often
encountered in GCNs, while the latter is introduced to clear the resulting
features of high-frequency noise. We establish the advantages of the presented
Scattering GCN with both theoretical results establishing the complementary

benefit from multiplexed photonic quantum memories. In this work we demonstrate
a temporally multiplexed quantum repeater node in a laser-cooled cloud of
$^{87}$Rb atoms. We employ the DLCZ protocol where pairs of photons and single
collective spin excitations (so called spin waves) are created in several
temporal modes using a train of write pulses. To make the spin waves created in
different temporal modes distinguishable and enable selective readout, we
control the dephasing and rephasing of the spin waves by a magnetic field
gradient, which induces a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the
involved atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate that by embedding the atomic
ensemble inside a low finesse optical cavity, the additional noise generated in
multi-mode operation is strongly suppressed. By employing feed forward readout,
we demonstrate distinguishable retrieval of up to 10 temporal modes. For each
mode, we prove non-classical correlations between the first and second photon.
Furthermore, an enhancement in rates of correlated photon pairs is observed as
we increase the number of temporal modes stored in the memory. The reported
capability is a key element of a quantum repeater architecture based on
multiplexed quantum memories.

scarcity of identifiable anatomical landmarks. We developed a technique for

method's inputs are end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) segmented 3D
surface models. The method first defines a partition of the ED endocardium
using the geodesic distances from each surface point to apex, tricuspid valve
and pulmonary valve: the landmarks that define the 3 regions. The ED surface
mesh is then tetrahedralised, and the endocardial-defined partition is
interpolated in the blood cavity via the Laplace equation. For obtaining an ES
partition, the endocardial partition is transported from ED to ES using a
commercial image-based tracking, and then interpolated towards the endocardium,
similarly to ED, for computing volumes and ejection fraction (EF). We present a
full assessment of the method's validity and reproducibility. First, we assess
reproducibility under segmentation variability, obtaining intra- and inter-
observer errors (4-10% and 10-23% resp.). Finally, we use a synthetic
remodelling dataset to identify the situations in which our method is able to
correctly determine the region that has remodelled. This dataset is generated
by a novel mesh reconstruction method that deforms a reference mesh, locally
imposing a given strain, expressed in anatomical coordinates. We show that the

resembles that in the host stars, one might expect Kepler planets to occur more
frequently, and to be more massive, around metal-rich stars. Contrary to these
expectations, we find that the radii of Kepler planets (a proxy for mass) are
independent of host metallicity. Previous claims that larger planets prefer
more metal-rich stars can be adequately explained by the combined facts that
more massive stars tend to host bigger planets, and that more massive stars are
also more metal rich in the Kepler sample. We interpret this independence as
that the mass of a Kepler planet is not determined by the availability of
solids, but is instead regulated by an as yet unknown process. Moreover, we
find that the occurrence rates of Kepler planets rise only weakly with stellar
metallicity, a trend that is further flattened when the influence of close
stellar binaries is accounted for. We explain this weak dependence, in contrast
to the strong dependence exhibited by Jovian planets, using a phenomenological
model, wherein the masses of proto-planetary disks have a much larger spread
than the spread in stellar metallicity, and wherein the formation of Jovian
planets requires disks that contain some $5$ times more solid than that needed
to form Kepler planets. This model predicts that stars more metal-poor than

proposed architecture, called a Neural Fuzzy Extractor (NFE), allows the
coupling of pre-existing classifiers with fuzzy extractors, through a

active flow control with steady blowing to increase the pressure distribution
within a single-phase pump-induced wall-normal vortex model, which is based on
the Burgers vortex with a no-slip boundary condition prescribed along its
symmetry plane. The goal of our control is to modify the vortex core velocity
profile. These changes are sought to increase the core pressure such that
detrimental effects on the pump are alleviated. Three-dimensional direct
numerical simulations (DNS) are performed to examine the dynamics of the vortex
with the application of axial momentum injection at and around the root of the
vortex. We find that the active flow control approach can effectively modify
the wall-normal vortical structure and significantly increase the low-core
pressure by up to 81% compared to that of the uncontrolled case. The result
shows that the control setup is also effective when it is introduced in an
off-centered manner. Compared to the unsteady blowing and suction based
actuation from our previous work (Liu et al. 2018), the current steady control

adapts a framework that defined a general set of supersenses according to

that the supersense categories are well-suited to Chinese adpositions despite

analysis could improve our ability to identify the relation between students'
online learning behavior and overall performance in an introductory physics
course. We created four linear regression models correlating students'
pass-fail events in a sequence of online learning modules with their normalized
total course score. Each model takes into account an additional level of
contextual information than the previous one, such as student learning strategy
and duration of assessment attempts. Each of the latter three models is also
accompanied by a visual representation of students' interaction states on each
learning module. We found that the best performing model is the one that
includes the most contextual information, including instruction condition,
internal condition, and learning strategy. The model shows that while most
students failed on the most challenging learning module, those with normal
learning behavior are more likely to obtain higher total course scores, whereas
students who resorted to guessing on the assessments of subsequent modules
tended to receive lower total scores. Our results suggest that considering more
contextual information related to each event can be an effective method to
improve the quality of learning analytics, leading to more accurate and
actionable recommendations for instructors.

momentum $S$ of an isolated black hole with mass $\mu$ is limited by the Kerr
bound, $S\leq G\mu^2/c$. Testing this cornerstone is challenging due to the
difficulty in modelling spinning compact objects that violate this bound. We
argue that precise, model-independent tests can be achieved by measuring
gravitational waves from an extreme mass ratio inspiral around a supermassive
object, one of the main targets of the future LISA mission. In the extreme mass
ratio limit, the dynamics of the small compact object depends only on its
multipole moments, which are free parameters. At variance with the
comparable-mass case, accurate waveforms are valid also when the spin of the
small object greatly exceeds the Kerr bound. By computing the orbital dephasing
and the gravitational-wave signal emitted by a spinning point particle in
circular, nonprecessing, equatorial motion around a Kerr black hole, we
estimate that LISA will be able to measure the spin of the small compact object
at the level of $10\%$. Together with mass measurements, this will allow for
theory-agnostic, unprecedented constraints on string-theory inspired objects
such as ""superspinars"", almost in their entire parameter space.

of variables which, when conditioned on, may further amplify existing
unmeasured confounding bias (bias amplification). Despite this theoretical
work, existing simulations of bias amplification in clinical settings have
suggested bias amplification may not be as important in many practical cases as
suggested in the theoretical literature.We resolve this tension by using tools
from the semi-parametric regression literature leading to a general
characterization in terms of the geometry of OLS estimators which allows us to
extend current results to a larger class of DAGs, functional forms, and
distributional assumptions. We further use these results to understand the
limitations of current simulation approaches and to propose a new framework for
performing causal simulation experiments to compare estimators. We then
evaluate the challenges and benefits of extending this simulation approach to
the context of a real clinical data set with a binary treatment, laying the
groundwork for a principled approach to sensitivity analysis for bias
amplification in the presence of unmeasured confounding.

surface temperatures and its thermophysical properties. This provides a
dramatic improvement on the work in Howett et al. (2011), where the values were
determined at only two regions on Mimas (one inside, and another outside of the
anomalous region). We use all spatially-resolved scans made by CIRS' focal
plane 3 (FP3, 600 to 1100 cm-1) of Mimas' surface, which are largely daytime
observations but do include one nighttime one. The resulting temperature maps
confirm the presence and location of Mimas' previously discovered thermally
anomalous region. No other thermally anomalous regions were discovered,
although we note that the surface coverage is incomplete on Mimas' leading and
anti-Saturn hemisphere. The thermal inertia map confirms that the anomalous
region has a notably higher thermal inertia than its surroundings: 98 +/- 42 J
m-2 K-1 s-1/2 inside of the anomaly, compared to 34 +/- 32 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2
outside. The albedo inside and outside of the anomalous region agrees within
their uncertainty: 0.45+/-0.08 inside compared to 0.41 +/- 0.07 outside the
anomaly. Interestingly the albedo appears brighter inside the anomaly region,
which may not be surprising given this region does appear brighter at some UV
wavelengths (0.338 microns, see Schenk et al., 2011). However, this result
should be treated with caution because, as previously stated, statistically the
albedo of these two regions is the same when their uncertainties are
considered. These thermal inertia and albedo values determined here are
consistent with those found by Howett et al. (2011), who determined the thermal
inertia inside the anomaly to be 66 +/- 23 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 and less than 16 J
m-2 K-1 s-1/2 outside, with albedos that varied from 0.49 to 0.70.

general position in the plane (realizable simple planar order types, realizable
uniform acyclic oriented matroids of rank $3$):
  (a) The number of extreme points in an $n$-point order type, chosen uniformly
at random from all such order types, is on average $4+o(1)$. For labeled order
types, this number has average $4- \frac{8}{n^2 - n +2}$ and variance at most
$3$.
  (b) The (labeled) order types read off a set of $n$ points sampled
independently from the uniform measure on a convex planar domain, smooth or
polygonal, or from a Gaussian distribution are concentrated, i.e. such sampling
typically encounters only a vanishingly small fraction of all order types of
the given size.
  Result (a) generalizes to arbitrary dimension $d$ for labeled order types
with the average number of extreme points $2d+o(1)$ and constant variance. We
also discuss to what extent our methods generalize to the abstract setting of
uniform acyclic oriented matroids. Moreover, our methods allow to show the
following relative of the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem: for any fixed $k$, as $n
\to \infty$, a proportion $1 - O(1/n)$ of the $n$-point simple order types
contain a triangle enclosing a convex $k$-chain over an edge.

we present results from a new set of experiments that utilize high speed
footage of two-dimensional schooling events, particle tracking, and projected
static and dynamic light fields to observe and control the behavior of

First, we use static light fields consisting of dark circular regions to
produce visual stimuli that confine the schools to a range of areas. We find
that the school has a maximum density independent of group size, and that the
swim pressure increases linearly with number density, suggesting that
unperturbed schools exist on an isotherm. Next, we use dynamic light fields
where the radius of the dark region shrinks linearly with time to compress the
schools. We find that the effective temperature parameter depends on the
compression time and our results are thus consistent with the school having a
constant heat flux. These findings provide further evidence for the utility of
effective thermodynamic descriptions descriptions of non-equilibrium systems in

battery (VB) models are often used to quantify the predictive flexibility in
thermostatic loads (e.g. residential air-conditioners, electric water-heaters),

order dynamics including self-dissipation rate, and power and energy capacities

introduce the notion of stochastic VB models, and propose a \textit{variational
autoencoder}-based deep learning algorithm to identify the probability
distribution of the VB model parameters. Using available sensors and meters
data, the proposed algorithm generates not only point estimates of the VB
parameters, but also confidence intervals around those values. Effectiveness of
the proposed frameworks is demonstrated on a collection of electric
water-heater loads, whose operation is driven by uncertain water usage

semantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training
high-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,
which can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training
such models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.
Recent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have
developed training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which
addresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled
examples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which
represent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very
small labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning
framework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made
available at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to
include surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals
--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that
including unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more
powerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better
generability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in
the task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.
Furthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined

fewer than one satellite galaxy with mass ratio M_sat : M_UMPEG >~ 1:5 (i.e.,
M_sat >~ 10^10.8 M_sun) within 0.5 Mpc; the large mass gap that we observe
between the typical UMPEG and its most massive satellite implies that the z~1.6
UMPEGs assembled through major mergers. Using observed satellite counts with
merger timescales from the literature, we estimate the growth rate due to
mergers with mass ratio of >~ 1:4 to be ~13% Gyr^-1 (with a ~2x systematic
uncertainty). This relatively low growth rate is unlikely to significantly
affect the shape of the massive end of the stellar mass function, whose
evolution must instead be driven by the quenching of new cohorts of
ultra-massive star-forming galaxies. However, this growth rate is high enough
that, if sustained to z~0, the typical z~1.6 M_UMPEG=10^11.6 M_sun UMPEG can
grow into a M_stars~10^12 M_sun brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of a present-day

tackle memory issues regarding the network weights, we use layers that train in
a factorized form directly. Therefore, we can maintain a large number of

the saved memory to increase the input size of the data by order of magnitude

indicating an aromatic structure and a large direct bandgap appears, while in
the absence of BN bonds, an anti-aromatic structure with an odd-number of
$\pi$-bonds is found resulting a direct small bandgap. The stress-strain curves
shows high elastic moduli and tensile strength of the structures with BN-bonds,
compared to structures without BN-bonds. Self-consistent field calculations
demonstrate that BC$_6$N with BN-bonds is energetically more stable than
structures without BN-bonds due to a strong binding energy between the B and
the N atoms, while their phonon dispersion displays that BC$_6$N without
BN-bonds has more dynamical stability. Furthermore, all the BC$_6$N structures
considered show a large absorption of electromagnetic radiation with
polarization parallel to the monolayers in the visible range. Finer detail of
the absorption depend on the actual structures of the layers. A higher

decreases as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature ($T_c\approx50$
K), however, the switching remains abrupt. We then image the initial
magnetization process, which reveals thickness-dependent domain wall depinning
fields well below $H_c$. These results point to ultrathin VI$_3$ being a
nucleation-type hard ferromagnet, where the coercive field is set by the
anisotropy-limited domain wall nucleation field. This work illustrates the
power of widefield NV microscopy to investigate magnetization processes in van

ferromagnetic properties of other materials and explore field- and
current-driven domain wall dynamics.

evaluate a filter's importance using its weights or optimize an alternative
objective function with sparsity constraints. While these methods offer a
useful way to approximate contributions from similar filters, they often either
ignore the dependency between layers or solve a more difficult optimization
objective than standard cross-entropy. Our method, Mutual Information-based
Neuron Trimming (MINT), approaches deep compression via pruning by enforcing
sparsity based on the strength of the relationship between filters of adjacent
layers, across every pair of layers. The relationship is calculated using
conditional geometric mutual information which evaluates the amount of similar
information exchanged between the filters using a graph-based criterion. When
pruning a network, we ensure that retained filters contribute the majority of
the information towards succeeding layers which ensures high performance. Our
novel approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art compression-via-pruning
methods on the standard benchmarks for this task: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
ILSVRC2012, across a variety of network architectures. In addition, we discuss
our observations of a common denominator between our pruning methodology's
response to adversarial attacks and calibration statistics when compared to the
original network.

  Caching",,,,,"cs.MM cs.IT cs.LG cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  360$^o$ video is an essential component of VR/AR/MR systems that provides
immersive experience to the users. However, 360$^o$ video is associated with
high bandwidth requirements. The required bandwidth can be reduced by
exploiting the fact that users are interested in viewing only a part of the
video scene and that users request viewports that overlap with each other.
Motivated by the findings of recent works where the benefits of caching video
tiles at edge servers instead of caching entire 360$^o$ videos were shown, in
this paper, we introduce the concept of virtual viewports that have the same
number of tiles with the original viewports. The tiles forming these viewports
are the most popular ones for each video and are determined by the users'
requests. Then, we propose a proactive caching scheme that assumes unknown
videos' and viewports' popularity. Our scheme determines which videos to cache
as well as which is the optimal virtual viewport per video. Virtual viewports
permit to lower the dimensionality of the cache optimization problem. To solve
the problem, we first formulate the content placement of 360$^o$ videos in edge
cache networks as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and then we determine the
optimal caching placement using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The
proposed solution aims at maximizing the overall quality of the 360$^o$ videos
delivered to the end-users by caching the most popular 360$^o$ videos at base
quality along with a virtual viewport in high quality. We extensively evaluate
the performance of the proposed system and compare it with that of known
systems such as LFU, LRU, FIFO, over both synthetic and real 360$^o$ video
traces. The results reveal the large benefits coming from proactive caching of
virtual viewports instead of the original ones in terms of the overall quality
of the rendered viewports, the cache hit ratio, and the servicing cost.

determine the inner slope of the DM density profile of a massive cluster of

analysis based on an extensive spectroscopic campaign carried out with the

unprecedented sample of 1234 spectroscopic members, 104 of which are located in
the cluster core (R < 200 kpc), extracted from the MUSE integral field
spectroscopy. The latter also allows the stellar velocity dispersion profile of
the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) to be measured out to 40 kpc. Methods: We
used an upgraded version of the MAMPOSSt technique to perform a joint maximum
likelihood fit to the velocity dispersion profile of the BCG and to the
velocity distribution of cluster member galaxies over a radial range from 1 kpc
to the virial radius (~ 2.7 Mpc). Results: We find a value of $\gamma_{DM}
=0.99 \pm 0.04$ for the inner logarithmic slope of the DM density profile after
marginalizing over all the other parameters. The newly determined dynamical
mass profile is found to be in excellent agreement with the mass density
profiles obtained from the independent X-ray hydrostatic analysis based on deep
Chandra data, as well as the strong and weak lensing analyses. Our value of
\gamma_{DM} is in very good agreement with predictions from cosmological CDM
simulations. We will extend our analysis to more clusters in future works. If
confirmed on a larger cluster sample, our result makes this DM model more

CPMD, all time critical routines have been revised to maximize the
computational throughput and to minimize the communication overhead for optimal
performance. Throughout the program missing hybrid MPI+OpenMP parallelization
has been added to optimize scaling. For communication intensive routines, as
the multiple distributed 3d FFTs of the electronic states and distributed
matrix-matrix multiplications related to the $\beta$-projectors of the
pseudopotentials, this MPI+OpenMP parallelization now overlaps computation and
communication. The necessary partitioning of the workload is optimized by an
auto-tuning algorithm. In addition, the largest global MPI_Allreduce operation
has been replaced by highly tuned node-local parallelized operations using MPI
shared-memory windows to avoid inter-node communication. A batched algorithm
for the multiple 3d FFTs improves the throughput of the MPI_Alltoall
communication and, thus, the scalability of the implementation, both for USPP

enhanced performance and scalability is demonstrated on a mid-sized benchmark

develop a toy model of the dependence epidemics spreading on the availability

model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two
components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through
tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate
from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected
individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a
giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that
the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the
rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that
the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the
form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested
and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing
activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially
keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of
testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various
orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing
epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to
develop quantitative models of testing process.

practitioners in domains as diverse as hypothesis testing to product
recommendations. There have been a lot of approaches in exploiting rich data
representations for contextual bandit problems with varying degree of success.
Self-supervised learning is a promising approach to find rich data
representations without explicit labels. In a typical self-supervised learning
scheme, the primary task is defined by the problem objective (e.g. clustering,
classification, embedding generation etc.) and the secondary task is defined by
the self-supervision objective (e.g. rotation prediction, words in
neighborhood, colorization, etc.). In the usual self-supervision, we learn
implicit labels from the training data for a secondary task. However, in the
contextual bandit setting, we don't have the advantage of getting implicit
labels due to lack of data in the initial phase of learning. We provide a novel
approach to tackle this issue by combining a contextual bandit objective with a
self supervision objective. By augmenting contextual bandit learning with
self-supervision we get a better cumulative reward. Our results on eight
popular computer vision datasets show substantial gains in cumulative reward.
We provide cases where the proposed scheme doesn't perform optimally and give
alternative methods for better learning in these cases.

forward that the combination of the Fabry-P\'erot interferences and the
magnetic field leads to a perfect transmission for one valley and a suppression
of the transmission for the other valley. When only one of the barriers
(magnetic or electric) is present, no valley polarized current can be produced.
By tuning the Fermi energy, this valley-dependent peculiar behavior can be used
as valley filtering. Our results show that highly efficient valley filtering
with maximum conductivity and polarization can be achieved by controlling the
value of the magnetic field and the electric barrier width and height.

state are key probes of nuclear physics and of the nature of neutrinos.
Neutrinoful double-beta decay is the rarest Standard Model process that has
been observed and provides a unique test of the understanding of weak nuclear
interactions. Observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would reveal that
neutrinos are Majorana fermions and that lepton number conservation is violated
in nature. While significant progress has been made in phenomenological
approaches to understanding these processes, establishing a connection between
these processes and the physics of the Standard Model and beyond is a critical
task as it will provide input into the design and interpretation of future
experiments. The strong-interaction contributions to double-beta decay
processes are non-perturbative and can only be addressed systematically through
a combination of lattice Quantum Chromoodynamics (LQCD) and nuclear many-body
calculations. In this review, current efforts to establish the LQCD connection
are discussed for both neutrinoful and neutrinoless double-beta decay. LQCD
calculations of the hadronic contributions to the neutrinoful process $nn\to pp
e^- e^- \bar\nu_e\bar\nu_e$ and to various neutrinoless pionic transitions are
reviewed, and the connections of these calculations to the phenomenology of
double-beta decay through the use of effective field theory (EFTs) is
highlighted. At present, LQCD calculations are limited to small nuclear
systems, and to pionic subsystems, and require matching to appropriate EFTs to
have direct phenomenological impact. However, these calculations have already
revealed qualitatively that there are terms in the EFTs that can only be
constrained from double-beta decay processes themselves or using inputs from
LQCD. Future prospects for direct calculations in larger nuclei are also

mixing) has been established for the switch chain under various conditions on
the degree sequences. Amanatidis and Kleer introduced the notion of strongly
stable families of degree sequences, and proved that the switch chain is
rapidly mixing for any degree sequence from a strongly stable family. Using a
different approach, Erd\H{o}s et al. recently extended this result to the

settings. Due to the distributed nature of the data, communicating with all
collaborating private data owners simultaneously may prove challenging or
altogether impossible. In this paper, we develop differentially-private
asynchronous algorithms for collaboratively training machine-learning models on
multiple private datasets. The asynchronous nature of the algorithms implies
that a central learner interacts with the private data owners one-on-one
whenever they are available for communication without needing to aggregate
query responses to construct gradients of the entire fitness function.
Therefore, the algorithm efficiently scales to many data owners. We define the
cost of privacy as the difference between the fitness of a privacy-preserving
machine-learning model and the fitness of trained machine-learning model in the
absence of privacy concerns. We prove that we can forecast the performance of
the proposed privacy-preserving asynchronous algorithms. We demonstrate that
the cost of privacy has an upper bound that is inversely proportional to the
combined size of the training datasets squared and the sum of the privacy
budgets squared. We validate the theoretical results with experiments on
financial and medical datasets. The experiments illustrate that collaboration
among more than 10 data owners with at least 10,000 records with privacy
budgets greater than or equal to 1 results in a superior machine-learning model
in comparison to a model trained in isolation on only one of the datasets,
illustrating the value of collaboration and the cost of the privacy. The number

some light on the behaviour of future autonomous and connected vehicles. Due to
the complexity of road networks, such phenomena have to be studied using

(LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We have conducted detailed
analysis of the LAT data for this source and multi-wavelength studies of the
source field. Its gamma-ray emission can be described with a power law
($\Gamma=2.0\pm0.2$) with an exponential cutoff ($E_c=2.9\pm1.6$ GeV), while
the flux shows significant long-term variations. From analysis of archival Neil
Gehrels Swift X-ray Telescope data, we find only one X-ray source in the LAT's
2$\sigma$ error region. Within a 3.7"" radius error circle of the X-ray source,
there is only one optical object down to $r'\sim$23 mag. Time-resolved
photometry of the optical object indicates a likely 2.5~hr periodic modulation,
while its spectrum shows double-peaked hydrogen and helium emission lines
(similar to those seen in accretion discs in low-mass X-ray binaries).
Combining these results, we conclude that we have discovered a compact X-ray
emitting binary in likely association with 4FGL J0935.3+0901, i.e., a
millisecond pulsar (MSP) binary. We discuss the implication of the optical
spectral features: this binary could be a transitional MSP system at a
sub-luminous disc state, although the other possibility, the binary in a
rotation-powered state showing the optical emission lines due to intrabinary
interaction processes, can not be excluded. Further observational studies will
help determine detailed properties of this candidate MSP binary and thus
clarify its current state.

at the level of $\Delta\chi^2=10.0$. We then consider nonoscillation data from
beta decay, from neutrinoless double beta decay (if neutrinos are Majorana),
and from various cosmological input variants (in the data or the model) leading
to results dubbed as default, aggressive, and conservative. In the default
option, we obtain from nonoscillation data an extra contribution $\Delta\chi^2

strengthened or weakened by using more aggressive or conservative options,

of all (oscillation and nonoscillation) neutrino data favors NO at the level of
$3.2-3.7\sigma$, and that $\Sigma$ is constrained at the $2\sigma$ level within
$\Sigma < 0.12-0.69$ eV. The upper edge of this allowed range corresponds to an

problem in mobile computing. While there has been much work on empirical
analysis of human mobility using mobile device data, prior work has largely
assumed devices to be independent and has not considered the implications of
modern Internet users owning multiple mobile devices that exhibit correlated
mobility patterns. Also, prior work has analyzed mobility at the spatial scale
of the underlying mobile dataset and has not analyzed mobility characteristics
at different spatial scales and its implications on system design. In this
paper, we empirically analyze the mobility of modern Internet users owning
multiple devices at multiple spatial scales using a large campus WiFi dataset.
First, our results show that mobility of multiple devices belonging to a user
needs to be analyzed and modeled as a group, rather than independently, and
that there are substantial differences in the correlations exhibited by device
trajectories across users that also need to be considered. Second, our analysis
shows that the mobility of users shows different characteristics at different
spatial scales such as within and across buildings. Third, we demonstrate the
implications of these results by presenting generative models that highlight
the importance of considering the spatial scale of mobility as well as
multi-device mobility. More broadly, our empirical results point to the need
for new modeling research to fully capture the nuances of mobility of modern
multi-device users.

design that has three main advantages: (i) it ensures exponential stability and
$ \mathcal{L}_2 $-gain performance with respect to a user-defined set of
reference trajectories, and (ii) it provides constructive conditions based on
convex optimization and a path-integral-based control realization, and (iii) it
is less restrictive than previous similar approaches. In the proposed approach,
first a virtual representation of the nonlinear dynamics is constructed for
which a behavioral (parameter-varying) embedding is generated. Then, by
introducing a virtual control contraction metric, a convex control synthesis
formulation is derived. Finally, a control realization with a virtual reference
generator is computed, which is guaranteed to achieve exponential stability and
$ \mathcal{L}_2 $-gain performance for all trajectories of the targeted
reference behavior. Connections with the linear-parameter-varying (LPV) theory
are also explored showing that the proposed methodology is a generalization of
LPV state-feedback control in two aspects. First, it is a unified
generalization of the two distinct categories of LPV control approaches: global
and local methods. Second, it provides rigorous stability and performance
guarantees when applied to the true nonlinear system, while such properties are
not guaranteed for tracking control using LPV approaches.

Our dataset, named SalMoN (saliency in multi-object natural images), has 588
images containing multiple objects. The subjective experiments performed record
spontaneous attention and perception through eye fixation duration, point
clicking and rectangle drawing. As object saliency in a multi-object image is
inherently multi-level, we propose that salient object detection must be
evaluated for the capability to detect all multi-level salient objects apart
from the salient object class detection capability. For this purpose, we
generate multi-level maps as ground truth corresponding to all the dataset
images using the results of the subjective experiments, with the labels being
multi-level salient objects and background. We then propose the use of mean
absolute error, Kendall's rank correlation and average area under
precision-recall curve to evaluate existing salient object detection methods on
our multi-level saliency ground truth dataset. Approaches that represent
saliency detection on images as local-global hierarchical processing of a graph

where the connection and the metric are independent. This action has a {\it
gauged} scale symmetry (also known as Weyl gauge symmetry) of Weyl gauge field
$v_\mu= (\tilde\Gamma_\mu-\Gamma_\mu)/2$, with $\tilde\Gamma_\mu$
($\Gamma_\mu$) the trace of the Palatini (Levi-Civita) connection,
respectively. The underlying geometry is non-metric due to the $R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$
term acting as a gauge kinetic term for $v_\mu$. We show that this theory has
an elegant spontaneous breaking of gauged scale symmetry and mass generation in
the absence of matter, where the necessary scalar field ($\phi$) is not added
ad-hoc to this purpose but is ""extracted"" from the $R^2$ term. The gauge field
becomes massive by absorbing the derivative term $\partial_\mu\ln\phi$ of the
Stueckelberg field (""dilaton""). In the broken phase one finds the
Einstein-Proca action of $v_\mu$ of mass proportional to the Planck scale
$M\sim \langle\phi\rangle$, and a positive cosmological constant. Below this
scale $v_\mu$ decouples, the connection becomes Levi-Civita and metricity and
Einstein gravity are recovered. These results remain valid in the presence of
non-minimally coupled scalar field (Higgs-like) with Palatini connection and
the potential is computed. In this case the theory gives successful inflation
and a specific prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0.007\leq r \leq
0.01$ for current spectral index $n_s$ (at $95\%$CL) and N=60 efolds. This
value of $r$ is mildly larger than in inflation in Weyl quadratic gravity of
similar symmetry, due to different non-metricity. This establishes a connection
between non-metricity and inflation predictions and enables us to test such
theories by future CMB experiments.

frequently deployed at conveyor belts to perform pick and place tasks. Because
objects on the conveyor belts are moving, robots have limited time to pick them
up. This brings the requirement for fast and reliable motion planners that
could provide provable real-time planning guarantees, which the existing
algorithms do not provide. Besides the planning efficiency, the success of
manipulation tasks relies heavily on the accuracy of the perception system
which is often noisy, especially if the target objects are perceived from a
distance. For fast moving conveyor belts, the robot cannot wait for a perfect
estimate before it starts executing its motion. In order to be able to reach
the object in time it must start moving early on (relying on the initial noisy
estimates) and adjust its motion on-the-fly in response to the pose updates
from perception. We propose an approach that meets these requirements by
providing provable constant-time planning and replanning guarantees. We present
it, give its analytical properties and show experimental analysis in simulation
and on a real robot.

revealing the genetic basis of complex diseases. At present, most GWAS are
studies of a particular single disease diagnosis against controls. However, in
practice, an individual is often affected by more than one condition/disorder.
For example, patients with coronary artery disease(CAD) are often comorbid with
diabetes mellitus(DM). Along a similar line, it is often clinically meaningful
to study patients with one disease but without a comorbidity. For example,
obese DM may have different pathophysiology from non-obese DM.
  Here we developed a statistical framework to uncover susceptibility variants
for comorbid disorders (or a disorder without comorbidity), using GWAS summary
statistics only. In essence, we mimicked a case-control GWAS in which the cases
are affected with comorbidities or a disease without a relevant comorbid
condition (in either case, we may consider the cases as those affected by a
specific subtype of disease, as characterized by the presence or absence of
comorbid conditions). We extended our methodology to deal with continuous
traits with clinically meaningful categories (e.g. lipids). In addition, we
illustrated how the analytic framework may be extended to more than two traits.
We verified the feasibility and validity of our method by applying it to
simulated scenarios and four cardiometabolic (CM) traits. We also analyzed the
genes, pathways, cell-types/tissues involved in CM disease subtypes. LD-score
regression analysis revealed some subtypes may indeed be biologically distinct
with low genetic correlations. Further Mendelian randomization analysis found
differential causal effects of different subtypes to relevant complications. We
believe the findings are of both scientific and clinical value, and the
proposed method may open a new avenue to analyzing GWAS data.

  Recognition","ECCV 2020, with supplementary materials",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object pose increases intraclass object variance which makes object
recognition from 2D images harder. To render a classifier robust to pose
variations, most deep neural networks try to eliminate the influence of pose by
using large datasets with many poses for each class. Here, we propose a
different approach: a class-agnostic object pose transformation network
(OPT-Net) can transform an image along 3D yaw and pitch axes to synthesize
additional poses continuously. Synthesized images lead to better training of an
object classifier. We design a novel eliminate-add structure to explicitly
disentangle pose from object identity: first eliminate pose information of the
input image and then add target pose information (regularized as continuous
variables) to synthesize any target pose. We trained OPT-Net on images of toy
vehicles shot on a turntable from the iLab-20M dataset. After training on
unbalanced discrete poses (5 classes with 6 poses per object instance, plus 5
classes with only 2 poses), we show that OPT-Net can synthesize balanced
continuous new poses along yaw and pitch axes with high quality. Training a
ResNet-18 classifier with original plus synthesized poses improves mAP accuracy
by 9% overtraining on original poses only. Further, the pre-trained OPT-Net can
generalize to new object classes, which we demonstrate on both iLab-20M and
RGB-D. We also show that the learned features can generalize to ImageNet.

In this gas, a log-Coulomb interaction between two charged particles occurs
only when the sites of the particles are connected by an edge of the network.
The partition functions of such gases turn out to be a particular class of
multivariate local zeta functions attached to the network and a positive test
function which is determined by the confining potential. The methods and
results of the theory of local zeta functions allow us to establish that the

partition functions are rational functions in the variable p^{-\b{eta}}. We
give an algorithm for computing such rational functions. For this reason, we
can consider the p-adic log-Coulomb gases as exact solvable models. We expect

direction is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that
generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch
between challenges to avoid local optima. However, the original POET was unable
to demonstrate its full creative potential because of limitations of the
algorithm itself and because of external issues including a limited problem
space and lack of a universal progress measure. Importantly, both limitations
pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit of open-endedness in
general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new innovations to the
original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed to help
elucidate its full potential. Together, these four advances enable the most
open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are
(1) a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are,
enabling the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges
endlessly, and (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should
goal-switch from one problem to another (helping open-ended search better
scale). Outside the algorithm itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration
of open-endedness, we introduce (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode
environmental challenges, and (4) a generic measure of the extent to which a
system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation. Enhanced POET produces a
diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of
environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other means.

days after the SRT, the X-ray luminosity of the associated pulsar wind nebula

PSR B0540-69 changes from n=2.12 to n=0.03 and then keeps this value for about
five years before rising to n=0.9 in the following years. We find that most of
the current models have difficulties in explaining the measured braking index.
One exceptive model of the braking index evolution is the increasing dipole
magnetic field of PSR B0540-69. We suggest that the field increase may result
from some instabilities within the pulsar core that enhance the poloidal

increasing dipole magnetic field will result in the X-ray brightening of the

magnetic field within the PWN during the brightening and the other assumes an
enhanced magnetic field proportional to the energy density of the PWN. It
appears that the two models fit the data well, though the later model seems to
fit the data a bit better. This provides marginal observational evidence that

the short-range correlation of realistic interaction is treated by employing
the damping factor, and the resultant interaction can be applied to the cluster

transform it in this way, and the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ energy curve is compared
with the results of phenomenological interactions. The attractive effect
between two $\alpha$'s is found to be not enough even with a damping factor for
the short-range repulsion, and the necessity of a finite-range three-body term
is discussed. With this three-body term, the resonance energy of the ground

the binding energy of $^{16}$O from the four $\alpha$ threshold is reasonably

resulting centrifugal force may be strong enough to disrupt large dust grains.
We examine the effect of this rotational disruption on the evolution of grain
size distribution in galaxies. To this goal, we modify our previous model by
assuming that rotational disruption is the major small-grain production
mechanism. We find that rotational disruption can have a large influence on the
evolution of grain size distribution in the following two aspects especially
for composites and grain mantles (with tensile strength $\sim 10^7$ erg
cm$^{-3}$). First, because of the short time-scale of rotational disruption,
the small-grain production occurs even in the early phase of galaxy evolution.
Therefore, even though stars produce large grains, the abundance of small
grains can be large enough to steepen the extinction curve. Secondly,
rotational disruption is important in determining the maximum grain radius,
which regulates the steepness of the extinction curve. For compact grains with
tensile strength $\gtrsim 10^9$ erg cm$^{-3}$, the size evolution is
significantly affected by rotational disruption only if the radiation field is
as strong as (or the dust temperature is as high as) expected for starburst
galaxies. For compact grains, rotational disruption predicts that the maximum
grain radius becomes less than 0.2 $\mu$m for galaxies with a dust temperature
$\gtrsim 50$ K.

of lane and road markings are inconsistent at various distances and

introduce a novel semantic segmentation neural network. This approach
decomposes the IPM process into multiple consecutive differentiable homographic

Furthermore, the interpolated feature map is refined by subsequent
convolutional layers thus reducing the artifacts and improving the accuracy.

experience (QoE) plays a crucial role in delivering high quality streaming
contents to the user. However, the complexity caused by the temporal
dependencies in QoE data and the non-linear relationships among QoE influence
factors has introduced challenges to continuous QoE prediction. To deal with
that, existing studies have utilized the Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM) to
effectively capture such complex dependencies, resulting in excellent QoE
prediction accuracy. However, the high computational complexity of LSTM, caused
by the sequential processing characteristic in its architecture, raises a
serious question about its performance on devices with limited computational
power. Meanwhile, Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a variation of
convolutional neural networks, has recently been proposed for sequence modeling
tasks (e.g., speech enhancement), providing a superior prediction performance
over baseline methods including LSTM in terms of prediction accuracy and
computational complexity. Being inspired of that, in this paper, an improved
TCN-based model, namely CNN-QoE, is proposed for continuously predicting the
QoE, which poses characteristics of sequential data. The proposed model
leverages the advantages of TCN to overcome the computational complexity
drawbacks of LSTM-based QoE models, while at the same time introducing the
improvements to its architecture to improve QoE prediction accuracy. Based on a
comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed CNN-QoE model can
reach the state-of-the-art performance on both personal computers and mobile
devices, outperforming the existing approaches.

presence of yet unknown mechanisms. Here we explore the applicability of
Gaussian Processes (GP) to establish predictability and uncertainty of local
behaviors from multimodal observations, providing an alternative to this
classical paradigm. Using atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron
Microscopy (STEM) of multiferroic Sm-doped BiFeO3 across a broad composition
range, we directly visualize the atomic structure and structural, physical, and
chemical order parameter fields for the material. GP regression is used to
establish the predictability of the local polarization field from different
groups of parameters, including the adjacent polarization values and several
combinations of physical and chemical descriptors, including lattice
parameters, column intensities, etc. We observe that certain elements of
microstructure including charged and uncharged domain walls and interfaces with
the substrate are best predicted with specific combinations of descriptors, and
this predictability and their associated uncertainties are consistent across
the composition series. The associated generative physical mechanisms are
discussed. We argue that predictability and uncertainty in observational data

activity, while the epigenetic histone state is largely determined by the
binding of specific factors such as the transcription factors (TFs) to DNA.
Here, the way how the TFs and the histone state are dynamically correlated is
not obvious when the TF synthesis is regulated by the histone state. This type
of feedback regulatory relations are ubiquitous in gene networks to determine
cell fate in differentiation and other cell transformations. To gain insights
into such dynamical feedback regulations, we theoretically analyze a model of
epigenetic gene switching by extending the Doi-Peliti operator formalism of
reaction kinetics to the problem of coupled molecular processes. The spin-1 and
spin-1/2 coherent state representations are introduced to describe stochastic
reactions of histones and binding/unbinding of TF in a unified way, which
provides a concise view of the effects of timescale difference among these
molecular processes; even in the case that binding/unbinding of TF to/from DNA
are adiabatically fast, the slow nonadiabatic histone dynamics give rise to a
distinct circular flow of the probability flux around basins in the landscape
of the gene state distribution, which leads to hysteresis in gene switching. In
contrast to the general belief that the change in the amount of TF precedes the
histone state change, the flux drives histones to be modified prior to the
change in the amount of TF in the self-regulating circuits. The flux-landscape
analyses shed light on the nonlinear nonadiabatic mechanism of epigenetic cell
fate decision making.

of increased yields below the loci linked to the conventional binary fission.
The bump was dubbed ""Ni-bump"" because it is centered at the masses associated
with the magic isotopes of Ni. Intriguing features of the CCT, especially high

far, this fact has been left beyond the scope of all known theoretical

estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time

We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that

theorem is based on the direct methods of the calculus of variations using
essentially the convexity of the energy in the nonlinear strain and curvature

$O(h^5)$ terms. The energy allows us to show the coercivity for terms up to

including $O(h^5)$ the conditions on the thickness $h$ are those considered in

navigation of tight multi-lane platoons travelling on public roads is
presented. Using the proposed approach, CAVs are able to form single or
multi-lane platoons of various geometrical configurations. They are able to
reshape and adjust their configurations according to changes in the
environment. The proposed architecture consists of two main components: an
offline motion planner system and an online hierarchical control system. The
motion planner uses an optimization-based approach for cooperative formation
and reconfiguration in tight spaces. A constrained optimization scheme is used
to plan smooth, dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories for all
the vehicles within the platoon. The paper addresses online computation
limitations by employing a family of maneuvers precomputed offline and stored
on a look-up table on the vehicles. The online hierarchical control system is
composed of three levels: a traffic operation system (TOS), a decision-maker,
and a path-follower. The TOS determines the desired platoon reconfiguration.
The decision-maker checks the feasibility of the reconfiguration plan. The
reconfiguration maneuver is executed by a low-level path-following feedback
controller in real-time. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated
through simulations of three case studies: 1) formation reconfiguration 2)
obstacle avoidance, and 3) benchmarking against behavior-based planning in
which the desired formation is achieved using a sequence of motion primitives.

that the skyrmion Hall angle is independent of input current density and the

of tunable current along mutually perpendicular directions, this property
enables us to propose an experimental setup by which the transverse motion of a

independent Hall angles for merons where their transverse motion will be
opposite depending on whether the spin at their centers are up or down, in

cavities, we study the influence of the atom-cavity coupling on the Fermi gases
trapped in optical lattices. By adiabatic elimination of the cavity photon
field, the atom-cavity coupling gives rise to effective long-range
interactions. It results in a variety of two-body scattering processes, during
which the atomic pairs can acquire an additional center-of-mass momentum. This
reveals the possibility of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluids
in which the atomic pairing momentum is nonzero. By inspecting the phase
diagram at the mean-field level, we confirm that the FFLO superfluid phase
coexists with the zero-momentum pairing, and is the ground state that hosts the
lowest energy. Furthermore, the order parameter characterizing the
nonzero-momentum pairing does not vanish as long as the cavity-induced
interaction is present.

such applications, the CP-DSSS waveform would operate as a secondary network at

paper, we evaluate per-user capacity of CP-DSSS when simple matched filtering
(MF) is performed on the uplink (UL) and time-reversal (TR) precoding is used
on the downlink (DL). In this setting when operating in the low SNR regime,
CP-DSSS achieves a per-user capacity that is near the optimum single-user
capacity. TR precoding converges to the optimal capacity as the number of
antennas at the hub/gateway increases. Using the estimated channel impulse
response for MF and TR introduces little to no capacity loss. Given the
near-optimal performance of MF detection and TR precoding for each of the

features between the two domains, such that a classifier trained on the source
features can be readily applied to the target ones. However, such a
transferring strategy has a potential risk of damaging the intrinsic
discrimination of target data. To alleviate this risk, we are motivated by the
assumption of structural domain similarity, and propose to directly uncover the
intrinsic target discrimination via discriminative clustering of target data.
We constrain the clustering solutions using structural source regularization
that hinges on our assumed structural domain similarity. Technically, we use a
flexible framework of deep network based discriminative clustering that
minimizes the KL divergence between predictive label distribution of the
network and an introduced auxiliary one; replacing the auxiliary distribution
with that formed by ground-truth labels of source data implements the
structural source regularization via a simple strategy of joint network
training. We term our proposed method as Structurally Regularized Deep
Clustering (SRDC), where we also enhance target discrimination with clustering
of intermediate network features, and enhance structural regularization with
soft selection of less divergent source examples. Careful ablation studies show
the efficacy of our proposed SRDC. Notably, with no explicit domain alignment,
SRDC outperforms all existing methods on three UDA benchmarks.

these two problems are linked and intertwined, but the previous methods tend to

introducing the depth potentiality perception, the network can perceive the
potentiality of depth information in a learning-based manner, and guide the
fusion process of two modal data to prevent the contamination occurred. The
gated multi-modality attention module in the fusion process exploits the
attention mechanism with a gate controller to capture long-range dependencies

longstanding and usually relies on elaborately designed lexical and syntactic

each argument of an event separately without considering associations between
arguments which ultimately leads to low efficiency, especially in sentences
with multiple events. To address the two above-referred problems, we propose a
novel joint event extraction framework that aims to extract multiple event
triggers and arguments simultaneously by introducing shortest dependency path
(SDP) in the dependency graph. We do this by eliminating irrelevant words in
the sentence, thus capturing long-range dependencies. Also, an attention-based
graph convolutional network is proposed, to carry syntactically related

mechanism allows the server to deliver more video segments to the client within
a single request in order to deal with the requests explosion problem. As a
result, recent research efforts have been focusing on utilizing such a feature
to enhance the streaming experience while reducing the request-related
overhead. However, current works only optimize the performance of a single
client, without necessary concerns of possible influences on other clients in
the same network. When multiple streaming clients compete for a shared
bandwidth in HTTP/1.1, they are likely to suffer from unfairness, which is
defined as the inequality in their bitrate selections. For HTTP/1.1, existing
works have proven that the network-assisted solutions are effective in solving
the unfairness problem. However, the feasibility of utilizing such an approach
for the HTTP/2 server push has not been investigated. Therefore, in this paper,
a novel proxy-based framework is proposed to overcome the unfairness problem in
adaptive streaming over HTTP/2 with the server push. Experimental results
confirm the outperformance of the proposed framework in ensuring the fairness,
assisting the clients to avoid rebuffering events and lower bitrate degradation

the few target class samples are from the same domain as the source class
samples. However, in practice this assumption is often invalid -- the target
classes could come from a different domain. This poses an additional challenge
of domain adaptation (DA) with few training samples. In this paper, the problem
of domain-adaptive few-shot learning (DA-FSL) is tackled, which requires
solving FSL and DA in a unified framework. To this end, we propose a novel
domain-adversarial prototypical network (DAPN) model. It is designed to address
a specific challenge in DA-FSL: the DA objective means that the source and
target data distributions need to be aligned, typically through a shared
domain-adaptive feature embedding space; but the FSL objective dictates that
the target domain per class distribution must be different from that of any
source domain class, meaning aligning the distributions across domains may harm
the FSL performance. How to achieve global domain distribution alignment whilst
maintaining source/target per-class discriminativeness thus becomes the key.
Our solution is to explicitly enhance the source/target per-class separation
before domain-adaptive feature embedding learning in the DAPN, in order to
alleviate the negative effect of domain alignment on FSL. Extensive experiments
show that our DAPN outperforms the state-of-the-art FSL and DA models, as well
as their na\""ive combinations. The code is available at

binary tree that is its minor. The Strahler number of a parity game is proposed
to be defined as the smallest Strahler number of the tree of any of its
attractor decompositions. It is proved that parity games can be solved in
quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices~$n$
and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $d$ is the number of priorities and $k$ is
the Strahler number. This complexity is quasi-polynomial because the Strahler
number is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. The proof is based on
a new construction of small Strahler-universal trees.
  It is shown that the Strahler number of a parity game is a robust parameter:
it coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures
and with the register number defined by Lehtinen~(2018). It follows that parity
games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the
number of vertices and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $k$ is the register
number. This significantly improves the running times and space achieved for
parity games of bounded register number by Lehtinen (2018) and by Parys (2020).
  The running time of the algorithm based on small Strahler-universal trees
yields a novel trade-off $k \cdot \lg(d/k) = O(\log n)$ between the two natural
parameters that measure the structural complexity of a parity game, which
allows solving parity games in polynomial time. This includes as special cases
the asymptotic settings of those parameters covered by the results of Calude,
Jain Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan (2017), of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (2017),

test allowing for the intrinsic character of a rheological constitutive law to
be assessed. Such a law is considered here for Semi-Crystalline Polymers
exhibiting necking and for large deformation. In the framework of a
$(\dot\sigma, \sigma, \dot\varepsilon, \varepsilon)$ behavior's law, tensile
experiments conducted at an imposed constant strain rate $\dot\varepsilon_0$
bring true stress responses from which constitutive (material) parameters can
be identified from Model-Based Metrology concepts. The same experiment repeated
at various strain rates gives then access to the dependence of the non-elastic
parameters on the strain rate. Then the intrinsic law is tested severely by
considering a new set of experiments carried out for constant displacement
rates of the grips. In that case, the specimens show local strain rates which
evolve strongly during the test (by a factor of 5-10 here). The parameter
identification process requires then the introduction of the exact realized
input strain and strain-rate command into the model. Accounting for strain rate
dependency requires additionally the knowledge of the preliminary identified
strain rate dependence of the non-elastic constitutive parameters for good
predictions of the experimental response directly. This is what is proven here.
The conclusion speaks in favor of a possible upgrade of international standards
for the mechanical characterization of polymers based on constant strain-rate
tensile tests and properly applied model-based metrology.

different energy loss by photodissociation and hence the different strength of
the prompt convection and the later neutrino-driven convection. The

the presence of large gas and dust reservoirs that are thought to sustain and
possibly obscure vigorous star formation processes that make these objects
shine at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths. We exploit ALMA Cycle 4 observations of
the continuum (~2.1mm) and high-J CO emission of a sample of six X-ray selected
SMGs hosting an obscured AGN at z_spec>2.5 in the 7 Ms CDF-S. We measured the
masses and sizes of the dust and molecular gas and we derived the gas density

compared the measured column densities with those derived from the Chandra
X-ray spectra. We detected both the continuum and line emission for three
sources for which we measured both the flux density and size. For the
undetected sources, we derived an upper limit on the flux density. We found
that the detected galaxies are rich in gas and dust (molecular gas mass in the
range <0.5 - 2.7 x 10^10 M_sun for {\alpha}_CO=0.8 and up to ~2 x 10^11~M_sun
for {\alpha}_CO=6.5, and dust mass <0.9 - 4.9 x 10^8 M_sun) and compact (gas
major axis 2.1-3.0 kpc, dust major axis 1.4-2.7 kpc). The column densities
associated with the ISM are on the order of 10^(23-24) cm-2, which is
comparable with those derived from the X-ray spectra. For the detected sources
we also derived dynamical masses in the range 0.8 - 3.7 x 10^10 M_sun. We
conclude that the ISM of high redshift galaxies can substantially contribute to
nuclear obscuration up to the Compton-thick (>10^24 cm-2) regime. In addition,
we found that all the detected sources show a velocity gradient reminding one
rotating system, even though two of them show peculiar features in their

friction could dominate the dynamical evolution and hence duplicate chirp
signals. The relevant hydrodynamical timescale, $\tau_{\rm gas}$, could be much
shorter than the GW radiation timescale, $\tau_{\rm gw}$, in the above
astrophysical scenarios. As a result, the observable chirp mass is higher than
the real one by a factor of $(1+\tau_{\rm gw}/\tau_{\rm gas})^{3/5}$ if the gas
effect is ignored in the data analysis. Such an error also results in an
overestimation of the source distance by a factor of $(1+\tau_{\rm
gw}/\tau_{\rm gas})$. By performing matched-filtering analysis in the
milli-Hertz band, we prove that the gas-dominated signals are practically
indistinguishable from the chirp signals of those more massive BBHs residing in
a vacuum environment. Such fake massive objects in the milli-Hertz band, if not
appropriately accounted for in the future, may alter our understanding of the
formation, evolution, and detection of BBHs.

interpretation of changing-look AGNs by modeling the polarization variations
that can be observed, in particular, polarized-light echoes. Methods: We built
a complex and representative model of an AGN and its host galaxy and ran
radiative transfer simulations to obtain realistic time-dependent polarization
signatures of changing-look objects. Based on actual data, we allowed the
system to become several times fainter or brighter within a few years, assuming
a rapid change in accretion rate. Results: We obtain time-dependent
polarization signatures of distant high-luminosity (quasars) and nearby
low-luminosity (Seyferts) changing-look AGNs for a representative set of
inclinations. We predict the evolution of the continuum polarization for future
polarimetric campaigns with the goal to better understand the physics at work
in these objects. We also investigate highly inclined AGNs that experience
strong accretion rate variations without appearing to change state. We apply
our modeling to Mrk 1018, the best-documented case of a changing-look AGN, and
predict a variation in its polarization after the recent dimming of its

critical challenges for 3D-ICs where the heat cannot easily transfer through
several layers of silicon. Consequently, the high-temperature area also
confronts the reliability threat as the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) decreases
exponentially with the operating temperature. Apparently, 3D-NoCs must tackle
this fundamental problem in order to be widely used. Therefore, in this work,
we investigate the thermal distribution and reliability prediction of 3D-NoCs.
We first present a new method to help simulate the temperature (both steady and
transient) using traffics value from realistic and synthetic benchmarks and the
power consumption from standard VLSI design flow. Then, based on the proposed
method, we further predict the relative reliability between different parts of
the network. Experimental results show that the method has an extremely fast
execution time in comparison to the acceleration lifetime test. Furthermore, we
compare the thermal behavior and reliability between Monolithic design and
TSV-based TSV. We also explorer the ability to implement the thermal via a

the resulting worst-case decrease of the decrement. The exact bounds are
expressed in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations which cannot

expressions which are accurate enough for use in optimization methods. As an
application, the neighbourhood of the central path in which the iterates of

spatiotemporal changes induced by the contrast agent flow are estimated from a
time series of MRI data. Sufficient time resolution can often only be obtained
by using an imaging protocol which produces undersampled data for each image in

image reconstruction approaches, where all the images in the time series are
reconstructed simultaneously, and temporal coupling between the images is
introduced into the problem by a sparsity promoting regularization functional.
We propose the use of Huber penalty for temporal regularization in DCE-MRI, and
compare it to total variation, total generalized variation and smoothness based
temporal regularization models. We also study the effect of spatial
regularization to the reconstruction and compare the reconstruction accuracy
with different temporal resolutions due to varying undersampling. The
approaches are tested using simulated and experimental radial golden angle

has now become a crucial part in quantum information and communication science.
For example, it has been shown to enable or enhance quantum processing tasks
such as quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum computing.
However, quantum entanglement is prone to decoherence as a result of
interactions with environmental scatterers, making it an expensive resource.
Therefore, it is crucial to understand its creation. We centre our attention to
a situation where one would like to distribute quantum entanglement between
principal particles that are apart. In this case, it is necessary to use
ancillary systems that are communicated between them or interact with them
continuously. Cubitt et al. showed that the ancillary systems need not be
entangled with the principal particles in order to distribute entanglement.
This has been demonstrated experimentally in the case of communicated ancillary
particles and it is now known that the bound on the distributed entanglement is
given by a communicated quantum discord. On the other hand, little is
understood about the setting with continuous interactions, despite its abundant
occurrence in nature. The main focus of this thesis is to study the
distribution of quantum entanglement via continuous interactions with ancillary
particles, which I will call mediators. I will present my work regarding the
necessary conditions for entanglement distribution, the factors that are
relevant for the distributed amount, and the speed limit to achieving maximum
entanglement gain. Finally, I present some notable applications that can
benefit from our work. This includes, among others, indirect probing of the

these non-detections, it is not clear whether disks around planetary-mass
companions indeed follow the disk flux-host mass trend in the stellar regime.
The faint radio brightness of these companion disks may result from a
combination of fast radial drift and a lack of dust traps. Alternatively, as
disks in binary systems are known to have significantly lower millimeter fluxes
due to tidal interactions, these companion disks may instead follow the

coarse-grained models are a good alternative, provided that one has identified
a few slow observables and collected a sufficient amount of data for their

The experimental study of a tracer, dispersed into the media, showed the
evidence of many time scales: fast ballistic, intermediate caged, slow
superdiffusive, very slow diffusive. A numerical investigation has demonstrated
that tracer's superdiffusion is related to slow rotating drifts of the granular
medium. Here we offer a deeper insight into the slow scales of the granular
medium, and propose a new phenomenological model for such a ""secular"" dynamics.
Based upon the model for the granular medium, we also introduce a model for the
tracer (fast and slow) dynamics, which consists in a stochastic system of
equations for three coupled variables, and is therefore more refined and
successful than previous models.

the appearance of nonlinear effects such as excited-state absorption and
vibronic coupling. In this way, we observe that the laser excitation affects

coherent vibrational motion contributes to stabilize the electronic excitation

however, have special organelles, Woronin bodies, that can plug the pores. When
the pores are blocked, no flow of cytoplasm takes place. Inspired by the

we designed two-dimensional fungal automata. A fungal automaton is a cellular

discovery space for studying quasar absorption outflows and their contribution
to AGN feedback. Specifically, COS provides high-quality far-ultraviolet (FUV)
spectra covering the diagnostic-rich 500-1050 Angstrom rest frame (hereafter,
EUV500) of medium redshift objects. The quality and quantity of EUV500
diagnostic troughs allow us to probe the very high-ionization phase, which
carries 90% or more of the outflowing material, as well as to determine the
distance of most outflows from the central source ($R$). The first objective is
impossible to achieve with ground-based spectra, and $R$ can be measured in
only $\sim$1% of them. Here, we summarize the main results of the first
dedicated survey of such outflows, including the following:
  1) Measurements of the three most energetic outflows to date, which can be
the main agents for AGN feedback processes in the environments of the host
galaxies.
  2) All the outflows have a very high-ionization component, similar to the one
found in warm absorbers, which carries most of the outflow's kinetic
luminosity. This finding suggests that all the high-ionization outflows
observed from the ground also have a similar undetected very high-ionization
component.
  3) Of the 13 studied EUV500 outflows, 9 have $100<R<2000$ parsecs, 2 have
$5<R<20$ parsecs, 1 has $0.05<R<50$ parsecs, and in 1 case, $R$ cannot be

they include $\sim$70 outflow troughs from ionic transitions. These include the
first non-solar detections from transitions of O V*, Ne V*, Ar VI, Ca VI, Ca

density sensitive troughs (e.g., S IV* $\lambda$ 657.32 $\r{A}$ and the O V*

distances from the central source ($R$) of a few hundred parsecs that are all
consistent within the errors, and an $\dot{E_k}$ within a factor of two for all

outflowing mass resides in a very high-ionization phase evident by troughs from
Ne VIII, Na IX, Mg X, and Si XII, which connect the physical conditions of
these ultraviolet outflows to the X-ray warm absorber outflows seen in nearby

diagnostics for the electron number density, yielding consistent values for
each outflow, which increase the robustness of the $R$ determinations. Troughs

2017 in the 500 -- 1050 $\r{A}$ rest frame. The outflow's velocity centroid
shifted by $\sim$ --1550 km s$^{-1}$ from --19,500 km s$^{-1}$ to --21,050 km
s$^{-1}$ over a rest-frame time of 3.2 yr. The velocity shift signatures are
most apparent in the absorption features from the Ne VIII $\lambda\lambda$
770.41, 780.32 doublet and are supported by the absorption troughs from OV
$\lambda$ 629.73 and the Mg X $\lambda\lambda$ 609.79, 624.94 doublet. This is
the first time where a quasar outflow velocity shift is observed in troughs
from more than one ion and in distinct troughs from a doublet transition (Ne
VIII). We attribute the velocity shift to an acceleration of an existing
outflow as we are able to exclude photoionization changes and motion of
material into and out of the line of sight as alternate explanations. This
leads to an average acceleration of 480 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ (1.52 cm
s$^{-2}$) in the quasar rest frame. Both the acceleration and the absolute
velocity shift are the largest reported for a quasar outflow to date. Based on
the absorption troughs of the O V* multiplet, we derive a range for the

where the column density of the very high-ionization phase is roughly 15 times
larger than the corresponding high-ionization phase. These high column
densities and very high-ionization potential ions are similar to X-ray warm
absorbers. The two phases of S2 show a unique velocity centroid shift between
associated troughs. Through Monte Carlo measurements of the O V* absorption
troughs, we determine the electron number density of S2 (fully corroborated by

high energy neutrinos, no secure detection of FSRQs has been obtained up to
now, except for a possible case of PKS B1424-418. In this work, we compute the
expected flux of high energy neutrinos from FSRQs using standard assumptions

with the present technology, since only neutrinos below 10 PeV have been
observed. We found that for a non-negligible range of the parameters the

by a Markovian quantum master equation. Using techniques from full counting
statistics, we evaluate the electrical currents, their noise power spectra, and
the power-power correlations in the output leads. The current fluctuations can
be attributed to the competition between Cooper pair splitting and elastic
cotunneling between the quantum dots via the superconductor. In one regime,
these processes can be clearly distinguished in the cross-correlation spectrum

specific means to quantify their relative strengths. As such, our results may

non-intrusive approximation method that is capable of identifying bilinear
models from time-domain measurements. This method uses harmonic inputs which
establish a natural way for data acquisition. For the general class of
nonlinear problems with VS representation, the growing exponential approach
allows the derivation of the generalized kernels, namely symmetric generalized
frequency response functions - (GFRFs). In addition, the homogeneity of the
Volterra operator determines the accuracy in terms of how many kernels are
considered. For the weakly nonlinear setup, only a few kernels are needed to
obtain a good approximation. In this direction, the proposed adaptive scheme is
able to improve the estimations of the computationally non-zero kernels. The
Fourier transform associates these measurements with the derived GFRFs and the
LF makes the connection with system theory. In the linear case, the LF
associates the so-called S-parameters with the linear transfer function by
interpolating in the frequency domain. The goal of the proposed method is to
extend identification to the case of bilinear systems from time-domain
measurements and to approximate other general nonlinear systems (by means of
the Carleman bilinearizarion scheme). By identifying the linear contribution
with the LF, a considerable reduction is achieved by means of the SVD. The
fitted linear system has the same McMillan degree as the original linear
system. Then, the performance of the linear model is improved by augmenting a
special nonlinear structure. In a nutshell, we learn reduced-dimension bilinear
models directly from a potentially large-scale system that is simulated in the
time domain. This is done by fitting first a linear model, and afterwards, by
fitting the corresponding bilinear operator.

relaxed version of the Bellman operator for q-functions and prove that it is

returns the correct q-function. For stochastic linear systems in continuous

q-function, hence retrieves the optimal policy. Theoretical results are backed
up in simulation where we solve sampled versions of the LPs with data collected
by interacting with the environment. For general nonlinear systems, we observe
that the RLP again tends to preserve the minimizers of the solution to the LP,

to infer superfluid characteristics in the framework of the vortex creep model.
The glitch rise time constraint of 12.6 seconds put stringent limits on the
angular momentum exchange between the crustal superfluid and the observed
crust. Together with the observed excess acceleration in the rotation rate as
compared to the post-glitch equilibrium value this discriminates crustal
superfluid-crust lattice and core superfluid-crustal normal matter coupling
time-scales. An evident decrease in the crustal rotation rate immediately
before the glitch is consistent with the formation of a new vortex trap zone
that initiates the large scale vortex unpinning avalanche. Formation of vortex
trap by a crust breaking quake induces short-lived magnetospheric changes. The
long term post-glitch spin-down rate evolution reveals the moments of inertia
and recoupling time-scales of the superfluid layers participating in the glitch
and leads to an estimation of the time to the next glitch which agrees with the
time interval between the 2016 and 2019 glitches. Our results are consistent
with theoretical estimates of effective neutron and proton masses in the

calling for the public concern in recent years. Therefore, how to develop
accurate traffic prediction while preserving privacy is a significant problem
to be solved, and there is a trade-off between these two objectives. To address
this challenge, we introduce a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
named federated learning and propose a Federated Learning-based Gated Recurrent
Unit neural network algorithm (FedGRU) for traffic flow prediction. FedGRU
differs from current centralized learning methods and updates universal
learning models through a secure parameter aggregation mechanism rather than
directly sharing raw data among organizations. In the secure parameter
aggregation mechanism, we adopt a Federated Averaging algorithm to reduce the
communication overhead during the model parameter transmission process.
Furthermore, we design a Joint Announcement Protocol to improve the scalability
of FedGRU. We also propose an ensemble clustering-based scheme for traffic flow
prediction by grouping the organizations into clusters before applying FedGRU
algorithm. Through extensive case studies on a real-world dataset, it is shown
that FedGRU's prediction accuracy is 90.96% higher than the advanced deep
learning models, which confirm that FedGRU can achieve accurate and timely
traffic prediction without compromising the privacy and security of raw data.

near $p_{\rm c}$. The suppression of $H_{\rm m}$ with pressure follows the
decrease of temperature $T_{\chi}^{\rm max}$, at the maximum in the

due to the increase of $T_{\rm sc}$ and the decrease of $H_{\rm m}$. The change

convolutional layers and image samples of a deep network. EN significantly
improves flexibility of the recently proposed switchable normalization (SN),
which solves a static L2N problem by linearly combining several normalizers in
each normalization layer (the combination is the same for all samples). Instead
of directly employing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn data-dependent
parameters as conditional batch normalization (cBN) did, the internal
architecture of EN is carefully designed to stabilize its optimization, leading
to many appealing benefits. (1) EN enables different convolutional layers,
image samples, categories, benchmarks, and tasks to use different normalization
methods, shedding light on analyzing them in a holistic view. (2) EN is
effective for various network architectures and tasks. (3) It could replace any
normalization layers in a deep network and still produce stable model training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EN in a wide spectrum of
tasks including image recognition, noisy label learning, and semantic
segmentation. For example, by replacing BN in the ordinary ResNet50,
improvement produced by EN is 300% more than that of SN on both ImageNet and

which is a magnetic monopole attached by two topological $Z$ strings ($Z$ flux
tubes) from two opposite sides. The monopole is a topologically stable solution
of the equation of motions when the Higgs potential has global $U(1)$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. In this paper, we consider more general cases
without the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and find that it is no longer a static

After analytically constructing an asymptotic form of the monopole, we confirm
such a motion using the numerical relaxation method. In addition, we analyze
the real time dynamics of the monopole based on a point-like approximation.
Consequently, if there were long string networks with the monopoles in the
early universe, the monopole accelerates nearly to the speed of light emitting
electromagnetic radiations as a synchrotron accelerator, and collides to an
anti-monopole on the string. This collision event, which we call the
cosmological monopole collider, can produce much heavier particles than those
we can see today, e.g., at the Large Hadron Collider.

blind migration, we present an objective method that is based on the analysis
of time-lapse recorded cell migration trajectories. First, we validate our
method with simulated data, demonstrating that it reliably detects the presence

method to data from three-dimensional collagen gels, interspersed with highly
migratory natural killer (NK) cells that were derived from two different human
donors. We find for one of the donors an attractive interaction between the NK
cells, pointing to a cooperative behavior of these immune cells. When adding
nearly stationary K562 tumor cells to the system, we find a repulsive
interaction between K562 and NK cells for one of the donors. By contrast, we
find attractive interactions between NK cells and an IL-15-secreting variant of
K562 tumor cells. We therefore speculate that NK cells find wild-type tumor

opening angle of the jet conical outflow. Fairly highly (15%) linearly
polarized emission is detected in a jet region of 19 $\mu$as in size, located
58 $\mu$as downstream from the core. The highest brightness temperature in the
source frame is estimated to be $>2.2\times10^{13}$ K for the blazar core. This
implies that the inverse Compton limit must be violated in the rest frame of
the source, even for the largest Doppler factor $\delta\thicksim25$ reported

  Adaptive Object Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has achieved unprecedented success in
improving the cross-domain robustness of object detection models. However,
existing UDA methods largely ignore the instantaneous data distribution during
model learning, which could deteriorate the feature representation given large
domain shift. In this work, we propose a Self-Guided Adaptation (SGA) model,
target at aligning feature representation and transferring object detection
models across domains while considering the instantaneous alignment difficulty.
The core of SGA is to calculate ""hardness"" factors for sample pairs indicating
domain distance in a kernel space. With the hardness factor, the proposed SGA
adaptively indicates the importance of samples and assigns them different
constrains. Indicated by hardness factors, Self-Guided Progressive Sampling
(SPS) is implemented in an ""easy-to-hard"" way during model adaptation. Using
multi-stage convolutional features, SGA is further aggregated to fully align
hierarchical representations of detection models. Extensive experiments on
commonly used benchmarks show that SGA improves the state-of-the-art methods
with significant margins, while demonstrating the effectiveness on large domain
shift.

video surveillance to autonomous driving. Despite achieving high performance,
it is still largely unknown how well existing detectors generalize to unseen
data. This is important because a practical detector should be ready to use in
various scenarios in applications. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive
study in this paper, using a general principle of direct cross-dataset
evaluation. Through this study, we find that existing state-of-the-art
pedestrian detectors, though perform quite well when trained and tested on the
same dataset, generalize poorly in cross dataset evaluation. We demonstrate
that there are two reasons for this trend. Firstly, their designs (e.g. anchor
settings) may be biased towards popular benchmarks in the traditional
single-dataset training and test pipeline, but as a result largely limit their
generalization capability. Secondly, the training source is generally not dense
in pedestrians and diverse in scenarios. Under direct cross-dataset evaluation,
surprisingly, we find that a general purpose object detector, without
pedestrian-tailored adaptation in design, generalizes much better compared to
existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Furthermore, we illustrate that
diverse and dense datasets, collected by crawling the web, serve to be an
efficient source of pre-training for pedestrian detection. Accordingly, we
propose a progressive training pipeline and find that it works well for
autonomous-driving oriented pedestrian detection. Consequently, the study
conducted in this paper suggests that more emphasis should be put on
cross-dataset evaluation for the future design of generalizable pedestrian
detectors. Code and models can be accessed at

habitable planets. However, their winds have been suggested to be harmful to
planetary atmospheres. Here, in order to better understand the winds of M
dwarfs and also infer their physical properties, we perform a one-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic parametric study of winds of M dwarfs that are heated by
dissipation of Alfv\'en waves. These waves are triggered by sub-surface
convective motions and propagate along magnetic field lines. Here, we vary the
magnetic field strength and density at the wind base (chromosphere), while
keeping the same relative wave amplitude ($0.1 B_0$) and dissipation
lenghtscale. We find that our winds very quickly reach isothermal temperatures
with mass-loss rates proportional to base density square. We compare our
results with Parker wind models and find that, in the high-beta regime, both
models agree. However, in the low-beta regime, the Parker wind underestimates
the terminal velocity by around one order of magnitude and mass-loss rate by
several orders of magnitude. We also find that M dwarfs could have
chromospheres extending to 18% to 180% of the stellar radius. We apply our
model to the planet-hosting star GJ 436 and find, from X-ray observational
constraints, $\dot{M}<7.6\times 10^{-15}\,M_{\odot}~\text{yr}^{-1}$. This is in
agreement with values derived from the Lyman-alpha transit of GJ 436b,
indicating that spectroscopic planetary transits could be used as a way to
study stellar wind properties.

we address a key challenge in this multi-task setup, i.e., the prediction
conflict, with two innovative designs namely, Consistency Energy Maximization

enables REC and RES to focus on similar visual regions by maximizing the
consistency energy between two tasks. ASNLS supresses the response of unrelated
regions in RES based on the prediction of REC. To validate our model, we
conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of REC and RES, i.e.,

their volume increases upon shear deformation. Conventional wisdom and previous
results suggest that dilatancy, as also the related phenomenon of shear-induced
jamming, requires frictional interactions [2, 3]. Here, we investigate the
occurrence of dilatancy and shear jamming in frictionless packings. We show
that the existence of isotropic jamming densities {\phi}j above the minimal
density, the J-point density {\phi}J [4, 5], leads both to the emergence of
shear-induced jamming and dilatancy. Packings at {\phi}J form a significant
threshold state into which systems evolve in the limit of vanishing pressure
under constant pressure shear, irrespective of the initial jamming density
{\phi}j. While packings for different {\phi}j display equivalent scaling
properties under compression [6], they exhibit striking differences in
rheological behaviour under shear. The yield stress under constant volume shear
increases discontinuously with density when {\phi}j > {\phi}J, contrary to the
continuous behavior in generic packings that jam at {\phi}J [4, 7].

motivated by questions in the context of satellite communication and
astrophysics. In the problem Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Costs (MSC), we
are given a graph $G$ that is embedded in Euclidean space. The edges of $G$
need to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. In order to scan
their edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a
vertex takes some time proportional to the corresponding turn angle. Our goal
is to minimize the time until all scans are completed, i.e., to compute a
schedule of minimum makespan.
  We show that MSC is closely related to both graph coloring and the minimum
(directed and undirected) cut cover problem; in particular, we show that the
minimum scan time for instances in 1D and 2D lies in $\Theta(\log \chi (G))$,
while for 3D the minimum scan time is not upper bounded by $\chi (G)$. We use
this relationship to prove that the existence of a constant-factor
approximation implies $P=NP$, even for one-dimensional instances. In 2D, we
show that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum scan cover within less than a
factor of $\frac{3}{2}$, even for bipartite graphs; conversely, we present a
$\frac{9}{2}$-approximation algorithm for this scenario. Generally, we give an
$O(c)$-approximation for $k$-colored graphs with $k\leq \chi(G)^c$. For general
metric cost functions, we provide approximation algorithms whose performance
guarantee depend on the arboricity of the graph.

range of recognition/classification tasks. However, when applying deep learning
to real-world applications, there are still multiple challenges. A typical
challenge is that unknown samples may be fed into the system during the testing
phase and traditional deep neural networks will wrongly recognize the unknown
sample as one of the known classes. Open set recognition is a potential
solution to overcome this problem, where the open set classifier should have
the ability to reject unknown samples as well as maintain high classification
accuracy on known classes. The variational auto-encoder (VAE) is a popular
model to detect unknowns, but it cannot provide discriminative representations
for known classification. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Conditional
Gaussian Distribution Learning (CGDL), for open set recognition. In addition to
detecting unknown samples, this method can also classify known samples by
forcing different latent features to approximate different Gaussian models.
Meanwhile, to avoid information hidden in the input vanishing in the middle
layers, we also adopt the probabilistic ladder architecture to extract
high-level abstract features. Experiments on several standard image datasets
reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline method
and achieves new state-of-the-art results.

particle beam energy could allow assessing the range of penetration during
treatments, encouraging the development of new dose delivery techniques for

measure in a few seconds the energy of clinical proton beams (from 60 to 230
MeV) from the Time of Flight (ToF) of protons, is presented. The prototype
consists of two Ultra Fast Silicon Detector (UFSD) pads, featuring an active
thickness of 80 um and a sensitive area of 3 x 3 mm2, aligned along the beam
direction in a telescope configuration, connected to a broadband amplifier and
readout by a digitizer. Measurements were performed at the Centro Nazionale di
Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO, Pavia, Italy), at five different clinical beam
energies and four distances between the sensors (from 7 to 97 cm) for each
energy. In order to derive the beam energy from the measured average ToF,
several systematic effects were considered, Monte Carlo simulations were
developed to validate the method and a global fit approach was adopted to
calibrate the system. The results were benchmarked against the energy values
obtained from the water equivalent depths provided by CNAO. Deviations of few
hundreds of keV have been achieved for all considered proton beam energies for
both 67 and 97 cm distances between the sensors and few seconds of irradiation
were necessary to collect the required statistics. These preliminary results
indicate that a telescope of UFSDs could achieve in a few seconds the accuracy
required for the clinical application and therefore encourage further
investigations towards the improvement and the optimization of the present
prototype.

act upon a dynamical system at specific times so as to minimize a quadratic
control cost, such as the objective of the Linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) or
the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). When budget or operational constraints
are imposed on the schedule, this problem is in general NP-hard and its
solution can therefore only be approximated even for moderately sized systems.
The quality of this approximation depends on the structure of both the
constraints and the objective. This work shows that greedy scheduling is
near-optimal when the constraints can be represented as an intersection of
matroids, algebraic structures that encode requirements such as limits on the
number of agents deployed per time slot, total number of actuator uses, and
duty cycle restrictions. To do so, it proves that the LQG cost function is
alpha-supermodular and provides a new alpha/(alpha + P)-optimality certificates
for the greedy minimization of such functions over an intersections of P
matroids. These certificates are shown to approach the 1/(1+P) guarantee of
supermodular functions in relevant settings. These results support the use of
greedy algorithms in non-supermodular quadratic control problems as opposed to
typical heuristics such as convex relaxations and surrogate figures of merit,
e.g., the logdet of the controllability Gramian.

for some galaxies are significantly lower than the expected values for a given
mass or luminosity. Thus, the decrease in the rotation curve can be associated
with a reduced contribution of the dark halo to the rotation velocity. For
seven galaxies with the longest rotation curves, the disk mass was estimated to
be with the dark halo (Newtonian model) and without the halo (modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) model). In four of the galaxies, the MOND model

asymptotic relative efficiency in an a-posteriori setting, the results allow us

based on the dependence of the tunnel conductance on the relative angle between
the magnetization of the two magnetic electrodes in in-plane magnetized tunnel
junctions. For this, it is necessary to design a free layer whose magnetization
can be stabilized along several or even any in-plane direction between the
parallel and the antiparallel magnetic configurations. We experimentally show
that this can be achieved by exploiting antiferromagnet-ferromagnet exchange
interactions in a regime where the antiferromagnet is thin enough to induce
enhanced coercivity and no exchange bias. The frustration of exchange
interactions at the interfaces due to competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic
interactions is at the origin of an isotropic dissipation mechanism yielding
isotropic coercivity. From a modeling point of view, it is shown that this
isotropic dissipation can be described by a dry friction term in the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The influence of this dry friction term on
the magnetization dynamics of an in-plane magnetized layer submitted to a
rotating in-plane field is investigated both analytically and numerically. The
possibility to control the free layer magnetization orientation in an in-plane
magnetized magnetic tunnel junction by using the spin transfer torque from an
additional perpendicular polarizer is also investigated through macrospin
simulation. It is shown that the memristor function can be achieved by the
injection of current pulses through the stack in the presence of an in-plane
static field transverse to the reference layer magnetization, the aim of which
is to limit the magnetization rotation between 0{\deg} and 180{\deg}.

Conditioning VMC on desired goal states is a promising way of achieving
versatile skill primitives. However, common conditioning schemes either rely on
task-specific fine tuning - e.g. using one-shot imitation learning (IL) - or on
sampling approaches using a forward model of scene dynamics i.e.
model-predictive control (MPC), leaving deployability and planning horizon
severely limited. In this paper we propose a conditioning scheme which avoids
these pitfalls by learning the controller and its conditioning in an end-to-end
manner. Our model predicts complex action sequences based directly on a dynamic
image representation of the robot motion and the distance to a given target
observation. In contrast to related works, this enables our approach to
efficiently perform complex manipulation tasks from raw image observations
without predefined control primitives or test time demonstrations. We report
significant improvements in task success over representative MPC and IL
baselines. We also demonstrate our model's generalisation capabilities in
challenging, unseen tasks featuring visual noise, cluttered scenes and unseen

allows for exploiting the engine coolant as thermal energy storage, providing
more flexibility for the HEV energy flow optimization. The simulation results
show that the proposed MH-MPC provides near-optimal results in reference to the

Moreover, compared with a more conventional MPC strategy, the MH-MPC can
leverage the speed previews with different resolutions effectively to achieve

of the most effective methods for Densely-Sampled Light Field (DSLF)
reconstruction. The ST-based DSLF reconstruction typically relies on an
iterative thresholding algorithm for Epipolar-Plane Image (EPI) sparse
regularization in shearlet domain, involving dozens of transformations between
image domain and shearlet domain, which are in general time-consuming. To
overcome this limitation, a novel learning-based ST approach, referred to as
Deep Residual Shearlet Transform (DRST), is proposed in this paper.
Specifically, for an input sparsely-sampled EPI, DRST employs a deep fully
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the residuals of the shearlet
coefficients in shearlet domain in order to reconstruct a densely-sampled EPI
in image domain. The DRST network is trained on synthetic Sparsely-Sampled
Light Field (SSLF) data only by leveraging elaborately-designed masks.
Experimental results on three challenging real-world light field evaluation
datasets with varying moderate disparity ranges (8 - 16 pixels) demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed learning-based DRST approach over the
non-learning-based ST method for DSLF reconstruction. Moreover, DRST provides a
2.4x speedup over ST, at least.

responses, and then densely reconstruct the feature map with an efficient
interpolation procedure. With this sampling-interpolation scheme, our network
avoids expending computation on spatial locations that can be effectively
interpolated, while being robust to activation prediction errors through
broadly distributed sampling. A technical challenge of this sampling-based
approach is that the binary decision variables for representing discrete
sampling locations are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with
backpropagation. To circumvent this issue, we make use of a reparameterization
trick based on the Gumbel-Softmax distribution, with which backpropagation can
iterate these variables towards binary values. The presented network is
experimentally shown to save substantial computation while maintaining accuracy

in the $L^1(\Omega)$-norm, satisfy a discrete energy law, and have \emph{ a

Moser--Trudinger inequality. As far as we know, our numerical method is the

Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated.
It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential,
but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment
policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime
following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase
transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed
in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in
crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a
quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment
policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread
but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results
show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking
positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found
values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and
Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment

discover the latent multi-source correlation. Thanks to the obtained

resulting video suffers from severe motion blur (due to exposure time) and
motion aliasing (due to low sampling rate in time). True Temporal
Super-Resolution (TSR) is more than just Temporal-Interpolation (increasing
framerate). It can also recover new high temporal frequencies beyond the
temporal Nyquist limit of the input video, thus resolving both motion-blur and
motion-aliasing effects that temporal frame interpolation (as sophisticated as
it maybe) cannot undo. In this paper we propose a ""Deep Internal Learning""
approach for true TSR. We train a video-specific CNN on examples extracted
directly from the low-framerate input video. Our method exploits the strong
recurrence of small space-time patches inside a single video sequence, both
within and across different spatio-temporal scales of the video. We further
observe (for the first time) that small space-time patches recur also
across-dimensions of the video sequence - i.e., by swapping the spatial and
temporal dimensions. In particular, the higher spatial resolution of video
frames provides strong examples as to how to increase the temporal resolution
of that video. Such internal video-specific examples give rise to strong
self-supervision, requiring no data but the input video itself. This results in
Zero-Shot Temporal-SR of complex videos, which removes both motion blur and
motion aliasing, outperforming previous supervised methods trained on external
video datasets.

$Ax=b$ with $b$ contaminated by white noise, the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization
based LSQR method and its mathematically equivalent CGLS, the Conjugate
Gradient (CG) method applied to $A^TAx=A^Tb$, are most commonly used. They have
intrinsic regularizing effects, where the iteration number $k$ plays the role
of regularization parameter. The long-standing fundamental question is: {\em
Can LSQR and CGLS find 2-norm filtering best possible regularized solutions}?
The author has given definitive answers to this question for severely and
moderately ill-posed problems when the singular values of $A$ are simple. This
paper extends the results to the multiple singular value case, and studies the
approximation accuracy of Krylov subspaces, the quality of low rank
approximations generated by Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the convergence
properties of Ritz values. For the two kinds of problems, we prove that LSQR
finds 2-norm filtering best possible regularized solutions at semi-convergence.
Particularly, we consider some important and untouched issues on best, near
best and general rank $k$ approximations to $A$ for the ill-posed problems with
the singular values $\sigma_k=\mathcal{O}(k^{-\alpha})$ with $\alpha>0$, and
the relationships between them and their nonzero singular values. Numerical
experiments confirm our theory. The results on general rank $k$ approximations
and the properties of their nonzero singular values apply to several Krylov
solvers, including LSQR, CGME, MINRES, MR-II, GMRES and RRGMRES.

available to neuroradiologists. MRI volumetry with AVS may support the
diagnosis of dementias by identifying regional atrophy. Moreover, automatic
classifiers using machine learning techniques have recently emerged as
promising approaches to assist diagnosis. However, the performance of both AVS
and automatic classifiers has been evaluated mostly in the artificial setting
of research datasets.OBJECTIVE:Our aim was to evaluate the performance of two
AVS and an automatic classifier in the clinical routine condition of a memory
clinic.METHODS:We studied 239 patients with cognitive troubles from a single
memory center cohort. Using clinical routine T1-weighted MRI, we evaluated the
classification performance of: 1) univariate volumetry using two AVS (volBrain
and Neuroreader$^{TM}$); 2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) automatic classifier,
using either the AVS volumes (SVM-AVS), or whole gray matter (SVM-WGM); 3)
reading by two neuroradiologists. The performance measure was the balanced
diagnostic accuracy. The reference standard was consensus diagnosis by three
neurologists using clinical, biological (cerebrospinal fluid) and imaging data
and following international criteria.RESULTS:Univariate AVS volumetry provided
only moderate accuracies (46% to 71% with hippocampal volume). The accuracy
improved when using SVM-AVS classifier (52% to 85%), becoming close to that of
SVM-WGM (52 to 90%). Visual classification by neuroradiologists ranged between
SVM-AVS and SVM-WGM.CONCLUSION:In the routine practice of a memory clinic, the
use of volumetric measures provided by AVS yields only moderate accuracy.
Automatic classifiers can improve accuracy and could be a useful tool to assist
diagnosis.

determining crystal growth rate and crystal quality. Crystals grown in reduced

demonstrated a new method to suppress the flow strength using confinement
effect during vapor diffusion method of protein crystallization where the
crystal is grown inside an evaporating droplet. Flow study is carried out at
four different confinement conditions to study the effect of confinement. Flow
inside the droplet is caused by evaporation induced natural convection which is
measured by micro-PIV method. Also concentration gradient generated around the
growing crystal also induces buoyancy driven flow around the protein crystal
during the crystal growth phase. The evaporation rate from the droplet and the
flow strength inside the droplet get suppressed by increasing confinement.
Hence, the flow strength can be tuned by adjusting the confinement which is a
very simple method to tune the flow strength.

the dynamics of semiflexible polymers under the influence of an imposed flow in

for long-chain polymer molecules such as DNA that are transported through
micropost arrays for electrophoretic chromatographic separation. In contrast to
long entropic molecules, the dynamics of elastic polymers results from a
combination of scattering with the obstacles and flow-induced buckling
instabilities. We identify three dominant modes of transport that involve
trapping, gliding and vaulting of the polymers around the obstacles, and we
reveal their essential features using tools from dynamical systems theory. The
interplay of these scattering dynamics with transport and deformations in the
imposed flow results in the long-time asymptotic dispersion of the center of
mass, which we quantify in terms of a hydrodynamic dispersion tensor. We then
discuss a simple yet efficient chromatographic device that exploits the
competition between different modes of transport to sort filaments in a dilute

This exactly solvable model involves a highly entangled state resulting from

concerns, we propose Smooth Adversarial Training (SAT), guided by our analysis
on the eigenspectrum of the loss Hessian. We find that curriculum learning, a
scheme that emphasizes on starting ""easy"" and gradually ramping up on the
""difficulty"" of training, smooths the adversarial loss landscape for a suitably

improvement in both clean accuracy and robustness compared to AT, TRADES, and

process a computational task in each time instant, where high-altitude balloons
(HABs), acting as flying wireless base stations, can use their powerful
computational abilities to process the tasks offloaded from their associated
users. Since the data size of each user's computational task varies over time,
the HABs must dynamically adjust the user association, service sequence, and
task partition scheme to meet the users' needs. This problem is posed as an
optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the energy and time consumption
for task computing and transmission by adjusting the user association, service
sequence, and task allocation scheme. To solve this problem, a support vector
machine (SVM)-based federated learning (FL) algorithm is proposed to determine
the user association proactively. The proposed SVM-based FL method enables each
HAB to cooperatively build an SVM model that can determine all user
associations without any transmissions of either user historical associations
or computational tasks to other HABs. Given the prediction of the optimal user
association, the service sequence and task allocation of each user can be
optimized so as to minimize the weighted sum of the energy and time

reduce the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption of all users by up

January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a

quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its
scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using
a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show
that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down
the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) > 1 to
R(t) <1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in
Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected
case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health
policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down
the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in
other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail
spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in
the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March
2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction
number at R(t) <1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures
in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent
increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) >1. Thus, it may be wise
to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which

wireless relay network in the presence of imperfect channel state information
(CSI), in which a source-destination pair both equipped with multiple antennas
communicates through a large number of half-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF)
relay terminals. We investigate the performance of three linear beamforming
schemes when the CSI of relay-to-destination (R-D) link is not perfect at the
relay nodes. The three efficient linear beamforming schemes are based on the
matched-filter (MF), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and regularized zero-forcing
(RZF) precoding techniques, which utilize the CSI of both S-D channel and R-D
channel at the relay nodes. By modeling the R-D CSI error at the relay nodes as
independent complex Gaussian random variables, we derive the ergodic capacities
of the three beamformers in terms of instantaneous SNR. Using Law of Large
Number, we obtain the asymptotic capacities, upon which the optimized MF-RZF is
derived. Simulation results show that the asymptotic capacities match with the
respective ergodic capacities very well. Analysis and simulation results
demonstrate that the optimized MF-RZF outperforms MF and MF-ZF for any power of
R-D CSI error.

It can
replace expensive experiments and even reduce the need for prototypes. While
products designed with the aid of numerical simulation undergo continuous
improvement, this must also be true for numerical simulation itself. Up to
date, no general purpose numerical method is available which can accurately
resolve a variety of physics ranging from fluid to solid mechanics including
large deformations and free surface flow phenomena. These complex multi-physics
problems occur for example in Additive Manufacturing processes. In this sense,
the recent developments in Machine Learning display promise for numerical
simulation. It has recently been shown that instead of solving a system of
equations as in standard numerical methods, a neural network can be trained
solely based on initial and boundary conditions. Neural networks are smooth,
differentiable functions that can be used as a global ansatz for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). While this idea dates back to more than 20 years
ago [Lagaris et al., 1998], it is only recently that an approach for the
solution of time dependent problems has been developed [Raissi et al., 2019].
With the latter, implicit Runge Kutta schemes with unprecedented high order
have been constructed to solve scalar-valued PDEs. We build on the
aforementioned work in order to develop an Updated Lagrangian method for the
solution of incompressible free surface flow subject to the inviscid Euler
equations. The method is easy to implement and does not require any specific
algorithmic treatment which is usually necessary to accurately resolve the
incompressibility constraint. Due to its meshfree character, we will name it
the Neural Particle Method (NPM). It will be demonstrated that the NPM remains
stable and accurate even if the location of discretization points is highly
irregular.

x-ray and an intense visible-light laser in a plasma. In normal circumstances,
the x-ray amplification from this type of the physical processes is implausible
because its phase, which is the \textbf{non-resonant} perturbation, is not
suitable for transferring the energy from the visible light laser to the x-ray.
As proposed in this paper, this undesirable phase can be manipulated into the
desirable one. Two situations are considered. The first case is in the presence
of the strong plasma density gradient. A lasting amplification is possible when
a strong Langmuir wave, whose phase velocity matches with the x-ray group
velocity, provides the density gradient along the way of the x-ray propagation.
  The second case is in the presence of a pre-excited Langmuir wave. The author
considers two lasers, with their frequency differing by the Langmuir wave,
counter-propagating and exciting a rather strong Langmuir wave. In the presence
of the mentioned Langmuir wave, it is demonstrated that the ponderomotive
interaction between the x-ray and one of the lasers excites the plasma density
perturbation with a desired phase, resulting to amplify (decay) the x-ray
(visible light laser). The condition for achieving the mentioned favorable
phase and the amplification strength, when the condition is met, is estimated.
The amplification strength is quite high, where the gain per length could reach
1000 per cm in both cases.

the several examined in previous studies are most central to shaping public

find that the perceived risks associated with climate change are more decisive
for shaping public support for policy options promoting renewable energy and
regulating pollutants. However, we observe a very different behavior related to
public support for increasing the use of nuclear energy where climate change
risk perception is no longer the sole decisive feature. Our findings indicate
that public support for renewable energy is inherently different from that for
nuclear energy reliance with the risk perception of climate change, dominant
for the former, playing a subdued role for the latter.

patients experiencing long-lasting complete responses to this therapy. This
treatment works by extracting the patient's T cells and adding them the CAR
group, which enables them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigen
CD19+, that is expressed in these haematological tumors.
  Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response of
leukaemias to the injection of CAR T-cells. The model accounts for mature and
progenitor B-cells, tumor cells, CAR T cells and side effects by incorporating
the main biological processes involved. The model explains the early
post-injection dynamics of the different compartments and the fact that the
number of CAR T cells injected does not critically affect the treatment
outcome. An explicit formula is found that provides the maximum CAR T cell
expansion in-vivo and the severity of side effects. Our mathematical model
captures other known features of the response to this immunotherapy. It also
predicts that CD19+ tumor relapses could be the result of the competition
between tumor and CAR T cells analogous to predator-prey dynamics. We discuss
this fact on the light of available evidences and the possibility of
controlling relapses by early re-challenging of the tumor with stored CAR T

perturbation, as well as their relative amplitudes, are varied in a series of
carefully designed numerical simulations at grid resolutions up to
$3.2\times10^9$ cells. Three different perturbations are considered,
characterised by a power spectrum of the form $P(k)\propto k^m$ where $m=-1$,
$-2$ and $-3$. The growth of the mixing layer is shown to strongly depend on
the initial conditions, with the growth rate exponent $\theta$ found to be
$0.5$, $0.63$ and $0.75$ for each value of $m$ at the highest grid resolution.
The asymptotic values of the molecular mixing fraction $\Theta$ are also shown
to vary significantly with $m$; at the latest time considered $\Theta$ is
$0.56$, $0.39$ and $0.20$ respectively. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is also
analysed in both the temporal and spectral domains. The temporal decay rate of
TKE is found not to match the predicted value of $n=2-3\theta$, which is shown
to be due to a time-varying {normalised dissipation rate $C_\epsilon$}. In
spectral space, the data follow the theoretical scaling of $k^{(m+2)/2}$ at low
wavenumbers and tend towards $k^{-3/2}$ and $k^{-5/3}$ scalings at high
wavenumbers for the spectra of transverse and normal velocity components
respectively. The results represent a significant extension of previous work on

nano-engines, which maintain living systems in far-from-equilibrium ordered
states. To investigate energetic processes in proteins, we have analyzed the
system of generalized Davydov equations that govern the quantum dynamics of
multiple amide I exciton quanta propagating along the hydrogen-bonded peptide
groups in $\alpha$-helices. Computational simulations have confirmed the
generation of moving Davydov solitons by applied pulses of amide I energy for
protein $\alpha$-helices of varying length. The stability and mobility of these
solitons depended on the uniformity of dipole-dipole coupling between amide I
oscillators, and the isotropy of the exciton-phonon interaction. Davydov
solitons were also able to quantum tunnel through massive barriers, or to
quantum interfere at collision sites. The results presented here support a
nontrivial role of quantum effects in biological systems that lies beyond the
mechanistic support of covalent bonds as binding agents of macromolecular
structures. Quantum tunneling and interference of Davydov solitons provide
catalytically active macromolecular protein complexes with a physical mechanism
allowing highly efficient transport, delivery, and utilization of free energy,
besides the evolutionary mandate of biological order that supports the
existence of such genuine quantum phenomena, and may indeed demarcate the
quantum boundaries of life.

aerial vehicle (UAV) flying at an altitude of 80 m. At this height, the sheep
are relatively small, only about 15 pixels across. Although deep learning
strategies have gained enormous popularity in the last decade and are now
extensively used for object detection in many fields, state-of-the-art
detectors perform poorly in the case of smaller objects. We develop a novel
dataset of UAV imagery of sheep and consider a variety of object detectors to
determine which is the most suitable for our task in terms of both accuracy and
speed. Our findings indicate that a UNet detector using the weighted Hausdorff
distance as a loss function during training is an excellent option for
detection of sheep onboard a UAV.

important/necessary for being a well-performing activation function. Also, the
most widely used weight initialization methods - Xavier and He normal
initialization have fundamental connection with activation function. This
survey discusses the important/necessary properties of activation function and
the most widely used activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LReLU and
PReLU). This survey also explores the relationship between these activation
functions and the two weight initialization methods - Xavier and He normal

be used to provide external data to smart contracts. An oracle is an interface
that delivers data from external data outside the blockchain to a smart
contract to consume. Oracle can deliver different types of data depending on
the industry and requirements. In this paper, we study and describe the widely

architecture, and design patterns. Finally, we discuss the human oracle and his
key role in solving the truth problem by reaching a consensus about a certain
