with it a rise in comparisons between human and machine perception. But such
comparisons face a challenge: Whereas machine perception of some stimulus can
often be probed through direct and explicit measures, much of human perceptual
knowledge is latent, incomplete, or unavailable for explicit report. Here, we
explore how this asymmetry can cause such comparisons to misestimate the
overlap in human and machine perception. As a case study, we consider human
perception of \textit{adversarial speech} -- synthetic audio commands that are
recognized as valid messages by automated speech-recognition systems but that
human listeners reportedly hear as meaningless noise. In five experiments, we
adapt task designs from the human psychophysics literature to show that even
when subjects cannot freely transcribe such speech commands (the previous
benchmark for human understanding), they often can demonstrate other forms of
understanding, including discriminating adversarial speech from closely matched
non-speech (Experiments 1--2), finishing common phrases begun in adversarial
speech (Experiments 3--4), and solving simple math problems posed in
adversarial speech (Experiment 5) -- even for stimuli previously described as
unintelligible to human listeners. We recommend the adoption of such ""sensitive
tests"" when comparing human and machine perception, and we discuss the broader
consequences of such approaches for assessing the overlap between systems.

that the velocity modulation associated with the 70-min beat period and the
38-min spin cycle are dramatically weaker than previously observed. We put
forward two interpretations for this change. The first is that a sudden drop
into a low state detected in 2018-2019 caused an episode of low mass transfer
from the companion, thus inhibiting the light-house effect produced by the
rebound emission. The second is that this is a consequence of a rare outburst
detected in 2007 by Crawford (2008). We find this post-outburst hypothesis to
be less likely. If the first scenario is correct, we predict that DW Cnc will
recover its intermediate polar characteristics. A new ephemeris is presented by
combining Patterson et aal. (2004) radial velocities with ours.

any of the classes in its training set. Existing methods fit a probability
distribution to the training samples on their embedding space and detect
outliers according to this distribution. The embedding space is often obtained
from a discriminative classifier. However, such discriminative representation
focuses only on known classes, which may not be critical for distinguishing the
unknown classes. We argue that the representation space should be jointly
learned from the inlier classifier and the density estimator (served as an
outlier detector). We propose the OpenHybrid framework, which is composed of an
encoder to encode the input data into a joint embedding space, a classifier to
classify samples to inlier classes, and a flow-based density estimator to
detect whether a sample belongs to the unknown category. A typical problem of
existing flow-based models is that they may assign a higher likelihood to
outliers. However, we empirically observe that such an issue does not occur in
our experiments when learning a joint representation for discriminative and
generative components. Experiments on standard open set benchmarks also reveal
that an end-to-end trained OpenHybrid model significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and flow-based baselines.

day period (with possible aliasing) in its bursting activity. Given magnetars
as widely considered FRB sources, this period has been attributed to precession
of the magnetar spin axis or the orbit of a binary companion. Here, we make the
simpler connection to a {\it rotational period}, an idea observationally
motivated by the 6.7 hour period of the Galactic magnetar candidate, 1E
161348--5055. We explore three physical mechanisms that could lead to the
creation of ultra long period magnetars: (i) enhanced spin-down due to episodic
mass-loaded charged particle winds (e.g. as may accompany giant flares), (ii)
angular momentum kicks from giant flares and (iii) fallback leading to long
lasting accretion disks. We show that particle winds and fallback accretion can
potentially lead to a sub-set of the magnetar population with ultra long
periods, sufficiently long to accommodate FRB 180916 or 1E 161348--5055. If
confirmed, such periods implicate magnetars in relatively mature states (ages
$1-10$ kyr) and which possessed large internal magnetic fields at birth $B_{\rm
int}\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G. In the low-twist magnetar model for FRBs, such long
period magnetars may dominate FRB production for repeaters at lower
isotropic-equivalent energies and broaden the energy distribution beyond that
expected for a canonical population of magnetars which terminate their magnetic
activity at shorter periods $P \lesssim 10$ s.

covers three days of the filament evolution, one day before the filament growth
and one day after the eruption. We search for possible triggers that lead to
the eruption of the filament.
  The surface velocity field in the region of the filament were measured by
means of time-distance helioseismology and coherent structure tracking. The
apparent velocities in the higher atmosphere were estimated by tracking the
features in the 30.4 nm AIA observations. To capture the evolution of the
magnetic field, we extrapolated the photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and
also computed the decay index of the magnetic field.
  We found that photospheric velocity fields showed some peculiarities. Before
the filament activation, we observed a temporal increase of the converging
flows towards the filament's spine. In addition, the mean squared velocity
increased temporarily before the activation and peaked just before it, followed
by a steep decrease. We further see an increase in the average shear of the
zonal flow component in the filament's region, followed by a steep decrease.
The photospheric l.o.s. magnetic field shows a persistent increase of induction
eastward from the filament spine. The decay index of the magnetic field at
heights around 10 Mm shows a value larger than critical at the connecting point
of the northern filament end.

although Nobel laureates were energetic producers from the outset, producing
works that garner unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize
follow relatively similar patterns as ordinary scientists, being characterized
by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations. We also uncovered
notable variations along their careers, often associated with the Nobel prize,
including shifting coauthorship structure in the prize-winning work, and a
significant but temporary dip in the impact of work they produce after winning
the Nobel. Together, these results document quantitative patterns governing the
careers of scientific elites, offering an empirical basis for a deeper

However, scalable generation of the GHZ states is experimentally difficult to
realize. It is desirable to use a practical entangled state that can be easily

with Dicke states. We show a way to prepare and measure Dicke states via a
global control. Moreover, we investigate how dephasing due to unwanted coupling
with the environment affects the performance of our proposal, and show that
single spin detection with Dicke states with dephasing has a significant
advantage over the classical strategy with separable states. Our results are
important toward realizing entanglement enhanced single spin detection.

more classes simultaneously. It is a very challenging task present in many
real-world applications, such as classification of biology, image, video,
audio, and text. Recently, the interest in interpretable classification models
has grown, partially as a consequence of regulations such as the General Data
Protection Regulation. In this context, we propose a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm that generates multiple rule-based multi-label
classification models, allowing users to choose among models that offer
different compromises between predictive power and interpretability. An
important contribution of this work is that different from most algorithms,
which usually generate models based on lists (ordered collections) of rules,
our algorithm generates models based on sets (unordered collections) of rules,
increasing interpretability. Also, by employing a conflict avoidance algorithm
during the rule-creation, every rule within a given model is guaranteed to be
consistent with every other rule in the same model. Thus, no conflict
resolution strategy is required, evolving simpler models. We conducted
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and compared our results with
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of predictive performance (F-Score) and
interpretability (model size), and demonstrate that our best models had
comparable F-Score and smaller model sizes.

using a data-flow architecture is presented. The overall performance targets
are to be able to saturate a 1 Gbps network link with outbound data, while
using few FPGA resources. The goal is to replace the use of custom data buses
and protocols with ordinary Ethernet equipment. These objectives are achieved
by being just-enough conforming, such that no special drivers are needed in the
PC equipment interfacing with the here presented Fakernet system. An important
design choice is to handle all packet-data internally as 16-bit words, thus
reducing the clock-speed requirements. An advantageous circumstance is that
even at 1 Gbps speeds, for local network segments, the round-trip times are
usually well below 500 microseconds. Thus, less than 50 kiB of unacknowledged
data needs to be in-flight, allowing to saturate a network link without TCP
window scaling. The Fakernet system has so far been shown to saturate a 100
Mbps link at 11.7 MB/s of TCP output data, and able to do 32-bit control
register accesses at over 450 kword/s.

plasma (QGP) is commonly studied within perturbative QCD (pQCD).
Nonperturbative (NP) effects, which are expected to become important near the
critical temperature, have been much less investigated. Here, we utilize a
recently developed $T$-matrix approach to incorporate NP effects for gluon
emission off heavy quarks propagating through the QGP. We set up four cases
that contain, starting from a Born diagram calculation with color-Coulomb
interaction, an increasing level of NP components, by subsequently including
(remnants of) confining interactions, resummation in the heavy-light scattering
amplitude, and off-shell spectral functions for both heavy and light partons.
For each case we compute the power spectra of the emitted gluons, heavy-quark
transport coefficients (drag and transverse-momentum broadening, $\hat{q}$),
and the path-length dependent energy loss within a ""QGP brick"" at fixed
temperature. Investigating the differences in these quantities between the four
cases illustrates how NP mechanisms affect gluon radiation processes. While the
baseline perturbative processes experience a strong suppression of soft
radiation due to thermal masses of the emitted gluons, confining interactions,

independent random variables. Our approach is based on a family of candidate
probabilities that we shall call a model and which is chosen to either contain
the true distribution of the data or at least to provide a good approximation
of it with respect to some loss function. The aim of the present paper is to
describe a general estimation strategy that allows to adapt to both the
specific features of the model and the choice of the loss function in view of
designing an estimator with good estimation properties. The losses we have in
mind are based on the total variation, Hellinger, Wasserstein and
$\mathbb{L}_p$-distances to name a few. We show that the risk of the resulting
estimator with respect to the loss function can be bounded by the sum of an
approximation term accounting for the loss between the true distribution and
the model and a complexity term that corresponds to the bound we would get if
this distribution did belong to the model. Our results hold under mild
assumptions on the true distribution of the data and are based on exponential
deviation inequalities that are non-asymptotic and involve explicit constants.
When the model reduces to two distinct probabilities, we show how our
estimation strategy leads to a robust test whose errors of first and second
kinds only depend on the losses between the true distribution and the two
tested probabilities.

sequence of trial input states and measurements, which involve an unquantified
use of additional resources. Remarkably, we find that only one stage has to be
adapted, which leaves the choice of the other stage completely arbitrary. We
also show that our scheme is robust against imperfections in the optimized
stage. Moreover, we show that the adaptive procedure only requires a
preliminary classical knowledge (i.e to a precision $1/\sqrt{N}$) on the

predicted that one would need to carry out an adaptive procedure which involves
both the input states employed and the measurement performed at the output; we
show that this is not necessary: Heisenberg scaling precision is still
achievable by only adapting a single stage. The non-adapted stage only affects
the value of a pre-factor multiplying the Heisenberg scaling precision: we show
that, for large values of $M$ and a random (unbiased) choice of the non-adapted

the encoding of the parameter $\varphi$ into the linear network.

restricts the movement of emergency personnel towards these survivors.
Therefore, it is advantageous to utilize Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in
cooperation with on-ground first responders to aid search and rescue efforts.
In this article we demonstrate an implementation and improvement of the
weight-based path planning algorithm using an off-the-shelf UAV. The
coordinates of the survivor and their heading is reported by an on-ground
observer to the UAV to generate a weighted map of the surroundings for
exploration. Each coordinate in the map is assigned a weight which dictates the
priority of exploration. These waypoints are then sorted on the basis of their
weights to arrive at an ordered list for exploration by the UAV. We developed
the model in MATLAB, followed by prototyping on Robot Operating System (ROS)
using a 3DR Iris quadcopter. We tested the model on an off-the-shelf UAV by
utilizing the MAVROS and MAVLINK capabilities of ROS. During the implementation
of the algorithm on the UAV, several additional factors such as unreliable GPS
signals and limited field of view which could effect the performance of the
model were in effect, despite which the algorithm performed fairly well. We

microdosimetry and replace it by the particle mean free path appropriate for
modelings in radio-biology. {\bf Methods}: We perform a collision-by-collision
following by event-by-event Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation and calculate
double-averaged stepping-length, $\langle\langle l \rangle\rangle$, for a range
of target sizes from mm down to $\mu$m and depth in water. We consider
$\langle\langle l \rangle\rangle$ to represent the particle mean free path.
{\bf Results}: We show that $\langle\langle l \rangle\rangle$ continuously
drops as a function of depth and asymptotically saturates to a minimum value in
low energies, where it exhibits a universal scaling behavior, independent of
particle nominal beam energy. We correlate $\langle\langle l \rangle\rangle$ to
linear density of DNA damage, complexities of initial lethal lesions and
illustrate a relative difference between predictive RBEs in model calculations
using mean chord length vs. the proposed mean free path. We demonstrate
consistency between rapid increase in RBE within and beyond the Bragg peak and
$\langle\langle l \rangle\rangle$, a decreasing function of depth. {\bf
Discussion and conclusion}: An interplay between localities in imparted energy
at nano-meter scale and subsequent physio-chemical processes, causalities and
pathways in DNA damage requires substitution of geometrical chord length of
cell nuclei by mean-free path of proton and charged particles to account for a
mean distance among sequential collisions in DNA materials.

difficult for conventional NAS algorithms to directly search the architectures
on large-scale tasks like ImageNet. In general, the cost of GPU hours for NAS
grows with regard to training dataset size and candidate set size. One common
way is searching on a smaller proxy dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) and then
transferring to the target task (e.g., ImageNet). These architectures optimized
on proxy data are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. Another
common way is learning with a smaller candidate set, which may require expert
knowledge and indeed betrays the essence of NAS. In this paper, we present
DA-NAS that can directly search the architecture for large-scale target tasks
while allowing a large candidate set in a more efficient manner. Our method is
based on an interesting observation that the learning speed for blocks in deep
neural networks is related to the difficulty of recognizing distinct
categories. We carefully design a progressive data adapted pruning strategy for
efficient architecture search. It will quickly trim low performed blocks on a
subset of target dataset (e.g., easy classes), and then gradually find the best
blocks on the whole target dataset. At this time, the original candidate set
becomes as compact as possible, providing a faster search in the target task.
Experiments on ImageNet verify the effectiveness of our approach. It is 2x
faster than previous methods while the accuracy is currently state-of-the-art,
at 76.2% under small FLOPs constraint. It supports an argument search space
(i.e., more candidate blocks) to efficiently search the best-performing
architecture.

there is a critical index \gamma_c that controls whether the dispersion measure

top-heavy. We find \gamma_c = 7/4 for Poisson wait-time distribution of

temporal clustering of repetitions and cosmological effects. It is especially
interesting that two of the CHIME repeaters (FRB 181017 and 190417) have large

dependence of the non-repeating ASKAP sample, which suggests that they are

RIGAKU copper/molybdenum switchable microfocus rotating anode X-ray generator
and a DECTRIS detector with a changeable sample-to-detector distance of up to
1.6 m in a vacuum chamber. A science case has been presented to demonstrate the
uniqueness of the newly established method at ILL. Temporal structural

colloidal particles during gold nanoparticle growth are simultaneously probed,
enabling immediate correlated structural information. The newly established
nano-analytical method at ILL will open the way for real time investigations of
a wide range of innovative nanomaterials and will enable comprehensive in-situ

optimal in regions of the landscape where the dynamics are tuned at

Page time. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the
dynamical phase transition at the Page lifetime. We focus on a finite region of
the landscape, which exchanges volume with the rest of the landscape and as
such acts as an open system. Through a change of variables the master equation
governing the comoving volume of de Sitter vacua is mapped to a stochastic
equation for coupled overdamped stochastic oscillators -- the well-known
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The rest of the landscape, which acts as an
environment, is assumed to result in a non-vanishing driving term for all sites
in the region with uncorrelated, white noise fluctuations (though not
necessarily Gaussian). We first show that the static susceptibility of the
oscillators diverges as the average lifetime of de Sitter vacua approaches the
Page time. Thus, optimal regions of the landscape are most susceptible to
volume influx from their environing landscape. We then show that the
displacement fluctuations for the oscillators exhibit a $1/f$ power spectrum
over a broad range of frequencies, precisely at the critical Page lifetime
distribution. A $1/f$ power spectrum is a hallmark of non-equilibrium systems
at criticality. In analogy with sand avalanches in the abelian sandpile or
neuronal avalanches in the brain, de Sitter vacua at criticality can be thought
of as undergoing scale invariant volume fluctuation avalanches.

Their masses
may originate from a vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. If the sterile
neutrino couplings are very small and their direct coupling to the inflaton is
forbidden by the lepton number symmetry, the leading dark matter production
mechanism is the freeze-in scenario. We study this possibility in the neutrino
mass range up to 1 GeV, taking into account relativistic production rates based
on the Bose-Einstein statistics, thermal masses and phase transition effects.
The specifics of the production mechanism and the dominant mode depend on the
relation between the scalar and sterile neutrino masses as well as on whether
or not the scalar is thermalized. We find that the observed dark matter
abundance can be produced in all of the cases considered. We also revisit the
freeze-in production of a Higgs portal scalar, pointing out the importance of a
fusion mode, as well as the thermalization constraints.

object-level semantic map in dense clutter. In dense clutter, objects are often
in close contact and severe occlusions, which brings more false detections and
noisy pose estimates from existing perception methods. To solve these problems,
our key insight is to consider geometric consistency at the object level within
a general SLAM framework. The geometric consistency is defined in two parts:
geometric consistency score and geometric relation. The geometric consistency
score describes the compatibility between object geometry model and observation
point cloud. Meanwhile, it provides a reliable measure to filter out false
positives in data association. The geometric relation represents the
relationship (e.g. contact) between geometric features (e.g. planes) among
objects. The geometric relation makes the graph optimization for poses more
robust and accurate. GeoFusion can robustly and efficiently infer the object
labels, 6D object poses, and spatial relations from continuous noisy semantic
measurements. We quantitatively evaluate our method using observations from a
Fetch mobile manipulation robot. Our results demonstrate greater robustness
against false estimates than frame-by-frame pose estimation from the

a key role in the exchange of matter and chemical interactions that are
essential for life. The density and the mobility of water molecules depend on
their proximity to biological interfaces and can play an important role in
processes such as protein folding and aggregation. In this work, we study the
dynamics of water near glutamine surfaces---a system of interest in studies of
neurodegenerative diseases. Combining molecular-dynamics simulations and
stochastic modelling, we study how the mean first-passage time and related
statistics of water molecules escaping subnanometer-sized regions vary from the
interface to the bulk. Our analysis reveals a dynamical complexity that
reflects underlying chemical and geometrical properties of the glutamine
surfaces. From the first-passage time statistics of water molecules, we infer
their space-dependent diffusion coefficient in directions normal to the
surfaces. Interestingly, our results suggest that the mobility of water varies
over a longer length scale than the chemical potential associated with the
water-protein interactions. The synergy of molecular dynamics and first-passage
techniques opens the possibility for extracting space-dependent diffusion
coefficients in more complex, inhomogeneous environments that are commonplace
in living matter.

used to calculate solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by
processes that are rougher than a Brownian motion. We use a Taylor series

rough differential equation in order to determine conditions that guarantee the
desired order of the local error for the underlying Runge-Kutta method.
Subsequently, we prove the order of the global error given the local rate. In
addition, we simplify the numerical approximation by introducing a Runge-Kutta
scheme that is based on the increments of the driver of the rough differential
equation. This simplified method can be easily implemented and is computational
cheap since it is derivative-free. We provide a full characterization of this
implementable Runge-Kutta method meaning that we provide necessary and

spacing, is desirable in various scenarios of medical image analysis. However,
many MR acquisitions use large inter-slice spacing in clinical practice. In
this work, we propose a novel deep-learning-based super-resolution algorithm to
generate high-resolution (HR) MR images with small slice spacing from
low-resolution (LR) inputs of large slice spacing. Notice that most existing
deep-learning-based methods need paired LR and HR images to supervise the
training, but in clinical scenarios, usually no HR images will be acquired.
Therefore, our unique goal herein is to design and train the super-resolution
network with no real HR ground-truth. Specifically, two training stages are
used in our method. First, HR images of reduced slice spacing are synthesized
from real LR images using variational auto-encoder (VAE). Although these
synthesized HR images are as realistic as possible, they may still suffer from
unexpected morphing induced by VAE, implying that the synthesized HR images
cannot be paired with the real LR images in terms of anatomical structure
details. In the second stage, we degrade the synthesized HR images to generate
corresponding LR images and train a super-resolution network based on these
synthesized HR and degraded LR pairs. The underlying mechanism is that such a
super-resolution network is less vulnerable to anatomical variability.
Experiments on knee MR images successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed solution to reduce the slice spacing for better rendering.

The tool-based Trojan insertion facilitate a comprehensive evaluation against

through sensor measurements and aim to transmit a message signal to a base
station via collaborative beamforming. The agents' sensor measurements result
in localization errors, which degrade the quality of service at the base
station due to unknown phase offsets that arise in the agents' communication
channels. Assuming that each agent's localization error follows a Gaussian
distribution, we study the problem of forming a reliable communication link
between the agents and the base station despite the localization errors. In
particular, we formulate a discrete optimization problem to choose only a
subset of agents to transmit the message signal so that the variance of the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received by the base station is minimized while the
expected SNR exceeds a desired threshold. When the variances of the
localization errors are below a certain threshold characterized in terms of the
carrier frequency, we show that greedy algorithms can be used to globally
minimize the variance of the received SNR. On the other hand, when some agents
have localization errors with large variances, we show that the variance of the
received SNR can be locally minimized by exploiting the supermodularity of the
mean and variance of the received SNR. In numerical simulations, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithms have the potential to synthesize beamformers
orders of magnitude faster than convex optimization-based approaches while
achieving comparable performances using less number of agents.

sUAS during flight, a long-wave infrared (LWIR) sensor is able to produce
images that clearly contrast the sUAS from its background. However, compared to
widely available visible spectrum sensors, LWIR sensors have lower resolution
and may produce more false positives when exposed to birds or other heat

visible spectrum sensors using machine learning for vision-based detection of
sUAS. Utilizing the heightened background contrast from the LWIR sensor
combined and synchronized with the relatively increased resolution of the
visible spectrum sensor, a deep learning model was trained to detect the sUAS
through previously difficult environments. More specifically, the approach
demonstrated effective detection of multiple sUAS flying above and below the

making the sensor responses as close to the CIEXYZ tristimulus values as
possible given the knowledge of real measured surfaces and illuminants spectra
data. This data-driven method in turn is extended to incorporate constraints on
the filter (smoothness and bounded transmission). Also, because how the
optimisation is initialised is shown to impact on the performance of the
solved-for filters, a multi-initialisation optimisation is developed.
  Experiments demonstrate that, by taking pictures through our optimised color
filters we can make cameras significantly more colorimetric.

is the dipole, which has been measured with increasing accuracy for more than
three decades, particularly with the Planck satellite. The simplest
interpretation of the dipole is that it is due to our motion with respect to
the rest frame of the CMB. Since current CMB experiments infer temperature
anisotropies from angular intensity variations, the dipole modulates the
temperature anisotropies with the same frequency dependence as the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. We present the first, and significant,
detection of this signal in the tSZ maps and find that it is consistent with
direct measurements of the CMB dipole, as expected. The signal contributes
power in the tSZ maps, which is modulated in a quadrupolar pattern, and we
estimate its contribution to the tSZ bispectrum, noting that it contributes
negligible noise to the bispectrum at relevant scales.

Unbinding of defect pairs intrinsic to active matter is suppressed by
anisotropic surface anchoring. The geometry of arrays allows one to estimate
the elastic and surface anchoring characteristics of the tissues. The

proton-proton ($p^{\uparrow}+p$) and polarized proton-nucleus
($p^{\uparrow}+A$) collisions ($A_N$) generated by a partonic lensing
mechanism. The polarized proton is considered in the quark-diquark model while
its interaction with the unpolarized target is calculated using the
small-$x$/saturation approach, which includes multiple rescatterings and
small-$x$ evolution. The phase required for the asymmetry is caused by a
final-state gluon exchange between the quark and diquark, as is standard in the
lensing mechanism of Brodsky, Hwang and Schmidt. Our calculation combines the
lensing mechanism with small-$x$ physics in the saturation framework. The
expression we obtain for the asymmetry $A_N$ of the produced quarks has the
following properties: (i) The asymmetry is generated by the dominant elastic
scattering contribution and $1/N_c^2$ suppressed inelastic contribution (with
$N_c$ the number of quark colors); (ii) The asymmetry grows or oscillates with
the produced quark's transverse momentum $p_T$ until the momentum reaches the
saturation scale $Q_s$, and then only falls off as $1/p_T$ for larger momenta;
(iii) The asymmetry decreases with increasing atomic number $A$ of the target
for $p_T$ below or near $Q_s$, but is independent of $A$ for $p_T$
significantly above $Q_s$. We discuss how these properties may be qualitatively
consistent with the data on $A_N$ published by the PHENIX collaboration and
with the preliminary data on $A_N$ reported by the STAR collaboration.

recent years. With the experimental uncertainties becoming lower than those
from theory, carefully considering all sources of $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ is
important when making theoretical predictions. One source of
$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ that is often neglected arises from the irradiation of the
nonfuel materials in reactors. The $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ rates and energies from
these sources vary widely based on the reactor type, configuration, and
sampling stage during the reactor cycle and have to be carefully considered for
each experiment independently. In this article, we present a formalism for
selecting the possible $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ sources arising from the neutron
captures on reactor and target materials. We apply this formalism to the High
Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the
$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ source for the the Precision Reactor Oscillation and
Spectrum Measurement (PROSPECT) experiment. Overall, we observe that the
nonfuel $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ contributions from HFIR to PROSPECT amount to 1\%
above the inverse beta decay threshold with a maximum contribution of 9\% in
the 1.8--2.0~MeV range. Nonfuel contributions can be particularly high for
research reactors like HFIR because of the choice of structural and reflector
material in addition to the intentional irradiation of target material for
isotope production. We show that typical commercial pressurized water reactors
fueled with low-enriched uranium will have significantly smaller nonfuel
$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ contribution.

  To capture unusual and large fluctuations of inflation and unemployment, we

  To this aim, by using the coupled multifractal approach, we analyze US data
for a period of 70 years from 1948 until 2018 and measure the non-Gausianity of
the distributions. Then, we investigate how the non-Gaussianity of the
variables affects the coupling structure of them. By applying the multifractal
method, one can see that the non-Gaussianity depends on the scales. While the
non-Gaussianity of unemployment is noticeable only for periods smaller than 1
year and for longer periods tends to Gaussian behavior, the non-Gaussianities
of inflation persist for all time scales. Also, it is observed that the
coupling structure of these variables tends to a Gaussian behavior after $2$

identification and estimation of population-level causal effects involving a
single treatment and a single outcome. We derive influence function based
estimators that exhibit double robustness for the identified effects in a large
class of hidden variable DAGs where the treatment satisfies a simple graphical
criterion; this class includes models yielding the adjustment and front-door
functionals as special cases. We also provide necessary and sufficient
conditions under which the statistical model of a hidden variable DAG is
nonparametrically saturated and implies no equality constraints on the observed
data distribution. Further, we derive an important class of hidden variable
DAGs that imply observed data distributions observationally equivalent (up to
equality constraints) to fully observed DAGs. In these classes of DAGs, we
derive estimators that achieve the semiparametric efficiency bounds for the
target of interest where the treatment satisfies our graphical criterion.
Finally, we provide a sound and complete identification algorithm that directly
yields a weight based estimation strategy for any identifiable effect in hidden

that, in the quasi-static regime, it is possible to have higher efficiency than
the limit imposed by Carnot, provided that engineered reservoirs are used. The
quasi-static regime, however, is a strong limitation to the operation of heat
engines, since infinitely long time is required to complete a cycle. In this
paper we propose a two-level model as the working substance to perform a
quantum Otto heat engine surrounded by a cold thermal reservoir and a squeezed
hot thermal reservoir. Taking advantage of this model we show a striking
achievement, that is to attain unity efficiency even at non null power.

partial contractivity to establish global exponential convergence of its
primal-dual dynamics. As an application, we propose a new distributed solver

constrained tensor factorization problem. Then, this optimization problem is
tackled using an alternating least-squares algorithm. GRATE has the ability to
handle exact aggregated data as well as inexact aggregation where some
unobserved quantities contribute to the aggregated data. Special emphasis is
given to the energy disaggregation problem where the goal is to provide energy
breakdown for consumers from their monthly aggregated consumption. Experiments

to conventional morphological data. We firstly designed two open-access

how the concept of network tomography could be achieved with cortical neuronal
circuits for morphological, topological and electrical classification of
neurons. We extract the simulated data to many different classifiers (including
SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Artificial Neuron Networks) classifying
the specific cell type (and sub-group types) achieving accuracies of up to
70\%. Inference of biological network structures using network tomography
reached up to 65\% of accuracy. We also analysed recall, precision and F1score

viable new method for how we capture and store 3D scenes. Unlike conventional
3D representations, such as point clouds, which explicitly store scene
properties in discrete, localized units, these implicit representations encode
a scene in the weights of a neural network which can be queried at any
coordinate to produce these same scene properties. Thus far, implicit
representations have primarily been optimized to estimate only the appearance
and/or 3D geometry information in a scene. We take the next step and
demonstrate that an existing implicit representation (SRNs) is actually
multi-modal; it can be further leveraged to perform per-point semantic
segmentation while retaining its ability to represent appearance and geometry.
To achieve this multi-modal behavior, we utilize a semi-supervised learning
strategy atop the existing pre-trained scene representation. Our method is
simple, general, and only requires a few tens of labeled 2D segmentation masks
in order to achieve dense 3D semantic segmentation. We explore two novel
applications for this semantically aware implicit neural scene representation:
3D novel view and semantic label synthesis given only a single input RGB image
or 2D label mask, as well as 3D interpolation of appearance and semantics.

affected through the extraction of radiation close to the horizon. We adopt a
model of extraction that involves a perfectly absorptive screen placed close to
the horizon and show that the evaporation rate can be changed depending on how
close to the horizon the screen is placed. We apply our results to show that
the scrambling time defined by the Hayden-Preskill decoding criterion, which is
derived in Pennington's work (arXiv:1905.08255) through entanglement wedge
reconstruction is modified. The modifications appear as logarithmic corrections
to Pennington's time scale which depend on where the absorptive screen is
placed. By fixing the proper distance between the horizon and screen we show
that for small AdS black holes the leading order term in the scrambling time is
consistent with Pennington's scrambling time. However, for large AdS black
holes the leading order Log contains the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a cell
of characteristic length equal to the AdS radius rather than the entropy of the
full horizon. Furthermore, using the correspondence between the radial null
energy condition (NEC) and the holographic c-theorem, we argue that the screen
cannot be arbitrarily close to the horizon. This leads to a holographic
argument that black hole mining using a screen cannot significantly alter the

to just his seminal demonstration of how Lagrangians appear naturally in
quantum mechanics, but that Dirac should be credited for creating a

than Feynman's while possessing all its desirable features. On top of it, the
Dirac path-integral is fully compatible with the inevitable quantisation
ambiguities, while the Feynman path-integral can never have that full
consistency. In particular, I show that the claim by Feynman that for
infinitesimal time intervals, what Dirac thought were analogues were actually
proportional can not be correct always. I have also shown the conection between
Dirac path-integrals and the Schr\""odinger equation. In particular, it is shown
that each choice of Dirac path-integral yields a {\it quantum Hamiltonian} that
is generically different from what the Feynman path-integral gives, and that
all of them have the same {\it classical analogue}. Dirac's method of
demonstrating the least action principle for classical mechanics generalizes in

hinders the practical application of the DR-CCP paradigm. Motivated by these
challenges, we conduct a polyhedral study to strengthen these formulations. We
reveal several hidden connections between DR-CCP and its nominal counterpart
(the sample average approximation), mixing sets, and robust 0-1 programming. By
exploiting these connections in combination, we provide an improved formulation
and two classes of valid inequalities for DR-CCP. We test the impact of our
results on a stochastic transportation problem numerically. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; in particular our improved
formulation and proposed valid inequalities reduce the overall solution times
remarkably. Moreover, this allows us to significantly scale up the problem
sizes that can be handled in such DR-CCP formulations by reducing the solution
times from hours to seconds.

by tracking the relative motion of speckles in projection holograms as a sample
is scanned across the wavefront. By removing the need to obtain an un-distorted
reference image of the sample, this method is suitable for the metrology of
highly divergent wavefields. Such wavefields allow for large magnification
factors, that, according to current imaging capabilities, will allow for
nano-radian angular sensitivity and nano-scale sample projection imaging. Both
the reconstruction algorithm and the imaging geometry are nearly identical to
that of ptychography, except that the sample is placed downstream of the beam
focus and that no coherent propagation is explicitly accounted for. Like other
x-ray speckle tracking methods, it is robust to low-coherence x-ray sources
making is suitable for lab based x-ray sources. Likewise it is robust to errors
in the registered sample positions making it suitable for x-ray free-electron
laser facilities, where beam pointing fluctuations can be problematic for
wavefront metrology. We also present a modified form of the speckle tracking
approximation, based on a second-order local expansion of the Fresnel integral.
This result extends the validity of the speckle tracking approximation and may

The attention and decoder modules take care of producing multiple
transcriptions from overlapped speech. SOT has two advantages over PIT: (1) no
limitation in the maximum number of speakers, and (2) an ability to model the
dependencies among outputs for different speakers. We also propose a simple
trick that allows SOT to be executed in $O(S)$, where $S$ is the number of the
speakers in the training sample, by using the start times of the constituent
source utterances. Experimental results on LibriSpeech corpus show that the SOT
models can transcribe overlapped speech with variable numbers of speakers
significantly better than PIT-based models. We also show that the SOT models
can accurately count the number of speakers in the input audio.

Heisenberg antiferromagnet(TLHAF) has a long range ordered ground state, a
thorough understanding of its spin dynamics is still missing. While the linear
spin wave theory(LSWT) predicts three branches of magnon mode in the magnetic
Brillouin zone(MBZ), the 1/S expansion at the next order is found to break down
in a large portion of the MBZ centered around the M point, leaving the fate of
the magnon modes there undecided. Recent neutron scattering measurement on
Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$, an ideal realization of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ TLHAF,
provides a surprising answer to this issue. Two, rather than three branches of
magnon mode are observed around the M point, whose dispersion are strongly
renormalized with respect to the LSWT prediction and exhibit pronounced
roton-like minimum at the M point. This is accompanied by a strong spin
fluctuation continuum at higher energy, inside which two strong and broad
spectral peaks of unknown origin are observed. In this work, we propose a
simple picture for these spectral anomalies by invoking the resonating valence
bond(RVB) physics in the description of the ground state of the system. We find
that the roton-like minimum in the magnon dispersion can be explained by the
coupling between the collective spin fluctuation and the continuum of Dirac
spinon excitation moving in a $\pi$-flux background. We also propose that the
two broad peaks in the continuum can be understood respectively as the Landau
damped third magnon mode and the Landau damped longitudinal mode. Such a
picture can be verified by studying the polarization character of the various
spectral features.

by abnormal and sudden hyper-synchronous excitation of the neurons in the
brain. The electroencephalogram(EEG) is the most widely used method to record
brain signals and diagnose epilepsy and seizure cases. In this paper we use the
method of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) in our analysis to classify
seizure/seizure free signals. This technique uses variational non recursive
mode decomposition, in comparison to other methods like Empirical Mode (EMD)
and Hilbert-Huang transform which recursively decompose the signals, making
them more susceptible to noise and sampling rate. VMD decomposes a signal into
its components which are called principal modes. In our analysis, 4 features of
the decomposed signals namely Renyi Entropy, second order difference plot
(SODP), fourth order difference plot(FODP) and average amplitude are
investigated, both individually and using a ranking methodology considering all
4 features at the same time. The SODP of decomposed signal modes is an
elliptical structure. The 95% confidence ellipse area measured from the SODP of
the decomposed signal modes has been used as a feature in order to discriminate
seizure-free EEG signals from the epileptic seizure EEG signal. For the
classification, a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) with back propagation algorithm as
the training method was used. A high percentage of accuracy was obtained when
the features were used individually for classification and an even higher

soon as the agents are finetuned to maximize task completion, they suffer from
the so-called language drift phenomenon: they slowly lose syntactic and

paper, we propose a generic approach to counter language drift called Seeded
iterated learning (SIL). We periodically refine a pretrained student agent by
imitating data sampled from a newly generated teacher agent. At each time step,
the teacher is created by copying the student agent, before being finetuned to
maximize task completion. SIL does not require external syntactic constraint
nor semantic knowledge, making it a valuable task-agnostic finetuning protocol.
We evaluate SIL in a toy-setting Lewis Game, and then scale it up to the
translation game with natural language. In both settings, SIL helps counter
language drift as well as it improves the task completion compared to
baselines.

label-control loss for the generative model to deal with the uneven

  Internet of Things","10 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the proliferation of smart devices having built-in sensors, Internet
connectivity, and programmable computation capability in the era of Internet of
things (IoT), tremendous data is being generated at the network edge. Federated
learning is capable of analyzing the large amount of data from a distributed
set of smart devices without requiring them to upload their data to a central
place. However, the commonly-used federated learning algorithm is based on
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and not suitable for resource-constrained IoT
environments due to its high communication resource requirement. Moreover, the
privacy of sensitive data on smart devices has become a key concern and needs
to be protected rigorously. This paper proposes a novel federated learning
framework called DP-PASGD for training a machine learning model efficiently
from the data stored across resource-constrained smart devices in IoT while
guaranteeing differential privacy. The optimal schematic design of DP-PASGD
that maximizes the learning performance while satisfying the limits on resource
cost and privacy loss is formulated as an optimization problem, and an
approximate solution method based on the convergence analysis of DP-PASGD is
developed to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Numerical results
based on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed DP-PASGD
scheme.

feedback) of the self-consistent evolution of molecular clouds (MCs) undergoing
global hierarchical collapse (GHC), to study the effect of the feedback on the
structural and kinematic properties of the gas and the stellar clusters formed
in the clouds. During this early stage, the evolution of the two simulations is
very similar (implying that the feedback from low mass stars does not affect
the cloud-scale evolution significantly) and the star-forming region accretes
faster than it can convert gas to stars, causing the instantaneous measured
star formation efficiency (SFE) to remain low even in the absence of
significant feedback. Afterwards, the ionising feedback first destroys the
filamentary supply to star-forming hubs and ultimately removes the gas from it,
thus first reducing the star formation (SF) and finally halting it. The
ionising feedback also affects the initial kinematics and spatial distribution
of the forming stars, because the gas being dispersed continues to form stars,
which inherit its motion. In the non-feedback simulation, the groups remain
highly compact and do not mix, while in the run with feedback, the gas
dispersal causes each group to expand, and the cluster expansion thus consists
of the combined expansion of the groups. Most secondary star-forming sites
around the main hub are also present in the non-feedback run, implying a
primordial rather than triggered nature. We do find one example of a peripheral
star-forming site that appears only in the feedback run, thus having a
triggered origin. However, this appears to be the exception rather than the
rule, although this may be an artifact of our simplified radiative transfer
scheme.

high cost such that they are far from being implemented in a lot of

CNT consisting of spin and orbital degrees of freedom give rise to the SU(4)
Kondo effect. We revisit the universal scaling behavior of the SU(4)
conductance for quarter- and half-filling in a wide temperature range. We find
that the filling dependence of the universal scaling behavior at low
temperatures $T$ can be explained clearly with an extended Fermi-liquid theory.
This theory clarifies that a $T^{2}$ coefficient of conductance becomes zero at
quarter-filling whereas the coefficient at half-filling is finite. We also
study a field-induced crossover from the SU(4) to SU(2) Kondo state observed at
the half-filled CNT dot. The crossover is caused by the matching of the spin
and orbital Zeeman splittings, which lock two levels among the four at the
Fermi level even in magnetic fields $B$. We find that the conductance shows the
SU($4$) scaling behavior at $\mu_{B}B<k_{B}T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$ and it
exhibits the SU($2$) universality at $\mu_{B}B\gg k_{B}T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$,
where $T_{K}^{\mathrm{SU(4)}}$ is the SU($4$) Kondo temperature. To clarify how
the excited states evolve along the SU(4) to SU(2) crossover, we also calculate
the spectral function. The results show that the Kondo resonance width of the
two states locked at the Fermi level becomes sharper with increasing fields.
The spectral peaks of the other two levels moving away from the Fermi level

developments in layer deposition techniques that have enabled the fabrication

this method, is that it also provides high-resolution and aberration-free
projection images of extended specimens. We report on three separate
experiments using this method, where we have resolved ray path angles to within

does not require a high degree of coherence, making it suitable for lab based

$0\leq S(t)\leq 1$. Previous work has invoked kinetic and magnetic
complexities, associated with velocity and magnetic fields ${\bf u(x}, t)$ and
${\bf B(x}, t)$, to study magnetic reconnection and diffusion in turbulent and
magnetized fluids. In this paper, using the coarse-grained momentum equation,
we argue that the fluid jets associated with magnetic reconnection events at an
arbitrary scale $l$ in the turbulence inertial range are predominantly driven
by the Lorentz force ${\bf{N}}_l=({\bf j\times B})_l-{\bf j}_l\times {\bf
B}_l$. This force, is induced by the subscale currents and is analogous to the
turbulent electromotive force ${\cal E}_l=({\bf u\times B})_l-{\bf u}_l\times
{\bf B}_l$ in dynamo theories. Typically, high (low) magnetic complexities
during reconnection imply large (small) spatial gradients for the magnetic
field, i.e., strong (weak) Lorentz forces ${\bf N}_l$. Reconnection launches
jets of fluid, hence the rate of change of kinetic complexity is expected to
strongly correlate with the power injected by the Lorentz force ${\bf N}_l$. We
test this prediction using an incompressible, homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulation and associate it with previous results. It follows that the
stronger (weaker) the turbulence, the more (less) complex the magnetic field

$g_{\Xi_{bb} \Xi_{bb} \pi}$. It is observed that the values of the couplings

enriches people's entertainment experiences and social interactions. However,
the popularity pattern of an individual micro-video still remains elusive among
the researchers. One of the major challenges is that the potential popularity
of a micro-video tends to fluctuate under the impact of various external
factors, which makes it full of uncertainties. In addition, since micro-videos
are mainly uploaded by individuals that lack professional techniques, multiple
types of noise could exist that obscure useful information. In this paper, we
propose a multimodal variational encoder-decoder (MMVED) framework for
micro-video popularity prediction tasks. MMVED learns a stochastic Gaussian
embedding of a micro-video that is informative to its popularity level while
preserves the inherent uncertainties simultaneously. Moreover, through the
optimization of a deep variational information bottleneck lower-bound (IBLBO),
the learned hidden representation is shown to be maximally expressive about the
popularity target while maximally compressive to the noise in micro-video
features. Furthermore, the Bayesian product-of-experts principle is applied to
the multimodal encoder, where the decision for information keeping or
discarding is made comprehensively with all available modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on a public dataset and a dataset we collect from Xigua
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMVED framework.

source with high repetition rates, which can enable many applications such as
high-speed quantum communication and quantum information processing. Ideally,
such single photon sources would then require a large on-chip photon extraction
decay rate, namely the rate of excited photons coupled into nanofibers or
waveguides, over a broad spectral range. However, this goal has remained
elusive till date. Here we propose a feasible scheme to enhance the on-chip
photon extraction decay rate of quantum emitters, through the tilting of the
optical axis of hyperbolic metamaterials with respect to the end-facet of
nanofibers. Importantly, the revealed scheme is applicable to arbitrarily
orientated quantum emitters over a broad spectral range, e.g., up to ~80 nm for
visible light. The underlying physics relies on the emerging unique feature of
hyperbolic metamaterials if their optical axis is judiciously tilted. That is,
their supported high-k (i.e., wavevector) hyperbolic eigenmodes, which are
intrinsically confined inside them if their optical axis is un-tilted, can now
become momentum-matched with the guided modes of nanofibers, and more
importantly, they can safely couple into nanofibers almost without reflection.

Solar Ring mission will be the first attempt to routinely monitor and study the
Sun and inner heliosphere from a full 360-degree perspective in the ecliptic

six spacecraft, grouped in three pairs, on a sub-AU orbit around the Sun. The
two spacecraft in each group are separated by about 30 degrees and every two
groups by about 120 degrees. This configuration with necessary science payloads

photospheric vector magnetic field with unambiguity, (2) provide 360-degree
maps of the Sun and the inner heliosphere routinely, and (3) resolve the solar
wind structures at multiple scales and multiple longitudes. With these

the origin of solar eruptions, the origin of solar wind structures and the
origin of severe space weather events. The successful accomplishment of the

brings in plenty of false positives. To avoid such a dilemma, this paper
proposes a novel Representative Region NMS approach leveraging the less
occluded visible parts, effectively removing the redundant boxes without
bringing in many false positives. To acquire the visible parts, a novel
Paired-Box Model (PBM) is proposed to simultaneously predict the full and
visible boxes of a pedestrian. The full and visible boxes constitute a pair
serving as the sample unit of the model, thus guaranteeing a strong
correspondence between the two boxes throughout the detection pipeline.
Moreover, convenient feature integration of the two boxes is allowed for the
better performance on both full and visible pedestrian detection tasks.
Experiments on the challenging CrowdHuman and CityPersons benchmarks
sufficiently validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on pedestrian

developed in Java. However, developers can now write Android applications using
a new programming language: Kotlin, which Google adopted in 2017 as an official
programming language for developing Android apps. Since then, Android
developers have been able to: a) start writing Android applications from
scratch using Kotlin, b) evolve their existing Android applications written in
Java by adding Kotlin code (possible thanks to the interoperability between the
two languages), or c) migrate their Android apps from Java to Kotlin. This
paper aims to study this last case. We conducted a qualitative study to find
out why Android developers have migrated Java code to Kotlin and to bring
together their experiences about the process, in order to identify the main
difficulties they have faced. To execute the study, we first identified commits
from open-source Android projects that have migrated Java code to Kotlin. Then,
we emailed the developers that wrote those migrations. We thus obtained
information from 98 developers who had migrated code from Java to Kotlin. This
paper presents the main reasons identified by the study for performing the
migration. We found that developers migrated Java code to Kotlin in order to
access programming language features (e.g., extension functions, lambdas, smart
casts) that are not available with Java for Android development, and to obtain
safer code (i.e., avoid null-pointer exceptions). We also identified research
directions that the research community could focus on in order to help
developers to improve the experience of migrating their Java applications to
Kotlin.

system may be assumed to follow a certain distribution, meaning that different
end users will experience different conditions. On the other hand, drawing from
the results of subjective user studies, we know that user diversity leads to
distributions of user scores for any given test conditions (in this case
referring to the QoS parameters of interest). Our previous studies have shown
that to correctly derive various QoE metrics (e.g., Mean Opinion Score (MOS),
quantiles, probability of users rating ""good or better"", etc.) in a system
under given conditions, there is a need to consider rating distributions
obtained from user studies, which are often times not available. In this paper
we extend these findings to show how to approximate user rating distributions
given a QoS-to-MOS mapping function and second order statistics. Such a user
rating distribution may then be combined with a QoS distribution observed in a
system to finally derive corresponding distributions of QoE scores. We provide
two examples to illustrate this process: 1) analytical results using a Web QoE
model relating waiting times to QoE, and 2) numerical results using
measurements relating packet losses to video stall pattern, which are in turn
mapped to QoE estimates. The results in this paper provide a solution to the
problem of understanding the QoE distribution in a system, in cases where the
necessary data is not directly available in the form of models going beyond the
MOS, or where the full details of subjective experiments are not available.

tools to quantify the scaling and reliability limits of FeFETs. In this work,
we propose to exploit an analytical expression for the Memory Window (MW, i.e.,
the difference between the threshold voltages due to polarization switching) as
a tool to: i) identify a universal scaling behavior of MW regardless of the
ferroelectric material; ii) predict endurance and explain its weak dependence
on writing conditions; iii) give an alternative explanation for MW being lower
than theoretical limits; and, based on this, iv) devise strategies to maximize
MW for a given ferroelectric thickness. According to these findings, the
characterization and analysis of MW would enable the systematic comparison of
next-generation FeFET based on emerging ferroelectric materials.

station. In particular it describes the layout design and the electromagnetic

side lobe pattern and beam shape (eg. smoothness, calibration models) and
presents the state of the art of our ability to measure the array performance

derived from the SKA L1 requirements, have evolved over the last years since
the LFAA PDR and the System Baseline Design. The SKA1 LOW field station has
been designed to meet those requirements and has therefore tracked their
evolution (eg. sensitivity requirements, array diameter, etc.). The
aforementioned requirements represent a very tight space with a desire for very
high sensitivity over a large frequency range (7 to 1) and wide field of view
(90 degrees cone around zenith) while keeping the station diameter to a
minimum, so as the filling factor but at the same time allowing for sufficient
space between antennas to allow for easy maintenances, amongst many others.
This results in a complex design.

fast radio burst FRB 180916, observed at 328 MHz with the Sardinia Radio

days from 2020 February 20 to 24 during a time interval of active radio
bursting, and detected the three bursts during the first hour of observations;
no more bursts were detected during the remaining ~ 30 hours. Simultaneous SRT
observations at 1548 MHz did not detect any bursts. Burst fluences are in the
range 37 to 13 Jy ms. No relevant scattering is observed for these bursts. We
also present the results of the multi-wavelength campaign we performed on FRB
180916, during the five days of the active window. Simultaneously with the SRT
observations, others with different time spans were performed with the Northern
Cross at 408 MHz, with XMM-Newton, NICER, INTEGRAL, AGILE, and with the TNG and
two optical telescopes in Asiago, which are equipped with fast photometers.
XMM-Newton obtained data simultaneously with the three bursts detected by the
SRT, and determined a luminosity upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of
~$10^{45}$ erg/s for the burst emission. AGILE obtained data simultaneously
with the first burst and determined a fluence upper limit in the MeV range for
millisecond timescales of $ 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$.Our results show that
absorption from the circumburst medium does not significantly affect the
emission from FRB 180916, thus limiting the possible presence of a
superluminous supernova around the source, and indicate that a cutoff for the
bursting mechanism, if present, must be at lower frequencies. Our
multi-wavelength campaign sensitively constrains the broadband emission from

accuracy in recovering unclothed human shape and pose from single images,
thanks to the availability of powerful statistical models, e.g. SMPL, learned
from a large number of body scans. In contrast, modeling and recovering clothed
human and 3D garments remains notoriously difficult, mostly due to the lack of
large-scale clothing models available for the research community. We propose to

Fashion3D contains 2078 models reconstructed from real garments, which covers
10 different categories and 563 garment instances. It provides rich annotations

real clothing deformations. To demonstrate the advantage of Deep Fashion3D, we
propose a novel baseline approach for single-view garment reconstruction, which
leverages the merits of both mesh and implicit representations. A novel
adaptable template is proposed to enable the learning of all types of clothing

Model Order Reduction (MOR) is used to reduce them to a lower dimension. Most
of the MOR algorithms require solving large sparse sequences of linear systems.
Since using direct methods for solving such systems does not scale well in time
with respect to the increase in the input dimension, efficient preconditioned
iterative methods are commonly used.
  In one of our previous works, we have shown substantial improvements by
reusing preconditioners for the parametric MOR (Singh et al. 2019). Here, we
had proposed techniques for both, the non-parametric and the parametric cases,
but had applied them only to the latter. We have four main contributions here.
First, we demonstrate that preconditioners can be reused more effectively in
the non-parametric case as compared to the parametric one because of the lack
of parameters in the former. Second, we show that reusing preconditioners is an
art and it needs to be fine-tuned for the underlying MOR algorithm. Third, we
describe the pitfalls in the algorithmic implementation of reusing
preconditioners. Fourth, and final, we demonstrate this theory on a real life
industrial problem (of size 1.2 million), where savings of upto 64% in the
total computation time is obtained by reusing preconditioners. In absolute
terms, this leads to a saving of 5 days.

Compared with the current substitute attacks, imitation attacks can use less

the basis of the hypothesis that type II GCs may have an extragalactic origin

cluster type correlates mainly with relative age. The cause of this relation
was further investigated finding that more metal-rich type II clusters, also
appear to be younger and more distant from the Galactic centre. A depletion of
type II clusters for positive values of Galactic coordinate Z was also
observed, with no type II clusters detected above Z$\sim2$ kpc. Type II cluster

Galaxy up to a large radius. In this work, we use the directly observable
line-of-sight velocities to test if the dynamics of the globular cluster
population is consistent with an assumed axisymmetric gravitational potential
of the Milky Way. For this, we numerically compute the phase space distribution
of the globular cluster population where the orbits are either oriented
randomly or co-/counter- rotating with respect to the stellar disk. Then we
compare the observed position and line-of-sight velocity distribution of $\sim$
150 globular clusters with that of the models. We found that, for the adopted
mass model, the co-rotating scenario is the favored model based on various
statistical tests. We do the analysis with and without the GCs associated to
the progenitors of early merger events. This analysis can be extended in the
near future to include precise and copious data to better constrain the

complete six-dimensional phase space information is needed. To this end, we
complemented positions and proper motions from the second data release of {\it

state-of-the-art model spectra and a tailored analysis strategy. The resulting

subsequent kinematic investigation to obtain as complete a picture as possible.
The combination of projected rotational velocity, position in the Kiel diagram,

data are still not precise enough to constrain the place of origin for 19
program stars, we identified eight objects that either come from the outer rim
of the Galactic disk or not from the disk at all, along with ten that
presumably stem from the Galactic disk. For almost all of those 18 targets with
more or less well-constrained spatial origin, the Galactic center (GC) is
disqualified as a possible place of origin. The most notable exception is B576,
the origin of which coincides extremely well with the GC when assuming a blue
horizontal branch (BHB) nature for it. HVS$\,$22 is by far the most extreme

autonomously navigates towards. A user study (37 participants) was conducted to
examine the efficacy of this control strategy when compared to direct control,
both with and without a communication delay. The results of the experiment
showed that participants were able to learn how to use the novel system
quickly, and the majority of participants reported a preference for waypoint

spread in a given population is developed. It enables the identification of the
key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in
terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended
to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by
Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the
initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of
infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a
`retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the
effectiveness of the control policies adopted.
  The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python
code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They
substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and
adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing
individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as `social/physical
distancing' and population density reduction by strict quarantining are
essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the

reduced to a nonlocal scalar Ginzburg-Landau equation. We derive an integral

challenging yet meaningful task and has been applied in many applications such

crowd counting is particularly prominent due to its specific significance to
social security and development. Fortunately, the development of the techniques
for crowd counting can be generalized to other related fields such as vehicle
counting and environment survey, if without taking their characteristics into
account. Therefore, many researchers are devoting to crowd counting, and many
excellent works of literature and works have spurted out. In these works, they
are must be helpful for the development of crowd counting. However, the
question we should consider is why they are effective for this task. Limited by
the cost of time and energy, we cannot analyze all the algorithms. In this
paper, we have surveyed over 220 works to comprehensively and systematically
study the crowd counting models, mainly CNN-based density map estimation
methods. Finally, according to the evaluation metrics, we select the top three
performers on their crowd counting datasets and analyze their merits and
drawbacks. Through our analysis, we expect to make reasonable inference and
prediction for the future development of crowd counting, and meanwhile, it can
also provide feasible solutions for the problem of object counting in other
fields. We provide the density maps and prediction results of some mainstream

the acoustical vortex tweezer and levitation devices. We discuss how the beam

first optimized variant applies state-of-the-art optimization techniques by
vectorizing loops, improving the data layout and using Loop-over-GEMM to
perform tensor contractions via highly optimized matrix multiplication
functions provided by the LIBXSMM library. We show that memory stalls due to a
memory footprint exceeding our L2 cache size hindered the vectorization gains.
We therefore introduce a new kernel that applies a sum factorization approach
to reduce the kernel's memory footprint and improve its cache locality. With
the L2 cache bottleneck removed, we were able to exploit additional
vectorization opportunities, by introducing a hybrid
Array-of-Structure-of-Array data layout that solves the data layout conflict

implement PDE-specific terms.
  With this last kernel, evaluated in a benchmark simulation at high polynomial

the recent years in the field of biomedical imaging and disease detection.
However, imaging through highly diffusive medium is a challenge and stability
is always an issue due to the inverse problem. Here a non-linear continous wave
(CW) semi-analytic reconstruction method is discussed that used curved-beam
paths for tomographic imaging with no assumption on inclusion, unlike iterative
methods.The non-linear Rosenbrock's function is used to approximate the paths
followed by majority photons as curved ones. The modified Beer-Lambert Law
(MBLL) in proposed differntial form is used to calculate the absorption
coefficient of all the avilable photon paths. The computed values are
back-projected along these channels and serve as the basis for image
reconstruction without solving the inverse problem. For three-dimensional (3-D)
imaging, measurements at three different depths covering the entire depth of
the phantom are taken. These slices are stacked together followed by
interpolation to form the volumetric image of the phantom to complete the
tomographic imaging in its true sense. Numerical simulations, wax phantom
experiments with different geometries and contrast are carried out with
satisfactory results. This semi-analytic reconstruction method is simple and
efficient and is suitable for real-time applications that reqiure fast
absorption image reconstruction. The method is compared with the Greedy
algorithms for further validation. Also, different performance evaluation

of functions of type $K_{x_i}$ and then in terms of the projection $\pi^n_x$ on
$\mathrm{Span}\{K_{x_i} \}^n_{i=1}$, for random sequences of points $x=(x_i)_i$
in the base space $X$. Previous results demonstrate that, for sequences of
points $(x_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ constituting a so-called \emph{uniqueness set}, the
orthogonal projections $\pi^n_x$ to $\mathrm{Span}\{K_{x_i} \}^n_{i=1}$
converge in the strong operator topology to the identity operator. The main
result shows that, for a given probability measure $P$, letting $P_K$ be the
measure defined by $\mathrm{d} P_K(x)=K(x,x)\mathrm{d} P(x)$, $x\in X$, and
$\mathrm{H}_P$ denote the reproducing kernel Hilbert space that is the operator
range of the nonexpansive operator \begin{equation*} L^2(X;P_K)\ni
\lambda\mapsto L_{P,K}\lambda:=\int_X \lambda(x)K_x\mathrm{d} P(x)\in
\mathcal{H}, \end{equation*} where the integral exists in the Bochner sense,
under the assumption that $\mathcal{H}_P$ is dense in $\mathcal{H}$ any
sequence of points sampled independently from $P$ yields a uniqueness set with
probability $1$. This result improves on previous error bounds in weaker norms,
such as uniform or $L^p$ norms, which yield only convergence in probability and
not almost certain convergence. Two examples that show the applicability of
this result to a uniform distribution on a compact interval and to the Hardy
space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ are presented as well.

carried out through topology-driven recursive node content aggregation for

A pure topology-driven feature aggregation approach between unaligned

result. In this paper, we advocate co-alignment graph convolutional learning
(CoGL), by aligning the topology and content networks to maximize consistency.
Our theme is to force the topology network to respect underlying content
network while simultaneously optimizing the content network to respect the
topology for optimized representation learning. Given a network, CoGL first
reconstructs a content network from node features then co-aligns the content

matrix affected by small and random perturbations on the off-diagonal.
  Notably, a recent work [1] reported that, while cooperation is sustained by
perturbations acting on the main diagonal, a less clear scenario emerges when
perturbations act on the off-diagonal. Thus, the second case represents the
core of this investigation, aimed at completing the description of the effects
that payoff perturbations have on the dynamics of evolutionary games. Our
results, achieved by analysing the proposed model under a variety of
configurations, as different update rules, suggest that off-diagonal
perturbations actually constitute a non-trivial form of noise. In particular,
the most interesting effects are detected near the phase transition, as
perturbations tend to move the strategy distribution towards non-ordered states
of equilibrium, supporting cooperation when defection is pervading the
population, and supporting defection in the opposite case. To conclude, we
identified a form of noise that, under controlled conditions, could be used to
enhance cooperation, and greatly delay its extinction.

nonempty interior). Given a point $p$ in the interior of $K$, a hyperplane $h$
passing through $p$ is called barycentric if $p$ is the barycenter of $K \cap
h$. In 1961, Gr\""{u}nbaum raised the question whether, for every $K$, there
exists an interior point $p$ through which there are at least $n+1$ distinct
barycentric hyperplanes. Two years later, this was seemingly resolved
affirmatively by showing that this is the case if $p=p_0$ is the point of
maximal depth in $K$. However, while working on a related question, we noticed
that one of the auxiliary claims in the proof is incorrect. Here, we provide a
counterexample; this re-opens Gr\""unbaum's question. It follows from known
results that for $n \geq 2$, there are always at least three distinct
barycentric cuts through the point $p_0 \in K$ of maximal depth. Using tools
related to Morse theory we are able to improve this bound: four distinct
barycentric cuts through $p_0$ are guaranteed if $n \geq 3$.

ignore the temporal-semantic relevance and spatio-temporal evolution of the

social-sensor cloud (SocSen) service composition approach to form tapestry
scenes for scene analysis. The novelty lies in utilising images and image
meta-information to bypass expensive traditional image processing techniques to
reconstruct scenes. Metadata, such as geolocation, time and angle of view of an
image are modelled as non-functional attributes of a SocSen service. Our major
contribution lies on proposing a context and direction-aware spatio-temporal

semantically similar services to compose the best available SocSen services.
Analytical results based on real datasets are presented to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach.

scintillating fibers embedded in a mix of tungsten powder and epoxy. The fibers

function of position and input energy. The energy resolution of the EMCal
prototype was obtained after applying a position dependent energy correction
and a beam profile correction. Two separate position dependent corrections were
considered. The EMCal energy resolution was found to be $\sigma(E)/\langle
E\rangle = 3.5(0.1) \oplus 13.3(0.2)/\sqrt{E}$ based on the hodoscope position
dependent correction, and $\sigma(E)/\langle E\rangle = 3.0(0.1) \oplus

novel distributed averaging algorithms which operate exclusively on quantized

integrals (ISIs) in the context of numerical integration of Ito SDEs and
non-commutative semilinear SPDEs with nonlinear multiplicative trace class
noise. The presented monograph opens up a new direction in researching of ISIs.
For the first time we successfully use the generalized multiple Fourier series
converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ for the expansion
and strong approximation of Ito ISIs of multiplicity $k,$ $k\in{\bf N}$
(Chapter 1). This result is adapted for Stratonovich ISIs of multiplicities 1
to 6 (Chapter 2) as well as for some other types of ISIs (Chapter 1). Theorem
on expansion of Stratonovich ISIs of multiplicity $k$ ($k\in{\bf N}$) based on
multiple Fourier-Legendre series as well as multiple trigonometric Fourier
series is proved under condition of convergence of trace series (Chapter 2).
The integration order replacement technique for the class of Ito ISIs has been
introduced (Chapter 3). This result is generalized for the class of ISIs with
respect to martingales. We derived the exact and approximate expressions for
the mean-square error of approximation of Ito ISIs of multiplicity $k$,
$k\in{\bf N}$ (Chapter 1). Furthermore, we provided a significant practical
material (Chapter 5) devoted to the expansions and approximations of specific
Ito and Stratonovich ISIs of multiplicities 1 to 6 from the Taylor-Ito and
Taylor-Stratonovich expansions (Chapter 4) using the system of Legendre
polynomials and the system of trigonometric functions. The methods formulated
in this book have been compared with some existing methods (Chapter 6). The
results of Chapter 1 were applied (Chapter 7) to the approximation of ISIs of
multiplicity $k,$ $k\in{\bf N}$ with respect to the $Q$-Wiener process.

software for solar-physics research. Although 82% of respondents work with data
from space-based or ground-based missions, some of which (e.g. the Solar
Dynamics Observatory and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope) produce terabytes of

the uniform discrete Gronwall lemma. A comparison with the estimates for the
continuous-in-time dynamical system reveals that the classical implicit Euler

access (DMCA) problem in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks with
fast time-varying channels wherein the channel parameters are unknown. The
proposed learning-based scheme can maintain near-optimal performance for a long
time, even in the sharp changing channels. This scheme greatly reduces
processing delay, and effectively alleviates the error due to decision lag,
which is cased by the non-immediacy of the information acquisition and
processing. We first propose a psychology-based personalized quality of service
model after introducing the network model with unknown channel parameters and
the streaming model. Then, two access criteria are presented for the living
streaming model and the buffered streaming model. Their corresponding
optimization problems are also formulated. The optimization problems are solved
by learning-based DMCA scheme, which combines the recurrent neural network with
deep reinforcement learning. In the learning-based DMCA scheme, the agent
mainly invokes the proposed prediction-based deep deterministic policy gradient
algorithm as the learning algorithm. As a novel technical paradigm, our scheme
has strong universality, since it can be easily extended to solve other
problems in wireless communications. The real channel data-based simulation
results validate that the performance of the learning-based scheme approaches
that derived from the exhaustive search when making a decision at each
time-slot, and is superior to the exhaustive search method when making a
decision at every few time-slots.

anisotropic matter contents along with the well-known Gaussian and Lorentizian
distributions of string theory. For the sake of simplicity in analytic
discussions, we take a specific form of $f(R,T)$ function given by
$f(R,T)=R+\lambda T$. For both these non-commutative distributions, we get
exact solutions in terms of exponential and hypergeometric functions. By taking
some suitable choice of free parameters, we investigate different interesting
aspects of these wormhole solutions graphically. We also explored the stability
of these wormhole models using equilibrium condition. It can be concluded that
the obtained solutions are stable and physically viable satisfying the wormhole
existence criteria. Lastly, we discuss the constraints for positivity of the
active gravitational mass for both these distributions.

only facility for regulation of water flow down Shire River, which has a major
influence on water levels in Lake Malawi. In this article a hydrological model
for optimized operation of the Kamuzu Barrage called the Kamuzu Barrage
Operation Model (KABOM) is presented. This model is a tool for water resource
management at the Kamuzu Barrage based on stochastic hydrology. The stochastic
model uses water level readings at Lake Malawi and at the Shire River near
Liwonde stretching from January 1900 to date. By using historical rating curves
at Liwonde, and developing an updated post-2003 flood rating curve, the model
can calculate flow at Liwonde for the entire period. The model simulates
available water budgets for a range of probabilities based on the Lake Level
and flow record over the past 115 years, plus available data on local inflows
to the Shire River from its tributaries. The results provide a basis for
choosing a release strategy in Kamuzu Barrage, which is used in optimizing the
release at the barrage on daily basis. Resulting quantiles display a strong
seasonal variation, highest Freewater forecasts within February and March in
the rainy season, and the lowest months of June and July in dry season. The
results for simulation are controlled against actual Freewater values in the
period of December 2016 to October 2017, which demonstrates a satisfactory
validation

existing systems. Based on a Design Science Research approach, we first perform
a user experience testing in an exemplary corporate office building.
Furthermore, we build a mechanism to gather user feedback on environmental
comfort. Based on this, we build a machine learning model including different
IoT data sources (e.g. building data and weather data) with an average
coefficient of determination of 41.5%. Using these insights, we are able to
suggest current individual comfort zones within the building and help employees
to make better informed decisions on where to sit or what to wear, to feel
comfortable and work productively. Therefore, we contribute to the body of
knowledge by proposing a user-centric design within a cross-disciplinary
context on the basis of analytical processes.

that detectors large enough for this application are cost prohibitive, likely
