two black holes in a binary system fill our observable universe, bearing with
them the underlying theory of gravity driving their process. One compelling
alternative theory of gravity -- known as Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity
motivated by string theory -- describes the presence of an additional dilaton
scalar field coupled directly to higher orders of the curvature, effectively
describing a ""fifth force"" interaction and the emission of scalar dipole
radiation between two scalarized black holes. Most previous studies focused on
considering only the leading correction to the inspiral portion of the binary
black hole waveforms. In our recent paper, we carried out
inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests in this string-inspired gravity by
including corrections to both the inspiral and ringdown portions, as well as
those to the mass and spin of remnant black holes, valid to quadratic order in
spin. We here extend the analysis by directly computing bounds on the
theoretical coupling constant using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform
rather than treating the inspiral and merger-ringdown portions separately. We
also consider the corrections valid to quartic order in spin to justify the
validity of black hole's slow-rotation approximation. We find the quasinormal
mode corrections to the waveform to be particularly important for high-mass
events such as GW170729, in which the dilaton fields' small-coupling
approximation fails without such effects included. We also show that future
space-based and multiband gravitational-wave observations have the potential to
go beyond existing bounds on the theory. The bounds presented here are
comparable to those found in via the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency
tests.

significant enhancements extend out to 3D separations of 280 kpc in the (302.6

seen throughout the redshift range explored ($0 \leq z < 1$), with the strength
of the enhancements decreasing with increasing redshift for galaxies with close

separately consider 2D projected distances between galaxies in IllustrisTNG. We

policy across the network. We additionally propose using multi-point

modeling and aligning the structure of visual-semantic context and translating
across different modalities. We term this process as structure completion,
which is realized by multi-grained reasoning blocks in our model. Another
challenge relates to the unimodal biases, which occurs when the model generates
plausible results without using the textual description. This can be true since
the annotated captions for an image are often semantically equivalent in
existing datasets, and thus there is only one paired text for a masked image in
training. We devise an unsupervised unpaired-creation learning path besides the

crystal structure, phonon structure, and electronic properties for 0.0 $\le$ x
$\le$ 0.5. Our electron diffraction studies reveal strong Bragg spots at
reciprocal lattice positions forbidden by ABC stacking, possibly resulting from
stacking faults, or a superlattice. The c-axis lattice parameter varies
monotonically with x for 0 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.2, but drops precipitously for
higher x. Similarly, Raman phonon modes $A^2_{1g}$ and $E_g$ soften
monotonically for 0 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.2 but harden sharply for x $\gt$ 0.2. This
indicates that Cu likely intercalates up to x $\sim$0.2, followed by partial
site-substitutions at higher values. The resulting strain makes the 0.2 $\lt$ x
$\lt$ 0.3 region susceptible to instabilities and distortions. Our results
point toward the presence of an incommensurate CDW above Td = 220 K. This work
strengthens prevalent thought that intercalation contributes significantly to
instabilities in the lattice and charge degrees of freedom in layered
chalcogenides.

globally-in-time the nonlinear interactions of localized waves in this setting.
This problem arises when studying localized perturbations around (possibly
non-decaying) special solutions of evolution PDEs, and trying to control the
projection onto the continuous spectrum of the nonlinear radiative
interactions. One of our main tools is the Fourier transform adapted to the
Schr\""odinger operator $H=-\Delta+V$, which we employ at a nonlinear level. As
a first step we analyze the spatial integral of the product of three
generalized eigenfunctions of $H$, and determine the precise structure of its
singularities. This leads to study bilinear operators with certain singular
kernels, for which we derive product estimates of Coifman-Meyer type. This
analysis can then be combined with multilinear harmonic analysis tools and the
study of oscillations to obtain (distorted Fourier space analogues of) weighted
estimates for dispersive and wave equations. As a first application we consider
the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation in $3$d in the presence of large decaying
potential with no bound states, and with a $u^2$ non-linearity. The main
difficulty is that a quadratic nonlinearity in $3$d is critical with respect to
the Strauss exponent; moreover, this nonlinearity has non-trivial fully
coherent interactions even when $V=0$. We prove quantitative global-in-time
bounds and scattering for small solutions.

distance provides a more informative mean of comparison between reduced density
matrices when compared to any other Schatten $n$-distance, normalized or not.
In particular, as noticed in earlier works, it provides a way to bound other
correlation functions in a precise manner, i.e., providing both lower and upper
bounds. Additionally, we show that two close reduced density matrices, i.e.
with zero trace distance for large sizes, can have very different modular
Hamiltonians. This means that, in terms of describing how two states are close
to each other, it is more informative to compare their reduced density matrices
rather than the corresponding modular Hamiltonians. After setting this
framework, we consider the ground states for infinite and periodic XX spin
chain and critical Ising chain. We provide robust numerical evidence that the
trace distance between the lattice BW reduced density matrix and the exact one
goes to zero as $\ell^{-2}$ for large length of the interval $\ell$. This
provides strong constraints on the difference between the corresponding
entanglement entropies and correlation functions. Our results indicate that
discretized BW reduced density matrices reproduce exact entanglement entropies
and correlation functions of local operators in the limit of large subsystem

discrimination and calibration. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve is widely used for evaluating model discrimination. When evaluating the
performance of a risk prediction model in a new sample, the shape of the ROC
curve is affected by both case-mix and the postulated model. Further, compared
to discrimination, evaluating calibration has not received the same level of
attention. Commonly used methods for model calibration involve subjective
specification of smoothing or grouping. Leveraging the familiar ROC framework,
we introduce the model-based ROC (mROC) curve to assess the calibration of a
pre-specified model in a new sample. mROC curve is the ROC curve that should be
observed if a pre-specified model is calibrated in the sample. We show the
empirical ROC and mROC curves for a sample converge asymptotically if the model
is calibrated in that sample. As a consequence, the mROC curve can be used to
assess visually the effect of case-mix and model mis-calibration. Further, we
propose a novel statistical test for calibration that does not require any
smoothing or grouping. Simulations support the adequacy of the test. A case
study puts these developments in a practical context. We conclude that mROC can
easily be constructed and used to evaluate the effect of case-mix and model
calibration on the ROC plot, thus adding to the utility of ROC curve analysis
in the evaluation of risk prediction models. R code for the proposed

the partial-volume effects that arise due to low system resolution and finite

a mixture of tissue classes. Conventional segmentation methods are typically
designed to assign each voxel in the image as belonging to a certain tissue
class. Thus, these methods are inherently limited in modeling tissue-fraction
effects. To address the challenge of accounting for partial-volume effects, and
in particular, tissue-fraction effects, we propose a Bayesian approach to
tissue-fraction estimation for oncological PET segmentation. Specifically, this
Bayesian approach estimates the posterior mean of fractional volume that the
tumor occupies within each voxel of the image. The proposed method, implemented
using a deep-learning-based technique, was first evaluated using clinically
realistic 2-D simulation studies with known ground truth, in the context of
segmenting the primary tumor in PET images of patients with lung cancer. The
evaluation studies demonstrated that the method accurately estimated the
tumor-fraction areas and significantly outperformed widely used conventional
PET segmentation methods, including a U-net-based method, on the task of
segmenting the tumor. In addition, the proposed method was relatively
insensitive to partial-volume effects and yielded reliable tumor segmentation
for different clinical-scanner configurations. The method was then evaluated
using clinical images of patients with stage IIB/III non-small cell lung cancer
from ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 multi-center clinical trial. Here, the results showed
that the proposed method significantly outperformed all other considered

quantum field theory and quantum gravity (formulated as metastring theory) and
various implications for the problems of dark matter and dark energy. The first
point concerns the new understanding of quantum theory via the concept of
quantum (modular) spacetime endowed with manifest non-locality that is
consistent with causality. This view implies the consistency of the fundamental
length and Lorentz symmetry, based on the principle of relative (observer
dependent) locality. The geometry of such quantum spacetime is encoded in the
new concept of Born geometry. This in turn leads to a novel understanding of
quantum field theory in a manifestly bi-local representation endowed with
metaparticle quanta. A fully dynamical quantum spacetime, with a dynamical Born
geometry, leads to quantum gravity (a quantum theory of dynamical geometry of
quantum non-locality) in the guise of metastring theory. This generic
formulation of string theory implies a radiatively stable positive cosmological
constant (viewed as a curvature of the dual spacetime) as a model of dark
energy in the observed classical spacetime, as well as metaparticle quanta (the
zero modes of the metastring) as the natural quanta of dark matter in this
approach.

velocity of the laser pulse has a profound impact on the transverse size of
electron trajectories. The transverse size remains constant below a threshold
energy that depends on the degree of the superluminosity and it increases with
the electron energy above the threshold. This increase can cause electron
losses in tightly focused laser pulses. We show using 3D particle-in-cell
simulations that the electron energy gain can be significantly increased by
increasing laser power at fixed intensity due to the increased electron
confinement. This finding makes a strong case for designing experiments at

after his Tesla Model X crashed into a highway barrier in Mountain View,
California. Tesla immediately disavowed responsibility for the accident. ""The
fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and
there was none here: [Mr. Huang] was well aware that the Autopilot was not
perfect [and the] only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang

manufacturers of the automated vehicles involved in the six fatal accidents to
date: the automated vehicle isn't perfect, the driver knew it wasn't perfect,
and if only the driver had been paying attention and heeded the vehicle's
warnings, the accident would never have occurred.
  However, as researchers focused on human-automation interaction in aviation
and military operations, we cannot help but wonder if there really are no
broken promises and no legal liabilities. Science has a critical role in
determining legal liability, and courts appropriately rely on scientists and
engineers to determine whether an accident, or harm, was foreseeable.
Specifically, a designer could be found liable if, at the time of the accident,
scientists knew there was a systematic relationship between the accident and
the designer's untaken precaution.

Paxos to EPaxos, a huge number of replication protocols have been proposed that
achieve high throughput and low latency. However, these protocols all have two
problems. First, they do not scale. Many protocols actually slow down when you
scale them, instead of speeding up. For example, increasing the number of
MultiPaxos acceptors increases quorum sizes and slows down the protocol.
Second, they are too complicated. This is not a secret; state machine
replication is notoriously difficult to understand.
  In this paper, we tackle both problems with a single solution: modularity. We
present Bipartisan Paxos (BPaxos), a modular state machine replication
protocol. Modularity yields high throughput via scaling. We note that while
many replication protocol components do not scale, some do. By modularizing
BPaxos, we are able to disentangle the two and scale the bottleneck components
to increase the protocol's throughput. Modularity also yields simplicity.
BPaxos is divided into a number of independent modules that can be understood
and proven correct in isolation.

nano-scale electrochemical and amphiphilic systems to mesoscale fluid, chemical
and biological media and to macro-scale vegetation and cloud patterns. Their
formation is usually due to a primary symmetry breaking of a uniform state to
stripes, often followed by secondary instabilities to form zigzag and
labyrinthine patterns. These secondary instabilities are well studied under
idealized conditions of an infinite domain, however, on finite domains, the
situation is more subtle since the unstable modes depend also on boundary
conditions. Using two prototypical models, the Swift-Hohenberg equation and the
forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, we consider bounded domains with no
flux boundary conditions transversal to the stripes, and reveal a distinct
mixed-mode instability that lies in between the classical zigzag and the
Eckhaus lines. This explains the stability of stripes in the mildly zigzag
unstable regime, and, after crossing the mixed-mode line, the evolution of
zigzag stripes in the bulk of the domain and the formation of defects near the
boundaries. The results are of particular importance for problems with large
time scale separation, such as bulk-heterojunction deformations in organic
photovoltaic and vegetation in semi-arid regions, where early temporal
transients may play an important role.

Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured
summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called ""metro maps"".
This was applied to several problem domains, where pattern mining was
necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a method for automatic creation
of metro maps of information obtained by Association Rule Mining and, thus,
spread its applicability to the other machine learning methods. Although the
proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core presents metro map
construction that is defined in the study as an optimization problem, which is
solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was applied to four
well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset. Visualizing the
resulted metro maps not only justifies that this is a suitable tool for
presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that they can tell
stories to users.

can tell what quantum black-box devices are doing by looking only at their

introduce a more general question: is it possible to self-test a theory, and,
in particular, quantum theory? More precisely, we ask whether within a
particular causal structure there are tasks that can only be performed in
theories that have the same correlations as quantum mechanics in any scenario.
We present a candidate task for such a correlation self-test and analyse it in
a range of generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs), showing that none of
these perform better than quantum theory. A generalisation of our results
showing that all non-quantum GPTs are strictly inferior to quantum mechanics
for this task would point to a new way to axiomatise quantum theory, and enable
an experimental test that simultaneously rules out such GPTs.

FEMs, based on a fixed background mesh computed once even if geometrical
changes are taking place. The sensitivity of the control problem is introduced
in terms of random domains, employing a Quasi-Monte Carlo method and
emphasizing a deterministic target state. The variational discretization

LISA response time and frequency dependencies in breaking degeneracies and
illustrate how degeneracy breaking unfolds over time. We also find that
restricting the merger-dominated signal to its dominant harmonic can make the

is too slow. The limitations imposed by such hardware make it an unlikely

  3-Dimensional Assistive Robotic Control","8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IROS 2020",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With increasing global age and disability assistive robots are becoming more
necessary, and brain computer interfaces (BCI) are often proposed as a solution
to understanding the intent of a disabled person that needs assistance. Most
frameworks for electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) BCI
control rely on the direct control of the robot in Cartesian space. However,
for 3-dimensional movement, this requires 6 motor imagery classes, which is a
difficult distinction even for more experienced BCI users. In this paper, we
present a simulated training and testing framework which reduces the number of
motor imagery classes to 4 while still grasping objects in three-dimensional
space. This is achieved through semi-autonomous eye-in-hand vision-based
control of the robotic arm, while the user-controlled BCI achieves movement to
the left and right, as well as movement toward and away from the object of
interest. Additionally, the framework includes a method of training a BCI
directly on the assistive robotic system, which should be more easily
transferrable to a real-world assistive robot than using a standard training
protocol such as Graz-BCI. Presented results do not consider real human EEG
data, but are rather shown as a baseline for comparison with future human data
and other improvements on the system.

(PlaNet), also referred to as PlaNet of the Bayesians (PlaNet-Bayes). There has
been a growing demand in model predictive control (MPC) in partially observable
environments in which complete information is unavailable because of, for
example, lack of expensive sensors. PlaNet is a promising solution to realize
such latent MPC, as it is used to train state-space models via model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL) and to conduct planning in the latent space.
However, recent state-of-the-art strategies mentioned in MBRR literature, such
as involving uncertainty into training and planning, have not been considered,
significantly suppressing the training performance. The proposed extension is
to make PlaNet uncertainty-aware on the basis of Bayesian inference, in which
both model and action uncertainty are incorporated. Uncertainty in latent
models is represented using a neural network ensemble to approximately infer
model posteriors. The ensemble of optimal action candidates is also employed to
capture multimodal uncertainty in the optimality. The concept of the action
ensemble relies on a general variational inference MPC (VI-MPC) framework and
its instance, probabilistic action ensemble with trajectory sampling (PaETS).
In this paper, we extend VI-MPC and PaETS, which have been originally
introduced in previous literature, to address partially observable cases. We
experimentally compare the performances on continuous control tasks, and
conclude that our method can consistently improve the asymptotic performance
compared with PlaNet.

scientific issue. It is of great significance in estimating the occurrence rate
of CBPs and studying their formation and evolution. Although the CBPs currently
discovered by the transit method are nearly coplanar, the true inclination
distribution of CBPs is still unknown. Previous researches on CBPs mostly
regarded them as an isolated binary-planet system, without considering the
birth environment of their host binaries. It is generally believed that almost
all stars are born in clusters. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the
impact of the close encounters of stars on the CBP systems. This article
discusses how the close encounters of fly-by stars affect the inclination of
CBP. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we found that CBPs in close
binary with a spacing of about 0.2 au are almost unaffected by star fly-bys.
Their orbits remain coplanar. However, when the spacing of the binary stars is
greater than 1 au, the 2-3 fly-bys of the intruding star can excite a
considerable inclination even for the CBP near the unstable boundary of the
binary. For the planets in the outer region, a single star fly-by can excite an
inclination to more than 5 degrees. Especially, CBPs in near polar or
retrograde orbits can naturally form through bianry-star encounters. If close
binaries are born in open clusters, our simulations suggest that there may be
high-inclination CBPs in binaries with spacing > 1 au.

parameters. We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a
photonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultra-small cavity in
a lithium niobate slab. This extends photonic inverse design to a whole new
class of simulations, and more broadly highlights the importance that automatic
differentiation could play in the future for tracking and optimizing
complicated physical models.

estimated power and accuracy for common analysis pipelines through simulation.
We varied subgroup size, number, separation (effect size), and covariance
structure. We then subjected generated datasets to dimensionality reduction
(none, multidimensional scaling, or UMAP) and cluster algorithms (k-means,
agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward or average linkage and
Euclidean or cosine distance, HDBSCAN). Finally, we compared the statistical
power of discrete (k-means), ""fuzzy"" (c-means), and finite mixture modelling
approaches (which include latent profile and latent class analysis). We found
that outcomes were driven by large effect sizes or the accumulation of many
smaller effects across features, and were unaffected by differences in
covariance structure. Sufficient statistical power was achieved with relatively
small samples (N=20 per subgroup), provided cluster separation is large
({\Delta}=4). Fuzzy clustering provided a more parsimonious and powerful
alternative for identifying separable multivariate normal distributions,
particularly those with slightly lower centroid separation ({\Delta}=3).
Overall, we recommend that researchers 1) only apply cluster analysis when
large subgroup separation is expected, 2) aim for sample sizes of N=20 to N=30

mappings to match joint distributions of two domains, occurs in many machine
learning and computer vision applications. This problem, however, is very
difficult due to two critical challenges: (i) it is often difficult to exploit
sufficient information from the joint distribution to conduct the matching;
(ii) this problem is hard to formulate and optimize. In this paper, relying on
optimal transport theory, we propose to address JDM problem by minimizing the
Wasserstein distance of the joint distributions in two domains. However, the
resultant optimization problem is still intractable. We then propose an
important theorem to reduce the intractable problem into a simple optimization
problem, and develop a novel method (called Joint Wasserstein Distribution
Matching (JWDM)) to solve it. In the experiments, we apply our method to
unsupervised image translation and cross-domain video synthesis. Both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superior performance
of our method over several state-of-the-arts.

$0.5\times0.5\; \mathrm{mm}^2$ and $0.225\times0.225\; \mathrm{mm}^2$ pixels
and Si detector designs with $0.5\times0.5\; \mathrm{mm}^2$ pixels of 30 and 60
mm active absorption length, with and without tungsten scatter blockers.
Monte-Carlo simulations of photon transport were used together with Gaussian
charge sharing models fitted to published data. Results: For detection in a 300
mm thick object at 120 kVp, the 0.5 mm and 0.225 mm pixel CdTe systems have
28-41 $\%$ and 5-29 $\%$ higher DQE, respectively, than the 60 mm Si system
with tungsten, whereas the corresponding numbers for two-material decomposition
are 2 $\%$ lower to 11 $\%$ higher DQE and 31-54 $\%$ lower DQE compared to Si.
We also show that combining these detectors with dual-spectrum acquisition is
beneficial. Conclusions: In the low-count-rate regime, CdTe detector systems
outperform the Si systems for detection tasks, while silicon outperforms one or
both of the CdTe systems for material decomposition.

attentions due to the rapid emergence of videos on the web. The current
dominant approach for this problem is to learn a joint embedding space to
measure cross-modal similarities. However, simple joint embeddings are
insufficient to represent complicated visual and textual details, such as
scenes, objects, actions and their compositions. To improve fine-grained
video-text retrieval, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Reasoning (HGR) model,
which decomposes video-text matching into global-to-local levels. To be
specific, the model disentangles texts into hierarchical semantic graph
including three levels of events, actions, entities and relationships across
levels. Attention-based graph reasoning is utilized to generate hierarchical
textual embeddings, which can guide the learning of diverse and hierarchical
video representations. The HGR model aggregates matchings from different
video-text levels to capture both global and local details. Experimental
results on three video-text datasets demonstrate the advantages of our model.
Such hierarchical decomposition also enables better generalization across
datasets and improves the ability to distinguish fine-grained semantic
differences.

compositionality. Second, to better exploit the full reasoning chain embodied

the use of available limited water resources. Irrigated agriculture is one of
the major consumers of freshwater. A large amount of water in irrigated
agriculture is wasted due to poor water management practices. To improve water
management in irrigated areas, models for estimation of future water
requirements are needed. Developing a model for forecasting irrigation water
demand can improve water management practices and maximise water productivity.
Data mining can be used effectively to build such models.
  In this study, we prepare a dataset containing information on suitable
attributes for forecasting irrigation water demand. The data is obtained from
three different sources namely meteorological data, remote sensing images and
water delivery statements. In order to make the prepared dataset useful for
demand forecasting and pattern extraction, we pre-process the dataset using a
novel approach based on a combination of irrigation and data mining knowledge.
We then apply and compare the effectiveness of different data mining methods
namely decision tree (DT), artificial neural networks (ANNs), systematically
developed forest (SysFor) for multiple trees, support vector machine (SVM),
logistic regression, and the traditional Evapotranspiration (ETc) methods and
evaluate the performance of these models to predict irrigation water demand.
Our experimental results indicate the usefulness of data pre-processing and the
effectiveness of different classifiers. Among the six methods we used, SysFor
produces the best prediction with 97.5% accuracy followed by a decision tree
with 96% and ANN with 95% respectively by closely matching the predictions with
actual water usage. Therefore, we recommend using SysFor and DT models for
irrigation water demand forecasting.

liquids. When a small fraction of particles in the supercooled liquid is made
heavier, they exhibit slower dynamics than the original particles and also make
the overall system slower. If one looks at the overlap correlation function to
quantify dynamics in the system, it has different behavior for the heavy and
the light particles. In particular, at the relaxation time of the overall
system, the degree of relaxation achieved by the heavier particles is lesser on
average than that achieved by the light particles. This difference in
relaxation however, goes down drastically as a crossover temperature, $T_0$, is
crossed. Below this crossover temperature, particles in the system have similar
relaxation times irrespective of their masses. This crossover temperature
depends on the fraction of the heavy particles and their masses. Next, we
isolate the effect of mass heterogeneity on the dynamics of supercooled liquids
and find that its effect increases monotonically with temperature. We also see
that the development of dynamical heterogeneity with decreasing temperature is
less dramatic for the system with impurities than for the pure system. Finally,
the introduction of heavy impurities can be seen as a way of reducing the
kinetic fragility of a supercooled liquid.

that the concept is fundamentally flawed and unphysical. We also analyze
experimental evidence concluding that there is no data supporting the need to
invoke such stabilization; rather, conventional models of ferroelectric
polarization switching suffice to account for the effects observed. We analyze
experimental evidence that at least in some of the model systems for which this
effect has been claimed, categorically rule out stabilized non-switching NC.
Microscopic measurements recently published as supporting non-switching
stabilized NC actually rule them out, since the ferroelectric in a stack
sandwiched between two dielectric layers was found to be in a mixed domain
state (high polarizations within each domain) rather than in the low
polarization state predicted by non-switching stabilized NC models.
Nonetheless, since stabilized NC (corresponding to a minimum in free energy) is
not physically impossible, it would be useful to move the research efforts to
investigating scenarios and systems in which this effect is possible and
expected and assess whether they are useful and practical for low power
electronics.

asynchronous setting involves a difficult multi-timescale decision problem, we
design a novel stochastic average gradient (SAG) based distributed algorithm

at a linear rate of $\mathcal{O}(c^k)$ where $c\in(0,1)$ and $k$ increases by
one no matter on which node updates. Finally, numerical experiments validate
that our method speeds up linearly with respect to the number of nodes, and is
robust to straggler nodes.

the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at high-redshift. The
GRB-DLAs (damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers) contain a large neutral hydrogen
column density, N(H I), and are observed against the GRB afterglow. A large
fraction of GRB-DLAs show presence of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) which is an
indicator of star-formation. Hence it is important to study those GRB-DLAs
which have H$_2$ lines to decipher and understand their physical conditions.
The GRB-DLAs 121024A and 120815A, situated at redshift 2.30 and 2.36
respectively, are two such important H$_2$-bearing GRB-DLAs. Besides H$_2$,
these two GRB-DLAs also show many metal lines. In this work we have carried out
a detail numerical study on the H$_2$ lines, as well as on those metal lines,
in GRB-DLAs 121024A and 120815A self-consistently. We use the spectral
synthesis code CLOUDY for this study. This modeling helps us to determine the
underlying physical conditions which give rise such lines and hence to
understand these two GRB-DLAs in much more detail than any other previous
investigation. We find that the hydrogen densities for these two H$_2$-bearing
DLAs are $\geq$ 60 cm$^{-3}$. Moreover our study infers that the linear sizes
are $\leq 17.7$ pc for these two GRB-DLAs, and the mean gas temperatures
averaged over the cloud thickness, are $\leq$ 140 K.

set registration problem without correspondences. Inspired by the Kernel
Correlation method, we consider the fully connected objective function between
two point sets, thus avoiding the computation of correspondences. By utilizing
least square minimization, the transformed objective function is directly
solved with existing well-known closed-form solutions, e.g., singular value
decomposition, that is usually used for given correspondences. However, using
equal weights of costs for each connection will degenerate the solution due to
the large influence of distant pairs. Thus, we additionally set a scale on each
term to avoid high costs on non-important pairs. As in feature-based
registration methods, the similarity between descriptors of points determines
the scaling weight. Given the weights, we get a one step solution. As the
runtime is in $\mathcal O (n^2)$, we also propose a variant with keypoints that
strongly reduces the cost. The experiments show that the proposed method gives
a one-step solution without an initial guess. Our method exhibits competitive
outlier robustness and accuracy, compared to various other methods, and it is
more stable in case of large rotations. Additionally, our one-step solution
achieves a performance on-par with the state-of-the-art feature based method

possibility of bit sign transition. Unlike other GNSS signals, there is no
pilot component for synchronization in BeiDou B1/B3 signals, which increases
the complexity in acquisition. A previous study has shown that the delay and
multiplication (DAM) method is able to eliminate the bit sign transition
problem, but it only applies to pretty strong signals. In this paper, a
DAM-based BeiDou signal acquisition approach, called variable length data
accumulation (VLDA), is proposed to acquire weak satellite signals. Firstly,
the performance of DAM method versus the different delays is analyzed. The DAM
operation not only eliminates bit sign transition, but it also increases noise
power. Secondly, long-term signal is periodically accumulated to improve signal
intensity in order to acquire weak signals. While considering the Doppler
frequency shift of ranging codes, the signal length must be compensated before
accumulating long-term signal. Finally, the fast-Fourier-transform based
parallel code phase algorithm are used for acquisition. The simulation results
indicate that the proposed VLDA method has better acquisition sensitivity than
traditional non-coherent integration method under the same calculation amount.
The VLDA method only requires approximately 27.5% of calculations to achieve
the same acquisition sensitivity (35 dBHz). What is more, the actual
experimental results verify the feasibility of the VLDA method. It can be
concluded that the proposed approach is an effective and feasible method for
solving the bit sign transition problem.

CONGEST distributed model. In this setting we test whether the distributive
network, $G_U$, is isomorphic to $G_K$ which is given as an input to all the

  We first consider the decision variant of the problem in which the algorithm
distinguishes $G_U$ and $G_K$ which are isomorphic from $G_U$ and $G_K$ which
are not isomorphic. We provide a randomized algorithm with $O(n)$ rounds for
the setting in which $G_K$ is given only to a single node. We prove that for
this setting the number of rounds of any deterministic algorithm is
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ rounds, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes, which
implies a separation between the randomized and the deterministic complexities

  We then consider the \emph{property testing} variant of the problem, where
the algorithm is only required to distinguish the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are
isomorphic from the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are \emph{far} from being

every algorithm requires $\Omega(D)$ rounds, where $D$ denotes the diameter of

input, and even if the message size is unbounded. We provide a randomized
algorithm with an almost matching round complexity of $O(D+(\epsilon^{-1}\log

  We also show that with the same number of rounds it is possible that each
node outputs its mapping according to a bijection which is an
\emph{approximated} isomorphism.

recently reported its experimental synthesis, we first carry out density
functional theory (DFT) calculations for an infinite nanowire to obtain the
nanoscopic dielectric constant, effective mass, and Kohn-Sham potential. The
DFT-derived data are then transferred to the finite nanorod cases to set up the
EMA equations, from which we estimate the photoluminescence (PL)
characteristics. Compared with the corresponding method based on bulk EMA
parameters and abrupt potential, we confirm that our EMA approach more
accurately describes the PL properties of nanorods. We find that, in agreement
with the experimentally observed trends, the optical gap of nanorods is roughly
determined by the nanorod diameter and the PL intensity is reduced with
increasing the nanorod length. The developed methodology is additionally
applied to CdSe nanoplatelets, where reliable experimental data became recently
available. Here, we again obtain excellent agreements between calculated and
measured optical gap values, confirming the generality of our approach. It is
finally shown that the abrupt confinement potential approximation most
adversely affects the accuracy of EMA simulations.

challenge is the fact that there is only one onboard IMU sensor which does not
provide full information on the system state. To overcome this difficulty, we
design a controller motivated by a simplified SAM model. The proposed
controller is very simple yet robust to model uncertainties. Moreover, we
propose a gain tuning rule by formulating the proposed controller in the form
of output feedback linear quadratic regulation problem. Consequently, it is
possible to quickly dampen oscillations with minimal energy consumption. The
proposed approach is validated through simulations and experiments.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for developing the efficient

Two-dimensional CNN methods have shown remarkable performance in detecting

for supervised learning on time-series data. We establish a machine learning
model based on the 1D-CNN by serializing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet

categorized and labeled for supervised learning in the 1D-CNN. We evaluated our

Using zero-range Skyrme interactions and finite-range interactions such as
Gogny forces, momentum-dependent interactions (MDI) and simple effective
interactions (SEI), we analyze the properties of the EoS and the influence they
may have on the calculations for NSs.
  We study the convergence properties of the Taylor series expansion of the EoS
in powers of the isospin asymmetry and the accuracy of the results for
$\beta$-stable nuclear matter when it is computed using the Taylor expansion of
the EoS. The NS mass-radius relation for Skyrme and finite-range interactions
is also analyzed. As none of the existing parametrizations of the standard
Gogny D1 interaction are able to provide an NS inside the observational
constraints, we propose a new parametrization, which we name D1M$^*$, that is
able to provide NSs of $2 M_\odot$ while still providing the same good
description of finite nuclei as D1M. A parametrization D1M$^{**}$ is also
presented, which is fitted similarly as D1M$^*$ and provides NSs up to $1.91
M_\odot$.
  An accurate determination of the core-crust transition point is necessary for
the modeling of NSs for astrophysical purposes. We estimate the core-crust
transition in NSs by finding where the nuclear matter in the core is unstable
against fluctuations of the density. To do that, we employ two methods, the
thermodynamical method and the dynamical method for zero-range and finite-range
interactions. To apply the dynamical method to finite-range forces, we have
explicitly derived the expression of the energy curvature matrix in momentum
space.

present a novel end-to-end network for robust point clouds processing, named
PointASNL, which can deal with point clouds with noise effectively. The key
component in our approach is the adaptive sampling (AS) module. It first
re-weights the neighbors around the initial sampled points from farthest point
sampling (FPS), and then adaptively adjusts the sampled points beyond the
entire point cloud. Our AS module can not only benefit the feature learning of
point clouds, but also ease the biased effect of outliers. To further capture
the neighbor and long-range dependencies of the sampled point, we proposed a
local-nonlocal (L-NL) module inspired by the nonlocal operation. Such L-NL
module enables the learning process insensitive to noise. Extensive experiments
verify the robustness and superiority of our approach in point clouds
processing tasks regardless of synthesis data, indoor data, and outdoor data
with or without noise. Specifically, PointASNL achieves state-of-the-art robust
performance for classification and segmentation tasks on all datasets, and
significantly outperforms previous methods on real-world outdoor SemanticKITTI

score is a smooth function of the characteristic over a liquid range. The
smooth function is based on B-splines, typically cubic. In contrast, the
characteristic scores for traditional scorecards are step functions of the
characteristics. Previously, there were two ways to control the smoothness of
the liquid characteristic score: (1) coarse classing where the fewer the number
of classes, the smoother the curve; (2) the penalty parameter, which penalizes
the norm of the score coefficient vector. However, in classical cubic spline
fitting theory, a direct measure of curve roughness is used as a penalty term
in the fitting objective function. In this paper, I work out the details of
this concept for our characteristic scores, which are linear functions of a
cubic B-spline basis. The roughness penalty is the integral of the second
derivative squared. As you vary the characteristic smoothness parameter from
zero to infinity, the characteristic score goes from being rough to being very
smooth. As one moves from rough to smooth, the palatable characteristic score
jumps off the page. This is illustrated by a case study. This case study also
shows that smoothness parameters, which maximize validation divergence, do not

models is of paramount importance in many areas of practice. One approach to
study these concerns is through the lens of differential privacy. In this
framework, privacy guarantees are generally obtained by perturbing models in
such a way that specifics of data used to train the model are made ambiguous. A
particular instance of this approach is through a ""teacher-student"" framework,
wherein the teacher, who owns the sensitive data, provides the student with
useful, but noisy, information, hopefully allowing the student model to perform
well on a given task without access to particular features of the sensitive
data. Because stronger privacy guarantees generally involve more significant
perturbation on the part of the teacher, deploying existing frameworks
fundamentally involves a trade-off between student's performance and privacy
guarantee. One of the most important techniques used in previous works involves
an ensemble of teacher models, which return information to a student based on a
noisy voting procedure. In this work, we propose a novel voting mechanism with
smooth sensitivity, which we call Immutable Noisy ArgMax, that, under certain
conditions, can bear very large random noising from the teacher without
affecting the useful information transferred to the student.
  Compared with previous work, our approach improves over the state-of-the-art
methods on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both better performance
and stronger privacy ($\epsilon \approx 0$). This new proposed framework can be
applied with any machine learning models, and provides an appealing solution

nanomembranes in a magnetic field with submicron inhomogeneity shows a pulse on
a certain interval of the magnetic field. It is a manifestation of a wide
phase-slip domain. The topological transition accompanying the phase-slip
effect consists in the occurrence of two new loops of weak superconducting
currents connecting two regions of superconducting screening currents, which
are disconnected in case of vortex-chain dynamics. In the middle of the
phase-slip domain, rapid dynamics of the superconducting order parameter
consists in decoupling of a spontaneously nucleated vortex-antivortex pair,
subsequent motion of a vortex and an antivortex in the opposite directions
followed by their annihilation with an antivortex and a vortex from the
adjacent pairs. The submicron-scale inhomogeneity of the magnetic field can be
achieved through a direct patterning of the magnetic field applied to a planar
membrane or using advanced nanostructuring, such as roll-up technology, focused
ion-beam deposition or coating carbon nanotubes by superconducting materials.
If the applied magnetic field is orthogonal to the axis of a microtube, which
carries transport current in the azimuthal direction, the phase-slip regime is
characterized by the vortex-antivortex lifetime of 10E-15 s versus 10E-12 s for
disconnected vortex dynamics in the half-tubes. The phase-slip dynamics
determines the voltage-magnetic field and voltage-current characteristics in

annotated with object classes and their bounding boxes. On the other hand,
medical images such as mammography usually contain normal regions or objects
that are similar to the lesion region, and may be misclassified in the testing
stage if they are not taken care of. In this paper, we address such problem by
introducing a novel top likelihood loss together with a new sampling procedure
to select and train the suspected target regions, as well as proposing a
similarity loss to further identify suspected targets from targets. Mean
average precision (mAP) according to the predicted targets and specificity,
sensitivity, accuracy, AUC values according to classification of patients are
adopted for performance comparisons. We firstly test our proposed method on a
private dense mammogram dataset. Results show that our proposed method greatly
reduce the false positive rate and the specificity is increased by 0.25 on
detecting mass type cancer. It is worth mention that dense breast typically has
a higher risk for developing breast cancers and also are harder for cancer
detection in diagnosis, and our method outperforms a reported result from
performance of radiologists. Our method is also validated on the public Digital
Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset, brings significant
improvement on mass type cancer detection and outperforms the most

providing reliable and high data rate communication in high-speed train
systems. However, with the increasing train mobility, the resulting large
Doppler shift introduces intercarrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems and
greatly degrades the channel estimation accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary
and important to investigate reliable channel estimation and ICI mitigation
methods in high-mobility environments. In this paper, we consider a typical HST
communication system and show that the ICI caused by the large Doppler shift
can be mitigated by exploiting the train position information as well as the
sparsity of the conventional basis expansion model (BEM) based channel model.
Then, we show that for the complex-exponential BEM (CE-BEM) based channel
model, the ICI can be completely eliminated to get the ICI-free pilots at each
receive antenna. After that, we propose a new pilot pattern design algorithm to
reduce the system coherence and hence can improve the compressed sensing (CS)
based channel estimation accuracy. The proposed optimal pilot pattern is
independent of the number of receive antennas, the Doppler shifts, the train
position, or the train speed. Simulation results confirms the performance
merits of the proposed scheme in high-mobility environments. In addition, it is
also shown that the proposed scheme is robust to the respect of high mobility.

based on the prior knowledge of the unknown release history. Thus reduced
computational cost allows one to reduce the sampling error associated with
construction of the approximate likelihood function. As all MCMC strategies for
source identification, our method has an added advantage of quantifying
predictive uncertainty and accounting for measurement errors. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate the accuracy comparable to that of MCMC with the
forward transport model, which is obtained at a fraction of the computational
cost of the latter.

broadband wireless services in HSTs is becoming crucial. Orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely adopted for broadband
wireless communications due to its high spectral efficiency. However, OFDM is
sensitive to the time selectivity caused by high-mobility channels, which costs
large spectrum or time resources to obtain the accurate channel state
information (CSI). Therefore, the channel estimation in high-mobility OFDM
systems has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we first propose a
new position-based high-mobility channel model,in which the HST's position
information and Doppler shift are utilized to determine the positions of the
dominant channel coefficients. %In this way, we can reduce the estimation
complexity and to design the transmitted pilot.Then, we propose a joint pilot
placement and pilot symbol design algorithm for compressed channel estimation.
It aims to reduce the coherence between the pilot signal and the proposed
channel model, and hence can improve the channel estimation accuracy.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better
performances than existing channel estimation methods over high-mobility
channels. Furthermore, we give an example of the designed pilot codebook to
show the practical applicability of the proposed scheme.

considered, where the inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by high mobility

exploiting the train position information, a new position-based interference

conditions of natural gas are different from those of other traditional energy
sources like petroleum or coal. To overcome these challenges, supplier
countries require take-or-pay agreements for requested natural gas quantities.
These contracts have many pre-clauses; if they are not met due to low/high
consumption or other external factors, buyers must completely fulfill them. A
similar contract is then imposed on distributors and wholesale consumers. It is
thus important for all parties to forecast their daily, monthly, and annual
natural gas demand to minimize their risk. In this paper, a model consisting of
a modulated expansion in Fourier series, supplemented by deviations from
comfortable temperatures as a regressor is proposed for the forecast of monthly
and weekly consumption over a one-year horizon. This model is supplemented by a
day-ahead feedback mechanism for the forecast of daily consumption. The method
is applied to the study of natural gas consumption for major residential areas
in Turkey, on a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily basis. It is shown that
residential heating dominates winter consumption and masks all other
variations. On the other hand, weekend and holiday effects are visible in
summer consumption and provide an estimate for residential and industrial use.
The advantage of the proposed method is the capability of long term projections
