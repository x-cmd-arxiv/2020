condensed matter physics because of the lack of an ideal QSL platform. Here we
report the pressure induced metallization and possible unconventional
superconductivity in $NaYbSe_{2}$, which belongs to a large and ideal family of
triangular lattice spin liquid we revealed recently and is evidenced to possess
a QSL ground state. The charge gap of NaYbSe2 is gradually reduced by applying
pressures, and at ~20 GPa the crystal jumps into a superconducting (SC) phase
with Tc ~ 5.8 K even before the insulating gap is completely closed. The
metallization is confirmed by further high-pressure experiments but the sign of
superconductivity is not well repeated. No symmetry breaking accompanies the SC
transition, as indicated by X-ray diffraction and low-temperature Raman
experiments under high pressures. This intrinsically connects QSL and SC
phases, and suggests an unconventional superconductivity developed from QSL. We
further observed the magnetic-field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition
which is analogous to that found in the underdoped cuprate superconductor
$La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$. The study is expected to inspire interest in exploring
new types of superconductors and sheds light into the intriguing physics from a

independent quantization procedure to replace the ad hoc process of canonical
quantization. This effort has largely coalesced into two distinct research
programs: geometric quantization and deformation quantization. Though both of
these programs can claim numerous successes, neither has found mainstream
acceptance within the more experimentally minded quantum physics community,
owing both to their mathematical complexities and their practical failures as
empirical models. This paper introduces an alternative approach to
coordinate-independent quantization called tautologically tuned quantization.
This approach uses only differential geometric structures from symplectic and
Riemannian geometry, especially the tautological one form and vector field
(hence the name). In its focus on physically important functions,
tautologically tuned quantization hews much more closely to the ad hoc approach
of canonical quantization than either traditional geometric quantization or
deformation quantization and thereby avoid some of the mathematical challenges
faced by those methods. Given its focus on standard differential geometric
structures, tautologically tuned quantization is also a better candidate than
either traditional geometric or deformation quantization for application to
covariant Hamiltonian field theories, and therefore may pave the way for the
geometric quantization of classical fields.

  Aims. We focus on the frequency analysis of the space-based observations,
comparing the results with the findings of the previous ground-based
measurements. The frequencies detected by the TESS observations can serve as
inputs for future asteroseismic analyses.
  Methods. We performed standard pre-whitening of the data sets to derive the
possible pulsation frequencies of the different targets. In some cases, we
fitted Lorentzians to the frequency groups that emerged as the results of
short-term amplitude/phase variations that occurred during the TESS
observations.
  Results. We detected more than 40 pulsation frequencies in seven ZZ Ceti
stars observed in the 120s cadence by TESS, with better than 0.1 microHz
precision. We found that HE 0532-5605 may be a new outbursting ZZ Ceti. Ten
targets do not show any significant pulsation frequencies in their Fourier
transforms, due to a combination of their intrinsic faintness and/or crowding
on the large TESS pixels. We also detected possible amplitude/phase variations
during the TESS observations in some cases. Such behaviour in these targets was
not previously identified from ground-based observations.

principle, unbounded amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Twisted
single-photons have been demonstrated as a high-dimensional quantum system with
information processing ability far beyond the widely used two-level qubits. To
date, the generations of single-photons carrying OAM merely rely on the
non-linear process in bulk crystals, e.g., spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC), which unavoidably limits both the efficiency and the
scalability of the source. Therefore, an on-demand OAM quantum light source on
a semiconductor chip is yet illusive and highly desirable for integrated
photonic quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate highly-efficient emission of
twisted single-photons from solid-state quantum emitters embedded in a
microring with angular gratings. The cavity QED effect allows the generations
of single-photons and encoding OAM in the same nanostructure and therefore
enables the realization of devices with very small footprints and great
scalability. The OAM states of singe-photons are clearly identified via quantum
interference of single-photons with themselves. Our device may boost the
development of integrated quantum photonic devices with potential applications

propose a scalable variational inference algorithm for GPRN, which not only
captures the abundant posterior dependencies but also is much more efficient

tensor/matrix-normal variational posteriors to capture the posterior

aid in the timely identification of possible problem areas and thus increase
the efficiency of water management. The purpose of this research is to develop
a water quality prediction model based on water quality parameters through the
application of a specialised recurrent neural network (RNN), Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and the use of historical water quality data over several years.
Both multivariate single and multiple step LSTM models were developed, using a
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and a Root Mean Square
Propagation (RMSprop) optimiser was developed. The single step model attained
an error of 0.01 mg/L, whilst the multiple step model achieved a Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.227 mg/L.

The mass-loss rate is not fixed, but varies from star-to-star by up to 5\%,
resulting in variations of the star's luminosity at the tip of the red giant
branch (TRGB). Also, most stars, during this phase, engulf part of their
planetary system, including their gas giant planets and possibly brown dwarfs.
Gas giant planet masses range between 0.1 to 2\% of the host star mass. The
engulfing of their gas giants planets can modify their luminosity at the TRGB,
i.e. the point at which the He-core degeneracy is removed. We show that the
increase in mass of the star by the engulfing of the gas giant planets only
modifies the luminosity of a star at the TRGB by less than 0.1\%, while
metallicity can modify the luminosity of a star at the TRGB by up to 0.5\%.
However, the increase in turbulence of the convective envelope of the star, has
a more dramatic effect, on the star's luminosity, which we estimate could be as
large as 5\%. The effect is always in the direction to increase the turbulence
and thus the mixing length which turns into a systematic decrease of the
luminosity of the star at the TRGB. We find that the star-to-star variation of
the mass-loss rate will dominate the variations in the luminosity of the TRGB
with a contribution at the 5\% level. If the star-to-star variation is driven
by environmental effects, the same effects can potentially create an
environmentally-driven mean effect on the luminosity of the tip of the red
giant branch of a galaxy. Engulfment of a brown dwarf will have a more dramatic
effect. Finally, we touch upon how to infer the frequency, and identify the
engulfment, of exoplanets in low-metallicity RGB stars through high resolution
spectroscopy as well as how to quantify mass loss rate distributions from the
morphology of the horizontal branch.

To investigate

As an empirical reference we use time series describing eight centuries of per
capita annual gross domestic products (GDP) of three European countries, the
UK, France and Sweden. The model requires a population large enough for
disruptive events, e.g. famine, epidemics and wars, not to destroy the
fundamental workings of society. The wealth evolution trend can then be
described by an ordinary differential equation with three free parameters. The
solution features a finite time singularity, which suggests a lack of long term
sustainability. The year at which the singularity occurs has a slight variation
near 2020 AD from one country to another. GDP time series curtailed after 1900
AD produce similar values for the occurrence of the singularity, which thus
could be predicted more than hundred years ago. Curtailing the GDP series from
the early years up to 1700 AD also produces stable and consistent predictions
for the singularity time. {Power spectra are obtained for de-trended data
spanning eight centuries, as well as for the first and last four centuries of
the same period. All spectra have an overall signature where the power decays
as the inverse frequency squared. The embedded peaks are reminiscent of the
cycles described in the economic literature, but are also present in time
series far predating industrialization. The background fluctuations in the GDP
series is tentatively interpreted as societal response to disruptive stochastic
events. e.g. new economic activities following epochal discoveries, as well as
wars and epidemics

robustness (in the sense of l2-stability) of the data-selective Volterra
normalized least-mean-square (DS-VNLMS) algorithm. First, we study the local
robustness of this algorithm at any iteration, then we propose a global bound
for the error/discrepancy in the coefficient vector. Also, we demonstrate that
the DS-VNLMS algorithm improves the parameter estimation for the majority of
the iterations that an update is implemented. Moreover, we prove that if the
noise bound is known, we can set the DS-VNLMS so that it never degrades the
estimate. The simulation results corroborate the validity of the executed
analysis and demonstrate that the DS-VNLMS algorithm is robust against noise,
no matter how its parameters are adopted.

massive stellar clusters are likely sources of the PeV (petaelectronvolt)

retrieved temperatures are far colder than expected. In some cases, retrieved
temperatures are ~1000 K colder than T_eq. Here, we provide an explanation for
this conundrum. We demonstrate that erroneously cold temperatures result when
1D atmospheric models are applied to spectra of planets with differing
morning-evening terminator compositions. Despite providing an acceptable fit,
1D retrieval techniques artificially tune atmospheric parameters away from
terminator-averaged properties. Retrieved temperature profiles are hundreds of
degrees cooler and have weaker temperature gradients than reality. Retrieved
abundances are mostly biased by > 1$\sigma$ and sometimes by > 3$\sigma$, with
the most extreme biases for ultra-hot Jupiters. When morning-evening
compositional differences manifest for prominent opacity sources, H$_2$O
abundances retrieved by 1D models can be biased by over an order of magnitude.
Finally, we demonstrate that these biases provide an explanation for the cold
retrieved temperatures reported for WASP-17b and WASP-12b. To overcome biases
associated with 1D atmospheric models, there is an urgent need to develop
multidimensional retrieval techniques.

disc at a galactocentric distance of r > 10 kpc as recently revealed by the
SDSS/APOGEE survey. Two sequences are present in the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane
with systematically different stellar ages. Surprisingly, the young sequence is
less metal-rich, suggesting a recent dilution process by additional gas
accretion. As the stars with the lowest iron abundance in the younger sequence
also show an enhancement in alpha-element abundance, the gas accretion event
must have involved a burst of star formation. In order to explain these
observations, we construct a chemical evolution model. In this model we include
a relatively short episode of gas accretion at late times on top of an
underlying secular accretion over long timescales. Our model is successful at
reproducing the observed distribution of stars in the three dimensional space
of [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H]-Age in the outer disc. We find that a late-time accretion
with a delay of 8.2 Gyr and a timescale of 0.7 Gyr best fits the observed data,
in particular the presence of the young, metal-poor sequence. Our best-fit
model further implies that the amount of accreted gas in the late-time
accretion event needs to be about three times the local gas reservoir in the
outer disc at the time of accretion in order to sufficiently dilute the metal
abundance. Given this large fraction, we interpret the late-time accretion
event as a minor merger presumably with a gas-rich dwarf galaxy with a mass M_*

Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity that leads to a well defined action
principle in four dimensions. Our construction is based on compactifying
$D$-dimensional EGB gravity on a $(D-4)$-dimensional maximally symmetric space
followed by redefining the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha\rightarrow
\frac{\alpha}{D-4}$. The resulting model is a special scalar-tensor theory that
belongs to the family of Horndeski gravity. Static black hole solutions in the
scalar-tensor theory are investigated. Interestingly, the metric profile is
independent of the curvature of the internal space and coincides with the
$D\rightarrow 4$ limit of the usual EGB black hole with the unusual
Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\frac{\alpha}{D-4}$. The curvature information of the
internal space is instead encoded in the profile of the extra scalar field. Our
procedure can also be generalized to define further limits of the Gauss-Bonnet
combination by compactifying the $D$-dimensional theory on a
$(D-p)$-dimensional maximally symmetric space with $p\leq 3$. These lead to
different $D\rightarrow 4$ limits of EGB gravity as well as its $D\rightarrow

how to compute the anomaly for symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states of

deconfined anyon excitations described by the given UMTC and symmetry
fractionalization class. We present concrete algorithms that can be used to
compute anomaly indicators in general. Our approach applies to general symmetry

providing a general way to compute the anomaly, our result also shows, by

described to per cent accuracy with only two parameters, and the approach
straightforwardly generalises to other parametric forms and surveys. The cosmic

We find that the frequency dependence of $\Sigma (\omega)$ agrees well with the
analytic form obtained within the Eliashberg theory of dynamical quantum

open up an avenue for QMC studies of quantum-critical metals.

visibilities based on a purely geometric representation of the light

detecting correlated stellar spin axes in young open clusters. Furthermore, if

systems to attacks and the information available to malicious attackers.
Specifically, it is shown that control systems are guaranteed to be secure in
an asymptotic manner by rendering reactions against potentially harmful actions
covert. The behaviors of the attacker and the defender are analyzed through a
repeated signaling game with an undisclosed belief under covert reactions. In
the typical setting of signaling games, reactions conducted by the defender are
supposed to be public information and the measurability enables the attacker to
accurately trace transitions of the defender's belief on existence of a
malicious attacker. In contrast, the belief in the game considered in this
paper is undisclosed and hence common equilibrium concepts can no longer be
employed for the analysis. To surmount this difficulty, a novel framework for
decision of reasonable strategies of the players in the game is introduced.
Based on the presented framework, it is revealed that any reasonable strategy
chosen by a rational malicious attacker converges to the benign behavior as
long as the reactions performed by the defender are unobservable to the
attacker. The result provides an explicit relationship between resilience and
information, which indicates the importance of covertness of reactions for
designing secure control systems.

appears that such models are incomplete in that they neglect kinetic effects
associated with long mean free paths of stellar wind particles, and the
complexity of Weibel instability fronts. Wind ions are scattered in the Weibel
instability and mix with the interstellar gas. However, they do not lose their
momentum and most ultimately diffuse further into the ambient gas like cosmic
rays, and share their energy and momentum. Lacking other coolants, the heated
gas transfers energy to interstellar dust grains, which radiate it. This
process, in addition to grain photo-heating, provides the energy for the
emission. A weak R-type ionization front, formed well outside the infrared
emission region, generally moderates the interstellar gas flow into the
emission region. The theory suggests that the infrared emission process is
limited to cases of moderate stellar peculiar velocities, evidently in accord

knowledge when selecting covariates for causal effect estimation. Multiple
variable selection procedures tailored for causal effect estimation have been
devised in recent years, but additional developments are still required to
adequately address the needs of data analysts. In this paper, we propose a
Generalized Bayesian Causal Effect Estimation (GBCEE) algorithm to perform
variable selection and produce double robust estimates of causal effects for
binary or continuous exposures and outcomes. GBCEE employs a prior distribution
that targets the selection of true confounders and predictors of the outcome
for the unbiased estimation of causal effects with reduced standard errors.
Double robust estimators provide some robustness against model
misspecification, whereas the Bayesian machinery allows GBCEE to directly
produce inferences for its estimate. GBCEE was compared to multiple
alternatives in various simulation scenarios and was observed to perform
similarly or to outperform double robust alternatives. Its ability to directly
produce inferences is also an important advantage from a computational
perspective. The method is finally illustrated for the estimation of the effect
of meeting physical activity recommendations on the risk of hip or upper-leg
fractures among elderly women in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. The 95%
confidence interval produced by GBCEE is 61% shorter than that of a double
robust estimator adjusting for all potential confounders in this illustration.

determines the chord length for a transiting planet, i.e., the projected
distance a transiting planet travels across the stellar disc. For a given
circular orbit, the chord length determines the transit duration. Changes in
the orbital inclination, the direction of the ascending node, or both, can
alter this chord length and thus result in transit duration variations (TDVs).
Variation of the full orbital inclination vector can even lead to de-transiting
or newly transiting planets for a system. We use Laplace-Lagrange secular
theory to estimate the fastest nodal eigenfrequencies for over 100 short-period
planetary systems. The highest eigenfrequency is an indicator of which systems
should show the strongest TDVs. We further explore five cases (TRAPPIST-1,
Kepler-11, K2-138, Kepler-445, and Kepler-334) using direct N-body simulations
to characterize possible TDVs and to explore whether de-transiting planets
could be possible for these systems. A range of initial conditions are
explored, with each realization being consistent with the observed transits. We
find that tens of percent of multiplanet systems have fast enough
eigenfrequencies to expect large TDVs on decade timescales. Among the directly
integrated cases, we find that de-transiting planets could occur on decade
timescales and TDVs of 10 minutes per decade should be common.

feature: they are all related to the ability of biological systems to
synchronize with the day-night cycle. When organisms lose resilience, this
ability of synchronizing can become weaker till they eventually become
desynchronized in a state of malfunctioning or sickness. It would be useful to
measure this loss of resilience before the full desynchronization takes place.
Several dynamical indicators of resilience (DIORs) have been proposed to
account for the loss of resilience of a dynamical system. The performance of
these indicators depends on the underlying mechanism of the critical
transition, usually a saddle-node bifurcation. Before such bifurcation the
recovery rate from perturbations of the system becomes slower, a mechanism
known as critical slowing down. Here we show that, for a wide class of
biological systems, desynchronization happens through another bifurcation,
namely the saddle-node of cycles, for which critical slowing down cannot be
directly detected. Such a bifurcation represents a system transitioning from
synchronized (phase locked) to a desynchronized state, or vice versa. We show
that after an appropriate transformation we can also detect this bifurcation
using dynamical indicators of resilience. We test this method with data
generated by models of sleep-wake cycles.

we demonstrate efficient carrier-envelope offset frequency $f_{\textrm{CEO}}$
stabilization of a modelocked laser with only 107 pJ of pulse energy via
self-referencing in an integrated lithium niobate waveguide. We realize an
$f$-$2f$ interferometer through second-harmonic generation and subsequent
supercontinuum generation in a single dispersion-engineered waveguide with a
stabilization performance equivalent to a conventional off-chip module. The
$f_{\textrm{CEO}}$ beatnote is measured over a pump wavelength range of 70 nm.
We theoretically investigate our system using a single nonlinear envelope

Our modeling reveals rich ultrabroadband nonlinear dynamics and confirms that
the initial second harmonic generation followed by supercontinuum generation
with the remaining pump is responsible for the generation of a strong

""type-2"" range counting queries: report the number of occurrences of every

internet companies. Survival analysis is a promising method for analyzing the
expected duration of events and usually assumes the same survival function for
all subjects and the event will occur in the long run. However, such
assumptions are inappropriate when the users behave differently or some events
never occur for some users, i.e., the conversion period on web services of the
light users with no intention of behaving actively on the service. Especially,
if the proportion of inactive users is high, this assumption can lead to
undesirable results. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mixture
model that separately addresses active and inactive individuals with a latent
variable. First, we define this specific problem setting and show the
limitations of conventional survival analysis in addressing this problem. We
demonstrate how naturally our Bernoulli-Weibull model can accommodate the
challenge. The proposed model was extended further to a Bayesian hierarchical
model to incorporate each subject's parameter, offering substantial
improvements over conventional, non-hierarchical models in terms of WAIC and
WBIC. Second, an experiment and extensive analysis were conducted using
real-world data from the Japanese job search website, CareerTrek, offered by
BizReach, Inc. In the analysis, some research questions are raised, such as the
difference in activation rate and conversion rate between user categories, and
how instantaneously the rate of event occurrence changes as time passes.
Quantitative answers and interpretations are assigned to them. Furthermore, the
model is inferred in a Bayesian manner, which enables us to represent the
uncertainty with a credible interval of the parameters and predictive
quantities.

chemically homogeneous clusters in the early phases of galaxy formation. They
should have already disintegrated and should exhibit large scatter in abundance
ratios of some sets of elements (e.g., Sr/Ba) in the Milky Way field stars.
However, chemical abundance ratios are expected to cluster in very metal-poor
stars in dwarf galaxies because the number of clusters formed in individual
galaxies in the very early phase is expected to be quite limited. We examine
the possible clustering of abundance ratios of Sr and Ba in the Sextans dwarf
galaxy to test for the clustering star formation scenario. We investigate a
total of 11 elements (C, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Ba) in five stars
in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Previous studies suggest that these have similar
abundance ratios. In this study, we focus on the abundance ratio of Sr to Ba.
The observations are based on high-resolution spectroscopy (R = 40 000) using
the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion Spectrograph. The distribution of
$\alpha$/Fe abundance ratios of the Sextans dwarf galaxy stars is slightly
lower than the average of the values of stars in the Galactic halo. The Sr/Ba
abundance ratios for the five metal-poor stars are in good agreement, and this
clumping is distinctive compared to the [Sr/Ba] spread seen in the metal-poor
halo stars. We find that the probability of such clumping is very small if the
Sextans stars have distributions of Sr and Ba abundances similar to halo stars.

this difference is to a very good approximation determined by the Chern number

the superfluid gap squared that becomes signifiant for stronger pairing. This
gives rise to a competition between the experimentally driven goal to maximise
the critical temperature of the superfluid, and observing a signal given by the
underlying topology. Using a combination of strong coupling Eliashberg and
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory, we analyse this tension for an atomic

observers. There are two possible states of nature (or hypotheses).
Observations are collected by two observers. The observations are statistically
related to the true state of nature. Given the observations, the objective of
both observers is to find out what is the true state of nature. We present four
different approaches to address the problem. In the first (centralized)
approach, the observations collected by both observers are sent to a central
coordinator where hypothesis testing is performed. In the second approach, each
observer performs hypothesis testing based on locally collected observations.
Then they exchange binary information to arrive at a consensus. In the third
approach, each observer constructs an aggregated probability space based on the
observations collected by it and the decision it receives from the alternate
observer and performs hypothesis testing in the new probability space. In this
approach also they exchange binary information to arrive at consensus. In the
fourth approach, if observations collected by the observers are independent
conditioned on the hypothesis we show the construction of the aggregated sample
space can be skipped. In this case, the observers exchange real-valued
information to achieve consensus. Given the same fixed number of samples, n, n
sufficiently large, for the centralized (first) and decentralized (second)
approaches, it has been shown that if the observations collected by the

The first infection from epidemic coronaviruses in 2003 fostered the spread of
an overwhelming amount of related scientific efforts. The manifold aspects that
have been raised, as well as their redundancy offer precious information that
has been underexploited and needs to be critically re-evaluated, appropriately
used and offered to the whole community, from scientists, to medical doctors,
stakeholders and common people. These efforts will favour a holistic view on
the comprehension, prevention and development of strategies (pharmacological,
clinical etc) as well as common intervention against the new coronavirus
spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was
focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking
it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral
receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is
a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways
determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and
can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly
gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning
predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the
severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or
to the sex related biases in the affected population. The model highlights
novel opportunities for further investigations, diagnosis and appropriate

time-band limiting, commuting pairs of integral and differential operators have
played a key role in signal processing, random matrix theory and integrable
systems. Previously, such pairs were constructed by ad hoc methods, which
worked because a commuting operator of low order could be found by a direct
calculation. We describe a general approach to these problems that proves that
every point $W$ of Wilson's infinite dimensional adelic Grassmannian $\mathrm
Gr^ad$ gives rise to an integral operator $T_W$, acting on $L^2(\Gamma)$ for a
contour $\Gamma\subset\mathbb C$, which reflects a differential operator
$R(z,\partial_z)$ in the sense that $R(-z,-\partial_z)\circ T_W=T_W\circ
R(w,\partial_w)$ on a dense subset of $L^2(\Gamma)$. By using analytic methods
and methods from integrable systems, we show that the reflected differential
operator can be constructed from the Fourier algebra of the associated
bispectral function $\psi_W(x,z)$. The size of this algebra with respect to a
bifiltration is in turn determined using algebro-geometric methods. Intrinsic
properties of four involutions of the adelic Grassmannian naturally lead us to
consider the reflecting property in place of plain commutativity. Furthermore,
we prove that the time-band limited operators of the generalized Laplace
transforms with kernels given by all rank one bispectral functions
$\psi_W(x,-z)$ reflect a differential operator. A $90^\circ$ rotation argument
is used to prove that the time-band limited operators of the generalized
Fourier transforms with kernels $\psi_W(x,iz)$ admit a commuting differential
operator. These methods produce vast collections of integral operators with
prolate-spheroidal properties, associated to the wave functions of all rational
solutions of the KP hierarchy vanishing at infinity, introduced by Krichever in

We tackle this gap between theory and experiment by employing microscopic
quantum kinetic calculations including realistic electron-electron and
electron-phonon scattering. Our theory provides a direct link to the build-up
of the Floquet-Chern insulator state in light-driven graphene and its detection
in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows us
to study the stability of the Floquet features due to dephasing and
thermalization effects. We also discuss the ultrafast Hall response in the
laser-heated state. Furthermore, the induced pseudospin texture and the
associated Berry curvature gives rise to momentum-dependent orbital
magnetization, which is reflected in circular dichroism in ARPES (CD-ARPES).
Combining our nonequilibrium calculations with an accurate one-step theory of
photoemission allows us to establish a direct link between the build-up of the
topological state and the dichroic pump-probe photoemission signal. The
characteristic features in CD-ARPES are further corroborated to be stable
against heating and dephasing effects. Thus, tracing circular dichroism in
time-resolve photoemission provides new insights into transient topological
properties.

Here, we report a general gelation strategy via non-specific and purely
entropic depletion attractions applied to three types of metal oxide
nanocrystals. The gelation thresholds of two compositionally distinct spherical
nanocrystals agree quantitatively, demonstrating the adaptability of the
approach for different chemistries. Consistent with theoretical phase behavior
predictions, nanocrystal cubes form gels at a lower polymer concentration than
nanocrystal spheres, allowing shape to serve as a handle to control gelation.

generates a finite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which can induce
noncollinear spin textures of chiral nature. The DMI is characterized by an
interaction vector whose magnitude, direction and symmetries are crucial to
determine the stability of various spin textures, such as skyrmions and spin
spirals. The DMI can be measured from the nonreciprocity of spin waves in
ferromagnets, which can be probed via inelastic scattering experiments. In a
ferromagnet, the DMI can modify the spin-wave dispersion, moving its minimum
away from the $\Gamma$ point. Spin waves propagating with opposite wavevectors
are then characterized by different group velocities, energies and lifetimes,
defining their nonreciprocity. Here, we address the case of complex spin
textures, where the manifestation of DMI-induced chiral asymmetries remains to

accessing the magnitude and direction of the DMI vectors in the context of
spin-polarized or spin-resolved inelastic scattering experiments. We show that
only when a periodic magnetic system has finite net magnetization, that is,
when the vector sum of all magnetic moments is nonzero, can it present a total
nonreciprocal spin-wave spectrum. However, even zero-net-magnetization systems,
such as collinear antiferromagnets and cycloidal spin spirals, can have
spin-wave modes that are individually nonreciprocal, while the total spectrum
remains reciprocal.

solving the dynamics of the standard nonlinear optomechanical Hamiltonian with

time-evolution of the system, which reduces the problem to considering a finite
set of coupled ordinary differential equations of real functions. The second
part applies the solutions of the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian to the
study of non-Gaussianity. We compute the non-Gaussian character of an
optomechanical state as a function of the parameters in the Hamiltonian, and
investigate the interplay between the non-Gaussianity, the strength of the
nonlinear coupling and the strength of the single-mode mechanical squeezing

impacts the non-Gaussianity, and that its relationship with the squeezing term
is highly complex. The third part concerns the use of nonlinear optomechanical
systems as quantum sensors. We derive a general expression of the quantum
Fisher information given the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian and
demonstrate its applicability through three concrete examples: estimating the
strength of a nonlinear light--matter coupling, the strength of a
time-modulated mechanical displacement, and the strength of a single-mode
mechanical squeezing parameter, all of which are modulated at resonance. In the

systems, which can be realized using ultracold atomic gases, would exhibit the
long-sought-after Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase. The
HFB formalism generalizes the standard Bogoliubov quasi-particle

an unbiased framework to describe inhomgenous densities and pairing
correlations in the FFLO state of a confined 1D gas. In a harmonic trap,
numerical minimization of the HFB ground state energy yields a spatially
oscillating order parameter reminiscent of the FFLO state. However, we find
that this state has almost no imprint in the local fermion densities
(consistent with experiments that found no evidence of the FFLO phase). In
contrast, for a hard-wall geometry, we find a strong signature of the spatial
oscillations of the FFLO pairing amplitude reflected in the local in situ
densities. In the hard wall case, the excess spins are strongly localized near
regions where there is a node in the pairing amplitude, creating an

Specifically, FORCE learning approach proposed a recursive least squares
alternative to train RRNN and was shown to be applicable even for the
challenging task of target-learning, where the network is tasked with
generating dynamic patterns with no guiding input. While FORCE training
indicates that solving target-learning is possible, it appears to be effective
only in a specific regime of network dynamics (edge-of-chaos). We thereby

initialization along with FORCE learning provides a robust training method,

non-linear recombination processes that artificially broaden the carrier
distribution profile. Here, we simulate diffusive processes in both excitonic

account second-order (i.e. bimolecular) and third-order (i.e. Auger) processes
to accurately recover D for various types of materials. For perovskite thin

Pauli hole at low filling, and strong doublon-hole correlations near half
filling. These are shown to account for the difference between local and
non-local density fluctuations in the Mott insulator. Our technique enables the
study of atom-resolved charge transport in the Fermi-Hubbard model, the
site-resolved observation of molecules, and the creation of bilayer

overwhelmed by the volume and the content of the information present in the
environment. The threshold model is currently one of the most common methods to
capture the effect of people on others' opinions and emotions. Although many
studies employ and try to improve upon the threshold model, the search for an
appropriate threshold function for defining human behavior is an essential and
yet unattained quest. The definition of heterogeneity in thresholds of
individuals is oftentimes poorly defined, which leads to the rather simplistic
use of uniform and binary functions, albeit they are far from representing the
reality. In this study, we use Twitter data of size 30,704,025 tweets to mimic
the adoption of a new opinion. Our results show that the threshold is not only
correlated with the out-degree of nodes, which contradicts other studies but
also correlated with nodes' in-degree. Therefore, we simulated two cases in
which thresholds are out-degree and in-degree dependent, separately. We
concluded that the system is more likely to reach a consensus when thresholds
are in-degree dependent; however, the time elapsed until all nodes fix their
opinions is significantly higher in this case. Additionally, we did not observe
a notable effect of mean-degree on either the average opinion or the fixation
time of opinions for both cases, and increasing seed size has a negative effect
on reaching a consensus. Although threshold heterogeneity has a slight
influence on the average opinion, the positive effect of heterogeneity on
reaching a consensus is more pronounced when thresholds are in-degree
dependent.

Also, our method was unaffected by CNR. A 200% increase in strain measurement

tested the method using a 54-subject clinical cohort (20 subjects diseased with

- high-quality image synthesis from salient object layout. This new setting
allows users to provide the layout of salient objects only (i.e., foreground
bounding boxes and categories), and lets the model complete the drawing with an
invented background and a matching foreground. Two main challenges spring from
this new task: (i) how to generate fine-grained details and realistic textures
without segmentation map input; and (ii) how to create a background and weave
it seamlessly into standalone objects. To tackle this, we propose Background
Hallucination Generative Adversarial Network (BachGAN), which first selects a
set of segmentation maps from a large candidate pool via a background retrieval
module, then encodes these candidate layouts via a background fusion module to
hallucinate a suitable background for the given objects. By generating the
hallucinated background representation dynamically, our model can synthesize
high-resolution images with both photo-realistic foreground and integral
background. Experiments on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the
advantage of BachGAN over existing methods, measured on both visual fidelity of
generated images and visual alignment between output images and input layouts.

high-throughput screening of potential materials. In this work, we have

hydrogen binding applications following a two-pronged approach. First, we have
compiled a dataset (H2Bind275) that comprehensively represents the hydrogen

sites encountered in hydrogen storage materials. We have also computed
reference interaction energies for this dataset using coupled cluster theory.
Secondly, we have assessed the performance of 55 density functional

two hybrid density functionals ($\omega$B97X-V and $\omega$B97M-V), two double
hybrid density functionals (DSD-PBEPBE-D3(BJ) and PBE0-DH), and one semi-local
density functional (B97M-V) as the best performing ones. We have recommended
the addition of empirical dispersion corrections to systematically underbinding
density functionals like revPBE, BLYP, and B3LYP for improvements in

of the def2-TZVPP basis set as it represents a good compromise between accuracy

and take actions. As a result sensing and control naturally interfere, more so
from a real-time perspective. A natural consequence is that in multi-agent
systems there are propositions based on the set of observed events that might
not be simultaneously verifiable, which leads to the need for probability
structures that allow such \textit{incompatible events}. We revisit the
structure of events in a multi-agent system and we introduce the necessary new
models that incorporate such incompatible events in the formalism. These models
are essential for building non-commutative probability models, which are
different than the classical models based on the Kolmogorov construction. From
this perspective, we revisit the concepts of \textit{event-state-operation
structure} and the needed \textit{relationship of incompatibility} from the
literature and use them as a tool to study the needed new algebraic structure
of the set of events. We present an example from multi-agent hypothesis testing
where the set of events does not form a Boolean algebra, but forms an
ortholattice. A possible construction of a `noncommutative probability space',
accounting for \textit{incompatible events} is discussed. We formulate and
solve the binary hypothesis testing problem in the noncommutative probability
space. We illustrate the occurrence of `order effects' in the multi-agent
hypothesis testing problem by computing the minimum probability of error that
can be achieved with different orders of measurements.

developments on the mismatched decoding problem, with an emphasis on achievable
random-coding rates for memoryless channels. We present two widely-considered

temperature ($T$) dependence because of electron-electron (e-e) scattering. For
such collisions to decay the charge current, there are two known mechanisms:
inter-band scattering (identified by Baber) and Umklapp events. However, dilute
metallic strontium titanate (STO) was found to display $T^2$ resistivity in
absence of either of these two mechanisms. The presence of soft phonons and
their possible role as scattering centers raised the suspicion that $T$-square
resistivity in STO is not due to e-e scattering. Here, we present the case of
Bi$_2$O$_2$Se, a layered semiconductor with hard phonons, which becomes a
dilute metal with a small single-component Fermi surface upon doping. It
displays $T$-square resistivity well below the degeneracy temperature where
neither Umklapp nor interband scattering is conceivable. We observe a universal
scaling between the prefactor of $T^2$ resistivity and the Fermi energy, which
is an extension of the Kadowaki-Woods plot to dilute metals. Our results imply
the absence of a satisfactory theoretical basis for the ubiquity of e-e driven
$T$-square resistivity in Fermi liquids.

address a longstanding challenge in using dictionary learning for
classification; that is to simultaneously maximise the discriminability and
sparse-representability power of the learned dictionaries. Upon this premise,
we designed class-specific dictionaries incorporating three factors:
discriminability, sparsity and classification error. We integrated these
metrics into a unified cost function and adopted a new feature space, i.e.,
histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), to generate the dictionary atoms. The
rationale of using HOG features for designing the dictionaries is their
strength in describing fine details of crowded images. The results of applying
the proposed method in the classification of Chinese handwritten numbers
demonstrated enhanced classification performance $(\sim98\%)$ compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (i.e., SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet and
MobileNetV2), but with a fraction of parameters. Furthermore, combination of
the HOG features with dictionary learning enhances the accuracy by $11\%$
compared to the case where only pixel domain data are used. These results were
supported when the proposed method was applied to both Arabic and English

systems using the well-established variational approach. The molecule is found
to be intrinsically unstable against lowest-order particle-hole excitations,
and it can only approximate the ground state of impurity system with finite
total momentum in the strong coupling regime. The polaron-molecule transition
can therefore be reinterpreted as a first-order transition between single
impurity systems with different total momenta. Within certain interaction
window near their transition, both states appear as local minima in the
dispersion curve, indicating they can coexist in a realistic system. We have
further confirmed the polaron-molecule coexistence in the presence of a finite
impurity concentration and at low temperature, which directly leads to a smooth
polaron-molecule transition as observed in recent experiments of 3D ultracold
Fermi gases. Our results have provided an unambiguous physical picture for the
competition and conversion between polaron and molecule, and also shed light on
Fermi polaron properties in low dimensions.

R-CNN in mask AP, mainly due to the difficulty of compactly representing masks,
making the design of one-stage methods very challenging. In this work, we
propose a simple singleshot instance segmentation framework, termed mask
encoding based instance segmentation (MEInst). Instead of predicting the
two-dimensional mask directly, MEInst distills it into a compact and
fixed-dimensional representation vector, which allows the instance segmentation
task to be incorporated into one-stage bounding-box detectors and results in a
simple yet efficient instance segmentation framework. The proposed one-stage
MEInst achieves 36.4% in mask AP with single-model (ResNeXt-101-FPN backbone)
and single-scale testing on the MS-COCO benchmark. We show that the much
simpler and flexible one-stage instance segmentation method, can also achieve
competitive performance. This framework can be easily adapted for other

complex spaces (\emph{not} necessarily normal) via Ohsawa's extension measure,
as a special case of which, it turns out to be the so-called Mather-Jacobian
multiplier ideals in the algebro-geometric setting. As applications, we obtain
a reasonable generalization of (algebraic) adjoint ideal sheaves to the
analytic setting and establish some extension theorems on K\""ahler manifolds
from \emph{singular} hypersurfaces. Relying on our multiplier and adjoint
ideals, we also give characterizations for several important classes of
singularities of pairs associated to plurisubharmonic functions.
  Moreover, we also investigate the local structure of singularities of log
canonical locus of plurisubharmonic functions. Especially, in the
three-dimensional case, we show that for any plurisubharmonic function with log
canonical singularities, its associated multiplier ideal subscheme is weakly
normal, by which we give a complete classification of multiplier ideal
subschemes with log canonical singularities.

  Power Transfer?","TVT",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power
energy-limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous
vehicles, for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Conventional WPCNs rely
only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically
inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation.
Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can
scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and
cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these
energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the
above, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest
energy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also
exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the
dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient,
WPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). To analytically
characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and
reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we
further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is
activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when
WPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on
the devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue.
Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.

supervised classifier without any labeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation
is able to overcome this challenge by transferring knowledge from a labeled
source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Transferability and
discriminability are two key criteria for characterizing the superiority of
feature representations to enable successful domain adaptation. In this paper,
a novel method called \textit{learning TransFerable and Discriminative Features

objectives simultaneously. On the one hand, distribution alignment is performed
to reduce domain discrepancy and learn more transferable representations.
Instead of adopting \textit{Maximum Mean Discrepancy} (MMD) which only captures
the first-order statistical information to measure distribution discrepancy, we
adopt a recently proposed statistic called \textit{Maximum Mean and Covariance
Discrepancy} (MMCD), which can not only capture the first-order statistical
information but also capture the second-order statistical information in the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). On the other hand, we propose to
explore both local discriminative information via manifold regularization and
global discriminative information via minimizing the proposed \textit{class
confusion} objective to learn more discriminative features, respectively. We
integrate these two objectives into the \textit{Structural Risk Minimization}

large number has been found rotating synchronously around their parent star,

very uneven stellar heating. Synchronous rotation of these planets causes one
side of the planet to permanently face the parent star while the other side
remains dark. This results in an extreme climatic condition that is not
feasible for sustaining life. Although these theories about exoplanets are well

establish a connection to the unique derivative coupling arising in the quartic
Lagrangian of the systematic construction of massive $2-$form interactions,
relating in this way BF theories to Galileon-like theories of 2-forms. In terms
of a massless $1-$form $A$ and a massless $2-$form $B$, the topological term
manifests itself as the interaction $B\wedge F$, where $F = {\rm d} A$ is the
field strength of the $1-$form. Such an interaction leads to a mechanism of
generation of mass, usually referred to as ""topological generation of mass"" in
which the single degree of freedom propagated by the $2-$form is absorbed by
the $1-$form, generating a massive mode for the $1-$form. Using the
systematical construction in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor, it was shown
that, apart from the quadratic and quartic Lagrangians, Galileon-like
derivative self-interactions for the massive 2-form do not exist. A unique
quartic Lagrangian
$\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}_{\;\;\;\;\;\;\sigma}\partial_{\mu}B_{\alpha\rho}\partial_{\nu}B_{\beta\gamma}$
arises in this construction in a way that it corresponds to a total derivative
on its own but ceases to be so once an overall general function is introduced.
We show that it exactly corresponds to the same interaction of topological mass
generation. Based on the decoupling limit analysis of the interactions, we
bring out supporting arguments for the uniqueness of such a topological mass
term and absence of the Galileon-like interactions. Finally, we discuss some
preliminary applications in cosmology.

to support very high speed wireless communications. A substantial increase in
spectrum efficiency for mmWave transmission can be achieved by using advanced
hybrid precoding, for which accurate channel state information is the key.
Rather than estimating the entire channel matrix, directly estimating subspace
information, which contains fewer parameters, does have enough information to
design transceivers. However, the large channel use overhead and associated
computational complexity in the existing channel subspace estimation techniques
are major obstacles to deploy the subspace approach for channel estimation. In
this paper, we propose a sequential two-stage subspace estimation method that
can resolve the overhead issues and provide accurate subspace information.
Utilizing a sequential method enables us to avoid manipulating the entire
high-dimensional training signal, which greatly reduces the complexity.
Specifically, in the first stage, the proposed method samples the columns of
channel matrix to estimate its column subspace. Then, based on the obtained
column subspace, it optimizes the training signals to estimate the row
subspace. For a channel with $N_r$ receive antennas and $N_t$ transmit
antennas, our analysis shows that the proposed technique only requires $O(N_t)$
channel uses, while providing a guarantee of subspace estimation accuracy. By
theoretical analysis, it is shown that the similarity between the estimated
subspace and the true subspace is linearly related to the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), i.e., $O(\text{SNR})$, at high SNR, while quadratically related to the
SNR, i.e., $O(\text{SNR}^2)$, at low SNR. Simulation results show that the
proposed sequential subspace method can provide improved subspace accuracy,
normalized mean squared error, and spectrum efficiency over existing methods.

unlabeled data with observations on $X$ only as well as a surrogate variable
$S$ that is predictive of $Y$ and available for all patients, under a high

$X$ only through $Y$ and allowing it to hold approximately, we propose a prior
adaptive semi-supervised (PASS) estimator that adaptively incorporates the
prior knowledge by shrinking the estimator towards a direction derived under
the prior. We derive asymptotic theory for the proposed estimator and
demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators via simulation studies.

in the corona. However, this coronal-reconnection model has difficulty in
explaining the recently discovered small WLFs. Here we report a C2.3
white-light flare, which are associated with several observational phenomena:
fast decrease in opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fluxes, disappearance
of two adjacent pores, significant heating of the lower chromosphere,
negligible increase of hard X-ray flux, and an associated U-shaped magnetic
field configuration. All these suggest that this white-light flare is powered
by magnetic reconnection in the lower part of the solar atmosphere rather than
by reconnection higher up in the corona.

orientation of spins in the bonds but not on the direction of each individual
spin. Thus, for insulating multiferroic compounds, P can be decomposed in terms
of pairwise isotropic, antisymmetric, and anisotropic contributions, which can
be rigorously derived in the framework of the superexchange (SE) theory, in an
analogy with the spin Hamiltonian. The SE theory also allows us to identify the
microscopic mechanism, which stands behind each contribution. The most
controversial and intriguing one is antisymmetric or spin-current mechanism. In
this work, we propose that the disputed magnetoelectric (ME) properties of
Ba2CuGe2O7 can be explained solely by the spin-current mechanism, while other
contributions are either small or forbidden by symmetry. First we explicitly
show how the cycloidal spin order induces the experimentally observed P in the
direction perpendicular to the xy plane, which can be naturally explained by
the spin-current mechanism operating in the out-of-plane bonds. Then, we unveil
previously overlooked ME effect, where the application of the magnetic field
perpendicular to the plane not only causes the incommensurate-commensurate
transition, but also flips P into the plane due to the spin-current mechanism
operating in the neighboring bonds within this plane. In both cases, the
magnitude and direction of P can be controlled by rotating the spin pattern in
the xy plane. Our analysis is based on a realistic spin model, which was
rigorously derived from the first-principles calculations and supplemented with

dynamic evaluation, when running a model on an unseen file, the model is

more targeted information (support tokens) for adaptation, that is both before

auto-completion in an IDE. Leveraging recent developments in meta-learning such

experiments on a large scale Java GitHub corpus, compared to other adaptation
baselines including dynamic evaluation. Moreover, our analysis shows that,
compared to a non-adaptive baseline, our approach improves performance on

entities. Since supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in galaxies of all
sizes, SMBH binaries (SMBHBs) are generally expected to form during the
amalgamation of galaxies. It is unclear what fraction of these binaries could
eventually merge, but a general consensus is that initially the orbital decay
is mediated by the surrounding gas and stars. In this Letter, we show that in
active galactic nulcei (AGNs) the radiation field also causes the orbits of the
accreting SMBHs to shrink. The corresponding mechanism, known as the
""Poynting-Robertson drag"" (PR drag), takes effect on a well-defined timescale
$CT_{\rm Sal}$, where $T_{\rm Sal}$ is the Salpeter timescale of the AGN,
presumably coincide with the primary SMBH, and
$C=4\xi^{-1}\epsilon^{-1}q^{1/3}(1+q)^{2/3}(1-\epsilon)$ is a constant
determined by the radiative efficiency $\epsilon$, the mass ratio $q$ of the
two black holes, and a parameter $\xi$ characterizing the size of the
circum-secondary accretion disk. We find that when $q\lesssim$a
few$\times10^{-5}$, the PR drag is more efficient in shrinking the binary than
many other mechanisms, such as dynamical friction and type-I migration. Our
finding points to a possible new channel for the coalescence of unequal SMBHBs

$N$ using a noisy comparator. The noise is modelled as follows: given two
elements to compare, if the values of the elements differ by at least $\alpha$
by some metric defined on the elements, then the comparison will be made
correctly; if the values of the elements are closer than $\alpha$, the outcome
of the comparison is not subject to any guarantees. We demonstrate a quantum
algorithm for noisy quantum minimum-finding that preserves the quadratic
speedup of the noiseless case: our algorithm runs in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{N
(1+\Delta)})$, where $\Delta$ is an upper-bound on the number of elements
within the interval $\alpha$, and outputs a good approximation of the true
minimum with high probability. Our noisy comparator model is motivated by the
problem of hypothesis selection, where given a set of $N$ known candidate
probability distributions and samples from an unknown target distribution, one
seeks to output some candidate distribution $O(\varepsilon)$-close to the
unknown target. Much work on the classical front has been devoted to speeding
up the run time of classical hypothesis selection from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, in
part by using statistical primitives such as the Scheff\'{e} test. Assuming a
quantum oracle generalization of the classical data access and applying our
noisy quantum minimum-finding algorithm, we take this run time into the
sublinear regime. The final expected run time is $\tilde O(
\sqrt{N(1+\Delta)})$, with the same $O(\log N)$ sample complexity from the
unknown distribution as the classical algorithm. We expect robust quantum
minimum-finding to be a useful building block for algorithms in situations
where the comparator (which may be another quantum or classical algorithm) is

alternative algorithms. Bayesian Delegation is also a capable ad-hoc

long-time dynamics of the NKGE with small initial data (and $O(1)$ cubic

numerical methods depend significantly on the small parameter $\varepsilon$,
which causes severe numerical burdens as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$. The EWI-FP
method is fully explicit, symmetric in time and has many superior properties in
solving wave equations. By adapting the energy method combined with the method

such as CO can be used to determine the disk structure in the warm inner parts.
The $v2/v1$ ro-vibrational ratio of $v_{1-0}$ and $v_{2-1}$ transitions has
been recently observed to follow distinct trends with the CO emitting radius,
in a sample of TTauri and Herbig disks; these trends have been empirically
interpreted as due to inner disk depletion from gas and dust. In this work we
use existing thermo-chemical disk models to explore the interpretation of these
observed trends in ro-vibrational CO emission. We use the radiation
thermo-chemical code ProDiMo, exploring a set of previously published models
with different disk properties and varying one parameter at a time: the inner
radius, the dust-to-gas mass ratio, the gas mass. In addition, we use models
where we change the surface density power law index, and employ a larger set of
CO ro-vibrational levels, including also fluorescence from the first electronic
state. We investigate these models for both TTauri and Herbig star disks.
Finally, we include a set of DIANA models for individual TTauri and Herbig
disks which were constructed to reproduce a large set of multi-wavelength

restricted to $0.01 < x < 0.40$. Protons and antiprotons are identified in the

this ratio becomes closer to the expectation of next-to-leading order pQCD. The

consists of the face descriptors in each image, and given a query for multiple

architecture -- {\em SetNet} -- to achieve the objective: it learns face
descriptors and their aggregation over a set to produce a compact fixed length
descriptor designed for set retrieval, and the score of an image is a count of
the number of identities that match the query; second, we show that this
compact descriptor has minimal loss of discriminability up to two faces per
image, and degrades slowly after that -- far exceeding a number of baselines;
third, we explore the speed vs.\ retrieval quality trade-off for set retrieval
using this compact descriptor; and, finally, we collect and annotate a large
dataset of images containing various number of celebrities, which we use for
evaluation and is publicly released.

processing layers forms deep network models by learning features of data on
specific task through big dataset. Deep network models have powerful and
hierarchical representation of data, and have brought about breakthroughs for
visual encoding, while revealing hierarchical structural similarity with the
manner of information processing in human visual cortices. However, previous
studies almost used image features of those deep network models pre-trained on
classification task to construct visual encoding models. Except for deep
network structure, the task or corresponding big dataset is also important for
deep network models, but neglected by previous studies. Because image
classification is a relatively fundamental task, it is difficult to guide deep
network models to master high-level semantic representations of data, which
causes into that encoding performance for high-level visual cortices is
limited. In this study, we introduced one higher-level vision task: image
caption (IC) task and proposed the visual encoding model based on IC features
(ICFVEM) to encode voxels of high-level visual cortices. Experiment
demonstrated that ICFVEM obtained better encoding performance than previous
deep network models pre-trained on classification task. In addition, the
interpretation of voxels was realized to explore the detailed characteristics
of voxels based on the visualization of semantic words, and comparative

functional theory is employed on the graphene/ammonia system. We identify the
effects on the band structure due to strain, charge transfer and presence of
molecular orbitals (MOs) of NH3 for six adsorption configurations. The induced
strain upon ammonia-adsorption opens the bandgap (Eg) of graphene due to the
breaking of translational symmetry and shifts the equilibrium Fermi energy
(EF). The Eg and EF values and charge density distribution are dependent on the
adsorption configuration, where the MO structure of NH3 plays a crucial role.
The presence of MOs of N or H -originated pushes the unoccupied states of
graphene towards EF. NH3 forms an interfacial occupied state originating from
N2p below the EF within 1.6 - 2.2 eV for all configurations. These findings
enhance the fundamental understanding of the graphene/NH3 system.

the Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem is solved for some particular parameter

generation into account, the concept of prosumer-based microgrids gives the
opportunity to rethink structuring and operation of power systems from scratch.
In a prosumer-based microgrid, each power grid node can feed energy into the
grid and draw energy from the grid. The concept allows for spatial aggregation
such that also an interaction between microgrids can be represented as a
prosumer-based microgrid. The contribution of this work is threefold: (i) we
propose a decentralized hierarchical control approach in a network including
different time scales, (ii) we use iterative learning control to compensate
periodic demand patterns and save lower layer control energy and (iii) we
assure asymptotic stability and monotonic convergence in the iteration domain
for the linearized dynamics and validate the performance by simulating the
nonlinear dynamics.

of the new actors in the system requires new concepts for structuring the power
grid, and achieving a wide range of control tasks ranging from seconds to days.
Here we introduce a multiplex dynamical network model covering all control
timescales. Crucially, we combine a decentralised, self-organised low-level
control and a smart grid layer of devices that can aggregate information from
remote sources. The safety-critical task of frequency control is performed by
the former, the economic objective of demand matching dispatch by the latter.
Having both aspects present in the same model allows us to study the
interaction between the layers. Remarkably, we find that adding communication
in the form of aggregation does not improve the performance in the cases
considered. Instead, the self-organised state of the system already contains
the information required to learn the demand structure in the entire grid. The
model introduced here is highly flexible, and can accommodate a wide range of
scenarios relevant to future power grids. We expect that it is especially
useful in the context of low-energy microgrids with distributed generation.

problems with a convex cost function without a regularity assumption that is
often supposed in the proof of the lower semicontinuity of an action integral.
In our new approach, we prove that the stochastic optimal transportation
problems with a convex cost function are equivalent to a class of variational
problems for the Fokker-Planck equation, which lets us revisit them. It is done
by the so-called superposition principle and by an idea from the mather theory.
The superposition principle is the construction of a semimartingale from the
Fokker-Planck equation and can be considered a class of the so-called marginal
problems that construct stochastic processes from given marginal distributions.
It was first considered in stochastic mechanics by E. Nelson, called Nelson's
problem, and was proved by E. Carlen first. The semimartingale is called the
Nelson process, provided it is Markovian. We also consider the Markov property
of a minimizer of the stochastic optimal transportation problem with a
nonconvex cost in a one-dimensional case. In the proof, the superposition
principle and the minimizer of an optimal transportation problem with a concave
cost function play crucial roles. Lastly, we prove the semiconcavity and the
Lipschitz continuity of Schrodinger's problem that is a typical example of the
stochastic optimal transportation problem.

Massive Interacting Particles (WIMPs) Dark Matter. The directional signature
provides in addition, an unique way to overcome the neutron and neutrino
backgrounds. In order to get the directional signature, the DDM detectors
should be sensitive to low nuclear energy recoils in the keV range and have an
angular resolution better than $20^{\circ}$. We have performed experiments with
low energy ($<30\,\mathrm{keV}$) ion beam facilities to measure the angular
distribution of nuclear recoil tracks in a MIMAC detector prototype. In this
paper, we study angular spreads with respect to the electron drift direction
($0^{\circ}$ incident angle) of Fluorine nuclear tracks in this low energy
range, and show nuclear recoil angle reconstruction produced by a monoenergetic
neutron field experiment. We find that a high-gain systematic effect leads to a
high angular resolution along the electron drift direction. The measured
angular distribution is impacted by diffusion, and space charge or ion feedback
effects, which can be corrected for by an asymmetry factor observed in the
flash-ADC profile. The estimated angular resolution of the $0^{\circ}$ incident
ion is better than $15^{\circ}$ at $10$ keV kinetic energy and agrees with the
simulations within $20$%. The distributions from the nuclear recoils have been
compared with simulated results based on a modified Garfield++ code. Our study
shows that protons would be a more adapted target than heavier nuclei for DDMD
of light WIMPs. We demonstrate that directional signature from the Galactic
halo origin of a Dark Matter WIMP signal is experimentally achievable, with a
deep understanding of the operating conditions of a low pressure detector with
its diffusion mechanism.

the derivation of the distance estimation in practical MC systems. According to
this approach, transmitted molecules are considered as moving droplets in the
MC channel. With this approach, the Fluid Dynamics-Based Distance Estimation
(FDDE) algorithm which predicts the propagation distance of the transmitted
droplets by updating the diameter of evaporating droplets at each time step is
proposed. FDDE algorithm is validated by experimental data. The results reveal
that the distance can be estimated by the fluid dynamics approach which
introduces novel parameters such as the volume fraction of droplets in a
mixture of air and liquid droplets and the beamwidth of the TX. Furthermore,
the effect of the evaporation is shown with the numerical results.

novel optimization problem, and report on a series of experiments on the MNIST

strategy, which is the main contribution of this article. It consists of a
self-construct radial basis function neural network inversion (SRBFNNI)
decoupling scheme and hybrid adaptive feed-forward internal model control
(HAFIMC). The former one enables the MVIP to create a self inverse model with
little prior knowledge and achieving self-decoupling. For the unique structure
of MVIP, the vibration control problem is stated and addressed by the proposed
HAFIMC, which utilizes the adaptive part to deal with the periodical
disturbance and the internal mode part to deal with the stability.

While hunting for this hypothetical nuclear process, a significant amount of
two-neutrino double beta decay data has become available. Although these events
are regarded and studied mostly as the background of neutrinoless double beta
decay, they can be also used to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In
this paper we show how the presence of right-handed leptonic currents would
affect the energy distribution and angular correlation of the outgoing
electrons in two-neutrino double beta decay. Consequently, we estimate
constraints imposed by currently available data on the existence of
right-handed neutrino interactions without having to assume their nature. In
this way our results complement the bounds coming from the non-observation of
neutrinoless double beta decay as they limit also the exotic interactions of
Dirac neutrinos. We perform a detailed calculation of two-neutrino double beta
decay under the presence of exotic (axial-)vector currents and we demonstrate
that current experimental searches can be competitive to existing limits.

represent and transmit information, which is not only biologically realistic
but also suitable for ultra-low-power event-driven neuromorphic implementation.
Motivated by the success of deep learning, the study of Deep Spiking Neural
Networks (DeepSNNs) provides promising directions for artificial intelligence
applications. However, training of DeepSNNs is not straightforward because the
well-studied error back-propagation (BP) algorithm is not directly applicable.
In this paper, we first establish an understanding as to why error
back-propagation does not work well in DeepSNNs. To address this problem, we
propose a simple yet efficient Rectified Linear Postsynaptic Potential function
(ReL-PSP) for spiking neurons and propose a Spike-Timing-Dependent
Back-Propagation (STDBP) learning algorithm for DeepSNNs. In STDBP algorithm,
the timing of individual spikes is used to convey information (temporal
coding), and learning (back-propagation) is performed based on spike timing in
an event-driven manner. Our experimental results show that the proposed
learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in single
spike time based learning algorithms of DeepSNNs. Furthermore, by utilizing the
trained model parameters obtained from the proposed STDBP learning algorithm,
we demonstrate the ultra-low-power inference operations on a recently proposed
neuromorphic inference accelerator. Experimental results show that the
neuromorphic hardware consumes 0.751~mW of the total power consumption and
achieves a low latency of 47.71~ms to classify an image from the MNIST dataset.
Overall, this work investigates the contribution of spike timing dynamics to
information encoding, synaptic plasticity and decision making, providing a new
perspective to design of future DeepSNNs and neuromorphic hardware systems.

great significance for the localization, evaluation and diagnosis of stenosis
and plaque in the arteries, as well as for the assisted navigation of
interventional surgery. In the clinical practice, physicians use a few angles
of coronary angiography to capture arterial images, so it is of great practical
value to perform 3D reconstruction directly from coronary angiography images.
However, this is a very difficult computer vision task due to the complex shape
of coronary blood vessels, as well as the lack of data set and key point
labeling. With the rise of deep learning, more and more work is being done to
reconstruct 3D models of human organs from medical images using deep neural
networks. We propose an adversarial and generative way to reconstruct three
dimensional coronary artery models, from two different views of angiographic
images of coronary arteries. With 3D fully supervised learning and 2D weakly
supervised learning schemes, we obtained reconstruction accuracies that
outperform state-of-art techniques.

localization (MBL) transition when recast in terms of a single-particle
tight-binding model in the space of many-body configurations. We compute the
distribution of tunneling rates between many-body states separated by an
extensive number of spin flips at the lowest order in perturbation theory
starting from the insulator, and determine the scaling of their typical
amplitude with the number of accessible states in the Hilbert space. By using
an analogy with the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble, we propose an
ergodicity breaking criterion for the MBL transition based on the Fermi Golden
Rule. According to this criterion, in the MBL phase many resonances are formed
at large distance from an infinite temperature initial state, but they are not
enough for the quantum dynamics to decorrelate from it in a finite time. This
implies that, differently from Anderson localized states, in the insulating
phase many-body eigenstates are multifractal in the Hilbert space, as they
occupy a large but subexponential part of the total volume, in agreement with
recent numerical results, perturbative calculations, and intuitive arguments.
Possible limitations and implications of our interpretation are discussed in
the conclusions.

Specifically, we first train a linear classifier with the labeled few-shot

solve another linear regression hypothesis by increasing the sparsity of the

until all the unlabeled samples are included in the expanded training set, i.e.
the pseudo-label is converged for unlabeled data pool. Extensive experiments

non-compact but the question of whether the measure of non-compactness of such
an embedding equals to its operator norm constituted a well-known open problem.
The existing theory suggested an argument that would possibly solve the problem
should the target norms be disjointly superadditive, but the question of
disjoint superadditivity of spaces $L^{p,\infty}$ has been open, too. In this
paper, we solve both these problems. We first show that weak Lebesgue spaces
are never disjointly superadditive, so the suggested technique is ruled out.
But then we show that, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the measure of
non-compactness of a sharp Sobolev embedding coincides with the embedding norm
nevertheless, at least as long as $p<\infty$. Finally, we show that if the
target space is $L^{\infty}$ (which formally is also a weak Lebesgue space with
$p=\infty$), then the things are essentially different. To give a comprehensive
answer including this case, too, we develop a new method based on a rather
unexpected combinatorial argument and prove thereby a general principle, whose
special case implies that the measure of non-compactness, in this case, is
strictly less than its norm. We develop a technique that enables us to evaluate
this measure of non-compactness exactly.

achieved by the ECOC approach. We do so by proposing a new adversarial attack
specifically designed for multi-label classification architectures, like the
ECOC-based one, and by applying two existing attacks. In contrast to previous
findings, our analysis reveals that ECOC-based networks can be attacked quite
easily by introducing a small adversarial perturbation. Moreover, the
adversarial examples can be generated in such a way to achieve high
probabilities for the predicted target class, hence making it difficult to use
the prediction confidence to detect them. Our findings are proven by means of
experimental results obtained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB classification
tasks.

no-overbidding assumption but has completely overlooked the no-underbidding
phenomenon, which is evident in empirical studies on variants of the second
price auction. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the
no-underbidding phenomenon. We study the PoA of simultaneous 2nd price auctions
(S2PA) under a new natural condition of {\em no underbidding}, meaning that
agents never bid on items less than their marginal values. We establish
improved (mostly tight) bounds on the PoA of S2PA under no underbidding for
different valuation classes (including unit-demand, submodular, XOS,
subadditive, and general monotone valuations), in both full-information and
incomplete information settings.
  To derive our results, we introduce a new parameterized property of auctions,
termed $(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed, which implies a PoA of at least
$\gamma/(1+\delta)$. Via extension theorems, this guarantee extends to coarse
correlated equilibria (CCE) in full information settings, and to Bayesian PoA
(BPoA) in settings with incomplete information and arbitrary (correlated)
distributions. We then show that S2PA are $(1,1)$-revenue guaranteed with
respect to bids satisfying no underbidding. This implies a PoA of at least
$1/2$ for general monotone valuation, which extends to BPOA with arbitrary
correlated distributions. Moreover, we show that $(\lambda,\mu)$-smoothness
combined with $(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed guarantees a PoA of at least
$(\gamma+\lambda)/(1+\delta+\mu)$. This implies a host of results, such as a
tight PoA of $2/3$ for S2PA with submodular (or XOS) valuations, under no
overbidding and no underbidding. Beyond establishing improved bounds for S2PA,
the no underbidding assumption sheds new light on the performance of S2PA

disease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional

estimates the causal effect of a treatment when its assignment is defined by a
threshold value for a continuous assignment variable. The RDD assumes that
subjects with measurements within a bandwidth around the threshold belong to a
common population, so that the threshold can be seen as a randomising device
assigning treatment to those falling just above the threshold and withholding
it from those who fall just below.
  Bandwidth selection represents a compelling decision for the RDD analysis as
the results may be highly sensitive to its choice. A number of methods to
select the optimal bandwidth, mainly originating from the econometric
literature, have been proposed. However, their use in practice is limited.
  We propose a methodology that, tackling the problem from an applied point of
view, consider units' exchangeability, i.e., their similarity with respect to
measured covariates, as the main criteria to select subjects for the analysis,
irrespectively of their distance from the threshold. We carry out clustering on
the sample using a Dirichlet process mixture model to identify balanced and
homogeneous clusters. Our proposal exploits the posterior similarity matrix,
which contains the pairwise probabilities that two observations are allocated
to the same cluster in the MCMC sample. Thus we include in the RDD analysis
only those clusters for which we have stronger evidence of exchangeability.
  We illustrate the validity of our methodology with both a simulated

treatment techniques for SCI that include promising solutions based on

characteristics of such systems. We then introduce two novel ICT-based
treatment approaches for SCI. The first proposal is based on neural interface
systems (NIS) with enhanced feedback, where the external machines are
interfaced with the brain and the spinal cord such that the brain signals are
directly routed to the limbs for movement. The second proposal relates to the
design of self-organizing artificial neurons (ANs) that can be used to replace
the injured or dead biological neurons. Apart from SCI treatment, the proposed
methods may also be utilized as enabling technologies for neural interface
applications by acting as bio-cyber interfaces between the nervous system and

provide fresh water for families, ships, islands and so on. The conventional
inclined solar still (ISS) suffers from low efficiency and low productivity. To
improve the performance of solar still, a flat solar still (FSS) is proposed,
which has a working principle similar to the solar cell. The condensate water
in FSS is collected by the capillary grid attached under the ultra-hydrophilic
glass cover, instead of by gravity. Therefore, FSS avoids the inclined
structure and is much more compact than ISS. The daily productivity of FSS
reaches up to 4.3 kg/m2. Theoretical analysis shows that the enhanced mass
transfer in FSS by the compact structure is an important factor for high
performance. More interestingly, FSS can also be easily extended to more stage
for latent heat recovery. The results show that the daily productivity of a
double-stage FSS reaches up to 7 kg/m2, which is much higher than the
conventional solar still. FSS paves a new way in designing and optimizing of
solar still.

explain the origin of the nematic paramagnet, which breaks the

quantum order-by-disorder in the frustrated ferromagnet with a continuous

provide predictions for future inelastic neutron scattering experiments on

particular, the nematic paramagnet exhibits a characteristic pseudo-Goldstone

their temporal delay, the two pulses are identical. Using a single-atom model
of the laser-matter interaction it is shown that the photon energy of the
generated harmonics is controllable within the range of one eV -- a bandwidth
comparable to the photon energy of the fundamental field -- by varying the time
delay between the generating laser pulses. It is also demonstrated that
high-order harmonics generated by double pulses have advantageous
characteristics, which mimick certain properties of an extreme ultraviolet

the static and spherically symmetric solutions of the relativistic stars with
the nontrivial profile of the vector field satisfying the boundary conditions
$A_\mu\to 0$ at the spatial infinity, where $A_\mu$ represents the vector
field. First, we study the linear perturbations about the general relativistic
(GR) stellar solutions with the vanishing vector field $A_\mu =0$. We show that
the pure vector disformal coupling causes the ghost or gradient instability of
the GR stars, indicating the breakdown of the hyperbolicity on the GR stellar
backgrounds. On the other hand, the pure conformal coupling causes the
tachyonic instability of the GR solutions and would lead to the spontanenous
growth of the vector field toward the nontrivial solutions as in the manner of
spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor theories. We then construct the
static and spherically symmetric solutions of the relativistic stars with $0$
and $1$ nodes of the vector field in the presence of the pure disformal
coupling. We find that the properties of the solutions with the nontrivial
vector field are similar to those of the generalized Proca theories. As in the
mass-radius diagram the branches of the $0$ and $1$ node solutions are
disconnected to that of the GR solutions in the lower density regimes, they may
be formed from the selected choice of the initial conditions. Finally, we
construct the $0$ node solutions in the case of the pure conformal coupling,
and show that the branch of these solutions is connected to that of the GR
solutions in both the low and high density regions and hence would arise
spontaneously via the continuous evolution from the GR solutions.

ultracold atoms has been studied in the limit of large particle numbers, where
a semiclassical treatment is adequate. The origin of irreversibility in these
sweep experiments, where a control parameter is slowly (adiabatically) tuned
back and forth, turned out to be a passage blue back and forth across a
separatrix (integrable case) or a passage in and out of a chaotic sea in phase
space (chaotic case). Here we focus on the full quantum mechanical description
of the integrable system and show how the semiclassical results emerge in the
limit of large particle numbers. Instead of the crossing of a separatrix in
phase space, where classical adiabaticity fails, the origin of irreversibility
in the quantum system is a series of avoided crossings of the adiabatic energy
levels: they become so close that already for modest particle numbers the
change of the external parameter has to be unrealistically slow to reach the
quantum adiabatic limit of perfectly reversible evolution. For a slow but
finite sweep rate we find a broad regime where the quantum results agree with
the semiclassical results, but only if besides the limit $N\to \infty$ an
initial ensemble of states is considered, with sufficient initial energy width.
For a single initial energy eigenstate we find in contrast that the backward
sweep reveals strong quantum effects even for very large particle numbers.

indicating that the electron-electron scattering plays a dominant role in this

a colossal magneto-resistance is observed, which reaches ~350% at 9 T and

establish MoOCl2 as a strongly correlated metal and shed light on the

recognition, still suffers from numerous cluttered outliers in practical
applications. To address this issue, we present the zero-assignment constraint
(ZAC) for approaching the graph matching problem in the presence of outliers.
The underlying idea is to suppress the matchings of outliers by assigning
zero-valued vectors to the potential outliers in the obtained optimal
correspondence matrix. We provide elaborate theoretical analysis to the
problem, i.e., GM with ZAC, and figure out that the GM problem with and without
outliers are intrinsically different, which enables us to put forward a
sufficient condition to construct valid and reasonable objective function.
Consequently, we design an efficient outlier-robust algorithm to significantly
reduce the incorrect or redundant matchings caused by numerous outliers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially in

fundamentally different from those that have not been seen to repeat. One
striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME
sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than
sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple
explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed
emission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but
are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation
predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration---not a
static bimodal one---with a correlation between repetition rate and width.
Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks,
where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common
Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect
where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars. Our
model has implications for the FRB emission mechanism and energy scale,
volumetric event rates, and the application of FRBs to cosmology.

Our sample comprises 56 bright and nearby M dwarfs observed by K2 during

for 46 M dwarfs and measure photometric activity indicators such as amplitude
of the rotational signal, standard deviation of the light curves, and the basic
flare properties (flare rate, flare energy, flare duration, and flare
amplitude). We found 1662 short-cadence flares, 363 of which have a
long-cadence counterpart with flare energies of up to $5.6\cdotp10^{34}$erg.
The flare amplitude, duration, and frequency derived from the short-cadence
light curves differ significantly from those derived from the long-cadence
data. The analysis of the short-cadence light curves results in a flare rate
that is 4.6 times higher than the long-cadence data. We confirm the abrupt
change in activity level in the rotation-activity relation at a critical period
of ~10d when photometric activity diagnostics are used. This change is most
drastic in the flare duration and frequency for short-cadence data. Our flare
studies revealed that the highest flare rates are not found among the fastest
rotators and that stars with the highest flare rates do not show the most
energetic flares. We found that the superflare frequency
($E\geq5\cdotp10^{34}$erg) for the fast-rotating M stars is twice higher than
for solar like stars in the same period range. By fitting the cumulative FFD,

unique characteristics of shortness, massiveness, and dynamic. Short texts do

dynamic short texts, causing various computational challenges to the current
batch learning algorithms. This paper presents a novel framework, namely Bag of

Biterms (BoB) for representing documents, and (2) a simple way to help
statistical models to include BoB. Our framework can be easily deployed for a
large class of probabilistic models, and we demonstrate its usefulness with two
well-known models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet
Process (HDP). By exploiting both terms (words) and biterms (pairs of words),
the major advantages of BBM are: (1) it enhances the length of the documents
and makes the context more coherent by emphasizing the word connotation and
co-occurrence via Bag of Biterms, (2) it inherits inference and learning
algorithms from the primitive to make it straightforward to design online and
streaming algorithms for short texts. Extensive experiments suggest that BBM
outperforms several state-of-the-art models. We also point out that the BoB
representation performs better than the traditional representations (e.g, Bag

significantly larger Nernst thermopower than its conventional thermopower under

well as inverse estimation of biophysical and biochemical properties from
vegetation optical properties. The remote sensing estimation of foliar protein
content is a key to monitoring the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems in
particular to better understand photosynthetic capacity of plants and improve
nitrogen management in agriculture. However, no physically based leaf RT model
currently allows for proper decomposition of leaf dry matter into
nitrogen-based proteins and carbon-based constituents (CBC), estimated from
optical properties of fresh or dry foliage. We developed a new version of the
PROSPECT model, named PROSPECT-PRO, which separates nitrogen-based constituents
(proteins) from CBC (including cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and starch).
PROSPECT-PRO was calibrated and validated on subsets of the LOPEX dataset,
accounting for both fresh and dry broadleaf and grass samples. We applied an
iterative model inversion optimization algorithm to identify optimal spectral
subdomains for retrieval of leaf protein and CBC contents, with 2125-2174 nm
optimal for proteins and 2025-2349 nm optimal for CBCs. PROSPECT-PRO inversions
revealed a better performance in estimating proteins from optical properties of
fresh than dry leaves. We further tested the ability of PROSPECT-PRO to
estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) as the sum of proteins and CBC using
independent datasets acquired for numerous plant species. Results showed that
PROSPECT-PRO is fully compatible and comparable with its predecessor PROSPECT-D
in indirect estimation of LMA. We can conclude from findings of this study that
PROSPECT-PRO has a high potential in establishing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio

indirect reconstruction to sample invariant distributions of molecular dynamics
systems that exhibit a time-scale separation between the microscopic (fast)
dynamics, and the macroscopic (slow) dynamics of some low-dimensional set of
reaction coordinates. The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in
the presence of metastability by allowing larger proposal moves at the
macroscopic level, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied.
Only when the macroscopic proposal is accepted, the full microscopic state is
reconstructed from the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected
to a second accept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact
that most proposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational
cost, while microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted.
This paper discusses an indirect method to reconstruct microscopic samples from
macroscopic reaction coordinate values, that can also be applied in cases where
direct reconstruction is cumbersome. The indirect reconstruction method
generates a microscopic sample by performing a biased microscopic simulation,
starting from the previous microscopic sample and driving the microscopic state
towards the proposed reaction coordinate value. We show numerically that the
mM-MCMC scheme with indirect reconstruction can significantly extend the range
of applicability of the mM-MCMC method.

models, using both recurrent neural network (RNN) and transformer
architectures. To this end, we consider the chit-chat task, where the problem
is more prominent than in other tasks that need encoder-decoder architectures.
We first study the influence of model architectures. By using pre-attention and
highway connections for RNNs, we manage to achieve lower repetition rates.
However, this method does not generalize to other models such as transformers.
We hypothesize that the deeper reason is that in the training corpora, there
are hard tokens that are more difficult for a generative model to learn than
others and, once learning has finished, hard tokens are still under-learned, so
that repetitive generations are more likely to happen. Based on this
hypothesis, we propose token loss dynamic reweighting (TLDR) that applies
differentiable weights to individual token losses. By using higher weights for
hard tokens and lower weights for easy tokens, NLG models are able to learn
individual tokens at different paces. Experiments on chit-chat benchmark
datasets show that TLDR is more effective in repetition reduction for both RNN
and transformer architectures than baselines using different weighting
functions.

Besides, the current-induced spin polarization is usually limited to in-plane,
whereas out-of-plane spin polarization could be favored for efficient
perpendicular magnetization switching. Recent advances in utilizing two
important classes of van der Waals materials$-$topological insulators and
transition-metal dichalcogenides$-$as spin sources to generate SOT shed light
on addressing these challenges. Topological insulators such as bismuth selenide
have shown a giant SOT efficiency, which is larger than those from
three-dimensional heavy metals by at least one order of magnitude.
Transition-metal dichalcogenides such as tungsten telluride have shown a
current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization, which is allowed by the reduced
symmetry. In this review, we use symmetry arguments to predict and analyze SOTs

problems of a topological nature, which impedes any progress towards settling
the complexity of the Necklace Splitting problem. On the contrary, topological
problems have been pivotal in obtaining completeness results for PPAD and PPA,
such as the PPAD-completeness of finding a Nash equilibrium [Daskalakis et al.,
2009, Chen et al., 2009b] and the PPA-completeness of Necklace Splitting with 2
thieves [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg, 2019].
  In this paper, we provide the first topological characterization of the
classes PPA-$p$. First, we show that the computational problem associated with
a simple generalization of Tucker's Lemma, termed $p$-polygon-Tucker, as well
as the associated Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem, $p$-polygon-Borsuk-Ulam, are
PPA-$p$-complete. Then, we show that the computational version of the
well-known BSS Theorem [Barany et al., 1981], as well as the associated
BSS-Tucker problem are PPA-$p$-complete. Finally, using a different
generalization of Tucker's Lemma (termed $\mathbb{Z}_p$-star-Tucker), which we
prove to be PPA-$p$-complete, we prove that $p$-thief Necklace Splitting is in
PPA-$p$. This latter result gives a new combinatorial proof for the Necklace
Splitting theorem, the only proof of this nature other than that of Meunier
[2014].
  All of our containment results are obtained through a new combinatorial proof
for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-versions of Tucker's lemma that is a natural generalization
of the standard combinatorial proof of Tucker's lemma by Freund and Todd
[1981]. We believe that this new proof technique is of independent interest.

productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the
common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources,
is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be
examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of
potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad
slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality
rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of
Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate
sample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the
joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients
and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the
first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional
correlation case in function of the infection probability. The
multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered.
Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their
outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or
thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable.
Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular
international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is
growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the
better.

at multi-scales and their pervasive coupling with electrons and photons. Here,
we report on a nanomechanical technological platform where a silicon chip is
combined with an aluminum nitride layer. Exploiting the AlN piezoelectricity,
Surface Acoustic Waves are injected in the Si layer where the material has been
localy patterned and etched to form a suspended nanostring. Characterizing the
nanostring vertical displacement induced by the SAW, we found an external
excitation peak efficiency in excess of 500 pm/V at 1 GHz mechanical frequency.
Exploiting the long term expertise in silicon photonic and electronic devices
as well as the SAW robustness and versatility, our technological platform
represents a strong candidate for hybrid quantum systems.

Buchi, Co-Buchi, and parity automata with state based acceptance. The problem
appears to sit between finding small deterministic and finding small
nondeterministic automata, where minimality is NP-complete and PSPACE-complete,
respectively. However, recent work of Radi and Kupferman has shown that
minimising Co-Buchi automata with transition based acceptance is tractable,
which suggests that the complexity of minimising GFG automata might be cheaper
than minimising deterministic automata.
  We show for the standard state based acceptance that the minimality of a GFG
automaton is NP-complete for Buchi, Co-Buchi, and parity GFG automata. The
proofs are a surprisingly straight forward generalisation of the proofs from
deterministic Buchi automata: they use a similar reductions, and the same hard

for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase
rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may
lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest
CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age
45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of
COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross
validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of
quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to
the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the
right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left
lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment
(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.
Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity
of COVID-19, were revealed.

superdeterministic hidden-variables models of Bell correlations. We first give
an overview of superdeterminism and discuss various criticisms of it raised in
the literature. We argue that the most common criticism, the violation of
`free-will', is incorrect. We take up Bell's intuitive criticism that these
models are `conspiratorial'. To develop this further, we introduce
nonequilibrium extensions of superdeterministic models. We show that the
measurement statistics of these extended models depend on the physical system
used to determine the measurement settings. This suggests a fine-tuning in
order to eliminate this dependence from experimental observation. We also study
the signalling properties of these extended models. We show that although they
generally violate the formal no-signalling constraints, this violation cannot
be equated to an actual signal. We therefore suggest that the so-called
no-signalling constraints be more appropriately named the marginal-independence
constraints. We discuss the mechanism by which marginal-independence is
violated in superdeterministic models. Lastly, we consider a hypothetical
scenario where two experimenters use the apparent-signalling of a
superdeterministic model to communicate with each other. This scenario suggests
another conspiratorial feature peculiar to superdeterminism. These suggestions
are quantitatively developed in the second paper.

observed and the frontdoor formula applies when an observed mediator transmits
the causal effect. In this paper, we investigate the over-identified scenario
where both confounders and mediators are observed, rendering both estimators
valid. Addressing the linear Gaussian causal model, we demonstrate that either
estimator can dominate the other by an unbounded constant factor. Next, we
derive an optimal estimator, which leverages all observed variables, and bound
its finite-sample variance. We show that it strictly outperforms the backdoor

naturally described by delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs). For
these equations H-infinity norms are analyzed and their sensitivity with
respect to small delay perturbations is studied. Subsequently, numerical
methods for the H-infinity norm computation and for designing controllers
minimizing the H-infinity norm with a prescribed structure or order, based on a

the world's population to debilitating financial shocks, and have manifestly
allowed uncontrolled global inequality over the long term. Given these basic
failures, how can we avoid asking whether mainstream macroeconomic principles
are actually compatible with democratic principles such as equality or the
protection of human rights and dignity? This idea paper takes a constructive
look at this question, by exploring how alternate monetary principles might
result in a form of money more compatible with democratic principles -- dare we
call it ""democratic money""? In this alternative macroeconomic philosophy, both
the supply of and the demand for money must be rooted in people, so as to give
all people both equal opportunities for economic participation. Money must be
designed around equality, not only across all people alive at a given moment,
but also across past and future generations of people, guaranteeing that our
descendants cannot be enslaved by their ancestors' economic luck or misfortune.
Democratic money must reliably give all people a means to enable everyday
commerce, investment, and value creation in good times and bad, and must impose
hard limits on financial inequality. Democratic money must itself be governed
democratically, and must economically facilitate the needs of citizens in a
democracy for trustworthy and unbiased information with which to make wise
collective decisions. An intriguing approach to implementing and deploying
democratic money is via a cryptocurrency built on a proof-of-personhood
foundation, giving each opt-in human participant one equal unit of stake. Such
a cryptocurrency would have both interesting similarities to, and important
differences from, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) denominated in an existing
currency.

picking a subset of relevant attributes for utilizing in a predictive model.
Recently, rough set-based feature selection techniques, that employ feature
dependency to perform selection process, have been drawn attention.
Classification of tumors based on gene expression is utilized to diagnose
proper treatment and prognosis of the disease in bioinformatics applications.
Microarray gene expression data includes superfluous feature genes of high
dimensionality and smaller training instances. Since exact supervised
classification of gene expression instances in such high-dimensional problems
is very complex, the selection of appropriate genes is a crucial task for tumor
classification. In this study, we present a new technique for gene selection
using a discernibility matrix of fuzzy-rough sets. The proposed technique takes
into account the similarity of those instances that have the same and different
class labels to improve the gene selection results, while the state-of-the art
previous approaches only address the similarity of instances with different
class labels. To meet that requirement, we extend the Johnson reducer technique
into the fuzzy case. Experimental results demonstrate that this technique
provides better efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

nonlinear functionals, functional derivatives, and functional differential
equations (FDEs). The purpose of this analysis is twofold: first, we prove that
continuous nonlinear functionals, functional derivatives and FDEs can be
approximated uniformly on any compact subset of a real Banach space admitting a
basis by high-dimensional multivariate functions and high-dimensional partial
differential equations (PDEs), respectively. Second, we show that the
convergence rate of such functional approximations can be exponential,
depending on the regularity of the functional (in particular its Fr\'echet
differentiability), and its domain. We also provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for consistency, stability and convergence of cylindrical
approximations to linear FDEs. These results open the possibility to utilize
numerical techniques for high-dimensional systems such as deep neural networks
and numerical tensor methods to approximate nonlinear functionals in terms of
high-dimensional functions, and compute approximate solutions to FDEs by
solving high-dimensional PDEs. Numerical examples are presented and discussed
for prototype nonlinear functionals and for an initial value problem involving
a linear FDE.

benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed
VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets.
We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art
long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic
hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR

opioid epidemic.Instead of exhaustively searching in a huge chemical space for
better opioid antagonists, we adopt reinforcement learning which allows
efficient gradient-based search towards molecules with desired physicochemical

learning framework to discover potential lead compounds as better opioid

Thorough evaluation demonstrates that with this framework, we are able to

that studying the evolution of circuit complexity of the auxiliary system can

the Raman interaction between a THz light and visible light lasers. Two lasers,
with their frequencies differing by that of a Langmuir wave, counter-propagate
inside a background plasma, exciting a rather strong Langmuir wave. The THz
light amplification occurs through the non-resonant Raman scattering between
the THz light and one of the lasers in the presence of the mentioned Langmuir
wave. It is normally the case that the non-resonant scattering does not
exchange the energy between E \&M fields but the author demonstrates that it is
possible under the pre-exciting Langmuir wave. In the presence of a
pre-existing Langmuir wave, the ponderomotive density perturbation between the
THz light and the visible-light laser is induced with the phase suitable for
transferring the energy from the visible light laser to the THz light. The
condition for achieving the favorable phase and the amplification strength,
when the condition is met, is estimated as an mathematical formula. The gain is

nicotine-containing aerosol by heating and vaporizing a liquid. Apart from
initiating nicotine addiction in nonsmokers, a persistent concern about these
products is that their emissions often include high levels of carbonyl species,
toxicants thought to cause most non-cancer pulmonary disease in smokers.
Carbonyls are known thermal degradation products of the primary ECIG liquid
constituents: propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG). To date, there
is no method available to predict the operating conditions for which an ECIG of
a given design will emit large quantities of carbonyls. This study examined
whether the phenomenon of film boiling can account for observations of high
carbonyl emissions under certain operating conditions, and if so, whether film
boiling theory can be invoked to predict conditions where such emissions are
likely. We measured the critical heat flux for several common heating materials
and liquids, and carbonyl emissions for several ECIG types while varying power.
We found that emissions rise drastically whenever power exceeds the value
corresponding to the critical heat flux. While limiting the heat flux to below
this threshold can greatly reduce carbonyl exposure, ECIG manufacturer
operating instructions often exceed it. Product regulations that limit heat
flux may reduce the public health burden of electronic cigarette use.
