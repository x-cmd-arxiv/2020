analog neuromorphic computing architecture. It describes the second-generation
BrainScales-2 (BSS-2) version and its most recent in-silico realization, the
HICANN-X Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), as it has been
developed as part of the neuromorphic computing activities within the European
Human Brain Project (HBP). While the first generation is implemented in an
180nm process, the second generation uses 65nm technology. This allows the
integration of a digital plasticity processing unit, a highly-parallel micro
processor specially built for the computational needs of learning in an
accelerated analog neuromorphic systems. The presented architecture is based
upon a continuous-time, analog, physical model implementation of neurons and
synapses, resembling an analog neuromorphic accelerator attached to build-in
digital compute cores. While the analog part emulates the spike-based dynamics
of the neural network in continuous-time, the latter simulates biological
processes happening on a slower time-scale, like structural and parameter
changes. Compared to biological time-scales, the emulation is highly
accelerated, i.e. all time-constants are several orders of magnitude smaller
than in biology. Programmable ion channel emulation and inter-compartmental
conductances allow the modeling of nonlinear dendrites, back-propagating
action-potentials as well as NMDA and Calcium plateau potentials. To extend the
usability of the analog accelerator, it also supports vector-matrix
multiplication. Thereby, BSS-2 supports inference of deep convolutional
networks as well as local-learning with complex ensembles of spiking neurons
within the same substrate.

  based on power law scaling exponents","6 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The number of corona virus (COVID-19) infections grows worldwide. In order to
create short term predictions to prepare for the extent of the global pandemic
we analyze infection data from the top 25 affected countries. It is shown that
all country-specific infection rates follow a power law growth behavior and the
scaling exponents per country are calculated. We find two different growth
patterns: either steady power law growth from the very beginning with moderate
scaling exponents of 3-5 or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling
exponents of 8-11. In the case of the USA we even find an exponent of 16.59. By
means of data analysis we confirm that instituting strict measures of
lock-downs combined with a strong adherence by the population are effective
means to bring the growth rates down. While many countries have instituted
measures there are only three countries (Denmark, Norway, and South Korea) so
far where such lock-downs led to a significant reduction of the growth rate. In
the case of Denmark we calculate the reduction of the scaling exponents to move
from 6.82 to 1.47.

applications where prior distributions and further model parameters are

consider the particular rank-one case, where the known matrices are outer
products of iid. zero-mean subgaussian $n$-dimensional complex vectors. We show
that, for given $n$ and $N$, one can recover nonnegative $s$--sparse weights

error estimate scales linearly in the instantaneous noise power whereby the

important if the magnitude of the additive distortion depends on the unknown

to the antidiffusive part of a nearly entropy conservative numerical flux is
generally insufficient to prevent violations of local bounds in shock regions.
Our monolithic convex limiting technique adjusts a given target flux in a
manner which guarantees preservation of invariant domains, validity of local
maximum principles, and entropy stability. The new methodology combines the
advantages of modern entropy stable/entropy conservative schemes and their
local extremum diminishing counterparts. The process of algebraic flux
correction is based on inequality constraints which provably provide the
desired properties. No free parameters are involved. The proposed algebraic

range of simulation conditions. While most linear models resulted in minimal
bias, non-linear models and population-weighted versions of classic linear
two-way fixed effect and linear GEE models yielded considerable bias (60 to
160%). Further, root mean square error is minimized by linear AR models when
examining crude mortality rates and by negative binomial models when examining
raw death counts. In the context of frequentist hypothesis testing, many models
yielded high Type I error rates and very low rates of correctly rejecting the
null hypothesis (< 10%), raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy
effectiveness. When considering performance across models, the linear
autoregressive models were optimal in terms of directional bias, root mean
squared error, Type I error, and correct rejection rates. These findings
highlight notable limitations of traditional statistical models commonly used
for DID designs, designs widely used in opioid policy studies and in state

exhibits a $T^2$ dependent dc resistivity below $\approx$ 30 K. Nevertheless,
previous optical studies in the infrared and terahertz range show non-Drude
dynamics at low temperatures which seem to contradict a Fermi-liquid picture
with long-lived quasiparticles. In this work, we measure the low-frequency THz
range response of thin films with residual resistivity ratios, $\rho_{300K}/
\rho_{4K} \approx$ 74. Such low disorder samples allow an unprecedented look at
the effects of electron-electron interactions on low-frequency transport. At
temperatures below 30 K, we found both a very sharp zero-frequency mode which
has a width narrower than $k_BT/\hbar$ as well as a broader zero frequency
Lorentzian that has at least an order of magnitude larger scattering rate. Both
features have temperature dependencies consistent with a Fermi-liquid with the
wider feature explicitly showing a T$^2$ scaling. Such two -Drude transport
sheds light on previous reports of the violation of Mathielssen's rule and
extreme sensitivity to disorder in metallic ruthenates. We consider a number of
possibilities for the origin of the two feature optical conductivity including
multiband effects that arise from momentum conserving interband scattering and

accurate harvest and grain marketing decisions minimizing possible losses of
profitability. A well developed corn ear can have up to 800 kernels, but
manually counting the kernels on an ear of corn is labor-intensive, time
consuming and prone to human error. From an algorithmic perspective, the
detection of the kernels from a single corn ear image is challenging due to the
large number of kernels at different angles and very small distance among the
kernels. In this paper, we propose a kernel detection and counting method based
on a sliding window approach. The proposed method detect and counts all corn
kernels in a single corn ear image taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions.
The sliding window approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for
kernel detection. Then, a non-maximum suppression (NMS) is applied to remove
overlapping detections. Finally, windows that are classified as kernel are
passed to another CNN regression model for finding the (x,y) coordinates of the
center of kernel image patches. Our experiments indicate that the proposed
method can successfully detect the corn kernels with a low detection error and
is also able to detect kernels on a batch of corn ears positioned at different
angles.

disjointed clusters when annealed below their melting temperature. The breakup
process is studied for different temperatures and orientations of the nanowire
axis relative to its internal crystal structure using the Monte Carlo kinetic
method. We have also presented an approximate analytical model of the
instability of nanowires. Generally, the interpretation of experimental results
refers to the theoretical model developed by Nichols and Mullins, which is
based on conceptions about the Rayleigh instability of liquid jets. In both
cases, the theories - which do not take into account the anisotropy of surface
energy density - predict the breakup of a nanowire/liquid jet with radius r
into fragments with an average length {\Lambda}=9r. However, the observed
value, {\Lambda}/r, often deviates from 9 either to lower values or to
substantially greater ones (up to 24-30). Our results explain various observed
features of the breakup and the significant variations in the values of its
parameter {\Lambda}/r depending on experimental conditions. In particular, the
ambiguous role of exchange by atoms of the surface of a nanowire with the
surrounding layer of free atoms formed as a result of their rather intensive
sublimation, which occurs in a number of cases, has been investigated. We have
shown that this exchange can lead both to a decrease, and to a significant
increase, in the parameter {\Lambda}/r. The obtained results could be
potentially useful in applications such as the development of optical
waveguides based on ordered nanoparticles chains.

of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking
into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters
determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using
data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is
capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of
confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The
drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different
countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as
the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the
occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating
its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that
insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented
infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that
country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model
predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did
not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is
that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a
non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been
deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently
imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving
into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting
the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the
hidden individuals.

in delay constrained wireless networks and notably in the context of ultra
reliable low latency communications (URLLC) in beyond fifth generation (B5G)
systems. However, W-SKG schemes are known to be malleable over the so called

attacker can act as a man-in-the-middle (MiM) by injecting pilot signals and/or
can mount denial of service attacks (DoS) in the form of jamming. This paper
investigates the impact of injection and reactive jamming attacks in W-SKG.
First, it is demonstrated that injection attacks can be reduced to -
potentially less harmful - jamming attacks by pilot randomization; a novel
system design with randomized QPSK pilots is presented. Subsequently, the
optimal jamming strategy is identified in a block fading additive white
Gaussian noise (BF-AWGN) channel in the presence of a reactive jammer, using a
game theoretic formulation. It is shown that the impact of a reactive jammer is
far more severe than that of a simple proactive jammer

people worldwide. About 3 to 4 million people with diabetes become blind
because of DR every year. Diagnosis of DR through color fundus images is a
common approach to mitigate such problem. However, DR diagnosis is a difficult
and time consuming task, which requires experienced clinicians to identify the
presence and significance of many small features on high resolution images.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has proved to be a promising approach for
automatic biomedical image analysis recently. In this work, we investigate
lesion detection on DR fundus images with CNN-based object detection methods.
Lesion detection on fundus images faces two unique challenges. The first one is
that our dataset is not fully labeled, i.e., only a subset of all lesion
instances are marked. Not only will these unlabeled lesion instances not
contribute to the training of the model, but also they will be mistakenly
counted as false negatives, leading the model move to the opposite direction.
The second challenge is that the lesion instances are usually very small,
making them difficult to be found by normal object detectors. To address the
first challenge, we introduce an iterative training algorithm for the
semi-supervised method of pseudo-labeling, in which a considerable number of
unlabeled lesion instances can be discovered to boost the performance of the
lesion detector. For the small size targets problem, we extend both the input
size and the depth of feature pyramid network (FPN) to produce a large CNN
feature map, which can preserve the detail of small lesions and thus enhance
the effectiveness of the lesion detector. The experimental results show that
our proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines.

  Analysis",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Video content is responsible for more than 70% of the global IP traffic.
Consequently, it is important for content delivery infrastructures to rapidly
detect and respond to changes in content popularity dynamics. In this paper, we
propose the employment of on-line change point (CP) analysis to implement
real-time, autonomous and low-complexity video content popularity detection.
Our proposal, denoted as real-time change point detector (RCPD), estimates the
existence, the number and the direction of changes on the average number of
video visits by combining: (i) off-line and on-line CP detection algorithms;
(ii) an improved time-series segmentation heuristic for the reliable detection
of multiple CPs; and (iii) two algorithms for the identification of the
direction of changes. The proposed detector is validated against synthetic
data, as well as a large database of real YouTube video visits. It is
demonstrated that the RCPD can accurately identify changes in the average
content popularity and the direction of change. In particular, the success rate
of the RCPD over synthetic data is shown to exceed 94% for medium and large
changes in content popularity. Additionally,the dynamic time warping distance,
between the actual and the estimated changes, has been found to range
between20sampleson average, over synthetic data, to52samples, in real data.The
rapid responsiveness of the RCPD is instrumental in the deployment of
real-time, lightweight load balancing solutions, as shown in a real example.

take a step towards a more physical understanding of actions. We address the
problem of inferring contact points and the physical forces from videos of
humans interacting with objects. One of the main challenges in tackling this
problem is obtaining ground-truth labels for forces. We sidestep this problem
by instead using a physics simulator for supervision. Specifically, we use a
simulator to predict effects and enforce that estimated forces must lead to the
same effect as depicted in the video. Our quantitative and qualitative results
show that (a) we can predict meaningful forces from videos whose effects lead
to accurate imitation of the motions observed, (b) by jointly optimizing for
contact point and force prediction, we can improve the performance on both
tasks in comparison to independent training, and (c) we can learn a
representation from this model that generalizes to novel objects using few shot

interaction (FSI) involving rigid bodies immersed in viscous incompressible
fluids. The capabilities of this methodology are demonstrated for a range of
benchmark test cases along with large-scale models of biomedical FSI. The
numerical approach developed herein, which we refer to as an immersed
Lagrangian-Eulerian method, integrates aspects of partitioned and immersed FSI
formulations by solving separate momentum equations for the fluid and solid
subdomains, as in a partitioned formulation, while also using non-conforming
discretizations of the dynamic fluid and structure regions, as in an immersed
formulation. A Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme is used, in which the motion
of the immersed solid is driven by fluid traction forces evaluated along the
fluid-structure interface, and the motion of the fluid along that interface is
constrained to match the solid velocity and thereby satisfy the no-slip
condition. To develop a practical numerical method, we adopt a penalty approach
that approximately imposes the no-slip condition along the fluid-structure
interface. Our fluid-structure interaction scheme relies on an immersed
interface method for discrete geometries, which enables the accurate
determination of both velocities and stresses along complex fluid-structure
interfaces. Unlike commonly used partitioned FSI methods, which can suffer from
so-called added mass effect instabilities, our methodology retains stability
for test cases involving extremely small, nearly equal, equal, and large
solid-fluid density ratios without requiring subiterations or complex handling
of the pressure. Biomedical FSI demonstration cases are also presented
including the dynamics of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve in a pulse
duplicator, and transport of blood clots in a patient-averaged anatomical model

  Code:https://github.com/RudyQ/InverseFaceRender",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we examine the problem of inverse rendering of real face
images. Existing methods decompose a face image into three components (albedo,
normal, and illumination) by supervised training on synthetic face data.
However, due to the domain gap between real and synthetic face images, a model
trained on synthetic data often does not generalize well to real data.
Meanwhile, since no ground truth for any component is available for real
images, it is not feasible to conduct supervised learning on real face images.
To alleviate this problem, we propose a weakly supervised training approach to
train our model on real face videos, based on the assumption of consistency of
albedo and normal across different frames, thus bridging the gap between real
and synthetic face images. In addition, we introduce a learning framework,
called IlluRes-SfSNet, to further extract the residual map to capture the
global illumination effects that give the fine details that are largely ignored
in existing methods. Our network is trained on both real and synthetic data,
benefiting from both. We comprehensively evaluate our methods on various
benchmarks, obtaining better inverse rendering results than the
state-of-the-art.

motivate us to offload the computation tasks of training a model or deploying a

challenges in this setup is to guarantee the privacy of the client data.
Various methods have been proposed to protect privacy in the literature. Those
include (i) adding noise to the client data, which reduces the accuracy of the
result, (ii) using secure multiparty computation (MPC), which requires
significant communication among the computing nodes or with the client, (iii)
relying on homomorphic encryption (HE) methods, which significantly increases
computation load at the servers. In this paper, we propose $\textit{Corella}$
as an alternative approach to protect the privacy of data. The proposed scheme
relies on a cluster of servers, where at most $T \in \mathbb{N}$ of them may
collude, each running a learning model (e.g., a deep neural network). Each
server is fed with the client data, added with $\textit{strong}$ noise,
independent from user data. The variance of the noise is set to be large enough
to make the information leakage to any subset of up to $T$ servers
information-theoretically negligible. On the other hand, the added noises for
different servers are $\textit{correlated}$. This correlation among the queries
allows the parameters of the models running on different servers to be
$\textit{trained}$ such that the client can mitigate the contribution of the
noises by combining the outputs of the servers, and recover the final result
with high accuracy and with a minor computational effort. Simulation results
for various datasets demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for the
classification, using deep neural networks, and the autoencoder, as supervised

Key to understanding this phenomenon are nonleptonic $B$ decays, especially

missing, requiring the use of models to fit the data. In this paper, we suggest
a model ansatz which reflects the underlying physics and the known mechanism of
CP violation via the CKM matrix. In addition, since CP violation is driven by
the interference between amplitudes with and without valence charm quarks, we
argue that the opening of the open-charm threshold may play an important role
in generating CP violation in the high invariant mass region. We present a
natural extension of the isobar model to incorporate these effects. We suggest
an analysis of nonleptonic three-body $B$ decay data including this extension,

a viable interaction mechanism. Our model is UV completed by a Dirac seesaw
with anomaly-free dark $U(1)_X^{}$ gauge group which charges the right-handed

induces self-scattering of right-handed neutrinos. The scattering with
left-handed neutrinos is suppressed by a chirality-flip mass insertion when the
neutrino energy is much larger than its mass. The resultant neutrino
self-scattering is not operative for $E_{\nu}\gtrsim O(\text{keV})$, which
avoids the cosmological and laboratory constraints. By evolving Boltzmann
equations for left- and right-handed neutrino number densities, we show that
about $2/3$ of the left-handed neutrinos are converted into right-handed
neutrinos in a short epoch between the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis and the

future linear collider with unprecedented acceleration gradients, exceeding the
GeV/m range. Beams for this application would have extremely high brightness
and, subject to the intense plasma ion-derived focusing, they would achieve
densities high enough to induce the plasma ions to collapse into the beam
volume. This non-uniform ion density gives rise to strong nonlinear focusing
which may lead to deleterious beam emittance growth. The effects of ion
collapse and their mitigation has been investigated recently through
particle-in-cell simulations, which show that by dynamically matching the beam
to the focusing of the collapsed ion distribution, one may avoid serious
emittance growth. We extend this work by exploring the near-equilibrium state
of the beam-ion system reached after the ions have collapsed, a condition
yielding the emittance growth mitigation observed. We show through PIC
simulations and analytical theory that in this case a dual electron beam-ion
Bennett-type equilibrium distribution is approached. Here, the beam and ion
distributions share nearly the same shape, which generates nonlinear transverse
electromagnetic fields. We exploit a Bennett-type model to study beam phase
space dynamics and emittance growth over time scales much longer than permitted
by PIC simulations through use of a 2D symplectic tracking code with Monte
Carlo scattering based on Moliere's theory of small angle multiple scattering.
We find that while phase space diffusion due to parametric excitations of the
beam size due to plasma non-uniformity is negligible, scattering from collapsed
ions gives rise to manageable emittance growth in the case of a linear
collider. The implications of these results on experiments planned at FACET-II
are examined.

Due to the
deteriorated quality of single frame, it may be hard for people to identify an
occluded object in this frame by just utilizing information within one image.
We argue that there are two important cues for humans to recognize objects in
videos: the global semantic information and the local localization information.
Recently, plenty of methods adopt the self-attention mechanisms to enhance the
features in key frame with either global semantic information or local
localization information. In this paper we introduce memory enhanced
global-local aggregation (MEGA) network, which is among the first trials that
takes full consideration of both global and local information. Furthermore,
empowered by a novel and carefully-designed Long Range Memory (LRM) module, our
proposed MEGA could enable the key frame to get access to much more content
than any previous methods. Enhanced by these two sources of information, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet VID dataset. Code is

given makeup one while preserving face identity. The most advanced method
separates makeup style information from face images to realize makeup transfer.
However, makeup style includes several semantic clear local styles which are
still entangled together. In this paper, we propose a novel unified adversarial
disentangling network to further decompose face images into four independent
components, i.e., personal identity, lips makeup style, eyes makeup style and
face makeup style. Owing to the further disentangling of makeup style, our
method can not only control the degree of global makeup style, but also
flexibly regulate the degree of local makeup styles which any other approaches
can't do. For makeup removal, different from other methods which regard makeup
removal as the reverse process of makeup, we integrate the makeup transfer with
the makeup removal into one uniform framework and obtain multiple makeup
removal results. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach can
produce more realistic and accurate makeup transfer results compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.

assume an epidemic proportion by 2030. Currently the reliable methods for
detection of coronary arterial lesions are either conventional coronary
angiogram (CAG) or MDCT (Multiple Detector Computed Tomography) coronary
angiogram. Conventional CAG is an invasive procedure. Conventional CAG and CT
(Computed Tomography) angiogram, both require expert supervision of either an
interventional cardiologist or a radiologist. In this work, we have proposed a
novel design and method for non-invasive detection and localization of coronary
arterial lesion using Impedance Cardiography (ICG). The ICG signal recorded by
the proposed device is used to extract feature points and compute augmentation
index, amplitude and other time related parameters. The extracted features are
used as input to a trained artificial neural network, for detection and
prediction of coronary arterial lesions. The trained network generates
specialized models, to be used for diagnosis of arterial lesions. The proposed
methodology detects lesion in Left main coronary artery (LMCA), Left anterior
descending artery (LAD), Diagonal branch, Left circumflex artery (LCX), and
Right coronary artery (RCA) with an accuracy of 92%, 82%, 76%, 76%, 84%
respectively. The proposed device could be also used by a common individual for
detection of arterial lesion without any expert supervision, unassisted. The
proposed algorithm eliminates the need of CAG for diagnosis of coronary
arterial lesions (stenosis), and provides an insight into a new method for
non-invasive monitoring of cardiovascular haemodynamics, detection and
localization of coronary arterial lesion.

our proposal of the modified Higgs mechanism, the Higgs vacua break twice, such
that, the very minuteness of the extra Higgs vacuum breaking explains the
origin of the very minuteness of neutrino masses, while the relative greatness

depending on galactic environments. In order to understand the diversity of
galactic-scale star formation, it is crucial to understand the formation and
evolution of giant molecular clouds in an extreme environment. We focus on
observational evidence that bars in strongly barred galaxies lack massive stars
even though quantities of molecular gas are sufficient to form stars. In this
paper, we present a hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly barred galaxy,
using a stellar potential which is taken from observational results of NGC1300,
and we compare cloud properties between different galactic environments: bar,
bar-end and spiral arms. We find that the mean of cloud's virial parameter is
~1 and that there is no environmental dependence, indicating that the
gravitationally-bound state of a cloud is not behind the observational evidence
of the lack of massive stars in strong bars. Instead, we focus on cloud-cloud
collisions, which have been proposed as a triggering mechanism for massive star
formation. We find that the collision speed in the bar is faster than those in
the other regions. We examine the collision frequency using clouds' kinematics
and conclude that the fast collisions in the bar could originate from
random-like motion of clouds due to elliptical gas orbits shifted by the bar
potential. These results suggest that the observed regions of lack of active
star-formation in the strong bar originate from the fast cloud-cloud
collisions, which are inefficient in forming massive stars, due to the
galactic-scale violent gas motion.

the strengths of the strongest fields in a light bridge using an advanced
inversion technique and to investigate their detailed structure. We analyze
observations from the spectropolarimeter on board the Hinode spacecraft of the
active region AR 11967. The thermodynamic and magnetic configurations are
obtained by inverting the Stokes profiles using an inversion scheme that allows
multiple height nodes. Both the traditional 1D inversion technique and the
so-called 2D coupled inversions, which take into account the point spread
function of the Hinode telescope, are used. We find a compact structure with an
area of 32.7 arcsec$^2$ within a bipolar light bridge with field strengths
exceeding 5 kG, confirming the strong fields in this light bridge reported in
the literature. Two regions associated with downflows of $\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$
harbor field strengths larger than 6.5 kG, covering a total area of 2.97

to accurately represent the waveform emitted from asymmetric BBHs. We discuss a

allows us to accurately and efficiently capture the morphology of higher mode
waveforms. We show that the ROM is very accurate with median (maximum) values
of the unfaithfulness against SEOBNRv4HM lower than $0.001\% (0.03\%)$ for
total masses in $[2.8,100] M_\odot$. For a total mass of $M = 300 M_\odot$ the
median (maximum) value of the unfaithfulness increases up to $0.004\%

estimated accuracy of SEOBNRv4HM compared to numerical relativity simulations.
The ROM is two orders of magnitude faster in generating a waveform compared to
SEOBNRv4HM. Data analysis applications typically require
$\mathcal{O}(10^6-10^8)$ waveform evaluations for which SEOBNRv4HM is in
general too slow. The ROM is therefore crucial to allow the SEOBNRv4HM waveform

evolution of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen gas fraction. However,
uncertainties in the measurement of X_LAE are still debated. Thanks to deep
data obtained with MUSE, we can measure the evolution of X_LAE homogeneously
over a wide redshift range of z~3-6 for UV-faint galaxies (down to
M_1500~-17.75). This is significantly fainter than in former studies, and
allows us to probe the bulk of the population of high-z star-forming galaxies.
We construct a UV-complete photo-redshift sample following UV luminosity
functions and measure the Lya emission with MUSE using the second data release
from the MUSE HUDF Survey. We derive the redshift evolution of X_LAE for M_1500
in [-21.75;-17.75] for the first time with a equivalent width range EW(Lya)>=65
A and find low values of X_ LAE<~30% at z<~6. For M_1500 in [-20.25;-18.75] and
EW(Lya)<~25 A, our X_LAE values are consistent with those in the literature
within 1sigma at z<~5, but our median values are systematically lower than
reported values over the whole redshift range. In addition, we do not find a
significant dependence of X_LAE on M_1500 for EW(Lya)>~50 A at z~3-4, in
contrast with previous work. The differences in X_LAE mainly arise from
selection biases for Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in the literature: UV-faint
LBGs are more easily selected if they have strong Lya emission, hence X_LAE is
biased towards higher values. Our results suggest either a lower increase of
X_LAE towards z~6 than previously suggested, or even a turnover of X_LAE at
z~5.5, which may be the signature of a late or patchy reionization process. We
compared our results with predictions from a cosmological galaxy evolution
model. We find that a model with a bursty star formation (SF) can reproduce our
observed X_LAE much better than models where SF is a smooth function of time.

have shown that the parasitic Varroa mite could be the main reason for colony
losses. In order to understand how mites affect population dynamics of
honeybees and a colony health, we propose a brood-adult bee-mite model in which
the time lag from brood to adult is taken into account. Noting that the
dynamics of a honeybee colony varies with respect to season, we validate the
model and perform parameter estimations under both constant and fluctuating
seasonality scenarios. Our analytical and numerical studies reveal the
following: (a) In the presence of parasite mites, the large time lag from brood
to adult could destabilize population dynamics and drive the colony to
collapse; but the small natural mortality of the adult population can promote a
mite-free colony when time lag is small or at an intermediate level; (b) Small
brood' infestation rates could stabilize all populations at the unique interior
equilibrium under constant seasonality while may drive the mite population to
die out when seasonality is taken into account; (c) High brood' infestation
rates can destabilize the colony dynamics leading to population collapse
depending on initial population size under constant and seasonal conditions;
(d) Results from sensitivity analysis indicate the queen's egg-laying may have
the greatest effect on colony population size. The brood death rate and the
colony size at which brood survivability is the half maximal were also shown to
be highly sensitive with an inverse correlation to the colony population size.
Our results provide insights on the effects of seasonality on the dynamics.

an alternative tactic for covert social media interference by inducing

tactic uses a malware that covertly manipulates targeted words, hashtags, and
Twitter metrics before the genuine content is presented to a targeted user in a

capable of achieving a similar goal as trolls and social bots, that is,
silencing or provoking social media users to express their opinion in polarized

actively participates injecting messages in a protocol execution, which is not
assumed in our attack strategy).

  Rates",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an enhanced version of our previous work, hybrid
non-uniform subdivision surfaces [19], to achieve optimal convergence rates in
isogeometric analysis. We introduce a parameter $\lambda$
($\frac{1}{4}<\lambda<1$) to control the rate of shrinkage of irregular
regions, so the method is called tuned hybrid non-uniform subdivision (tHNUS).
Our previous work corresponds to the case when $\lambda=\frac{1}{2}$. While
introducing $\lambda$ in hybrid subdivision significantly complicates the
theoretical proof of $G^1$ continuity around extraordinary vertices, reducing
$\lambda$ can recover the optimal convergence rates when tuned hybrid
subdivision functions are used as a basis in isogeometric analysis. From the
geometric point of view, the tHNUS retains comparable shape quality as [19]
under non-uniform parameterization. Its basis functions are refinable and the
geometric mapping stays invariant during refinement. Moreover, we prove that a
tuned hybrid subdivision surface is globally $G^1$-continuous. From the
analysis point of view, tHNUS basis functions form a non-negative partition of
unity, are globally linearly independent, and their spline spaces are nested.
We numerically demonstrate that tHNUS basis functions can achieve optimal
convergence rates for the Poisson's problem with non-uniform parameterization
around extraordinary vertices.

showing excellent agreement. It is used to explore regimes not possible with
previously published models, such as the variable viscosity case, and how these

Next, elastic waves are discussed with a focus on thin films. Finally, the

  To solve these problems, we introduce a novel virtualization framework for

provide isolated and runtime-programmable hardware resources, further leading
to performance isolation for multiple users. On the other hand, to overcome the
heavy re-compilation overheads, we propose a tiling-based instruction frame

runtime information is re-compiled with $\sim$1 ms overhead, thus the
performance is guaranteed for the private cloud. Our extensive experimental
results show that the proposed virtualization design achieves 1.07-1.69x and
1.88-3.12x throughput improvement over previous static designs using the

a type-directed notion of visible inductiveness, which ensures that the
algorithm makes progress toward its goal as it alternates between weakening and
strengthening candidate invariants. The algorithm is parameterized by an
example-based synthesis engine and a verifier, and we prove that it is sound

Hanoi, which synthesizes representation invariants for recursive data types.
Hanoi not only handles invariants for first-order code, but higher-order code
as well. In its back end, Hanoi uses an enumerative synthesizer called Myth and
an enumerative testing tool as a verifier. Because Hanoi uses testing for

formal model of innovation diffusion shows that the network structure of

widely adopted innovations will be payoff optimal. Building on prior diffusion
research, this paper focuses on the role of central actors i.e. well-connected

central actors for spreading innovations further and faster, the present

actors in a network increases rates of adoption but also increases the

that every better quasi order labeled Aronszajn line can be expressed as a
finite sum of labeled types which are algebraically indecomposable. By encoding
lines with finite labeled trees, we are also able to deduce a decomposition

$\Omega_\nu h^2$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $n_s$, $w_0$, $w_a$}; spatial flatness is
assumed. We obtain smooth halo mass functions by fitting piecewise second-order
polynomials to the halo catalogs and employ Gaussian process regression to
construct the emulator while keeping track of the statistical noise in the
input halo catalogs and uncertainties in the regression process. For redshifts
$z\lesssim1$, the typical emulator precision is better than $2\%$ for
$10^{13}-10^{14} M_\odot/h$ and $<10\%$ for $M\simeq 10^{15}M_\odot/h$. For
comparison, fitting functions using the traditional universal form for the halo

include most of the identified DIBs of the C2 and zeta families, while the

from very strong bands of large conjugated elongated molecules, such as carbon
chains, polyacenes, or other catacondensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
The total amount of carbon contained in all the carriers of these narrow DIBs
is a very small fraction of the interstellar carbon if their oscillator
strengths are <~1. The amount of carbon locked in the carriers of the broader

weaker.

literature. However, as real world systems, such as climate data are
notoriously inseparable, validating this assumption by statistical tests, seems
inherently questionable. In this paper we present an alternative approach: By
virtue of separability measures, we quantify how strongly the data's covariance
operator diverges from a separable approximation. Confidence intervals localize
these measures with statistical guarantees. This method provides users with a
flexible tool, to weigh the computational gains of a separable model against
the associated increase in bias. As separable approximations we consider the
established methods of partial traces and partial products, and develop weak
convergence principles for the corresponding estimators. Moreover, we also
prove such results for estimators of optimal, separable approximations, which
are arguably of most interest in applications. In particular we present for the
first time statistical inference for this object, which has been confined to
estimation previously. Besides confidence intervals, our results encompass
tests for approximate separability. All methods proposed in this paper are free

properties of 16 faint and mostly unstudied open clusters in the poorly known
sector of the Galaxy at 270$^\circ-$300$^\circ$, to probe the Milky Way
structure in future investigations. (2) To address previously reported
systematics in Gaia DR2 parallaxes by comparing the cluster distances derived
from photometry with those derived from parallaxes. Methods: Deep UBVI
photometry of 16 open clusters was carried out. Observations were reduced and
analyzed in an automaticway using the ASteCA package to get individual
distances, reddening, masses, ages and metallicities. Photometric distances
were compared to those obtained from a Bayesian analysis of Gaia DR2
parallaxes. Results: Ten out of the 16 clusters are true or highly probable
open clusters. Two of them are quite young and follow the trace of the Carina
Arm and the already detected warp. The rest of the clusters are placed in the
interarm zone between the Perseus and Carina Arms as expected for older
objects. We found that the cluster van den Berg-Hagen 85 is 7.5$\times$10$^9$
yrs old becoming then one of the oldest open cluster detected in our Galaxy so
far. The relationship of these ten clusters with the Galaxy structure in the
solar neighborhood is discussed. The comparison of distances from photometry
and parallaxes data, in turn, reveals a variable level of disagreement.
Conclusions: Various zero point corrections for Gaia DR2 parallax data recently
reported were considered for a comparison between photometric and parallax
based distances. The results tend to improve with some of these corrections.
Photometric distance analysis suggest an average correction of $\sim$+0.026 mas
(to be added to the parallaxes). The correction may have a more intricate
distance dependency, but addressing that level of detail will require a larger
cluster sample.

qualitative analyses. However, social media data are unstructured and must
undergo complex manipulation for research use. The manual annotation is the
most resource and time-consuming process that multiple expert raters have to
reach consensus on every item, but is essential to create gold-standard
datasets for training NLP-based machine learning classifiers. To reduce the
burden of the manual annotation, yet maintaining its reliability, we devised a
crowdsourcing pipeline combined with active learning strategies. We
demonstrated its effectiveness through a case study that identifies job loss
events from individual tweets. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to
recruit annotators from the Internet and designed a number of quality control
measures to assure annotation accuracy. We evaluated 4 different active
learning strategies (i.e., least confident, entropy, vote entropy, and
Kullback-Leibler divergence). The active learning strategies aim at reducing
the number of tweets needed to reach a desired performance of automated
classification. Results show that crowdsourcing is useful to create
high-quality annotations and active learning helps in reducing the number of
required tweets, although there was no substantial difference among the
strategies tested.

of the compact binary merger rate with redshift. The redshift distribution of
black hole mergers would offer considerable information about their
evolutionary history, including their progenitor formation rate, the dependence
of black hole formation on stellar metallicity, and the time delay distribution
between formation and merger. Efforts to measure the binary redshift
distribution are currently limited, however, by the detection range of existing
instruments, which can individually resolve compact binary merger events only
out to $z\lesssim1$. We present a novel strategy with which to measure the
redshift distribution of binary black hole mergers well beyond the detection
range of current instruments. By synthesizing direct detections of individually
resolved mergers with \textit{indirect} searches for the stochastic
gravitational-wave background due to unresolved distant sources, we can glean
information about the peak redshift, $z_p$, at which the binary black hole
merger rate attains its maximum, even when this redshift is beyond the
detection horizon. Using data from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's first and second
observing runs, we employ this strategy to place joint constraints on $z_p$ and
the slope $\alpha$ with which the binary merger rate increases at low
redshifts, ruling out merger rates that grow faster than $\alpha \gtrsim 7$ and
peak beyond $z_p \gtrsim 1.5$. Looking ahead, we project that approximately one
year of observation with design-sensitivity Advanced LIGO will further break
remaining degeneracies, enabling a direct measurement of the peak redshift of
the binary black hole merger history.

problem of this work. We formulate this problem as a gradient-based
perturbation maximization method that discovers this subset in the input
feature space with respect to the functionality of the prediction model used by
the provider. After identifying the subset, our framework, Cloak, suppresses
the rest of the features using utility-preserving constant values that are
discovered through a separate gradient-based optimization process. We show that
Cloak does not necessarily require collaboration from the service provider
beyond its normal service, and can be applied in scenarios where we only have
black-box access to the service provider's model. We theoretically guarantee
that Cloak's optimizations reduce the upper bound of the Mutual Information

Experimental results show that Cloak reduces the mutual information between the
input and the sifted representations by 85.01% with only a negligible reduction
in utility (1.42%). In addition, we show that Cloak greatly diminishes
adversaries' ability to learn and infer non-conducive features.

  Based on multivariate analysis methods, we have built an extended sample of

ROSAT All-Sky Survey and XMM-Newton X-ray sources. From optical spectroscopic
observations, we measured their radial velocity with the cross-correlation

to measure the lithium equivalent width, from which we infer their lithium
abundance and age. Finally, we studied their kinematics using the second Gaia
data release.
  Our sample is mainly composed of young or active stars and multiple systems.
We identify two distinct populations of young stars that are spatially and
kinematically separated. Those with an age between 100 and 300 Myr are mostly
projected towards the Galactic plane. In contrast, 23 of the 37 sources younger

inference in the finite population have been well documented in literature.
These challenges are due primarily to statistical bias arising from
under-coverage in the big data source to represent the population of interest
and measurement errors in the variables available in the data set. By
stratifying the population into a big data stratum and a missing data stratum,
we can estimate the missing data stratum by using a fully responding
probability sample, and hence the population as a whole by using a data
integration estimator. By expressing the data integration estimator as a
regression estimator, we can handle measurement errors in the variables in big
data and also in the probability sample. We also propose a fully nonparametric
classification method for identifying the overlapping units and develop a
bias-corrected data integration estimator under misclassification errors.
Finally, we develop a two-step regression data integration estimator to deal

is notoriously challenging mainly due to the translational property and
nonlinearity of the governing equations. While the Lagrangian framework for ROM
construction resolves the translational issue, it is valid only before a shock
forms. Once that occurs, characteristic lines cross each other and projection
from a high-fidelity model space onto a ROM space distorts a moving grid,
resulting in numerical instabilities. We address this grid distortion issue by
developing a physics-aware dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method based on
hodograph transformation. The latter provides a map between the original
nonlinear system and its linear counterpart, which coincides with the Koopman
operator. This strategy is consistent with the spirit of physics-aware DMDs in
that it retains information about shock dynamics. Several numerical examples

proposed to overcome this issue. Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks are
trained on the variants contained in an event log with the intention to
approximate the underlying variant distribution of the system behavior.
Unobserved realistic variants are sampled either directly from the Sequence
Generative Adversarial Network or by leveraging the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm. The degree by which a process model relates to its underlying
unknown system behavior is then quantified based on the realistic observed and
estimated unobserved variants using established process model quality metrics.
Significant performance improvements in revealing realistic unobserved variants
are demonstrated in a controlled experiment on 15 ground truth systems.
Additionally, the proposed methodology is experimentally tested and evaluated
to quantify the generalization of 60 discovered process models with respect to
their systems.

efficient and scalable approach to on-chip coherent visible light generation.
However, so far only red light at < 420 THz (near the edge of the visible band)
has been reported. In this work, we demonstrate on-chip OPO covering > 130 THz
of the visible spectrum, including red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths.
In particular, using a pump laser that is scanned 5 THz in the near-infrared
from 386 THz to 391 THz, the signal is tuned from the near-infrared at 395 THz
to the visible at 528 THz, while the idler is tuned from the near-infrared at
378 THz to the infrared at 254 THz. The widest signal-idler separation we
demonstrate of 274 THz corresponds to more than an octave span and is the
widest demonstrated for a nanophotonic OPO to date. Our work is a clear
demonstration of how nonlinear nanophotonics can transform light from readily
accessible compact near-infrared lasers to targeted visible wavelengths of
interest, which is crucial for field-level deployment of spectroscopy and
metrology systems.

Phys. 60, 102502 (2019)] that slowly
lowering an electric charge into a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini (ST) black hole
endows the final state with electric multipole fields, which implies the final
state geometry is not Reissner-Nordstr\""om-Tangherlini in nature. This
conclusion departs from the four-dimensional case in which the no-hair theorem
(NHT) requires the final state to be a Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. To
better understand this discrepancy clearly requires a deeper understanding of
the origin of the multipole hair in the higher-dimensional case. In this paper,
we advance the conjecture that charged, static, and asymptotically-flat
higher-dimensional black holes can acquire electric multipole hair only after
they form. This supposition derives from studying the asymptotic behavior of
the field of a multipole charge onto which a massive and hyperspherical shell
with an exterior ST geometry is collapsing. In the mathematical limit as the
shell approaches its ST radius, we find that the multipole fields (except the
monopole) vanish. This implies that the only information of an arbitrary (but
finite) charge distribution inside the collapsing shell that is available to an
asymptotic observer is the total electric charge. Our results yield
considerable insight into how higher-dimensional black holes acquire electric
multipole hair, and also imply that, in four dimensions, the fadeaway of
multipole moments during gravitational collapse is not strictly because of the
NHT.

path represents a particularly important characteristic because of its
potential impact not only on other topological properties, but mainly for its
influence on several dynamical processes taking place on the network. In
addition, several practical situations, such as transit in cities, can benefit
by modifying a network so as to reduce the respective shortest paths. In the
present work, we addressed the problem of trying to reduce the average shortest
path of several theoretical and real-world complex networks by adding a given
number of links according to different strategies. More specifically, we
considered: placing new links between nodes with relatively low and high
degrees; to enhance the degree regularity of the network; preferential
attachment according to the degree; linking nodes with relatively low and high
betweenness centrality; and linking nodes with relatively low/low, low/high,
and high/high accessibilities. Several interesting results have been obtained,
including the identification of the accessibility-based strategies as providing
the largest reduction of the average shortest path length. Another interesting
finding is that, for several types of networks, the degree-based methods tend
to provide improvements comparable to those obtained by using the much more
computationally expensive betweenness centrality measurement.

It does not require any training annotations in terms of frame-level bounding

that propose a prediction-based approach to event understanding. We use a stack
of LSTMs coupled with CNN encoder, along with novel attention mechanisms, to
model the events in the video and use this model to predict high-level features
for the future frames. The prediction errors are used to continuously learn the

other approaches but is very effective in learning robust visual

approach outputs in a streaming fashion, requiring only a single pass through
the video, making it amenable for real-time processing. We demonstrate this on
three datasets - UCF Sports, JHMDB, and THUMOS'13 and show that the proposed
approach outperforms weakly-supervised and unsupervised baselines and obtains

II-LBM, the discontinuity related to the normal portion of the interfacial
force is sharply resolved by imposing the relevant jump conditions using an
approach that is analogous to imposing the corresponding pressure jump
condition in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that the jump
conditions for the distribution functions are the same in both
single-relaxation-time and multi-relaxation-time LBM formulations. Tangential
forces are treated using the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method
(IB-LBM). The performance of the II-LBM method is compared to both the direct
forcing IB-LBM for rigid-body fluid-structure interaction, and the classical
IB-LBM for elastic interfaces. Higher order accuracy is observed with the
II-LBM as compared to the IB-LBM for selected benchmark problems. Because the
jump conditions of the distribution function also satisfy the continuity of the
velocity field across the interface, the error in the velocity field is much
smaller for the II-LBM than the IB-LBM. The II-LBM is also demonstrated to
provide superior volume conservation when simulating flexible boundaries.

  Financial Time Series",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal decision-making in social settings is often based on forecasts from
time series (TS) data. Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks
(DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS
forecasting and have shown promising results. However, the applicability of
these approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of
quality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors.
Examples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing
accurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult. In this
work, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS
conjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of
computing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end,
we make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate
autoregressive model. We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on
the DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism
(ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive
order of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability
distributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a
self-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns
and takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two
datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental
results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical
DNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We
point out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to
use can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies.

conspiratorial in a mathematically well-defined sense, by further development
of the ideas presented in a previous article $\mathcal{A}$. We consider a Bell
scenario where, in each run and at each wing, the experimenter chooses one of
$N$ devices to determine the local measurement setting. We prove, without
assuming any features of quantum statistics, that superdeterministic models of
this scenario must have a finely-tuned distribution of hidden variables.
Specifically, fine-tuning is required so that the measurement statistics depend
on the measurement settings but not on the details of how the settings are
chosen. We quantify this as the overhead fine-tuning $F$ of the model, and show
that $F > 0$ (corresponding to `fine-tuned') for any $N >1$. The notion of
fine-tuning assumes that arbitrary (`nonequilibrium') hidden-variables
distributions are possible in principle. We also show how to quantify
superdeterministic conspiracy without using nonequilibrium. This second
approach is based on the fact that superdeterministic correlations can mimic
actual signalling. We argue that an analogous situation occurs in equilibrium
where, for every run, the devices that the hidden variables are correlated with
are coincidentally the same as the devices in fact used. This results in
extremely large superdeterministic correlations, which we quantify as a drop of
an appropriately defined formal entropy. Nonlocal and retrocausal models turn
out to be non-conspiratorial according to both approaches.

orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck (OAFP) equation for distribution function of stars
in dense isotropic star clusters. At the late stage of relaxation evolution of
the clusters, standard stellar dynamics predicts that the clusters evolve in a
self-similar fashion forming collapsing cores. However, the corresponding
mathematical model, the self-similar OAFP equation, has never been solved on
the whole energy domain $(-1< E < 0)$. The existing works based on kinds of
finite difference methods provide solutions only on the truncated domain $-1<
E<-0.2$. To broaden the range of the truncated domain, the present work resorts
to a (highly accurate and efficient) Gauss-Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method. We
provide a spectral solution, whose number of significant figures is four, on
the whole domain. Also, the solution can reduce to a semi-analytical form whose
degree of polynomials is only eighteen holding three significant figures. We
also provide the new eigenvalues; $c_{1}=9.0925\times10^{-4}$,
$c_{2}=1.1118\times10^{-4}$, $c_{3}=7.1975\times10^{-2}$ and
$c_{4}=3.303\times10^{-2}$, corresponding to the core collapse rate
$\xi=3.64\times10^{-3}$, scaled escape energy $\chi_\text{esc}=13.881$ and
power-law exponent $\alpha=2.2305$. Since the solution on the whole domain is
unstable against degree of Chebyshev polynomials, we also provide spectral
solutions on truncated domains ( $-1< E<E_\text{max}$, where
$-0.35<E_\text{max}<-0.03$) to explain how to handle the instability. By
reformulating the OAFP equation in several ways, we improve the accuracy of the
spectral solution and reproduce an existing self-similar solution, which infers
that existing solutions have only one significant figure at best.

diverse consumers reveal heterogeneous preferences. The objective of this paper
is to sort out a linear ordering for these observations and to recommend
strategies to improve their relative positions in the ranking. A properly
sorted solution could help consumers make the right choices, and governments
make wise policy decisions. Previous researchers have applied exogenous
weighting or multivariate regression approaches to sort big data objects,
ignoring their variety and variability. By recognizing the diversity and
heterogeneity among both the observations and the consumers, we instead apply
endogenous weighting to these contradictory revealed preferences. The outcome
is a consistent steady-state solution to the counterbalance equilibrium within
these contradictions. The solution takes into consideration the spillover
effects of multiple-step interactions among the observations. When information
from data is efficiently revealed in preferences, the revealed preferences
greatly reduce the volume of the required data in the sorting process. The
employed approach can be applied in many other areas, such as sports team
ranking, academic journal ranking, voting, and real effective exchange rates.

lack flexibility and do not allow for separate partition structures among the

novel prior are extensively investigated. We discuss its formal link with the
enriched Dirichlet process and normalized random measures, we describe a
square-breaking representation and we obtain closed-form expressions for the
posterior law and the involved urn schemes. In second place, we show that
several existing approaches, including Dirichlet processes with a spike and
slab base measure and mixture of mixtures models, implicitly rely on special

for many Bayesian nonparametric priors. Interestingly, our unifying formulation
will allow us to naturally extend these models while preserving their
analytical tractability. As an illustration, we employ the EPY for a species
sampling problem in ecology and for functional clustering in an e-commerce

covert channels, which require simultaneous multi-threading (SMT),
SpectreRewind supports single hardware thread based covert channels, making it
viable on systems where attacker cannot utilize SMT. We show that contention on

a high-performance (~100 KB/s), low-noise covert channel for transient
execution attacks instead of commonly used flush+reload based cache covert
channels.

regression (DKRR) for example, we succeed in deriving its optimal learning
rates in expectation and providing theoretically optimal ranges of the number
of local processors. Due to the gap between theory and experiments, we also
deduce optimal learning rates for DKRR in probability to essentially reflect
the generalization performance and limitations of DKRR. Furthermore, we propose
a communication strategy to improve the learning performance of DKRR and
demonstrate the power of communications in DKRR via both theoretical

formula ABO3 and A2B2O7, where the B sites are occupied by an open-shell
transition metal ion with a local moment, and the A sites are typically a rare
earth. The [111] oriented quasi-two-dimensional lattices derived from these
parent compound lattices can exhibit peculiar geometries and symmetries,
namely, a buckled honeycomb lattice, as well as kagome and triangular lattices.
These lattice motifs form the basis for emergent strongly correlated and
topological states expressed in exotic magnetism, various forms of orbital
ordering, topological insulators, topological semimetals, quantum anomalous
Hall insulators, and quantum spin liquids. For transition metal ions with high
atomic number, spin-orbit coupling plays a significant role and may give rise
to additional topological features in the electronic band structure and in the
spectrum of magnetic excitations. We conclude the Perspective by articulating
open challenges and opportunities in this actively developing field.

experiments, in particular, the reactor neutrino experiments. The complex
absorption and re-emission processes of optical photons are known to be an
important source of the non-linear and non-uniform response of LS detectors.
Precise simulation of light propagation in LS is highly desirable to model the
detector response and reduce the systematic errors. In this paper, we develop a
novel optical model which can completely deal with the competitive photon
absorption and subsequent re-emission processes of the LS components. It allows
to directly plug in the laboratory measurements of the LS components to model
any LS composition. Extensive measurements have been performed to obtain the
essential optical parameters for this model. We validate the model with a
bench-top experiment featuring a small LS volume. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that for any given detector geometry, this model provides the capability of
optimizing the LS recipe to maximize the light collection. It is valuable for
designing future LS-based detectors and improving the agreement between Monte
Carlo and data for current neutrino experiments.

considered, where multiple mobile users wish to download network content of
different popularity. By caching data into the small-cell base stations (SBS),
we will design distributed caching optimization algorithms via belief
propagation (BP) for minimizing the downloading latency. First, we derive the
delay-minimization objective function (OF) and formulate an optimization
problem. Then we develop a framework for modeling the underlying HCN topology
with the aid of a factor graph. Furthermore, distributed BP algorithm is
proposed based on the network's factor graph. Next, we prove that a fixed point
of convergence exists for our distributed BP algorithm. In order to reduce the
complexity of the BP, we propose a heuristic BP algorithm. Furthermore, we
evaluate the average downloading performance of our HCN for different numbers
and locations of the base stations (BS) and mobile users (MU), with the aid of
stochastic geometry theory. By modeling the nodes distributions using a Poisson
point process, we develop the expressions of the average factor graph degree
distribution, as well as an upper bound of the outage probability for random
caching schemes. We also improve the performance of random caching. Our
simulations show that (1) the proposed distributed BP algorithm has a
near-optimal delay performance, approaching that of the high-complexity
exhaustive search method, (2) the modified BP offers a good delay performance
at a low communication complexity, (3) both the average degree distribution and
the outage upper bound analysis relying on stochastic geometry match well with
our Monte-Carlo simulations, and (4) the optimization based on the upper bound
provides both a better outage and a better delay performance than the
benchmarks.

Consequently, FWI produces overburden related artifacts inside the target zone

Marchenko-based target-oriented Full Waveform Inversion can compensate the need
of Hessian matrix inversion by reducing the non-linearity due to overburden
effects. This is achieved by exploiting Marchenko-based target replacement to
remove the overburden response and its interactions with the target zone from
residuals and inserting the response of the updated target zone into the
response of the entire medium. We have also shown that this method is more
robust with respect to prior information than the standard gradient FWI.
Similarly to standard Marchenko imaging, the proposed method only requires
knowledge of the direct arrival time from a focusing point to the surface and
the reflection response of the medium.

clip-level labels. We proposed two GPVAD models, one full (GPV-F), trained on
527 Audioset sound events, and one binary (GPV-B), only distinguishing speech
and noise. We evaluate the two GPV models against a CRNN based standard VAD
model (VAD-C) on three different evaluation protocols (clean, synthetic noise,
real data). Results show that our proposed GPV-F demonstrates competitive
performance in clean and synthetic scenarios compared to traditional VAD-C.
Further, in real-world evaluation, GPV-F largely outperforms VAD-C in terms of
frame-level evaluation metrics as well as segment-level ones. With a much lower
requirement for frame-labeled data, the naive binary clip-level GPV-B model can
still achieve comparable performance to VAD-C in real-world scenarios.

the possibilities of eavesdropping and the contamination simultaneously. Under
an acyclic broadcast network, the optimality of linear codes was shown when Eve
is allowed to attack any $r$ edges. The optimality of linear codes is not shown
under a different assumption for Eve. As a typical example of an acyclic
unicast network, we focus on the one-hop relay network under the single

Surprisingly, as a result, we find that a non-linear code significantly
improves the performance on the one-hop relay network over linear codes. That

be realized by linear codes. This kind of superiority of a linear code still
holds even with considering the effect of sequential error injection on

remains inconclusive, previous studies have considered the synchrotron
radiation of relativistic electrons as a promising mechanism. These works
usually adopted a invariable injection rate of electrons ($Q$) which may be
discordant with that in a Poynting-flux dominated jet. In a Poynting-flux
dominated jet (e.g., ICMART model, Zhang & Yan 2011), the number of magnetic
reconnections occurred simultaneously may grow rapidly with time and results in
an increase of $Q$ with time. This paper is dedicated to study the synchrotron
radiation spectrum in this scenario. It is found that the radiation spectrum
would obviously get harder if an increasing $Q$ is adopted and a Band-like
radiation spectrum can be obtained if the increase of $Q$ is fast enough. The
latter is related to the fact that a bump-shape rather than a power-law
spectrum appears in the low-energy regime of the obtained electron spectrum.
This effect can strongly harden the low-energy radiation spectrum. It indicates
that an increasing $Q$ can help to alleviate the ""fast-cooling problem"" of
synchrotron radiation for GRBs. Our studies also reveal that a Poynting-flux
dominated jet with a large emission radius, a small length of the magnetic
reconnection region, or a low-minimum energy of injected electron would prefer
to form a Band-like radiation spectrum. We suggest that the Band spectrum found
in GRBs may be the synchrotron emission of the electrons with a bump-shape

We first prove that {\it the loss surfaces of many neural networks have
infinite spurious local minima} which are defined as the local minima with
higher empirical risks than the global minima. Our result demonstrates that the
networks with piecewise linear activations possess substantial differences to
the well-studied linear neural networks. This result holds for any neural
network with arbitrary depth and arbitrary piecewise linear activation
functions (excluding linear functions) under most loss functions in practice.
Essentially, the underlying assumptions are consistent with most practical
circumstances where the output layer is narrower than any hidden layer. In
addition, the loss surface of a neural network with piecewise linear
activations is partitioned into multiple smooth and multilinear cells by
nondifferentiable boundaries. The constructed spurious local minima are
concentrated in one cell as a valley: they are connected with each other by a
continuous path, on which empirical risk is invariant. Further for
one-hidden-layer networks, we prove that all local minima in a cell constitute
an equivalence class; they are concentrated in a valley; and they are all
global minima in the cell.

to directly minimize the Shannon Entropy, but the side effect caused by entropy

To address this issue, we reinvestigate the structure of classification output
matrix of a randomly selected data batch. We find by theoretical analysis that
the prediction discriminability and diversity could be separately measured by
the Frobenius-norm and rank of the batch output matrix. Besides, the
nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the Frobenius-norm, and a convex approximation
of the matrix rank. Accordingly, to improve both discriminability and

universal One-Shot GAN generated fake face detection method which can be used

based on extracting out-of-context objects from faces via scene understanding
models. To do so, we use state of the art scene understanding and object
detection methods as a pre-processing tool to detect the weird objects in the
face. Second, we create a bag of words given all the detected out-of-context
objects per all training data. This way, we transform each image into a sparse
vector where each feature represents the confidence score related to each
detected object in the image. Our experiments show that, we can discriminate
fake faces from real ones in terms of out-of-context features. It means that,
different sets of objects are detected in fake faces comparing to real ones
when we analyze them with scene understanding and object detection models. We

optimisation of expensive black-box functions. However when dealing with big
search spaces the algorithm goes through several low function value regions
before reaching the optimum of the function. Since the function evaluations are
expensive in terms of both money and time, it may be desirable to alleviate
this problem. One approach to subside this cold start phase is to use prior
knowledge that can accelerate the optimisation. In its standard form, Bayesian
optimisation assumes the likelihood of any point in the search space being the
optimum is equal. Therefore any prior knowledge that can provide information
about the optimum of the function would elevate the optimisation performance.
In this paper, we represent the prior knowledge about the function optimum
through a prior distribution. The prior distribution is then used to warp the
search space in such a way that space gets expanded around the high probability
region of function optimum and shrinks around low probability region of
optimum. We incorporate this prior directly in function model (Gaussian
process), by redefining the kernel matrix, which allows this method to work
with any acquisition function, i.e. acquisition agnostic approach. We show the
superiority of our method over standard Bayesian optimisation method through
optimisation of several benchmark functions and hyperparameter tuning of two
algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random forest.

the correspondence between compatible Poisson structures of the quantum cluster

we find that a quantum cluster algebra possesses dual quantum cluster algebras

method to probe the 3D structure of materials from the nano- to the
atomic-scale. However, as a grant challenge, radiation intolerance of the
nanoscale samples and the missing-wedge-induced information loss and artifacts
greatly hindered us from obtaining 3D atomic structures with high fidelity.
Here, for the first time, by combining generative adversarial models with
state-of-the-art network architectures, we demonstrate the resolution of
electron tomography can be improved to 0.71 angstrom which is the highest
three-dimensional imaging resolution that has been reported thus far. We also
show it is possible to recover the lost information and remove artifacts in the
reconstructed tomograms by only acquiring data from -50 to +50 degrees (44%
reduction of dosage compared to -90 to +90 degrees full tilt series). In
contrast to conventional methods, the deep learning model shows outstanding
performance for both macroscopic objects and atomic features solving the
long-standing dosage and missing-wedge problems in electron tomography. Our
work provides important guidance for the application of machine learning
methods to tomographic imaging and sheds light on its applications in other 3D
imaging techniques.

interpolation operations in explicit style representations. Specifically, a new
architecture consisting of two encoding pathways with style block connections
is proposed to decompose the original hard mapping into multiple more
accessible subtasks. In source pathway, we further extract component layouts
with an off-the-shelf human parser and feed them into a shared global texture
encoder for decomposed latent codes. This strategy allows for the synthesis of
more realistic output images and automatic separation of un-annotated

impose three gauge conditions (longitudinal, spatially-flat, and comoving
gauges) for dust and radiation. The resulting energy-momentum tensor is
described only by a gauge invariant variable, but the functional form depends
on the gauge choice. In the matter-dominated epoch with dust-like fluid
background, the second-order effective energy density and pressure of the
perturbations evolve as 1/a^2 in all three gauge choices, like the curvature
density of the Universe, but they do not provide the correct equation of state.
The value of this parameter depends also on the gauge choice. In the
radiation-dominated epoch, the perturbations in the short-wave limit behave in
the same way as the radiation-like fluid in the longitudinal and the
spatially-flat gauges. However, they behave in a different way in the comoving
gauge. As a whole, we conclude that the second-order effective energy-momentum

the value of 1 in the standard model. We consider all known background
processes. For the signal we adopt the most recent event generator of {\tt
POWHEG-BOX-V2} to exploit the NLO distributions for Toolkit for Multivariate

analysis trained for $\lambda_{3H}=1$, compared to the the conventional
cut-and-count approach, the signal-to-background ratio improves tremendously
from about $1/10$ to $1$ and the significance can reach up to $20.5$ with a
luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$ without including systematic uncertainties. In
addition, by implementing a likelihood fitting of the signal-plus-background
$M_{\gamma\gamma b b}$ distribution with optimized bin sizes, it is possible to
determine the THSC with the precision of 7.5\% at 68\% CL even at the early

prior for learning latent representations of deformable 3D shapes. Key to our
construction is the introduction of a geometric distortion criterion, defined
directly on the decoded shapes, translating the preservation of the metric on
the decoding to the formation of linear paths in the underlying latent space.
Our rationale lies in the observation that training samples alone are often
insufficient to endow generative models with high fidelity, motivating the need
for large training datasets. In contrast, metric preservation provides a
rigorous way to control the amount of geometric distortion incurring in the
construction of the latent space, leading in turn to synthetic samples of
higher quality. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the adoption of
differentiable intrinsic distances in the backpropagation of a geodesic loss.
Our geometric priors are particularly relevant in the presence of scarce
training data, where learning any meaningful latent structure can be especially
challenging. The effectiveness and potential of our generative model is
showcased in applications of style transfer, content generation, and shape
completion.

before ending their life as supernovae. These so-called runaway stars can
travel hundreds of parsecs into the low-density interstellar medium, where
momentum and energy from stellar feedback is efficiently deposited. In this
work we explore how this mechanism affects large scale properties of the
galaxy, such as outflows. To do so we use a new model which treats OB stars and
their associated feedback processes on a star-by-star basis. With this model we
compare two hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, one where we
include runaways, and one where we ignore them. Including runaway stars leads
to twice as many supernovae explosions in regions with gas densities ranging
from 1e-5 cm^-3 to 1e-3 cm^-3. This results in more efficient heating of the
inter-arm regions, and drives strong galactic winds with mass loading factors
boosted by up to one order of magnitude. These outflows produce a more massive
and extended multi-phase circumgalactic medium, as well as a population of
dense clouds in the halo. Conversely, since less energy and momentum is
released in the dense star forming regions, the cold phase of the interstellar
medium is less disturbed by feedback effects.

property, it is common to use accuracy of a probe, i.e. a classifier trained to
predict the property from the representations. Despite widespread adoption of
probes, differences in their accuracy fail to adequately reflect differences in
representations. For example, they do not substantially favour pretrained
representations over randomly initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can
be similar when probing for genuine linguistic labels and probing for random
synthetic tasks. To see reasonable differences in accuracy with respect to
these random baselines, previous work had to constrain either the amount of
probe training data or its model size. Instead, we propose an alternative to
the standard probes, information-theoretic probing with minimum description
length (MDL). With MDL probing, training a probe to predict labels is recast as
teaching it to effectively transmit the data. Therefore, the measure of
interest changes from probe accuracy to the description length of labels given
representations. In addition to probe quality, the description length evaluates
""the amount of effort"" needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort
characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii) the amount of data
needed to achieve the high quality. We consider two methods for estimating MDL
which can be easily implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines:
variational coding and online coding. We show that these methods agree in

distinguishable at low temperature: direct bandgap electron-hole and

PL lifetime is limited by population transfer to lower-energy states and no

that the PL lifetime decreases at high temperatures as a consequence of more

charged sites. The negatively charged sites interact with each other through
the Lennard-Jones potential (steric and dispersion interactions), square-well
potential (short-range specific interactions due to electron charge transfer),
and Coulomb potential, whereas the positively charged sites interact with all
types of sites by applying the Coulomb potential only. Taking into account the
nonlocal packing effects via the fundamental measure theory (FMT), dispersion
and specific interactions in the mean-field approximation, and electrostatic
interactions at the many-body level through the random phase approximation, we
describe the liquid-vapour interface. We demonstrate that our model without
explicit account of the association of water molecules due to hydrogen bonding
and with explicit account of the many-body electrostatic interactions at the
many-body level is able to describe the liquid-vapour coexistence curve and the
surface tension at the ambient pressures and temperatures. We obtain very good
agreement with available in the literature MD simulation results for density
profile of liquid-vapour interface at ambient state parameters. The formulated
theory can be used as a theoretical background for describing of the capillary
phenomena, occurring in micro- and mesoporous materials.

assessment of a patient's severity of illness are imperfect. Characterization
of a patient's immune response by quantifying expression levels of specific
genes from blood represents a potentially more timely and precise means of
accomplishing both tasks. Machine learning methods provide a platform to
leverage this 'host response' for development of deployment-ready
classification models. Prioritization of promising classifiers is dependent, in
part, on hyperparameter optimization for which a number of approaches including
grid search, random sampling and Bayesian optimization have been shown to be
effective. We compare HO approaches for the development of diagnostic
classifiers of acute infection and in-hospital mortality from gene expression
of 29 diagnostic markers. We take a deployment-centered approach to our
comprehensive analysis, accounting for heterogeneity in our multi-study patient
cohort with our choices of dataset partitioning and hyperparameter optimization
objective as well as assessing selected classifiers in external (as well as
internal) validation. We find that classifiers selected by Bayesian
optimization for in-hospital mortality can outperform those selected by grid
search or random sampling. However, in contrast to previous research: 1)
Bayesian optimization is not more efficient in selecting classifiers in all
instances compared to grid search or random sampling-based methods and 2) we
note marginal gains in classifier performance in only specific circumstances
when using a common variant of Bayesian optimization (i.e. automatic relevance
determination). Our analysis highlights the need for further practical,
deployment-centered benchmarking of HO approaches in the healthcare context.

complex systems that modern science has encountered so far. In particular,
scientists have concentrated on understanding how the complexity of the
interacting structure between different neurons, proteins or species influences
the functioning of their respective systems. It is well-established that many
biological networks are constructed in a highly hierarchical way with two main
properties: short average paths that join two apparently distant nodes
(neuronal, species, or protein patches) and a high proportion of nodes in
modular aggregations. Although several hypotheses have been proposed so far,
still little is known about the relation of the modules with the dynamical
activity in such biological systems. Here we show that network modularity is a
key ingredient for the formation of self-organising patterns of functional
activity, independently of the topological peculiarities of the structure of
the modules. In particular, we propose a self-organising mechanism which
explains the formation of macroscopic spatial patterns, which are homogeneous
within modules. This may explain how spontaneous order in biological networks
follows their modular structural organisation. We test our results on
real-world networks to confirm the important role of modularity in creating
macro-scale patterns.

However, formation of a singularity-free apparent horizon in finite time of a
distant observer is consistent only with special states of geometry and matter
in its vicinity. In spherical symmetry such horizons exist only in two classes
of solutions of the Einstein equations. Both violate the null energy condition
(NEC) and allow for expanding and contracting trapped regions. However, an
expanding trapped region leads to a firewall. The weighted time average of the
energy density for an observer crossing this firewall is negative and exceeds
the maximal NEC violation that quantum fields can produce. As a result, either
black holes only can evaporate or the semiclassical physics breaks down already
at the horizons. Geometry of a contracting trapped region approaches the
ingoing Vaidya metric with decreasing mass. Only one class of solutions allows
for a test particle to cross the apparent horizon, and for a thin shell to
collapse into a black hole. These results significantly constrain the regular
black hole models. Models with regular matter properties at the horizon can be
realized only if significant departures from the semiclassical physics occur
already at the horizon scale. The Hayward-Frolov model may describe only
evaporation, but not formation of a regular black hole.

Fundamental questions regarding learning in hardware neural networks remain
largely unexplored. Noise in particular is unavoidable in such architectures,
and here we investigate its interaction with a learning algorithm using an
opto-electronic recurrent neural network. We find that noise strongly modifies
the system's path during convergence, and surprisingly fully decorrelates the

magnetic field. We formally investigate all possible small-amplitude solutions
which remain bounded close to the pattern's centre (the core region) and decay
exponentially away from the pattern's centre (the far-field region). The
results are presented for a finite-depth, infinite expanse of ferrofluid
equipped with a linear magnetisation law. These patterns bifurcate at the
Rosensweig instability, where the applied magnetic field strength reaches a
critical threshold. Techniques for finding localised solutions to a
non-autonomous PDE system are established; solutions are decomposed onto a
basis which is independent of the radius, reducing the problem to an infinite
set of nonlinear, non-autonomous ODEs. Using radial centre manifold theory,
local manifolds of small-amplitude solutions are constructed in the core and
far-field regions, respectively. Finally, using geometric blow-up coordinates,
we match the core and far-field manifolds; any solution that lies on this
intersection is a localised radial pattern. Three distinct classes of
stationary radial solutions are found: spot A and spot B solutions, which are
equipped with two different amplitude scaling laws and achieve their maximum
amplitudes at the core, and ring solutions, which achieve their maximum
amplitudes away from the core. These solutions correspond exactly to the
classes of localised radial solutions found for the Swift-Hohenberg equation.
Different values of the linear magnetisation and depth of the ferrofluid are
investigated and parameter regions in which the various localised radial
solutions emerge are identified. The approach taken in this paper outlines a
route to rigorously establishing the existence of axisymmetric localised
patterns in the future.

gain much attention in the community as they can flexibly decide the number of

propose a simple training method, the auxiliary autoencoding permutation

obtain a tractable formulation, only a suitably designed finite subset of the

a linear combination of the sections of the kernel and its derivatives. An
equivalent optimization problem with a quadratic cost function subject to
linear and bilinear constraints is derived. A suitable change of variable gives
a convex reformulation of the problem. To reduce the number of hyperparameters,
the optimization problem is adapted to the case of diagonal kernels. The method

affected if non-equilibrium ionisation effects occur. The aim of this work is
to determine if non-equilibrium ionisation effects are relevant in CMEs and in
particular when and in which regions of the CME. We use a magneto-hydrodynamic
simulation of a magnetic flux rope ejection to generate a CME. From this we
then reconstruct the ionisation state of Hydrogen atoms in the CME by
evaluating both the advection of neutral and ionised Hydrogen atoms and the
ionisation and recombination rates in the MHD simulation. We find that the
equilibrium ionisation assumption holds mostly in the core of the CME. In
contrast non-equilibrium ionisation effects are significant at the CME front,
where we find about 100 times more neutral Hydrogen atoms than prescribed by
ionisation equilibrium conditions, even if this neutral Hydrogen excess might
be difficult to identify due to projection effects. This work provides key
information for the development of a new generation of diagnostic techniques

Rapid and accurate detection of viral pneumonia using chest X-ray can be
significantly useful in large-scale screening and epidemic prevention,
particularly when other chest imaging modalities are less available. Viral
pneumonia often have diverse causes and exhibit notably different visual
appearances on X-ray images. The evolution of viruses and the emergence of
novel mutated viruses further result in substantial dataset shift, which
greatly limits the performance of classification approaches. In this paper, we
formulate the task of differentiating viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia
and healthy controls into an one-class classification-based anomaly detection
problem, and thus propose the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model,
which consists of a shared feature extractor, an anomaly detection module, and
a confidence prediction module. If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly
detection module is large enough or the confidence score estimated by the
confidence prediction module is small enough, we accept the input as an anomaly
case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage of our approach over binary
classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia classes
explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to reinforce

train a neural network by supervising the learning with annotated poses in real
world images. These annotations are generally expensive to obtain and a common
workaround is to generate and train on synthetic scenes, with the drawback of
limited generalisation when the model is deployed in the real world. In this
work, a two-stage 6D object pose estimator framework that can be applied on top
of existing neural-network-based approaches and that does not require pose
annotations on real images is proposed. The first self-supervised stage
enforces the pose consistency between rendered predictions and real input
images, narrowing the gap between the two domains. The second stage fine-tunes
the previously trained model by enforcing the photometric consistency between
pairs of different object views, where one image is warped and aligned to match
the view of the other and thus enabling their comparison. In the absence of
both real image annotations and depth information, applying the proposed
framework on top of two recent approaches results in state-of-the-art
performance when compared to methods trained only on synthetic data, domain

conditions, iron in Fp undergoes a high spin (HS), S=2, to low spin (LS), S=0,
state change. The nature of this phenomenon is quite well understood now, but
there are still basic questions regarding the structural stability and the
existence of soft phonon modes during this iron state change. General theories
exist to explain the volume reduction, the significant thermo-elastic
anomalies, and the broad nature of this HS-LS crossover. These theories make
extensive use of the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Therefore, dynamical
and structural stability is essential to their validity. Here, we investigate
the vibrational spectrum of Fp throughout this spin-crossover using $\textit{ab
initio}$ DFT+Usc calculations. We address vibrational modes associated with
isolated and (2nd) nearest neighbor iron ions undergoing the HS-LS state
change. As expected, acoustic modes of this solid solution are resilient while
optical modes are the most affected. We show that there are no soft phonon
modes across this HS-LS crossover, and Fp is dynamically stable at all relevant
pressures.

have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon
catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator
to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are
obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients
with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs
of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but
that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different
compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility
of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments
expanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different
ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs
connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were
measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances,
modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found
discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional
with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway
resistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also
change the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume
controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP
settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test
lungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to
identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the
hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for
mitigating risks.

after the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME-driven shock wave
moves the streamer sideways, and a decaying oscillation of the streamer is
observed after the CME passage. Previous works generally reported observations
of streamer oscillations taken from a single vantage point (typically the SOHO
spacecraft). We conduct a data survey searching for streamer wave events
observed by the COR2 coronagraphs onboard the STEREO spacecraft. For the first
time, we report observations of streamer wave events from multiple vantage
points, by using the COR2 instrument on both STEREO A and B, as well as the
SOHO/LASCO C2+C3 coronagraphs. We investigate the properties of streamer waves
by comparing the different events and performing a statistical analysis. Common
observational features give us additional insight on the physical nature of
streamer wave events. The most important conclusion is that there appears to be
no relation between the speed of the CME and the phase speed of the resulting
streamer wave, indicating that the streamer wave speed is determined by the
physical properties of the streamer rather than the properties of the CME. This
result makes streamer waves events excellent candidates for coronal seismology
studies. From a comparison between the measured phase speeds and the phase
speeds calculated from the measured periods and wavelengths, we could determine
that the speed of the post-shock solar wind flow in our streamers is around 300
$\mathrm{km \ s}^{-1}$.

Ku (12 GHz) and Ka (26.5-40 GHz) radio-frequency bands for assessing the feeder
link, between the ground gateway and the satellite. Nevertheless, with the aim
to provide hundreds of Mbps of throughput per each user, free-space optical
(FSO) feeder links have been proposed to fulfill these high data rates
requirements. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security
performance for a hybrid very high throughput satellite communication system
with an FSO feeder link. In particular, the satellite receives the incoming
optical wave from an appropriate optical ground station, carrying the data
symbols of $N$ users through various optical apertures and combines them using
the selection combining technique. Henceforth, the decoded and regenerated
information signals of the $N$ users are zero-forcing (ZF) precoded in order to
cancel the interbeam interference at the end-users. The communication is
performed under the presence of malicious eavesdroppers nodes at both hops.
Statistical properties of the signal-to-noise ratio of the legitimate and
wiretap links at each hop are derived, based on which the intercept probability
metric is evaluated. The derived results show that above a certain number of
optical apertures, the secrecy level is not improved further. Also, the
system's secrecy is improved using ZF precoding compared to the no-precoding
scenario for some specific nodes' positions. All the derived analytical
expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

(BZBs). Then we also discovered 18 BL Lac objects lying within the positional
uncertainty regions of UGSs that could be their potential counterparts.

architecture translates spectroscopic parameters into Coulomb matrix
eigenspectra, as a method of recovering chemical and structural information
encoded in the rotational spectrum. The eigenspectrum is subsequently used by
three deep learning networks to constrain the range of stoichiometries,
generate SMILES strings, and predict the most likely functional groups present
in the molecule. In each model, we utilize dropout layers as an approximation
to Bayesian sampling, which subsequently generates probabilistic predictions
from otherwise deterministic models. These models are trained on a modestly

theory where the theoretical uncertainty of the spectroscopic constants are
well understood and used to further augment training. Since chemical and
structural properties depend highly on molecular composition, we divided the
dataset into four groups corresponding to pure hydrocarbons, oxygen-bearing,
nitrogen-bearing, and both oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing species, training each
type of network with one of these categories thus creating ""experts"" within
each domain of molecules. We demonstrate how these models can then be used for

individual pulses of the single-peaked, double-peaked and triple-peaked sGRBs
are fitted to get their statistical properties such as the pulse asymmetry,
amplitude, peak time, and pulse width, etc. For the double-peaked sGRBs,
according to the overlapping ratio between two adjacent peaks, we first define
two kinds of double-peaked sGRBs as M-loose and M-tight types and find that
most of the first pulses are similar to the single-peaked ones. We study the
dependence of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) on the photon energy among
different energy bands. Interestingly, it is found that a power-law relation
with an index of -0.4 does exist between the FWHM and the photon energy for the
single- and double-peaked sGRBs. More interestingly, we notice that the
power-law relation with a positive index also exist for several special short
bursts. In view of the three typical timescales of pulses, namely the angular
spreading timescale, the dynamic timescale, and the cooling timescale, we
propose that the diverse power-law indexes together with the profile evolution

power of present and future hadron colliders to extend the reach of searches
for SUSY, with particular emphasis whether it can be claimed that either
discovery or exclusion is {\it guaranteed} in a region of LSP and NLSP masses -
no set of values of the other SUSY could change the conclusion. A scan over
SUSY parameter space was done, only requiring that the NLSP was a bosino - the
hardest case - with mass not larger than a few TeV. The mass-spectrum,
cross-sections and decay branching ratios found in this region were confronted
with projections of sensitivity at future hadron colliders. In our conclusions
we weigh in the maturity of the analysis the projections are based upon. The
conclusion is that although future hadron colliders have a large
discovery-reach, i.e. potential to discover {\it some} SUSY model, hardly any
models with low-to-medium LSP-NLSP mass-differences can be excluded with
certainty. The models that are expected to be excluded/discovered are, on one
hand, those with mass-differences larger than those allowed by models with
GUT-scale $M_1$-$M_2$ unification, and on the other hand, a tiny region where
the mass-difference is so small that the NLSP decays in the tracking volume of
the detectors. Excluding the latter possibility does not, however, allow to
exclude the possibility of a Wino or Higgsino LSP: at any value of the LSP
mass, we could identify models where the NLSP lifetime would be too short for a
signal to be seen.

convection in the diffusive regime, where the fluid flow is driven by a
destabilizing temperature gradient and stabilized by a stably stratified
salinity gradient. We study how the heat flux, Reynolds number, and flow
structures change with the density ratio $\Lambda$, which is the ratio of the
buoyancy force induced by the salinity gradient to that by the temperature
gradient. When $\Lambda$ increases from zero, the flow first behaves similarly
as in pure Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection, both with respect to flow
structure and to heat transport. The linear stability analysis of Baines & Gill
(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 37, 1969, pp. 289-306) had estimated the critical density
ratio $\Lambda_c$, above which the flow becomes stable. However, here we show
that by using a large-scale circulation as initial condition (rather than the
linear profiles assumed in the linear stability analysis), DDC in the diffusive
regime can exhibit subcritical behaviour when $\Lambda > \Lambda_c$, i.e.,
coexistence of states at the same control parameters. Even though the density
ratio becomes thousands times that of the critical value $\Lambda_c$, there is
still convection with strongly enhanced heat transfer properties compared to
the pure conduction case. We reveal the corresponding flow structures and find
an unstably-stratified region sandwiched between two stably-stratified layers.
Our results demonstrate the importance of the initial condition for DDC in the
diffusive regime, especially in the situation of a large density ratio, which
occurs in high-latitude ocean regions.

former in spintronics and also as another platform for realizing non-trivial

knowledge of the existing exchange fields and/or the stray-fields which are
therefore essential for the study of these systems. Here, we determine the
effective stray-field and the Meissner currents in a
Superconductor/Ferromagnet/Superconductor (S/F/S) junction produced by various
nonhomogenous magnetic textures in the F. The inhomogeneity arises either due
to a periodic structure with flat domain walls (DW) or is caused by an isolated
chiral magnetic skyrmion (Sk). We consider both Bloch- and N\'{e}el-type Sk and
also analyze in detail the periodic structures of different types of DW's--
that is Bloch-type DW (BDW) and N\'{e}el-type DW (NDW) of finite width with in-
and out-of-plane magnetization vector. The spatial dependence of the fields and
Meissner currents are shown to be qualitatively different for the case of
Bloch- and N\'{e}el-type magnetic textures. While the spatial distributions in
the upper and lower S are identical for Bloch-type Sk and DW's they are
asymmetric for the case of N\'{e}el-type magnetic textures. The depairing
factor, which determines the critical temperature and which is related to
vector potential of the stray-field, can have its maximum at the center of a
magnetic domain but also, as we show, above the DW. For Sk's the maximum is
located at a finite distance within the Sk radius. Based on this, we study the
nucleation of superconductivity in the presence of DW's. Because of the
asymmetry for N\'{e}el-type structures, the critical temperature in the upper
and lower S is expected to be different. The obtained results can also be
applied to S/F bilayers.

on convergence of the proposed iterative minimum repairing, and (3) efficient
estimation of parameters in each iteration. Remarkably, with incremental
computation, we reduce the complexity of parameter estimation from O(n) to

using deep reinforcement learning (RL). In 3D modeling software like Maya, a
modeler usually creates a mesh model in two steps: (1) approximating the shape
using a set of primitives; (2) editing the meshes of the primitives to create
detailed geometry. Inspired by such artist-based modeling, we propose a
two-step neural framework based on RL to learn 3D modeling policies. By taking
actions and collecting rewards in an interactive environment, the agents first
learn to parse a target shape into primitives and then to edit the geometry. To
effectively train the modeling agents, we introduce a novel training algorithm
that combines heuristic policy, imitation learning and reinforcement learning.
Our experiments show that the agents can learn good policies to produce regular
and structure-aware mesh models, which demonstrates the feasibility and
effectiveness of the proposed RL framework.

converting the constrained problem to an unconstrained one, we characterize the

for capturing the visual appearance of an object in terms of its surface light
field. In contrast to existing representations, our implicit model represents
surface light fields in a continuous fashion and independent of the geometry.
Moreover, we condition the surface light field with respect to the location and
color of a small light source. Compared to traditional surface light field
models, this allows us to manipulate the light source and relight the object
using environment maps. We further demonstrate the capabilities of our model to
predict the visual appearance of an unseen object from a single real RGB image
and corresponding 3D shape information. As evidenced by our experiments, our
model is able to infer rich visual appearance including shadows and specular
reflections. Finally, we show that the proposed representation can be embedded

expensive to collect. Examples include long-term health effects of medical
interventions, measurements requiring expensive testing or follow-up, and
outcomes only measurable on small panels as in marketing. This reduces
effective sample sizes for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE).
However, there is often an abundance of observations on surrogate outcomes not
of primary interest, such as short-term health effects or online-ad
click-through. We study the role of such surrogate observations in the
efficient estimation of treatment effects. To quantify their value, we derive
the semiparametric efficiency bounds on ATE estimation with and without the
presence of surrogates and several intermediary settings. The difference
between these characterizes the efficiency gains from optimally leveraging
surrogates. We study two regimes: when the number of surrogate observations is
comparable to primary-outcome observations and when the former dominates the
latter. We take an agnostic missing-data approach circumventing strong
surrogate conditions previously assumed. To leverage surrogates' efficiency
gains, we develop efficient ATE estimation and inference based on flexible
machine-learning estimates of nuisance functions appearing in the influence
functions we derive. We empirically demonstrate the gains by studying the
long-term earnings effect of job training.

doubling time is expected to increase by $40\%\sim 50\%$, going from $5^\circ$

at $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present, but its evidence disappears for
the larger datasets. We also analyzed a possible bias: poor countries, often

countries below a given GDP per capita, we find that our conclusions are only
slightly affected and only for the {\it extended} dataset. The significance
remains high, with a $p$-value of $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give
hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should
significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown
policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong
lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the cold season.

(SGD), with low communication load and computational complexity, and still fast
convergence. To reduce the communication load, at each iteration of the
algorithm, the worker nodes calculate and communicate some scalers, that are
the directional derivatives of the sample functions in some \emph{pre-shared
directions}. However, to maintain accuracy, after every specific number of
iterations, they communicate the vectors of stochastic gradients. To reduce the
computational complexity in each iteration, the worker nodes approximate the
directional derivatives with zeroth-order stochastic gradient estimation, by
performing just two function evaluations rather than computing a first-order
gradient vector. The proposed method highly improves the convergence rate of
the zeroth-order methods, guaranteeing order-wise faster convergence. Moreover,
compared to the famous communication-efficient methods of model averaging (that
perform local model updates and periodic communication of the gradients to
synchronize the local models), we prove that for the general class of
non-convex stochastic problems and with reasonable choice of parameters, the
proposed method guarantees the same orders of communication load and
convergence rate, while having order-wise less computational complexity.
Experimental results on various learning problems in neural networks

various state-of-the-art distributed SGD methods.

action localization model with only video-level action labeling available. The
general framework largely relies on the classification activation, which
employs an attention model to identify the action-related frames and then
categorizes them into different classes. Such method results in the
action-context confusion issue: context frames near action clips tend to be
recognized as action frames themselves, since they are closely related to the
specific classes. To solve the problem, in this paper we propose to model the
class-agnostic frame-wise probability conditioned on the frame attention using
conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). With the observation that the
context exhibits notable difference from the action at representation level, a
probabilistic model, i.e., conditional VAE, is learned to model the likelihood
of each frame given the attention. By maximizing the conditional probability
with respect to the attention, the action and non-action frames are well
separated. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 demonstrate advantage of
our method and effectiveness in handling action-context confusion problem. Code

in mind, we apply the principles of cycle-consistent generative adversarial

in the ICM after dissecting the abundance profiles into different components.
We use Chandra archival observations of 186 morphologically regular clusters in
the redshift range [0.04, 1.07]. For each cluster we compute the iron abundance
and gas density profiles. We aim at identifying in the iron distribution a
central peak associated with the BCG, and an approximately constant plateau
associated with early enrichment. We are able to firmly identify the two
components in a significant fraction of the sample, simply relying on the fit
of the abundance profile. We compute the iron mass included in the iron peak
and plateau, and the gas mass-weighted iron abundance out to $r_{500}$. While
the iron plateau shows no evolution, we find marginal decrease with redshift in
the iron peak. We measure that the fraction of iron peak mass is typically a
few percent (~1%) of the total iron mass within $r_{500}$. Therefore, since the
total iron mass budget is dominated by the plateau, we find consistently that
the global gas mass-weighted iron abundance does not evolve significantly. We
are also able to reproduce past claims of evolution in the global iron
abundance, which turn out to be due to the use of cluster samples with
different selection methods combined to the use of emission-weighted instead of
gas mass-weighted abundance values. Finally, while the intrinsic scatter in the
iron plateau mass is consistent with zero, the iron peak mass exhibits a large
scatter, in line with the fact that the peak is produced after the
virialization of the halo and depends on the formation of the hosting cool core
and the associated feedback processes. We conclude that only a
spatially-resolved approach can resolve the issue of the ICM iron evolution,
reconciling the contradictory results obtained in the last ten years.

complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving

on a surface by its structure. The study of this problem led us to a new
conformally invariant property, called isotropic isothermicity, that coincides
with the usual concept of isothermicity for surfaces lying in totally umbilical
hypersurfaces, and is related to lines of curvature and infinitesimal isometric
deformations that preserve the mean curvature vector field. We show that if a
simply-connected surface is not proper Bonnet, then it admits either at most
one, or exactly three Bonnet mates. For simply-connected proper Bonnet
surfaces, the moduli space is either 1-dimensional with at most two connected
components diffeomorphic to the circle, or the 2-dimensional torus. We prove
that simply-connected Bonnet surfaces lying in totally geodesic hypersurfaces

characterizes the proper Bonnet surfaces, and we provide relevant conditions

compact surfaces that are locally proper Bonnet, and we prove that the
existence of a uniform substructure on the local moduli spaces, characterizes
surfaces with a vertically harmonic Gauss lift that are neither minimal, nor

  condensate by using a local acceleration potential",,,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons is one of few macroscopic quantum
phenomena observable at room temperature. Due to competition of the exchange
and the magnetic dipole interactions the minimum-energy magnon state is doubly
degenerate and corresponds to two antiparallel non-zero wavevectors.
Correspondingly, magnon BEC differs essentially from other condensates, since
it takes place simultaneously at +/-k_min. The degeneracy of BEC and
interaction between its two components have significant impact on the
condensate properties. Phase locking of the two condensates causes formation of
a standing wave of the condensate density and quantized vortices. Additionally,
interaction between the two components is believed to be important for
stabilization of the condensate with respect to the real-space collapse. Thus,
the possibility to create a non-degenerate, single-component condensate is
decisive for understanding of underlying physics of magnon BEC. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate an approach, which allows one to accomplish this
challenging task. We show that this can be achieved by using a separation of
the two components of the degenerate condensate in the real space by applying a
local pulsed magnetic field, which causes their motion in the opposite
directions. Thus, after a certain delay, the two clouds corresponding to
different components become well separated in the real space. We find that the
motion of the clouds can be described well based on the peculiarities of the
magnon dispersion characteristics. Additionally, we show that, during the
motion, the condensate cloud harvests non-condensed magnons, which results in a
partial compensation of the condensate depletion.

chemistry. It is essential in predicting infrared and sum-frequency generation
spectra, as well as induction and long-range electrostatic interactions.
Furthermore, it can be extracted directly from high-level quantum mechanical
calculations, making it an ideal target for machine learning (ML). In this
work, we choose to represent this quantity with a physically inspired ML model
that captures two distinct physical effects: local atomic polarization is
captured within the symmetry-adapted Gaussian process regression (SA-GPR)
framework, which assigns a (vector) dipole moment to each atom, while movement
of charge across the entire molecule is captured by assigning a partial
(scalar) charge to each atom. The resulting ""MuML"" models are fitted together
to reproduce molecular $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ computed using high-level
coupled-cluster theory (CCSD) and density functional theory (DFT) on the QM7b
dataset. The combined model shows excellent transferability when applied to a
showcase dataset of larger and more complex molecules, approaching the accuracy
of DFT at a small fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that
the uncertainty in the predictions can be estimated reliably using a calibrated
committee model. The ultimate performance of the models depends, however, on
the details of the system at hand, with the scalar model being clearly superior
when describing large molecules whose dipole is almost entirely generated by
charge separation. These observations point to the importance of simultaneously
accounting for the local and non-local effects that contribute to
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$; further, they define a challenging task to benchmark future
models, particularly those aimed at the description of condensed phases.

accretion disk, two populations of clouds, bipolar jets, and a dusty torus. The
clouds move in Keplerian orbits at high velocities. In particular, the
broad-line region (BLR) clouds have velocities ranging from $1000$ to $10000$
km s$^{-1}$. Given the extreme proximity of these clouds to the supermassive
black hole, frequent collisions with the accretion disk should occur. The
impact of BLR clouds onto the accretion disk can produce strong shock waves
where particles might be accelerated. The goal of this work is to investigate
the production of relativistic particles, and the associated non-thermal
radiation in these events. In particular, we apply the model we develop to the
Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. We analyze the efficiency of diffusive shock
acceleration in the shock of colliding clouds of the BLR with the accretion
disk. We calculate the spectral energy distribution of photons generated by the
relativistic particles and estimate the number of simultaneous impacts needed
to explain the gamma radiation observed by the Fermi satellite in Seyfert
galaxies. We find that is possible to understand the measured gamma emission in
terms of the interaction of clouds with the disk if the hard X-ray emission of
the source is at least obscured between $20\%$ and $40\%$. The total number of
clouds contained in the BLR region might be between $3\times10^{8}$ and
$6\times10^{8}$, which are values in good agreement with the observational
evidence. The maximum energy achieved by the protons ($\sim$ PeV) in this

physics performance for particular approaches to calorimeter detector
technologies and configurations are:
  - Emulating particular detector properties including raw detector response
together with a signal processing chain to adequately simulate a calorimeter
response for different signal and background conditions. This includes
combining detector properties obtained from the general Geant simulation with

the detector response which is reasonably tuned to extract the most of the

modern machine learning approaches, that allow a combination of available

advanced machine learning techniques to speed up and improve the precision of

solutions for globally integrable initial data was established in [5]. However,
in the Euclidean space, it is known from Herrero and Pierre [20] that the
Cauchy problem associated with the FDE is well posed for initial data that are
merely in $ L^1_{\mathrm{loc}} $. We establish here that such data still give
rise to global solutions on general Riemannian manifolds. If, in addition, the
radial Ricci curvature satisfies a suitable pointwise bound from below
(possibly diverging to $-\infty$ at spatial infinity), we prove that also
uniqueness holds, for the same type of data, in the class of strong solutions.
Besides, under the further assumption that the initial datum is in
$L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ and nonnegative, a minimal solution is shown to exist, and
we are able to establish uniqueness of purely (nonnegative) distributional
solutions, which to our knowledge was not known before even in the Euclidean
space. The required curvature bound is in fact sharp, since on model manifolds
it turns out to be equivalent to stochastic completeness, and it was shown in
[13] that uniqueness for the FDE fails even in the class of bounded solutions
on manifolds that are not stochastically complete. Qualitatively this amounts
to asking that the curvature diverges at most quadratically at infinity. A
crucial ingredient of the uniqueness result is the proof of nonexistence of
distributional subsolutions to certain semilinear elliptic equations with power

matter effects on stars. But, in this work, we implemented Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs) annihilation as a new source of energy inside such

density environments. The new source of energy causes stars to follow different
evolutionary paths on the H-R diagram in comparison with classical stellar
evolutionary models. Increasing dark matter density in stellar evolutionary
simulations causes the deviations from the standard H-R diagrams becomes more
pronounced. By investigating the effects of WIMPs density on stellar structures

When the subspaces are $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, this can be
cast as finding the center of a minimum enclosing ball on a Grassmann manifold,
Gr$(k,n)$. For subspaces of different dimension, the setting becomes a disjoint
union of Grassmannians rather than a single manifold, and the problem is no
longer well-defined. However, natural geometric maps exist between these
manifolds with a well-defined notion of distance for the images of the
subspaces under the mappings. Solving the initial problem in this context leads
to a candidate minimax center on each of the constituent manifolds, but does
not inherently provide intuition about which candidate is the best
representation of the data. Additionally, the solutions of different rank are
generally not nested so a deflationary approach will not suffice, and the
problem must be solved independently on each manifold. We propose and solve an
optimization problem parametrized by the rank of the minimax center. The
solution is computed using a subgradient algorithm on the dual. By scaling the
objective and penalizing the information lost by the rank-$k$ minimax center,
we jointly recover an optimal dimension, $k^*$, and a central subspace, $U^*

of verifying the authenticity of messages. Updating the protocol would close
off security loopholes in new aircraft but would require thousands of airplanes
to be modified. For the interim, until the protocol is replaced, we propose the
first intrusion detection system that utilizes a hardware fingerprinting
approach for sender identification for the ARINC 429 data bus. Our approach
relies on the observation that changes in hardware, such as replacing a
transmitter or a receiver with a rogue one, modify the electric signal of the
transmission. Because we rely on the analog properties, and not on the digital
content of the transmissions, we are able to detect a hardware switch as soon
as it occurs, even if the data that is being transmitted is completely normal.
Thus, we are able to preempt the attack before any damage is caused. In this
paper we describe the design of our intrusion detection system and evaluate its
performance against different adversary models. Our analysis includes both a
theoretical Markov-chain model and an extensive empirical evaluation. For this
purpose, we collected a data corpus of ARINC 429 data traces, which may be of
independent interest since, to the best of our knowledge, no public corpus is

e.g., it achieves near-zero false alarms per second, while detecting a rogue

$N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not

series of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the
infectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which
includes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic

solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$

model is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an
exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more
recent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is
reliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the

error free and experimentally verified. Performing material measurements are
time-consuming and often restricted by the fact that material sample
preparations are non-trivial, labour-intensive and expensive. Numerical
modelling of materials has been studied over the years in order to address
these issues and nowadays it has been developed at multi-scale and
multi-physics levels. However, numerical models for nano-composites, especially
for ferroelectrics are limited due to multiple unknowns including oxygen
vacancy densities, grain sizes and domain boundaries existing in the system. In
this work, we introduce a human-machine interactive learning framework by
developing a scalable semi-empirical model to accurately predict material
properties enabled by deep learning (DL). MgO-doped BST (BaxSr1-xTiO3) is
selected as an example ferroelectric-dielectric composite for validation. The
DL model transfer-learns the experimental features of materials from a
measurement database which includes data for over 100 different ferroelectric
composites collected by screening the published data and combining our own
measurement data. The trained DL model is utilized in providing feedback to
human researchers, who then refine computer model parameters accordingly, hence
completing the interactive learning cycle. Finally, the developed DL model is
applied to predict and optimise new ferroelectric-dielectric composites with
the highest figure of merit (FOM) value.

virtual colonoscopy (VC), are critical for diagnosing and ultimately removing
polyps (precursors of colon cancer). The non-invasive VC is normally used to
inspect a 3D reconstructed colon (from CT scans) for polyps and if found, the
OC procedure is performed to physically traverse the colon via endoscope and
remove these polyps. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework,
Extended and Directional CycleGAN, for lossy unpaired image-to-image
translation between OC and VC to augment OC video sequences with
scale-consistent depth information from VC, and augment VC with
patient-specific textures, color and specular highlights from OC (e.g, for
realistic polyp synthesis). Both OC and VC contain structural information, but
it is obscured in OC by additional patient-specific texture and specular
highlights, hence making the translation from OC to VC lossy. The existing
CycleGAN approaches do not handle lossy transformations. To address this
shortcoming, we introduce an extended cycle consistency loss, which compares
the geometric structures from OC in the VC domain. This loss removes the need
for the CycleGAN to embed OC information in the VC domain. To handle a stronger
removal of the textures and lighting, a Directional Discriminator is introduced
to differentiate the direction of translation (by creating paired information
for the discriminator), as opposed to the standard CycleGAN which is
direction-agnostic. Combining the extended cycle consistency loss and the
Directional Discriminator, we show state-of-the-art results on scale-consistent
depth inference for phantom, textured VC and for real polyp and normal colon
video sequences. We also present results for realistic pendunculated and flat
polyp synthesis from bumps introduced in 3D VC models. Code/models:

comparable to or even harder than cubic boron nitride (c-BN) due the full

an exact numerical solution to the phonon Boltzmann equation, we show that
BC$_{2}$N has a high lattice thermal conductivity exceeding that of c-BN owing
to the strong C-C and B-N bonds, which produce high phonon frequencies as well
as high acoustic velocities. The existence of large group velocities in the
optical branches is responsible for its large thermal conductivity. Its
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is found to vary from
2.6$\times$10$^{-6}$/K at room temperature to almost 5$\times$ 10$^{-6}$/K at
1000K. The combination of large thermal conductivity and a good CTE match with
that of Si, makes BC$_2$N a promising material for use in thermal management
and high-power electronics applications. We show that the application of
compressive strain increases the thermal conductivity significantly. This
enhancement results from the overall increased frequency scale with pressure,
which makes acoustic and optic velocities higher, and weaker phonon-phonon
scattering rates.

two-dimensional model fermionic systems on triangular lattices (with and
without periodic boundary conditions), using the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In particular, we focus on the nature of the
entangler blocks which provide the most efficient convergence to the system
ground state inasmuch as they use the minimal number of gate operations, which
is key for the implementation of this algorithm in NISQ computers. Using the
concurrence measure, the amount of entanglement of the register qubits is
monitored during the entire optimization process, illuminating its role in
determining the efficiency of the convergence. Finally, we investigate the
scaling of the VQE circuit depth as a function of the desired energy accuracy.
We show that the number of gates required to reach a solution within an error
$\varepsilon$ follows the Solovay-Kitaev scaling,
$\mathcal{O}(\log^c(1/\varepsilon))$, with an exponent $c = 1.31

and fuzzy modus tollens(FMT) are two fundamental and basic models of general
fuzzy approximate reasoning in various fuzzy systems. And the reductive
property is one of the essential and important properties in the approximate
reasoning theory and it is a lot of applications. This paper suggests a kind of
extended distance measure (EDM) based approximate reasoning method in the
single input single output(SISO) fuzzy system with discrete fuzzy set vectors
of different dimensions. The EDM based fuzzy approximate reasoning method is
consists of two part, i.e., FMP-EDM and FMT-EDM. The distance measure based
fuzzy reasoning method that the dimension of the antecedent discrete fuzzy set
is equal to one of the consequent discrete fuzzy set has already solved in
other paper. In this paper discrete fuzzy set vectors of different dimensions
mean that the dimension of the antecedent discrete fuzzy set differs from one
of the consequent discrete fuzzy set in the SISO fuzzy system. That is, this
paper is based on EDM. The experimental results highlight that the proposed
approximate reasoning method is comparatively clear and effective with respect
to the reductive property, and in accordance with human thinking than existing

passing network. However, a tolerance to players being marked or passes being
blocked in a passing network, namely the robustness of the network, has been
poorly understood so far. Because the robustness of a passing network can be
connected to the increase of ball possession, it would be deeply related to the
outcome of a game. Here, we developed position-dependent passing networks of 45
matches by 18 teams belonging to the Japan Professional Football League. Then,
nodes or links were continuously removed from the passing networks by two
removal methods so that we could evaluate the robustness of these networks
against the removals. The results show that these passing networks commonly
contain hubs (key players making passes). Then, we analyzed the most robust
networks in detail and found that their full backs increase the robustness by
often invoking a heavier emphasis on attack. Moreover, we showed that the

humans was commonplace in the history of our species. After admixture, some
individuals with admixed autosomes carried the modern Homo Sapiens uniparental
DNAs, while the rest carried the archaic versions. Coevolution of admixed
autosomes and uniparental DNAs is expected to cause some of the sites in modern
uniparental DNAs to revert back to archaic alleles, while the opposite process
would occur (from archaic to modern) in some of the sites in archaic
uniparental DNAs. This type of coevolution is one of the elements that
differentiate the two different models of the Y phylogenetic tree of modern
humans, rooting it either in Africa or East Asia. The expected reversion to
archaic alleles is assumed to occur and is easily traceable in the Asia model,
but is absent in the Africa model due to its infinite site assumption, which
also precludes the independent or convergent mutation to modern alleles in
archaic uniparental DNAs since mutations are assumed to occur randomly across a
neutral genome, and convergent evolution is assumed not to occur. Here, we
examined newly published high coverage Y chromosome sequencing data of two
Denisovan and two Neanderthal samples to determine whether they carry
modern-Homo Sapiens alleles in sites where they are not supposed to according
to the Africa model. The results showed that a significant fraction of the
sites that, according to the Asia model, should differentiate the original
modern Y from the original archaic Y carried modern alleles in the archaic Y
samples here. Some of these modern alleles were shared among all archaic humans
while others could differentiate Denisovans from Neanderthals. The observation
is best accounted for by coevolution of archaic Y and admixed modern autosomes,
and hence supports the Asia model, since it takes such coevolution into
account.

research. Nowadays, plenty of attention has been focused on local methods of
community detection. Among them, community detection with a greedy algorithm
typically starts from the identification of local essential nodes called
central nodes of the network; communities expand later from these central nodes
by optimizing a modularity function. In this paper, we propose a new central
node indicator and a new modularity function. Our central node indicator, which
we call local centrality indicator (LCI), is as efficient as the well-known
global maximal degree indicator and local maximal degree indicator; on certain
special network structure, LCI performs even better. On the other hand, our
modularity function F2 overcomes certain disadvantages,such as the resolution
limit problem,of the modularity functions raised in previous literature.
Combined with a greedy algorithm, LCI and F2 enable us to identify the right
community structures for both the real world networks and the simulated
benchmark network. Evaluation based on the normalized mutual information (NMI)
suggests that our community detection method with a greedy algorithm based on
LCI and F2 performs superior to many other methods. Therefore, the method we
proposed in this paper is potentially noteworthy.

machine learning tool for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) and disease
prediction. A key component in these models is to build a population graph,
where the graph adjacency matrix represents pair-wise patient similarities.
Until now, the similarity metrics have been defined manually, usually based on
meta-features like demographics or clinical scores. The definition of the
metric, however, needs careful tuning, as GCNs are very sensitive to the graph
structure. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time in the CADx domain
that it is possible to learn a single, optimal graph towards the GCN's
downstream task of disease classification. To this end, we propose a novel,
end-to-end trainable graph learning architecture for dynamic and localized
graph pruning. Unlike commonly employed spectral GCN approaches, our GCN is
spatial and inductive, and can thus infer previously unseen patients as well.
We demonstrate significant classification improvements with our learned graph
on two CADx problems in medicine. We further explain and visualize this result
using an artificial dataset, underlining the importance of graph learning for
more accurate and robust inference with GCNs in medical applications.

  Prediction over Traffic Data",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work focuses on classification over time series data. When a time series
is generated by non-stationary phenomena, the pattern relating the series with
the class to be predicted may evolve over time (concept drift). Consequently,
predictive models aimed to learn this pattern may become eventually obsolete,
hence failing to sustain performance levels of practical use. To overcome this
model degradation, online learning methods incrementally learn from new data
samples arriving over time, and accommodate eventual changes along the data
stream by implementing assorted concept drift strategies. In this manuscript we
elaborate on the suitability of online learning methods to predict the road
congestion level based on traffic speed time series data. We draw interesting
insights on the performance degradation when the forecasting horizon is
increased. As opposed to what is done in most literature, we provide evidence
of the importance of assessing the distribution of classes over time before
designing and tuning the learning model. This previous exercise may give a hint
of the predictability of the different congestion levels under target.
Experimental results are discussed over real traffic speed data captured by
inductive loops deployed over Seattle (USA). Several online learning methods
are analyzed, from traditional incremental learning algorithms to more
elaborated deep learning models. As shown by the reported results, when
increasing the prediction horizon, the performance of all models degrade
severely due to the distribution of classes along time, which supports our
claim about the importance of analyzing this distribution prior to the design
of the model.

range of applications for the statistical reconstruction of heterogeneous

(ED) that quantify the degree of spatial non-uniformity of configurations of
finite-sized objects. This technique is an innovative development of previously
elaborated entropy methods for statistical reconstruction. Here, we discuss the
two-dimensional case, but this method can be generalized into three dimensions.
At the first stage, the developed procedure creates a set of black synthetic
clusters that serve as surrogate inclusions. The clusters have the same
individual areas and interfaces as their target counterparts, but random
shapes. Then, from a given number of easy-to-generate synthetic cluster
configurations, we choose the one with the lowest value of the cost function
defined by us using extended ED. At the second stage, we make a significant
change in the standard technique of simulated annealing (SA). Instead of
swapping pixels of different phases, we randomly move each of the selected
synthetic clusters. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reconstruct
and analyze two-phase microstructures with irregular inclusions of silica in
rubber matrix as well as stones in cement paste. The results show that the
two-stage reconstruction (TSR) method provides convincing realizations for
these complex microstructures. The advantages of TSR include the ease of
obtaining synthetic microstructures, very low computational costs, and
satisfactory mapping in the statistical context of inclusion shapes. Finally,
its simplicity should greatly facilitate independent applications.
