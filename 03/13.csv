multichannel optical communication systems. In the case of pilot-aided
estimation, the pilots are distributed over a two-dimensional channel--time
symbol block that is transmitted through multiple channels. However, suboptimal
pilot distributions reduce the effectiveness of the carrier-phase estimation
and thus result in unnecessary pilot overhead, which reduces the overall
information rate of the system. It is shown that placing pilots identically in
all channels is suboptimal in general. By instead optimizing the pilot
distribution, the mean squared error of the phase-noise estimates can be
decreased by over 90% in some cases. Moreover, it is shown that the achievable
information rate can be increased by up to 0.05, 0.16, and 0.41 bits per

architecture composed of dimensionality reduction network and reconstruction
network to respectively mimic the pilot signals and channel estimator, which
can be acquired by data-driven deep learning. For the dimensionality reduction
network, we design a fully-connected layer by compressing the high-dimensional
massive MIMO channel vector as input to low-dimensional received measurements,
where the weights are regarded as the pilot signals. For the reconstruction
network, we design a fully-connected layer followed by multiple cascaded
convolutional layers, which will reconstruct the high-dimensional channel as
the output. By defining the mean square error between input and output as loss
function, we leverage Adam algorithm to train the end-to-end DNN aforementioned
with extensive channel samples. In this way, both the pilot signals and channel
estimator can be simultaneously obtained. The simulation results demonstrate
that the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art compressive

  Behavioral Research published by Taylor & Francis",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) are psychometric models for
evaluating a student's mastery of the essential skills in a content domain
based upon their responses to a set of test items. Currently, diagnostic model
and/or Q-matrix misspecification is a known problem with limited avenues for
remediation. To address this problem, this paper defines a one-sided score
statistic that is a computationally efficient method for detecting
under-specification of both the Q-matrix and the model parameters of the
particular DCM chosen in the analysis. This method is analogous to the
modification indices widely used in structural equation modeling. The results
of a simulation study show the Type I error rate of modification indices for
DCMs are acceptably close to the nominal significance level when the
appropriate mixture chi-squared reference distribution is used. The simulation
results indicate that modification indices are very powerful in the detection
of an under-specified Q-matrix and have ample power to detect the omission of
model parameters in large samples or when the items are highly discriminating.
An application of modification indices for DCMs to analysis of response data
from a large-scale administration of a diagnostic test demonstrates how they
can be useful in diagnostic model refinement.

neither with the MF limit nor with the NTK one. We show that for networks with
more than two hidden layers RMSProp training has a non-trivial discrete-time MF
limit but GD training does not have one. Overall, our framework demonstrates
that both MF and NTK limits have considerable limitations in approximating
finite-sized neural nets, indicating the need for designing more accurate

$N=5$ SCFT in three dimensions. We give a number of domain walls interpolating
between this $AdS_4$ fixed point and singular geometries in the IR with $SO(4)$
and $SO(3)$ symmetries. These solutions describe RG flows from the $N=5$ SCFT
to non-conformal field theories driven by mass deformations. The $SO(4)$
solutions are precisely in agreement with the previously known mass
deformations within the dual $N=5$ SCFT. We also find supersymmetric Janus
solutions describing two-dimensional conformal defects in the $N=5$ SCFT with
$N=(4,1)$ and $N=(1,1)$ supersymmetries on the defects. Finally, we study
supersymmetric solutions of the form $AdS_2\times \Sigma^2$, with
$\Sigma^2=S^2,H^2$ being a Riemann surface, corresponding to near horizon
geometries of $AdS_4$ black holes. We consider both magnetic and dyonic
solutions and find that there exists a class of magnetic $AdS_2\times H^2$
solutions with $SO(2)$ symmetry. It is rather remarkable that a complete
analytic solution interpolating between $AdS_4$ and $AdS_2\times H^2$ with a
running scalar can be obtained. The solution corresponds to a twisted
compactification of $N=5$ SCFT to superconformal quantum mechanics. We also
show that no purely magnetic or dyonic black holes with $AdS_2\times \Sigma^2$
horizon from $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ twist exist in $N=5$, $SO(5)$ gauged
supergravity.

real-world applications. Among all the pruning approaches, those implementing a
sparsity learning framework have shown to be effective as they learn and prune
the models in an end-to-end data-driven manner. However, these works impose the
same sparsity regularization on all filters indiscriminately, which can hardly
result in an optimal structure-sparse network. In this paper, we propose a
Saliency-Adaptive Sparsity Learning (SASL) approach for further optimization. A
novel and effective estimation of each filter, i.e., saliency, is designed,
which is measured from two aspects: the importance for the prediction
performance and the consumed computational resources. During sparsity learning,
the regularization strength is adjusted according to the saliency, so our
optimized format can better preserve the prediction performance while zeroing
out more computation-heavy filters. The calculation for saliency introduces
minimum overhead to the training process, which means our SASL is very
efficient. During the pruning phase, in order to optimize the proposed
data-dependent criterion, a hard sample mining strategy is utilized, which
shows higher effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superior performance of our method. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012 dataset, our
approach can reduce 49.7% FLOPs of ResNet-50 with very negligible 0.39% top-1
and 0.05% top-5 accuracy degradation.

to dust properties (i.e. dust composition, size and shape) and play a key role
in numerous phenomena in the interstellar medium (ISM). The large disparity in
physical conditions (i.e. density, gas temperature) in the ISM triggers an
evolution of dust properties. The analysis of how dust evolves with the
physical conditions is a stepping-stone towards a more thorough understanding
of interstellar dust. The aim of this paper is to highlight dust evolution in
the Horsehead Nebula PDR region. We use Spitzer/IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8
{\mu}m), Spitzer/MIPS (24 {\mu}m) together with Herschel/PACS (70 and 160
{\mu}m) and Herschel/SPIRE (250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m) to map the spatial
distribution of dust in the Horsehead over the entire emission spectral range.
We model dust emission and scattering using the THEMIS interstellar dust model
together with the 3D radiative transfer code SOC. We find that the nano-grains
dust-to-gas ratio in the irradiated outer part of the Horsehead is 6 to 10
times lower than in the diffuse ISM. Their minimum size is 2 to 2.25 times
larger than in the diffuse ISM and the power-law exponent of their size
distribution, 1.1 to 1.4 times lower than in the diffuse ISM. Regarding the
denser part of the Horsehead, it is necessary to use evolved grains (i.e.
aggregates, with or without an ice mantle). It is not possible to explain the
observations using grains from the diffuse medium. We therefore propose the
following scenario to explain our results. In the outer part of the Horsehead,
all the nano-grains have not yet had time to re-form completely through
photo-fragmentation of aggregates and the smallest of the nano-grains that are
sensitive to the radiation field are photo-destroyed. In the inner part of the
Horsehead, grains most likely consist of multi-compositional, mantled
aggregates.

applications, such as optical zoom, low-light imaging and High Dynamic Range
(HDR) imaging. In this work, we explore an optimal method for capturing the
scene HDR and disparity map using dual camera setups. Hasinoff et al. (2010)
have developed a noise optimal framework for HDR capture from a single camera.
We generalize this to the dual camera set-up for estimating both HDR and
disparity map. It may seem that dual camera systems can capture HDR in a
shorter time. However, disparity estimation is a necessary step, which requires
overlap among the images captured by the two cameras. This may lead to an
increase in the capture time. To address this conflicting requirement, we
propose a novel framework to find the optimal exposure and ISO sequence by
minimizing the capture time under the constraints of an upper bound on the
disparity error and a lower bound on the per-exposure SNR. We show that the
resulting optimization problem is non-convex in general and propose an
appropriate initialization technique. To obtain the HDR and disparity map from
the optimal capture sequence, we propose a pipeline which alternates between
estimating the camera ICRFs and the scene disparity map. We demonstrate that
our optimal capture sequence leads to better results than other possible
capture sequences. Our results are also close to those obtained by capturing
the full stereo stack spanning the entire dynamic range. Finally, we present
for the first time a stereo HDR dataset consisting of dense ISO and exposure
stack captured from a smartphone dual camera. The dataset consists of 6 scenes,
with an average of 142 exposure-ISO image sequence per scene.

induced by four simple robot shapes are investigated: sphere, upright cylinder,
horizontally-laid cylinder, and five-pointed star-shaped prism. Shapes with
cross-sections that are axisymmetric about the rotation axis (sphere and
upright cylinder) generate time-invariant flow fields, which could be useful
for applications such as micromanipulation. Non-axisymmetric shapes
(horizontally-laid cylinder and the star-shaped prism) induce significant
unsteadiness inside the flow field, which could be desirable for applications
such as micromixing. Furthermore, a slender horizontally-laid cylinder
generates substantially three-dimensional flows, an added benefit for
micromixing applications. The presence of nearby walls such as a bottom
substrate or sidewalls has a retarding effect on the induced flows, which is
quantified. Finally, we present the driving torque and power-consumption of
these microrobots rotating in viscous liquids. The numerical modeling platform

for the Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$), radio and X-ray backgrounds from both Pop III

star formation rate density estimates (and the Ly$\alpha$ background) from the
{\it Delphi} semi-analytic model that has been shown to reproduce all key
observables for galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$; the radio and X-ray backgrounds are
fixed using low-$z$ values. The constraints on the free parameters
characterizing the properties of the Pop III stars are obtained using a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results yield a $\dot{\rho}_{*}^{III}$ that
whilst increasing from $z \sim 21-16$ thereafter shows a sharp decline which is
in excellent agreement with the results found by \citet{valiante2016} to
simulate the growth of $z \sim 6 - 7$ quasars and their host galaxies,
suggesting that the bulk of Pop III star formation occurs in the rarest and
most massive metal-poor halos at $z \lesssim 20$. This allows Pop III stars to
produce a rapidly growing Ly$\alpha$ background between $z \sim 21-15$.
Further, Pop III stars are required to provide a radio background that is about
$3-4$ orders of magnitude higher than that provided by Pop II stars although
Pop II stars dominate the X-ray background.

continuous-time mixed-monotone dynamical systems subject to a disturbance
input. The vector field of a mixed-monotone system is decomposable via a
decomposition function into increasing and decreasing components, and this
decomposition enables embedding the original dynamics in a higher-dimensional
embedding system. While the original system is subject to an unknown
disturbance input, the embedding system has no disturbances and its
trajectories provide bounds for finite-time reachable sets of the original
dynamics. Our main contribution is to show how one can efficiently identify
robustly forward invariant and attractive sets for mixed-monotone systems by
studying certain equilibria of this embedding system. We show also how this
approach, when applied to the backward-time dynamics, establishes different
robustly forward invariant sets for the original dynamics. Lastly, we present
an independent result for computing decomposition functions for systems with
polynomial dynamics. These tools and results are demonstrated through several
examples and a case study.

need by designing a semi-automatic software program for applying reliable
segmentation of 8 different macular layers as well as outlining retinal
pathologies such as diabetic macular edema. The software accommodates a novel
graph-based semi-automatic method, called ''Livelayer'' which is designed for
straightforward segmentation of retinal layers and fluids. This method is
chiefly based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path (SPF) algorithm and the Live-wire
function together with some preprocessing operations on the to-be-segmented
images. The software is indeed suitable for obtaining detailed segmentation of
layers, exact localization of clear or unclear fluid objects and the ground
truth, demanding far less endeavor in comparison to a common manual
segmentation method. It is also valuable as a tool for calculating the
irregularity index in deformed OCT images. The amount of time (seconds) that
Livelayer required for segmentation of ILM, IPL-INL, OPL-ONL was much less than
that for the manual segmentation, 5s for the ILM (minimum) and 15.57s for the
OPL-ONL (maximum). The unsigned errors (pixels) between the semi-automatically
labeled and gold standard data was on average 2.7, 1.9, 2.1 for ILM, IPL-INL,
OPL-ONL, respectively. The Bland-Altman plots indicated perfect concordance
between the Livelayer and the manual algorithm and that they could be used

and < 1 for the other two. The dice scores for comparing the two algorithms and
for obtaining the repeatability on segmentation of fluid objects were at
acceptable levels.

65Ab (TOI-129, TIC-201248411) is an ultra-short-period Jupiter orbiting a
bright (V=11.1 mag) K4-dwarf every 0.98 days. It is a massive 3.213 +/- 0.078
Mjup planet in a grazing transit configuration with an impact parameter of b =
1.17 +0.10/-0.08. As a result the radius is poorly constrained, 2.03
+0.61/-0.49 Rjup. The planet's distance to its host star is less than twice the
separation at which it would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow. It is
expected to spiral into HIP 65A on a timescale ranging from 80 Myr to a few
gigayears, assuming a reduced tidal dissipation quality factor of Qs' = 10^7 -
10^9. We performed a full phase-curve analysis of the TESS data and detected
both illumination- and ellipsoidal variations as well as Doppler boosting. HIP
65A is part of a binary stellar system, with HIP 65B separated by 269 AU (3.95
arcsec on sky). TOI-157b (TIC 140691463) is a typical hot Jupiter with a mass
of 1.18 +/- 0.13 Mjup and a radius of 1.29 +/- 0.02 Rjup. It has a period of
2.08 days, which corresponds to a separation of just 0.03 AU. This makes
TOI-157 an interesting system, as the host star is an evolved G9 sub-giant star
(V=12.7). TOI-169b (TIC 183120439) is a bloated Jupiter orbiting a V=12.4
G-type star. It has a mass of 0.79 +/- 0.06 Mjup and a radius of 1.09
+0.08/-0.05 Rjup. Despite having the longest orbital period (P = 2.26 days) of
the three planets, TOI-169b receives the most irradiation and is situated on
the edge of the Neptune desert. All three host stars are metal rich with [Fe/H]
ranging from 0.18 - 0.24.

unpolarized light, for example, it is possible to tune the material without
breaking either time-reversal or any lattice symmetries. To illustrate these

the honeycomb, square and triangular lattices. We derive the effective
Heisenberg spin models to fourth order in perturbation theory for arbitrary
fixed polarizations, and several types of unpolarized light that preserve
time-reversal and lattice symmetries. Coupling these models to periodic light
tunes first, second and third neighbor exchange couplings, as well as ring
exchange terms on the square and triangular lattices. Circularly polarized
light induces chiral fields for the honeycomb and triangular lattices, which
favors non-coplanar magnetism and potential chiral spin liquids. We discuss how
to maximize the enhancement of the couplings without inducing heating.

Several lines of observational evidence indicate that most super-Earths do not
possess massive H$_2$/He atmospheres. However, accretion and retention of less
massive atmospheres on super-Earths challenge planet formation theory. We
consider the following three mechanisms: (i) envelope heating by pebble
accretion, (ii) mass loss during giant impacts, and (iii) atmospheric loss by
stellar X-ray and EUV photoevaporation. We investigate whether these mechanisms
influence the amount of the atmospheres that form around super-Earths. We
develop a code combining an N-body simulation of pebble-driven planetary
formation and an atmospheric evolution simulation. We demonstrate that the
observed orbital properties of super-Earths are well reproduced by the results
of our simulations. However, (i) heating by pebble accretion ceases prior to
disk dispersal, (ii) the frequency of giant impact events is too low to sculpt
massive atmospheres, and (iii) many super-Earths having H$_2$/He atmospheres of
$\gtrsim 10$ wt% survive against stellar irradiations for 1 Gyr. Therefore, it
is likely that other mechanisms such as suppression of gas accretion are
required to explain less massive atmospheres ($\lesssim 10$ wt%) of
super-Earths.

realise novel, effectively static Hamiltonians. This technique is being
explored in experimental platforms across physics, including ultracold atoms,
laser-driven electron systems, nuclear magnetic resonance, and trapped ions.
The key challenge in Floquet engineering is to avoid the uncontrolled
absorption of photons from the drive, especially in interacting systems in
which the excitation spectrum becomes effectively dense. The resulting
dissipative coupling to higher-lying modes, such as the excited bands of an
optical lattice, has been explored in recent experimental and theoretical
works, but the demonstration of a broadly applicable method to mitigate this
effect is lacking. Here, we show how two-path quantum interference, applied to
strongly-correlated fermions in a driven optical lattice, suppresses
dissipative coupling to higher bands and increases the lifetime of double
occupancies and spin-correlations by two to three orders of magnitude.
Interference is achieved by introducing a weak second modulation at twice the
fundamental driving frequency with a definite relative phase. This technique is
shown to suppress dissipation in both weakly and strongly interacting regimes
of a driven Hubbard system, opening an avenue to realising low-temperature
phases of matter in interacting Floquet systems.

Isolated Galaxy Pair Catalog (IGPC) of 13114 pairs \cite{Nottale2018a} is used
here for this research. The algorithms of statistical deprojection elaborated
in \cite{Nottale2018b} are applied to these observational data. We derive the
orbital velocity PDFs for the whole catalog and for several selected
subsamples. The interdistance PDF is deprojected and compared to analytical
profiles which are expected from semi-theoretical arguments. The PDF of
deprojected pair orbital velocities is characterized by the existence of a main
probability peak around $\approx 150$ km.s$^{-1}$ for all subsamples of the
IGPC as well as for the UGC pair catalog \cite{Chamaraux2016}. The
interdistance PDFs of both the projected and deprojected data are described at
large distances by the same power law with exponent $\approx -2$. The whole
distributions, including their cores, are fairly fitted by King profiles. The
mass deprojection yields a mass/luminosity ratio for the pairs of $M/L=(30 \pm
5)$ in Solar units. The orbital velocity probability peak is observed at the
same value, $\approx 150$ km/s, as the main exoplanet velocity peak, which
points toward a possible universality of Keplerian structures, whatever the
scale. The pair $M/L$ ratio is just 5 times the standard ratio for luminous
matter, which does not require the existence of non-baryonic dark matter in

their host star to exhibit a relatively strong day to night temperature
gradient. For hot planets, this leads to cause a chemical composition dichotomy
between the two hemispheres. In the extreme case of ultra hot jupiters, some
species, such as molecular hydrogen and water, are strongly dissociated on the
day-side while others, such as carbon monoxide, are not. However, most current
retrieval algorithm rely on 1D forward models that are unable to model this
effect. We thus investigate how the 3D structure of the atmosphere biases the
abundances retrieved using commonly used algorithms. We study the case of
Wasp-121b as a prototypical ultra hot Jupiter. We use the simulations of this
planet performed with the SPARC/MIT global climate model (GCM) and generate
transmission spectra that fully account for the 3D structure of the atmosphere
with Pytmopsh3R. These spectra are then analyzed using the \taurex retrieval
code. We find that such ultra hot jupiter's transmission spectra exhibit muted
H$_2$O features that originate in the night-side where the temperature, hence
the scale-height, is smaller than on the day-side. However, the spectral
features of molecules present on the day-side are boosted by both its high
temperature and low mean molecular weight. As a result, the retrieved
parameters are strongly biased compared to the ground truth. In particular the
[CO]/[H$_2$O] is overestimated by one to three orders of magnitude. This must
be kept in mind when using such retrieval analysis to infer the C/O ratio of a
planet's atmosphere. We also discuss whether indicators can allow us to infer
the 3D structure of an observed atmosphere. Finally we show that HST/WFC3
transmission data of Wasp-121b are compatible with the day-night thermal and
compositional dichotomy predicted by models.

vigorously star-forming regions that usually contain a feedback-driven
kpc-scale superbubble surrounded by a dense shell. The shell is forming stars
while accelerated, so new stars formed earlier in the shell are already inside
the shell. Young stars in the bubble and near the edge of the shell can fully
ionize some low-column-density paths pre-cleared by feedback, allowing a large
fraction of their ionizing photons to escape. The decrease of <f_esc> at the
high-mass end is due to dust attenuation, while at the low-mass end, <f_esc>
decreases owing to inefficient star formation (and hence feedback). At fixed
mass, <f_esc> tends to increase with redshift. Our simulations produce
sufficient ionizing photons for cosmic reionization.

2019ein, a high-velocity Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) discovered in the nearby

the highest measured expansion velocities of any SN Ia, with a Si II absorption
minimum blueshifted by 24,000 km s$^{-1}$ at 14 days before peak brightness.
More unusually, we observed the emission components of the P Cygni profiles to
be blueshifted upward of 10,000 km s$^{-1}$ before B-band maximum light. This
blueshift, among the highest in a sample of 28 other Type Ia supernovae, is
greatest at our earliest spectroscopic epoch and subsequently decreases toward
maximum light. We discuss possible progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms
that could explain these extreme absorption and emission velocities. Radio
observations beginning 14 days before B-band maximum light yield nondetections
at the position of SN 2019ein, which rules out symbiotic progenitor systems,
most models of fast optically thick accretion winds, and optically thin shells
of mass $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ at radii $< 100$ AU. Comparing our spectra
to models and observations of other high-velocity SNe Ia, we find that SN
2019ein is well fit by a delayed-detonation explosion. We propose that the high
emission velocities may be the result of abundance enhancements due to ejecta
mixing in an asymmetric explosion, or optical depth effects in the photosphere
of the ejecta at early times. These findings may provide evidence for common
explosion mechanisms and ejecta geometries among high-velocity SNe Ia.

superconductivity directly in the number-conserving setting. We focus on a

stripping. For lower mass galaxies (with stellar masses < 10^9.5 solar masses)
both star formation and black hole accretion are suppressed by ram pressure
before they reach pericenter, whereas for more massive galaxies accretion onto
the black hole is enhanced during pericentric passage. Our analysis also
indicates that as long as the galaxy retains gas, AGN with higher Eddington
ratios are more likely to be the found in galaxies experiencing higher ram
pressure. We conclude that prior to quenching star formation, ram pressure
triggers enhanced accretion onto the black hole, which then produces heating
and outflows due to AGN feedback. AGN feedback may in turn serve to aid in the
quenching of star formation in tandem with ram pressure.

probability density function of the mass of a particular cluster, thereby
providing a principled way of quantifying uncertainties, in contrast to
conventional machine learning approaches. The neural network mass predictions,
when applied to a contaminated catalogue with interlopers, have a mean overall
logarithmic residual scatter of 0.028 dex, with a log-normal scatter of 0.126
dex, which goes down to 0.089 dex for clusters in the intermediate to high mass

classical cluster mass scaling relation with the velocity dispersion, and
outperforms recently proposed machine learning approaches. We also apply our

it was demonstrated that their accretion-outflow cycle is analogous to that of
their higher mass cousins -- the X-ray Binaries (XRBs). Subsequent observations
of the CV SS Cygni confirmed this and have consistently shown radio flaring
equivalent to that in the XRBs that marks a transient jet. Based on this

radio emission is most likely from a transient jet. Observations of other CVs,

Abelian states in different Jain sequences, as opposed to the QED3 transitions
between Abelian states in the same Jain sequence. A good example is the

However, due to the high computational demands of a NMPC, this paper discusses
a possibility of embedding nonlinearities inside a linear parameter varying
(LPV) system and thus make a use of a numerically low-demanding linear MPC. The
resulting mismatches are treated as parametric and additive uncertainties in
the context of robust tube-based MPC (TMPC). For the proposed approach, most of
the computations are carried out offline. Only a simple convex quadratic
program (QP) is conducted online. Additionally a soft-constrained extension was
briefly proposed. Simulation results are used to illustrate the good
performance, closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed
approach despite uncertainties.

Schr{\""o}dinger type dimer with a saturable nonlinear intersite coupling
between the dimer sites, in addition to a cubic onsite nonlinearity and
asymmetric linear onsite potentials. In contrast to previously studied cases
with pure onsite nonlinearities, the transmission coefficient for stationary
transmission is shown to be a multivalued function of the transmitted
intensity, in regimes of low saturability and small or moderate transmitted
intensity. The corresponding backward transfer map is analyzed analytically and
numerically, and shown to have either one or three distinct solutions for
saturable coupling, and zero or two solutions for the purely cubic nonlinear
coupling. As saturation strength is increased, the multi-solution regimes
disappear through bifurcations and the single-valued regime of the onsite model
is recovered. The existence of multiple solution branches yields novel
mechanisms for asymmetric left/right stationary transmission: in addition to
shifts of the positions of transmission peaks, peaks for transmission in one
direction may correspond to nonexistence of stationary solutions propagating in
the opposite direction, at the corresponding branch and transmitted intensity.
Moreover, one of these transmission channels behaves as a nearly perfect mirror
for incoming signals. The linear stability of the stationary solutions is
analyzed, and instabilities are typically observed, and illustrated by direct
numerical simulations, in regimes with large transmission coefficient.
Intersite nonlinearities are found to prevent the formation of a localized
dimer mode in the instability-induced dynamics. Finally, the partial reflection
and transmission of a Gaussian excitation is studied, and the asymmetric
transmission properties are compared to previously studied onsite models.

activity is ongoing under the ice crust of Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons.
According to these models, hydrothermal flow in the porous, rocky core of the
satellite is driven by tidal deformation that induces dissipation and
volumetric internal heating. Despite the effort in the modelling of Enceladus'
interior, systematic understanding---and even basic scaling laws---of
internally-heated porous convection and hydrothermal activity are still
lacking. In this article, using an idealised model of an internally-heated
porous medium, we explore numerically and theoretically the flows that develop
close and far from the onset of convection. In particular, we quantify
heat-transport efficiency by convective flows as well as the typical extent and
intensity of heat-flux anomalies created at the top of the porous layer. With
our idealised model, we derive simple and general laws governing the
temperature and hydrothermal velocity that can be driven in the oceans of icy
moons. In the future, these laws could help better constraining models of the
interior of Enceladus and other icy satellites.

that the Magnus force of the skyrmion produces circular orbits that can
resonate with the ac drive and the periodicity of the substrate to create
quantized motion both parallel and perpendicular to the dc drive. The skyrmion
Hall angle exhibits a series of increasing and/or decreasing steps along with
strongly fluctuating regimes. In the phase locked regimes, the skyrmion Hall
angle is constant and the skyrmion motion consists of periodic orbits
encircling an integer number of obstacles per every or every other ac drive
cycle. We also observe phases in which the skyrmion moves at $90^\circ$ with
respect to the driving direction even in the presence of damping, a phenomenon
called absolute transverse mobility that can exhibit reentrance as a function
of dc drive. When the biharmonic ac drives have different amplitudes, in the
two directions we find regimes in which the skyrmion Hall angle shows a sign
reversal from positive to negative, as well as a reentrant pinning effect in
which the skyrmion is mobile at low drives but becomes pinned at higher drives.
These behaviors arise due to the combination of the Magnus force with the
periodic motion of the skyrmions, which produce Shapiro steps, directional
locking, and ratchet effects.

measurement depends critically on our ability to understand how non-ideal
instrumental effects affect astronomical images. WFIRST will fly a focal plane
containing 18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared detector arrays, which present
different instrument calibration challenges from previous weak lensing
observations. Previous work has shown that correlation functions of flat field
images are effective tools for disentangling linear and non-linear inter-pixel
capacitance (IPC) and the brighter-fatter effect (BFE). Here we present a
Fourier-domain treatment of the flat field correlations, which allows us to
expand the previous formalism to all orders in IPC, BFE, and classical
non-linearity. We show that biases in simulated flat field analyses in Paper I
are greatly reduced through the use of this formalism. We then apply this
updated formalism to flat field data from three WFIRST flight candidate
detectors, and explore the robustness to variations in the analysis. We find
that the BFE is present in all three detectors, and that its contribution to
the flat field correlations dominates over the non-linear IPC. The magnitude of
the BFE is such that the effective area of a pixel is increased by
$(3.54\pm0.03)\times 10^{-7}$ for every electron deposited in a neighboring
pixel. We compare IPC maps from flat field autocorrelation measurements to
those obtained from the single pixel reset method and find a median difference
of 0.113%. After further diagnosis of this difference, we ascribe it largely to
an additional source of cross-talk, the vertical trailing pixel effect, and
recommend further work to develop a model for this effect. These results
represent a significant step toward calibration of the non-ideal effects in
WFIRST detectors.

are commonly used to control for confounding when estimating causal effects
from observational data. When planning a study that will be analyzed with
marginal structural modeling, determining the required sample size for a given
level of statistical power is challenging because of the effect of weighting on
the variance of the estimated causal means. This paper considers the utility of
the design effect to quantify the effect of weighting on the precision of
causal estimates. The design effect is defined as the ratio of the variance of
the causal mean estimator divided by the variance of a naive estimator if,
counter to fact, no confounding had been present and weights were not needed. A
simple, closed-form approximation of the design effect is derived that is
outcome invariant and can be estimated during the study design phase. Once the
design effect is approximated for each treatment group, sample size
calculations are conducted as for a randomized trial, but with variances
inflated by the design effects to account for weighting. Simulations
demonstrate the accuracy of the design effect approximation, and practical
considerations are discussed.

  version, Comments welcome",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical probabilistic models of (noisy) quantum systems are not only
relevant for understanding the non-classical features of quantum mechanics, but
they are also useful for determining the possible advantage of using quantum
resources for information processing tasks. A common feature of these models is
the presence of inaccessible information, as captured by the concept of
preparation contextuality: There are ensembles of quantum states described by
the same density operator, and hence operationally indistinguishable, and yet
in any probabilistic (ontological) model, they should be described by distinct
probability distributions. In this work, we quantify the inaccessible
information of a model in terms of the maximum distinguishability of
probability distributions associated to any pair of ensembles with identical
density operators, as quantified by the total variation distance of the
distributions. We obtain a family of lower bounds on this maximum
distinguishability in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. In the
case of an ideal qubit this leads to a lower bound of, approximately, 0.07.
These bounds can also be interpreted as a new class of robust preparation
non-contextuality inequalities. Our non-contextuality inequalities are phrased
in terms of generalizations of max-relative entropy and trace distance for
general operational theories, which could be of independent interest.
  Under sufficiently strong noise any quantum system becomes preparation
non-contextual, i.e., can be described by models with zero inaccessible
information. Using our non-contextuality inequalities, we show that this can
happen only if the noise channel has the average gate fidelity less than or
equal to 1/D(1+1/2+...+1/D), where D is the dimension of the Hilbert space.

millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed
on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various
tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority
fails to protect vulnerable contracts that have already been deployed on the
blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the
issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision
and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack.
  In this work, we introduce {\AE}GIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects
smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of
detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack
patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is
tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language
enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we
propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing
attack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus
leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the
blockchain. We compare {\AE}GIS to current state-of-the-art tools and
demonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks.
Finally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of

interest into self-play in reinforcement learning. In self-play, Monte Carlo
Tree Search is used to train a deep neural network, that is then used in tree
searches. Training itself is governed by many hyperparameters.There has been
surprisingly little research on design choices for hyper-parameter values and
loss-functions, presumably because of the prohibitive computational cost to
explore the parameter space. In this paper, we investigate 12 hyper-parameters
in an AlphaZero-like self-play algorithm and evaluate how these parameters
contribute to training. We use small games, to achieve meaningful exploration
with moderate computational effort. The experimental results show that training
is highly sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. Through multi-objective
analysis we identify 4 important hyper-parameters to further assess. To start,
we find surprising results where too much training can sometimes lead to lower
performance. Our main result is that the number of self-play iterations
subsumes MCTS-search simulations, game-episodes, and training epochs. The
intuition is that these three increase together as self-play iterations
increase, and that increasing them individually is sub-optimal. A consequence
of our experiments is a direct recommendation for setting hyper-parameter
values in self-play: the overarching outer-loop of self-play iterations should
be maximized, in favor of the three inner-loop hyper-parameters, which should
be set at lower values. A secondary result of our experiments concerns the
choice of optimization goals, for which we also provide recommendations.

  of Observational Studies",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Observational healthcare data offer the potential to estimate causal effects
of medical products on a large scale. However, the confidence intervals and
p-values produced by observational studies only account for random error and
fail to account for systematic error. As a consequence, operating
characteristics such as confidence interval coverage and Type I error rates
often deviate sharply from their nominal values and render interpretation
impossible. While there is longstanding awareness of systematic error in
observational studies, analytic approaches to empirically account for
systematic error are relatively new. Several authors have proposed approaches
using negative controls (also known as ""falsification hypotheses"") and positive
controls. The basic idea is to adjust confidence intervals and p-values in
light of the bias (if any) detected in the analyses of the negative and
positive control. In this work, we propose a Bayesian statistical procedure for
posterior interval calibration that uses negative and positive controls. We
show that the posterior interval calibration procedure restores nominal
characteristics, such as 95% coverage of the true effect size by the 95%
posterior interval.

local explanations, the root corresponds to the global explanation, and
intermediate levels correspond to explanations for groups of data points that
it automatically clusters. The method can also leverage side information, where
users can specify points for which they may want the explanations to be
similar. We argue that such a multilevel structure can also be an effective
form of communication, where one could obtain few explanations that
characterize the entire dataset by considering an appropriate level in our
explanation tree. Explanations for novel test points can be cost-efficiently
obtained by associating them with the closest training points. When the local
explainability technique is generalized additive (viz. LIME, GAMs), we develop
a fast approximate algorithm for building the multilevel tree and study its
convergence behavior. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique

effect sizes of gender differences are calculated using Cohen's d on two
measures: responses to survey items on discipline-specific self-efficacy and

mathematics courses. In engineering, physics, and mathematics courses, we find
sizeable discrepancies between self-efficacy and performance, with men
appearing significantly more confident than women despite small or reverse

have higher self-efficacy. The patterns are consistent across courses within
each discipline. All self-efficacy gender differences close by the fourth year

with multi-inverter systems are becoming more common. Consequently, the
effectiveness of voltage and frequency regulation in microgrids using
conventional droop-based methodologies is challenged by uncertainty in the
sizeand schedule of loads. This article proposes an isochronous architecture of
parallel inverters with only voltage-active power droop (VP-D) control for
improving active power sharing as well as plug-and-play of multi-inverter based
distributed energyresources (DERs). In spite of not employing explicit control
for frequency regulation, this architecture allows even sharing of reactive
power while maintaining reduced circulating currents between inverters. The
performance is achieved even when there are mismatches between commanded
reference and power demanded from the actual load in the network. The
isochronous architecture is implemented by employing a global positioning
system (GPS) to disseminate timing signals that enable the microgrid to
maintain nominal system frequency in the entire network. This enables direct
control of active power through voltage source inverter (VSI) output voltage
regulation, even in the presence of system disturbances. A small signal
eigenvalue analysis of a multi-inverter system near the steady-state operating
point is presented to evaluate the stability of the multi-inverter system with
the proposed VP-D control. Simulation studies and hardware experiments on an
1.2 kVA prototype are conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture
towards active and reactive power sharing between inverters with load scenarios
are demonstrated. Results of the hardware experiments corroborate the viability
of the proposed VP-D control architecture.

among both their rows and their columns. A useful and parsimonious model of
such dependence is the matrix normal model, in which the covariances among the
elements of a random matrix are parameterized in terms of the Kronecker product
of two covariance matrices, one representing row covariances and one
representing column covariance. An appealing feature of such a matrix normal
model is that the Kronecker covariance structure allows for standard likelihood
inference even when only a very small number of data matrices is available. For
instance, in some cases a likelihood ratio test of dependence may be performed
with a sample size of one. However, more generally the sample size required to
ensure boundedness of the matrix normal likelihood or the existence of a unique
maximizer depends in a complicated way on the matrix dimensions. This motivates
the study of how large a sample size is needed to ensure that maximum
likelihood estimators exist, and exist uniquely with probability one. Our main
result gives precise sample size thresholds in the paradigm where the number of

interstellar polarization (ISP) as well as a critical review of ISP removal
techniques employed in the field. The polarization of SN 1993J is found to show
significant alignment on the $q-u$ plane, suggesting the presence of a dominant
axis and therefore of continuum polarization. We also see strong line
polarization features, including $\mathrm{H\beta}$, He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 5876$,
$\mathrm{H\alpha}$, He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 6678$, He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 7065$, and
high velocity (HV) components of He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 5876$ and

features, and the first to show a likely HV \halpha contribution. Overall, we
determine that the observed features can be interpreted as the superposition of
anisotropically distributed line forming regions over ellipsoidal ejecta. We
cannot exclude the possibility of an off-axis energy source within the ejecta.
These data demonstrate the rich structures that are inaccessible if solely

to be important for achieving realistic speckle appearance in the generated OCT

mathematically analyzed using low-dimensional firing-rate or neural-mass

rapidly changing stimuli. Here, we derive low-dimensional firing-rate models
for homogeneous populations of general renewal-type neurons, including
integrate-and-fire models driven by white noise. Renewal models account for
neuronal refractoriness and spike synchronization dynamics. The derivation is
based on an eigenmode expansion of the associated refractory density equation,
which generalizes previous spectral methods for Fokker-Planck equations to
arbitrary renewal models. We find a simple relation between the eigenvalues,
which determine the characteristic time scales of the firing rate dynamics, and
the Laplace transform of the interspike interval density or the survival
function of the renewal process. Analytical expressions for the Laplace
transforms are readily available for many renewal models including the leaky
integrate-and-fire model. Retaining only the first eigenmode yields already an
adequate low-dimensional approximation of the firing-rate dynamics that
captures spike synchronization effects and fast transient dynamics at stimulus
onset. We explicitly demonstrate the validity of our model for a large
homogeneous population of Poisson neurons with absolute refractoriness, and
other renewal models that admit an explicit analytical calculation of the

microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS). A neutrino leakage
scheme that captures the overall energetics and lepton number exchange is also

(MRI) in the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) amplifies magnetic field to
beyond magnetar-strength ($10^{15}\, \mathrm{G}$). The ultra-strong toroidal
field is able to launch a relativistic jet from the HMNS. We also find a
magnetized wind that ejects neutron-rich material with a rate of
$\dot{M}_{\mathrm{ej}} \simeq 1 \times10^{-1}\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}\, s^{-1}}$.
The total ejecta mass in our simulation is $5\times 10^{-3}\,
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. This makes the ejecta from the HMNS an important component
in BNS mergers and a promising source of $r$-process elements that can power a
kilonova. The jet from the HMNS reaches a terminal Lorentz factor of $\sim 5$
in our highest-resolution simulation. The formation of this jet is aided by
neutrino-cooling preventing the accretion disk from protruding into the polar
region. As neutrino pair-annihilation and radiative processes in the jet (which
were not included in the simulations) will boost the Lorentz factor in the jet
further, our simulations demonstrate that magnetars formed in BNS mergers are a
viable engine for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs).

covariances of two-dimensional surfaces obtained from extensive numerical
simulations of the celebrated Clarke-Vvedensky (CV) model for homoepitaxial
thin film growth. In this model, the effect of temperature, deposition flux,
and strengths of atom-atom interactions are encoded in two parameters: the
diffusion to deposition ratio $R=D/F$ and $\varepsilon$, which is related to
the probability of an adatom ""breaking"" a lateral bond. We demonstrate that the
HDs present a strong dependence on both $R$ and $\varepsilon$, and even after
the deposition of $10^5$ monolayers (MLs) they are still far from the
asymptotics in some cases. For instance, the temporal evolution of the HDs'
skewness (kurtosis) displays a pronounced minimum (maximum), for small $R$ and
$\varepsilon$, and only at long times it passes to increase (decrease) toward
its asymptotic value. However, it is hard to determine whether they converge to
a single value or different nonuniversal ones. For large $R$ and/or
$\varepsilon$, on the other hand, these quantities clearly converge to the
values expected for the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma (VLDS) universality class. A
similar behavior is observed in the spatial covariances, but with weaker
finite-time effects, so that rescaled curves of them collapse quite well with
the one for the VLDS class at long times. Simulations of a model with limited
mobility of particles, which captures some essential features of the CV model
in the limit of irreversible aggregation ($\varepsilon=0$), reveal a similar
scenario. Overall, these results point out that the study of fluctuations in
homoepitaxial thin films' surfaces can be a very difficult task and shall be
performed very carefully, once typical experimental films have $\lesssim 10^4$
MLs, so that their HDs and covariances can be in the realm of transient

within vegetative canopy, buildings, dunes. Kevin-Helmholtz instability
triggered hairpin vortex shedding has been widely concluded as the ""signature""

observing practice of turbulent evolving progress. To simplify that, spanwise
homogeneous roughness has been adopted in this work to capture the streamwise
flow alternations under different streamwise roughness element distances.
Streamwise successive object distance $\lambda_x$ is used to show the roughness
element distance. The transitional trends from turbulent channel flow to canopy
flow have been observed from Case 1 to Case 4. However, when $\lambda_x/h<1.0$,
as successive distance decreases, the evidences indicate turbulent flow is
transferring from canopy flow into channel flow from Case 4 to Case 6.
Instantaneous results verifies the enhancement of turbulent mixing and
decreasing turbulent coherency. The attached-eddy hypothesis (AEH) becomes
valid in $\lambda_x/h<1.0$ Cases. Meanwhile, Reynolds-averaged flow results
show the roughness shear ""curve"" effectiveness will decrease when $\lambda_x$

to map the source training data to unseen domains. This is achieved by having a
learning objective formulated to ensure that the generated data can be

Hamiltonian-based solvers in dynamical mean-field theory) aim for a
reproduction of a desired environment spectral density in terms of a discrete
set of bath states, mimicking the open system as a larger closed problem.
Existing strategies to find a compressed representation of the environment for
this purpose can be numerically demanding, or lack the compactness and
systematic improvability required for an accurate description of the system
propagator. We propose a method in which bath orbitals are constructed
explicitly by an algebraic construction based on the Schmidt-decomposition of
response wave functions, efficiently and systematically compressing the
description of the full environment. These resulting bath orbitals are designed
to directly reproduce the system Green's function, not hybridization, which
allows for consideration of the relevant system energy scales to optimally
model. This results in an accurate and efficient truncation of the environment,
with applications in a wide range of numerical simulations of open quantum
systems.

graphs (KGs) is an essential yet challenging task that benefits many downstream
applications. In this work, we present GPFL, a probabilistic rule learner
optimized to mine instantiated first-order logic rules from KGs. Instantiated
rules contain constants extracted from KGs. Compared to abstract rules that
contain no constants, instantiated rules are capable of explaining and
expressing concepts in more details. GPFL utilizes a novel two-stage rule
generation mechanism that first generalizes extracted paths into templates that
are acyclic abstract rules until a certain degree of template saturation is
achieved, then specializes the generated templates into instantiated rules.
Unlike existing works that ground every mined instantiated rule for evaluation,
GPFL shares groundings between structurally similar rules for collective
evaluation. Moreover, we reveal the presence of overfitting rules, their impact
on the predictive performance, and the effectiveness of a simple validation
method filtering out overfitting rules. Through extensive experiments on public
benchmark datasets, we show that GPFL 1.) significantly reduces the runtime on
evaluating instantiated rules; 2.) discovers much more quality instantiated
rules than existing works; 3.) improves the predictive performance of learned
rules by removing overfitting rules via validation; 4.) is competitive on
knowledge graph completion task compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

be responsible for the launching of magnetically driven winds in
proto-planetary nebulae. Using 2D simulations of magnetized winds interacting
with an envelope drawn from a 3D simulation of the common envelope phase, we
study the confinement, heating, and magnetic field development of post-common
envelope winds. We find that the ejected magnetic field can be enhanced via
compression by factors up to $\sim 10^4$ in circumbinary disks during the
self-regulated phases. We find values for the kinetic energy of the order of
$10^{46}$ erg that explain the large values inferred in proto-planetary nebula
outflows. We show that the interaction of the formed circumbinary disk with a
spherical, stellar wind produces a ""tapered"" flow that is almost
indistinguishable from an imposed tapered flow. This increases the uncertainty
of the origin of proto-planetary nebula winds, which could be either stellar,
circumstellar (stellar accretion disk), circumbinary (circumbinary accretion
disk), or a combination of all three.

winds is discussed, which can explain the two objects where the collimation
process is observationally resolved, HD 101584 and Hen 3-1475. An explanation
for the equatorial, molecular hydrogen emission in CRL 2688 is also presented.

to their potential to enable new approaches to discovery in a wide swath of
science. These areas are: advanced, high gradient acceleration techniques, and
x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). Further, there is intense interest in the
marriage of these two fields, with the goal of producing a very compact XFEL.
In this context, recent advances in high gradient radio-frequency cryogenic
copper structure research have opened the door to the use of surface electric
fields between 250 and 500 MV/m. Such an approach is foreseen to enable a new
generation of photoinjectors with six-dimensional beam brightness beyond the
current state-of-the-art by well over an order of magnitude. This advance is an
essential ingredient enabling an ultra-compact XFEL (UC-XFEL). In addition, one
may accelerate these bright beams to GeV scale in less than 10 meters. Such an
injector, when combined with inverse free electron laser-based bunching
techniques can produce multi-kA beams with unprecedented beam quality,
quantified by ~50 nm-rad normalized emittances. These beams, when injected into
innovative, short-period (1-10 mm) undulators uniquely enable UC-XFELs having
footprints consistent with university-scale laboratories. We describe the
architecture and predicted performance of this novel light source, which
promises photon production per pulse of a few percent of existing XFEL sources.
We review implementation issues including collective beam effects, compact
x-ray optics systems, and other relevant technical challenges. To illustrate
the potential of such a light source to fundamentally change the current
paradigm of XFELs with their limited access, we examine possible applications
in biology, chemistry, materials, atomic physics, industry, and medicine which
may profit from this new model of performing XFEL science.

present a novel imitation learning framework to enable robots to 1) learn
complex real world manipulation tasks efficiently from a small number of human

latent structure, where demonstrated trajectories for different tasks intersect
at common regions of the state space. We present Generalization Through
Imitation (GTI), a two-stage offline imitation learning algorithm that exploits
this intersecting structure to train goal-directed policies that generalize to
unseen start and goal state combinations. In the first stage of GTI, we train a
stochastic policy that leverages trajectory intersections to have the capacity
to compose behaviors from different demonstration trajectories together. In the
second stage of GTI, we collect a small set of rollouts from the unconditioned

up watercraft inspection stations at roadsides, where potentially infested

budgets for AIS control are limited, watercraft inspection stations can only be
operated at specific locations and daytimes. Though theoretical studies provide

as an estimator of the posterior. B-PINNs make use of both physical laws and
scattered noisy measurements to provide predictions and quantify the aleatoric
uncertainty arising from the noisy data in the Bayesian framework. Compared
with PINNs, in addition to uncertainty quantification, B-PINNs obtain more
accurate predictions in scenarios with large noise due to their capability of
avoiding overfitting. We conduct a systematic comparison between the two
different approaches for the B-PINN posterior estimation (i.e., HMC or VI),

Our experiments show that HMC is more suitable than VI for the B-PINNs

accurate predictions with reasonable uncertainty. Finally, we replace the BNN
in the prior with a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansion combined with HMC

accurate as BNN and much faster but this framework cannot be easily extended to
high-dimensional problems unlike the BNN based framework.

Proposed powering sources generally fall into two categories: (1)

clogging transition in the flow of particles through a constriction. We present
results of a simple experiment to elucidate a similar transition in the
bidirectional flow of two species in which two species of macroscopic particles
with different densities are confined in a tube and suspended in a fluid of
intermediate density. Counterflowing grains serve as mobile obstacles and
clogging occurs without arch formation due to confinement. We measure the
clogging or jamming probability $J$ as a function of number of particles of
each species $N$ in a fixed channel length for channel widths $D = $ 3$-$7$d$,
where $d$ is the particle diameter. $J(N)$ exhibits a sigmoidal dependence and
collapses on a single curve $J(N/D^3)$ indicating the transition occurs at a
critical density. Data is well-fit by a probabilistic model motivated by prior
constriction flows which assumes grains enter the clogging region with a fixed
probability to produce a clogging state. A quasi-two-dimensional experiment
provides insight into the interface shape and and we identify a Rayleigh-Taylor
instability at large channel widths.

adapts the searchable encryption technique to preserve the search functionality
over encrypted documents without having much impact on its scalability.
However, merely realising such a theoretical primitive suffers from real-world
threats, where a knowledgeable adversary can exploit the leakage (aka access
pattern to the database) to break the claimed protection on data
confidentiality. To address this challenge in practical deployment, ShieldDB is
designed with tailored padding countermeasures. Unlike prior works, we target a
more realistic adversarial model, where the database gets updated continuously,
and the adversary can monitor it at an (or multiple) arbitrary time
interval(s). ShieldDB's padding strategies ensure that the access pattern to
the database is obfuscated all the time. Additionally, ShieldDB provides other
advanced features, including forward privacy, re-encryption, and flushing, to
further improve its security and efficiency. We present a full-fledged
implementation of ShieldDB and conduct intensive evaluations on Azure Cloud.

synchrotron emission to be detected at low radio frequencies. Here, we present
the stacking analysis of a sample of 33 dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies with
low-frequency (72 - 231 MHz) radio images from the GaLactic and Extragalactic
All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. We produce radial surface
brightness profiles of images centred upon each dSph galaxy with background
radio sources masked. We remove ten fields from the stacking due to
contamination from either poorly subtracted, bright radio sources or strong
background gradients across the field. The remaining 23 dSph galaxies are
stacked in an attempt to obtain a statistical detection of any WIMP-induced
synchrotron emission in these systems. We find that the stacked radial
brightness profile does not exhibit a statistically significant detection above
the 95% confidence level of $\sim$1.5 mJy beam$^{-1}$. This novel technique
shows the potential of using low-frequency radio images to constrain

the corresponding human brain activity monitored by functional magnetic

natural images. Visual reconstruction is a conditional image generation on fMRI
data and thus generative adversarial network (GAN) for natural image generation
is recently introduced for this task. Although GAN-based methods have greatly
improved, the fidelity and naturalness of reconstruction are still
unsatisfactory due to the small number of fMRI data samples and the instability
of GAN training. In this study, we proposed a new GAN-based Bayesian visual
reconstruction method (GAN-BVRM) that includes a classifier to decode
categories from fMRI data, a pre-trained conditional generator to generate
natural images of specified categories, and a set of encoding models and
evaluator to evaluate generated images. GAN-BVRM employs the pre-trained
generator of the prevailing BigGAN to generate masses of natural images, and
selects the images that best matches with the corresponding brain activity
through the encoding models as the reconstruction of the image stimuli. In this
process, the semantic and detailed contents of reconstruction are controlled by
decoded categories and encoding models, respectively. GAN-BVRM used the
Bayesian manner to avoid contradiction between naturalness and fidelity from
current GAN-based methods and thus can improve the advantages of GAN.
Experimental results revealed that GAN-BVRM improves the fidelity and
naturalness, that is, the reconstruction is natural and similar to the
presented image stimuli.

physical properties due to different atomic connectivity. Graphite has a
layered structure in which the honeycomb carbon sheets can easily glide, while
atoms in diamond are strongly bonded in all three dimensions. The transition
from graphite to diamond has been a central subject in physical science. One
way to turn graphite into diamond is to apply the high pressure and high
temperature (HPHT) conditions. However, atomistic mechanism of this transition
is still under debate. From a series of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, we report a mechanism that the diamond nuclei originate at the
graphite grain boundaries and propagate in two preferred directions. In
addition to the widely accepted [001] direction, we found that the growth along
[120] direction of graphite is even faster. In this scenario, cubic diamond
(CD) is the kinetically favorable product, while hexagonal diamond (HD) would
appear as minor amounts of twinning structures in two main directions.
Following the crystallographic orientation relationship, the coherent interface

posed challenging problems such as concept drift as well as short and noisy

solutions to cope with these challenges. Prior knowledge that is derived from
human knowledge (e.g. Wordnet) or a pre-trained model (e.g. Word2vec) is very
valuable and useful to help topic models work better. However, in a streaming
environment where data arrives continually and infinitely, existing studies are
limited to exploiting these resources effectively. Especially, a knowledge
graph, that contains meaningful word relations, is ignored. In this paper, to
aim at exploiting a knowledge graph effectively, we propose a novel graph
convolutional topic model (GCTM) which integrates graph convolutional networks
(GCN) into a topic model and a learning method which learns the networks and
the topic model simultaneously for data streams. In each minibatch, our method
not only can exploit an external knowledge graph but also can balance the
external and old knowledge to perform well on new data. We conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate our method with both a human knowledge graph (Wordnet)

results show that our method achieves significantly better performances than

number are discussed in this work. The types of flows include the
area-preserving flow and the length-preserving flow. We have a relatively good
understanding of these flows for plane curves with the rotation number one. In
particular, when the initial curve is strictly convex, the flow exists globally
in time, and converges to a circle as time tends to infinity. Even if the
initial curve is not strictly convex, a global solution, if it exists,
converges to a circle. Here, we deal with curves with a general rotation
number, and show, not only a similar result for global solutions, but also a
blow-up criterion, upper estimates of the blow-up time, and blow-up rate from
below. For this purpose, we use a geometric quantity which has never been

coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we
assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the
viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals
generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as
the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut
epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree
reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and
ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells
analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins
towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity.
Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway
epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly
enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways
might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral
pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral
infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the
Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the
compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and
ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2
infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral
transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.

of two temporal sub-networks including a short-term memory sub-network and a
long-term memory sub-network. The short-term memory sub-network models the
fine-grained spatial-temporal interactions between local regions across
neighboring frames in video via a graph-based learning framework, which can
well preserve the visual consistency of local regions over time. The long-term

channels) provides a promising scalability solution for blockchains which
allows untrusting parties to transact off-chain and resolve potential disputes
via on-chain smart contracts. To protect participants who have no constant
access to the blockchain, a watching service named as watchtower is proposed --
a third-party entity obligated to monitor channel states (on behalf of the
participants) and correct them on-chain if necessary. Unfortunately, currently
proposed watchtower schemes suffer from multiple security and efficiency
drawbacks. In this paper, we explore the design space behind watchtowers. We
propose a novel watching service named as fail-safe watchtowers. In contrast to
prior proposed watching services, our fail-safe watchtower does not watch
on-chain smart contracts constantly. Instead, it only sends a single on-chain
message periodically confirming or denying the final states of channels being
closed. Our watchtowers can easily handle a large number of channels, are
privacy-preserving, and fail-safe tolerating multiple attack vectors.
Furthermore, we show that watchtowers (in general) may be an option
economically unjustified for multiple payment scenarios and we introduce a
simple, yet powerful concept of short-lived assertions which can mitigate
misbehaving parties in these scenarios.

systems from scaling. However, we argue that transaction execution is also
important to the performance and security of blockchains. In other words, there
are ample opportunities to speed up and further secure blockchains by reducing
the cost of transaction execution.
  Our goal is to understand how much we can speed up blockchains by exploiting
transaction concurrency available in blockchain workloads. To this end, we
first analyze historical data of seven major public blockchains, namely
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and
Zilliqa. We consider two metrics for concurrency, namely the single-transaction
conflict rate per block, and the group conflict rate per block. We find that
there is more concurrency in UTXO-based blockchains than in account-based ones,
although the amount of concurrency in the former is lower than expected.
Another interesting finding is that some blockchains with larger blocks have
more concurrency than blockchains with smaller blocks. Next, we propose an
analytical model for estimating the transaction execution speed-up given an
amount of concurrency. Using results from our empirical analysis, the model
estimates that 6x speed-ups in Ethereum can be achieved if all available
concurrency is exploited.

addition to radiative cooling of the jet materials (cooling effect), conversion
of the ordered magnetic field into the turbulent one (conversion effect) and
dissipation of the turbulent magnetic field (dissipation effect) are formulated
according to our study on pulsar wind nebulae. Although each of the cooling and
conversion effects is an ineffective acceleration process, the terminal
velocity of magnetized cylindrical jets attains about half of the maximum
possible value when the cooling, conversion and dissipation effects work
simultaneously. The radiation efficiency is also about half of the total
luminosity of the jet in the case of maximal acceleration. The concept for flow
acceleration by the non-ideal MHD effects may be useful for studying
relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei, in which the region near the jet
axis is expected to be cylindrical and kink unstable.

super-resolution (SR) methods that are based on convolutional neural networks

temporal correlation between low-resolution (LR) video frames, and/or to
super-resolve a frame with multiple LR frames. These methods pursue higher
quality of super-resolved frames, where the quality is usually measured frame
by frame in e.g. PSNR. However, frame-wise quality may not reveal the
consistency between frames. If an algorithm is applied to each frame
independently (which is the case of most previous methods), the algorithm may
cause temporal inconsistency, which can be observed as flickering. It is a
natural requirement to improve both frame-wise fidelity and between-frame
consistency, which are termed spatial quality and temporal quality,
respectively. Then we may ask, is a method optimized for spatial quality also
optimized for temporal quality? Can we optimize the two quality metrics
jointly?

simulation performed by Iaconi et al., that involves a giant of 0.88~\ms \ and
83~\rs, with a companion of 0.6~\ms \ placed on the surface of the giant in
circular orbit. After simulating the dynamic in-spiral phase we follow the
expansion of the ejecta for $\simeq 18\,000$~days. During this period the gas
is able to cool down enough to reach dust formation temperatures. Our results
show that dust forms efficiently in the window between $\simeq 300$~days (the
end of the dynamic in-spiral) and $\simeq 5000$~days. The dust forms in two
separate populations; an outer one in the material ejected during the first few
orbits of the companion inside the primary's envelope and an inner one in the
rest of the ejected material. We are able to fit the grain size distribution at
the end of the simulation with a double power law. The slope of the power law
for smaller grains is flatter than that for larger grains, creating a
knee-shaped distribution. The power law indexes are however different from the
classical values determined for the interstellar medium. We also estimate that
the contribution to cosmic dust by common envelope events is not negligible and
comparable to that of novae and supernovae.

as a means to explain the surprising generalization ability of modern-days
overparameterized learning algorithms. This notion refers to the tendency of
the optimization algorithm towards a certain structured solution that often
generalizes well. Recently, several papers have studied implicit regularization
and were able to identify this phenomenon in various scenarios. We revisit this
paradigm in arguably the simplest non-trivial setup, and study the implicit
bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the context of Stochastic Convex
Optimization. As a first step, we provide a simple construction that rules out
the existence of a \emph{distribution-independent} implicit regularizer that
governs the generalization ability of SGD. We then demonstrate a learning
problem that rules out a very general class of \emph{distribution-dependent}
implicit regularizers from explaining generalization, which includes strongly
convex regularizers as well as non-degenerate norm-based regularizations.
Certain aspects of our constructions point out to significant difficulties in
providing a comprehensive explanation of an algorithm's generalization
performance by solely arguing about its implicit regularization properties.

traced by the stellar absorption features, indicating that the profiles are
dominated by outflow. In contrast, matched inactive galaxies are characterised
by a systemic peak and weaker outflow wing. We present three independent
estimates of the electron density in these AGN, discussing the merits of the
different methods. The electron density derived from the [SII] doublet is
significantly lower than than that found with a method developed in the last

photoionized by an AGN, much of the [SII] emission arises in an extended
partially ionized zone where the implicit assumption that the electron density
traces the hydrogen density is invalid. We propose ways to deal with this
situation and we derive the associated outflow rates for ionized gas, which are
in the range 0.001--0.5 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for our AGN sample. We compare
these outflow rates to the relation between $\dot{M}_{out}$ and $L_{AGN}$ in
the literature, and argue that it may need to be modified and rescaled towards
lower mass outflow rates.

adopts the well-known value iteration algorithm, and the other resorts to the
Madani's algorithm specifically designed for DMDPs. The latter approach can
find an exact optimal solution and outperform existing methods in terms of time

is the diffusion of incorrect information. However, very few studies have
investigated the impact of incorrect information on individual and collective

series of quantities before and after receiving social information. Unbeknownst
to them, we controlled the degree of inaccuracy of the social information
through ""virtual influencers"", who provided some incorrect information. We find
that a large proportion of individuals only partially follow the social

incorrect social information can help a group perform better when it
overestimates the true value, by partly compensating a human underestimation
bias. Overall, our results suggest that incorrect information does not
necessarily impair the collective wisdom of groups, and can even be used to
dampen the negative effects of known cognitive biases.

occurrence frequency by scaling up solar relations. However, because the
topology and strength of the magnetic fields on M stars is different from that
of the Sun, it is not obvious that this approach works well. We used a large
number of high-resolution spectra to study flares, CMEs, and their dynamics of
the active M dwarf star AD Leo. The results can then be used as reference for
other M dwarfs. We obtained more than 2000 high-resolution spectra (R~35000) of
the highly active M dwarf AD Leo, which is viewed nearly pole on. Using these
data, we studied the behaviour of the spectral lines Halpha , Hbeta , and He I
5876 in detail and investigated asymmetric features that might be Doppler
signatures of CMEs. We detected numerous flares. The largest flare emitted 8.32
x 10 31 erg in Hbeta and 2.12 x 10 32 erg in Halpha . Although the spectral
lines in this and other events showed a significant blue asymmetry, the
velocities associated with it are far below the escape velocity. Although AD
Leo shows a high level of flare activity, the number of CMEs is relatively low.
It is thus not appropriate to use the same flare-to-CME relation for M dwarfs

elastic scattering and the deuteron breakup reaction at neutron laboratory
energies up to 200 MeV is investigated. To that end we use the chiral
nucleon-nucleon interaction with the semi-local momentum-space regularization
at various orders of the chiral expansion, exploiting knowledge of the
covariance matrix of its parameters. For both reactions we compare statistical
uncertainties for chiral predictions with the uncertainties obtained in the
same way but for the semi-phenomenological One-Pion-Exchange two-nucleon force.
In addition for the elastic scattering we show also the truncation errors
arising from restriction to a given order of chiral predictions, estimated
among others within the Bayesian method, and the cutoff dependence of chiral
predictions. We find that the resulting statistical uncertainty is smaller than
the truncation errors for the chiral force at lower orders of the chiral
expansion. At the higher orders of the chiral expansion and at low energies the
statistical errors exceed the truncation ones but at intermediate and higher
energies truncation errors are more important. Overall, magnitudes of the
theoretical uncertainties are small and amount up to 0.5\%-4\%, depending on
the observable and energy. We also find that the magnitudes of statistical
uncertainties for the chiral and semi-phenomenological potentials are similar
and that the dependence of predictions on the regularization parameter values
is important at all investigated energies.

$(n-1)^2$. The hypothesis, mostly known today as \v{C}erny conjecture, claims
that $(n-1)^2$ is a precise upper bound on the length of such a word over
alphabet $\Sigma$ of letters on edges of $\Gamma$ for every complete $n$-state
DFA. The hypothesis was formulated in 1966 by Starke. Algebra with nonstandard
operation over special class of matrices induced by words in the alphabet of
labels on edges is used to prove the conjecture. The proof is based on the
connection between length of words $u$ and dimension of the space generated by
solution $L_x$ of matrix equation $M_uL_x=M_s$ for synchronizing word $s$, as
well as on relation between ranks of $M_u$ and $L_x$. Important role below
placed the notion of pseudo inverseL matrix, sometimes reversible.

shown that if the configuration space is $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and

fluxes and durations corrected for the sensitivity bias using a new method that
allowed us to take the error on the flare fluxes and durations into account.
From this intrinsic distribution, we determined the average flare detection
efficiency for each Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift observation. After
correcting each observational exposure for this efficiency, we applied the
Bayesian blocks algorithm on the concatenated flare arrival times. As in the
above-mentioned study, we also searched for a flux and fluence threshold that
might lead to a change in flaring rate. We improved the previous method by
computing the average flare detection efficiencies for each flux and fluence
range. The Bayesian block algorithm did not detect any significant change in
flaring rate of the 121 flares. However, we detected an increase by a factor of
about three in the flaring rate of the most luminous and most energetic flares
that have occurred since 2014 Aug. 30. The X-ray activity of Sgr A* has
increased for more than four years. Additional studies about the overall

mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) at the end of their lives.
The accepted mass-loss mechanism requires radiation pressure acting on dust
grains that form in the extended AGB stellar atmospheres. The details of this
process are not yet well understood, however. Using the extreme-adaptive-optics
imager and polarimeter SPHERE/ZIMPOL, we observed light polarised by grains
around W\,Hya, SW\,Vir, and R\,Crt, which have mass-loss rates between
10$^{-7}$ and 10$^{-6}~M_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$. We find the distribution of dust
to be asymmetric around the three targets. A biconical morphology is seen for R
Crt, with a position angle that is very similar to those inferred from
interferometric observations of maser emission and of mid-infrared continuum
emission. The cause of the biconical outflow cannot be directly inferred from
the ZIMPOL data. The dust grains polarise light more efficiently at 0.65~$\mu$m
for R\,Crt and SW\,Vir and at 0.82~$\mu$m for W\,Hya. This indicates that at
the time of the observations, the grains around SW\,Vir and R\,Crt had sizes $<
0.1~\mu$m, while those around W\,Hya were larger, with sizes $\gtrsim
0.1~\mu$m. The asymmetric distribution of dust around R\,Crt makes the
interpretation more uncertain for this star, however. We find that polarised
light is produced already from within the visible photosphere of W~Hya, which
we reproduce using models with an inner dust shell that is optically thick to
scattering. The radial profile of the polarised light observed around W\,Hya
reveal a steep dust density profile. We find the wind-acceleration region of
W\,Hya to extend to at least $\sim 7~R_\star$, in agreement with theoretical
predictions of acceleration up to $\sim 12~R_\star$.

custodial funds accrued off-chain in these channels to in-turn make
tamper-proof off-chain payments to merchants, without locking up corresponding
capital in channels with merchants. Our design ensures that new payments made
to merchants are guaranteed to be safe once notarized and provably mitigates
well-known drawbacks in previous constructions like the data availability
attack and ensures that neither consumers nor merchants need to be online to
ensure continued safety of their notarized funds. We show that the on-chain
monetary and computational costs for PayPlace is O(1) in the number of payment
transactions processed, and is near-constant in other parameters in most
scenarios. PayPlace can hence scale the payment throughput for large-scale
marketplaces at no marginal cost and is orders of magnitude cheaper than the
state-of-art solution for non-pairwise off-chain payments, Zero Knowledge

yet clear how much their chemical composition can vary and why. So far, two
chemically distinct types of Solar-like protostars have been identified: hot
corinos, which are enriched in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs),
such as methanol (CH$_3$OH) or dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$), and Warm Carbon
Chain Chemistry (WCCC) objects, which are enriched in carbon chain molecules,
such as butadiynyl (C$_4$H) or ethynyl radical (CCH). However, none of these
have been studied so far in environments similar to that in which our Sun was
born, that is, one that is close to massive stars. Aims: In this work, we
search for hot corinos and WCCC objects in the closest analogue to the Sun's
birth environment, the Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 (OMC-2/3) filament located in
the Orion A molecular cloud. Methods: We obtained single-dish observations of
CCH and CH$_3$OH line emission towards nine Solar-like protostars in this
region. As in other, similar studies of late, we used the [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH]
abundance ratio in order to determine the chemical nature of our protostar
sample. Results: Unexpectedly, we found that the observed methanol and ethynyl
radical emission (over a few thousands au scale) does not seem to originate
from the protostars but rather from the parental cloud and its
photo-dissociation region, illuminated by the OB stars of the region.
Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that caution should be taken before
using [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH] from single-dish observations as an indicator of the
protostellar chemical nature and that there is a need for other tracers or high
angular resolution observations for probing the inner protostellar layers.

there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_k$, or $v_i\rightarrow v_j$ is an arc for
all $0\leq i<j\leq k$. An undirected graph is semi-transitive if it admits a
semi-transitive orientation. Semi-transitive graphs generalize several
important classes of graphs and they are precisely the class of
word-representable graphs studied extensively in the literature.
  Determining if a triangle-free graph is semi-transitive is an NP-hard
problem. The existence of non-semi-transitive triangle-free graphs was
established via Erd\H{o}s' theorem by Halld\'{o}rsson and the authors in 2011.
However, no explicit examples of such graphs were known until recent work of
the first author and Saito who have shown computationally that a certain
subgraph on 16 vertices of the triangle-free Kneser graph $K(8,3)$ is not
semi-transitive, and have raised the question on the existence of smaller
triangle-free non-semi-transitive graphs. In this paper we prove that the
smallest triangle-free 4-chromatic graph on 11 vertices (the Gr\""otzsch graph)
and the smallest triangle-free 4-chromatic 4-regular graph on 12 vertices (the
Chv\'atal graph) are not semi-transitive. Hence, the Gr\""otzsch graph is the
smallest triangle-free non-semi-transitive graph. We also prove the existence
of semi-transitive graphs of girth 4 with chromatic number 4 including a small
one (the circulant graph $C(13;1,5)$ on 13 vertices) and dense ones (Toft's
graphs). Finally, we show that each $4$-regular circulant graph (possibly
containing triangles) is semi-transitive.

consumes a huge amount of computing resources, the majority of which is spent
in self-play. Hyperparameter tuning exacerbates the training cost since each
hyperparameter configuration requires its own time to train one run, during
which it will generate its own self-play records. As a result, multiple runs
are usually needed for different hyperparameter configurations. This paper
proposes using population based training (PBT) to help tune hyperparameters
dynamically and improve strength during training time. Another significant
advantage is that this method requires a single run only, while incurring a
small additional time cost, since the time for generating self-play records
remains unchanged though the time for optimization is increased following the
AlphaZero training algorithm. In our experiments for 9x9 Go, the PBT method is
able to achieve a higher win rate for 9x9 Go than the baselines, each with its
own hyperparameter configuration and trained individually. For 19x19 Go, with
PBT, we are able to obtain improvements in playing strength. Specifically, the
PBT agent can obtain up to 74% win rate against ELF OpenGo, an open-source
state-of-the-art AlphaZero program using a neural network of a comparable
capacity. This is compared to a saturated non-PBT agent, which achieves a win
rate of 47% against ELF OpenGo under the same circumstances.

Furthermore, the parameters of the system estimated from the horizon agree with

growing perceptual scale and integrates them into the super-resolution
sub-network with the help of attention-based fusion. Extraction and integration
of multi-level edges allows the super-resolution network to process
texture-to-object level information progressively, enabling more
straightforward identification of overlapping edges between the input images.

We discuss the failure of this conjecture, considering radiation of an
ultrarelativistic electron interacting with strong counterpropagating laser
waves. A deviation from LCFA, in particular in the high-frequency domain, is
shown to occur even at $\xi\gg 1$ because of the appearance of an additional
small time scale in the trajectory. Moreover, we identify a new class of LCFA
violation, when the radiation formation length becomes smaller than the one via
LCFA. It is characterized by a broad and smooth spectrum rather than an
harmonic structure. A similar phenomenon is also demonstrated in the scenario
of an electron colliding with an ultrashort laser pulse. The relevance to
laser-plasma kinetic simulations is discussed.

we examine the pure jump Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) model and its extensions to
two jump-diffusion models. For each model, the maximum relative error between
our approximated transition density and the benchmark density obtained by the
inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function is sufficiently small,

been proposed, comparatively little attention has been paid to evaluating their
performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on
simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable
ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the
comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing

to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this,
we present a data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point
detection algorithms that consists of 37 time series from various application
domains. Each series was annotated by five human annotators to provide ground
truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency
of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to
measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth
annotations. Next, we present a benchmark study where 14 algorithms are
evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. Our aim is that this data
set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point

phase in gamma-ray bursts. Spectral analyses, however, indicate that many
spectra are narrower than what is expected for non-thermal emission models.
Here, we reanalyse the sample of 37 bursts in \citet{Yu2019}, by fitting the
narrowest time-resolved spectrum in each burst. We perform model comparison
between a photospheric and a synchrotron emission model based on Bayesian
evidence. We choose to compare the shape of the narrowest expected spectra:
emission from the photosphere in a non-dissipative flow and slow-cooled
synchrotron emission from a narrow electron distribution. We find that the
photospheric spectral shape is preferred by $54 \pm 8 \%$ of the spectra
(20/37), while $38 \pm 8 \%$ of the spectra (14/37) prefer the synchrotron
spectral shape; three spectra are inconclusive. We hence conclude that GRB
spectra are indeed very narrow and that more than half of the bursts have a
photospheric emission episode. We also find that a third of all analysed
spectra, not only prefer, but are also compatible with a non-dissipative
photosphere, confirming previous similar findings.
  Furthermore, we notice that the spectra, that prefer the photospheric model,
all have a low-energy power-law indices $\alpha > -0.5$. This means that
$\alpha$ is a good estimator of which model is preferred by the data.
  Finally, we argue that the spectra which statistically prefer the synchrotron
model, could equally well be caused by subphotospheric dissipation. If that is
the case, photospheric emission during the early, prompt phase would be even
more dominant.

progress has been possible due to the advent of powerful ground-based, and
space telescopes for combined study of several millimeter to far-IR, line or
continuum tracers of the molecular gas and dust components. The main
conclusions of this review are:
  1. Star forming galaxies contained much more molecular gas at earlier cosmic
epochs than at the present time.
  2. The galaxy integrated depletion time scale for converting the gas into
stars depends primarily on z or Hubble time, and at a given z, on the vertical
location of a galaxy along the star-formation rate versus stellar mass
""main-sequence"" (MS) correlation.
  3. Global rates of galaxy gas accretion primarily control the evolution of
the cold molecular gas content and star formation rates of the dominant MS
galaxy population, which in turn vary with the cosmological expansion. A second
key driver may be global disk fragmentation in high-z, gas rich galaxies, which
ties local free-fall time scales to galactic orbital times, and leads to rapid
radial matter transport and bulge growth. Third, the low star formation
efficiency inside molecular clouds is plausibly set by super-sonic streaming
motions, and internal turbulence, which in turn may be driven by conversion of
gravitational energy at high-z, and/or by local feedback from massive stars at
low-z.
  4. A simple 'gas regulator' model is remarkably successful in predicting the
combined evolution of molecular gas fractions, star formation rates, galactic
winds, and gas phase metallicities.

environment. By studying the halo occupation distribution in cosmic voids it is
possible to obtain useful information that can shed light on the subject. The
history of the formation of the haloes and galaxies residing in these regions
is likely to differ from the global behaviour given their extreme environment.
We use two public access simulated galaxy catalogues constructed with different
methods: a semi-analytical model and a hydrodynamic simulation. In both, we
identify cosmic voids and we measure the halo occupation distribution inside
these regions for different absolute magnitude thresholds. We compare these
determinations with the overall results and we study the dependence of
different characteristics of the voids. Also, we analyze the stellar content
and the formation time of the haloes inside voids and confront the general halo
population results. Inside the voids, we find a significantly different halo
occupation distribution with respect to the general results. This is present in
all absolute magnitude ranges explored. We obtain no signs of variation related
to void characteristics indicating that the effects depend only on the density
of the large-scale environment. Additionally, we find that the stellar mass
content also differs within voids, which host haloes with less massive central
galaxies (10%) as well as satellites with significantly lower stellar mass
content (30%). Finally, we find a slight difference between the formation times
of the haloes which are younger in voids than the average population. These
characteristics indicate that haloes populating voids have had a different
formation history, inducing significant changes on the halo occupation
distribution.

spectral shape is stable but the intensity varies with the level of the
environmental charged particles. In this paper, we develop a model to estimate
the ME background based on the ME database that is established with the
two-year blank sky observations of the high Galactic latitude. In this model,
the entire geographical area covered by Insight-HXMT is divided into grids of
$5^{\circ}\times5^{\circ}$ in geographical coordinate system. For each grid,
the background spectral shape can be obtained from the background database and
the intensity can be corrected by the contemporary count rate of the blind FOV
detectors. Thus the background spectrum can be obtained by accumulating the
background of all the grids passed by Insight-HXMT during the effective
observational time. The model test with the blank sky observations shows that
the systematic error of the background estimation in $8.9-44.0$ keV is
$\sim1.3\%$ for a pointing observation with an average exposure $\sim5.5$ ks.
We also find that the systematic error is anti-correlated with the exposure,
which indicates the systematic error is partly contributed by the statistical
error of count rate measured by the blind FOV detectors.

the cost for a marketing action depends on the customer response and proposes a
framework to estimate the decision variables for campaign profit optimization.
Targeting a customer is profitable if the impact and associated profit of the
marketing treatment are higher than its cost. Despite the growing literature on
uplift models to identify the strongest treatment-responders, no research has
investigated optimal targeting when the costs of the treatment are unknown at
the time of the targeting decision. Stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct
marketing and customer retention campaigns because marketing incentives are
conditioned on a positive customer response. This study makes two contributions
to the literature, which are evaluated on an e-commerce coupon targeting
campaign. First, we formally analyze the targeting decision problem under
response-dependent costs. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the
treatment effect on the customer and an estimate of the customer response
probability under treatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the
consideration of treatment cost substantially increases campaign profit when
used for customer targeting in combination with an estimate of the average or
customer-level treatment effect. Second, we propose a framework to jointly
estimate the treatment effect and the response probability by combining methods
for causal inference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle
model achieves competitive campaign profit while streamlining model building.

almost all branches of science. However, this problem can prove notably
difficult when processes and model descriptions become increasingly complex and
an explicit likelihood function is not available. With this work, we propose a
novel method for globally amortized Bayesian inference based on invertible
neural networks which we call BayesFlow. The method uses simulation to learn a
global estimator for the probabilistic mapping from observed data to underlying
model parameters. A neural network pre-trained in this way can then, without
additional training or optimization, infer full posteriors on arbitrary many
real datasets involving the same model family. In addition, our method
incorporates a summary network trained to embed the observed data into
maximally informative summary statistics. Learning summary statistics from data
makes the method applicable to modeling scenarios where standard inference
techniques with hand-crafted summary statistics fail. We demonstrate the
utility of BayesFlow on challenging intractable models from population
dynamics, epidemiology, cognitive science and ecology. We argue that BayesFlow
provides a general framework for building amortized Bayesian parameter
estimation machines for any forward model from which data can be simulated.

significantly enhances the transferability of feature representations, the
feature discriminability of object detectors remains less investigated.
Moreover, transferability and discriminability may come at a contradiction in
adversarial adaptation given the complex combinations of objects and the
differentiated scene layouts between domains. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Transferability Calibration Network (HTCN) that hierarchically
(local-region/image/instance) calibrates the transferability of feature
representations for harmonizing transferability and discriminability. The
proposed model consists of three components: (1) Importance Weighted
Adversarial Training with input Interpolation (IWAT-I), which strengthens the
global discriminability by re-weighting the interpolated image-level features;
(2) Context-aware Instance-Level Alignment (CILA) module, which enhances the
local discriminability by capturing the underlying complementary effect between
the instance-level feature and the global context information for the
instance-level feature alignment; (3) local feature masks that calibrate the
local transferability to provide semantic guidance for the following
discriminative pattern alignment. Experimental results show that HTCN
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

performance might change when a hydropower plant is operated at variable speed.
The Euler model considers the water flow dependency on the turbine rotational
speed and calculates the turbine power as a non-linear function of water flow,
turbine rotational speed and guide vane opening. A waterway model is included,
based on the 1-D momentum and continuity balance for a water-filled elementary
pipe to simulate water hammer, mass oscillation and tunnel losses. These
detailed and accurate models are necessary for recognising possible limitations
in the hydraulic system, to model the turbine power and rotational speed
correctly and thereby to be able to maximise power delivery for system control
purposes. All Euler model parameters can be derived from the physical
dimensions of the turbine and waterway, ensuring easy implementation.
State-space representation of the Euler model is approximated by utilising a
lumped-parameter equivalent of the penstock dynamics. Dynamic simulations and
eigenvalue analysis show the strength of the Euler model compared to
conventional hydropower models.

Namely, the dual geometry is an ensemble of AdS$_3$ spaces or BTZ black holes,
without a finite cutoff, but instead with randomly fluctuating boundary
diffeomorphisms. This reflects an increase in degrees of freedom in the
renormalization group flow to the UV by the irrelevant $T\bar{T}$ operator. We
streamline the method of computation and calculate the energy spectrum and the
thermal free energy in a manner that can be directly translated into the
gravity dual language. We further generalize this approach to correlation
functions and reproduce the all-order result with universal logarithmic

not only for the energy spectrum and the thermal free energy but also for

not use the name ""time crystal"", it was later adopted from 1980's popular
culture. For the physics community, however, the ultimate qualification of a
new concept is its ability to provide predictions and insight. Confirming that
time crystals manifest the basic dynamics of quantum mechanics is a necessary
step in that direction. We study two adjacent quantum time crystals
experimentally. The time crystals, realised by two magnon condensates in
superfluid $^3$He-B, exchange magnons leading to opposite-phase oscillations in
their populations -- AC Josephson effect -- while the defining periodic motion
remains phase coherent throughout the experiment.

gravitational-wave signals have been since detected, no further electromagnetic

telescopes on a single robotic mount. G-TeCS also includes software that
enables the telescope to complete a sky survey and transient alert follow-up
observations completely autonomously, whilst monitoring the weather conditions
and automatically fixing any hardware issues that arise. I go on to describe
the routines used to determine target priorities, as well as how the all-sky
survey grid is defined, how gravitational-wave and other transient alerts are
received and processed, and how the optimum follow-up strategies for these
events were determined.
  The GOTO prototype, situated on La Palma, saw first light in June 2017. I
detail the work I carried out on the site to help commission the prototype, and
how the control software was developed during the commissioning phase. I also
analyse the GOTO CCD cameras and optics, building a complete theoretical model
of the system to confirm the performance of the prototype. Finally, I describe

based on Euclidean distance under a broad set of conditions. Furthermore, the
scarcity and high cost of labels prompt us to explore more expressive

To address these issues, the small-perturbation ideology is firstly introduced
on the representation learning model based on the representation probability
distribution. The positive small-perturbation information (SPI) which only
depend on two labels of each cluster is used to stimulate the representation
probability distribution and then two variant models are proposed to fine-tune
the expected representation distribution of RBM, namely, Micro-supervised
Disturbance GRBM (Micro-DGRBM) and Micro-supervised Disturbance RBM
(Micro-DRBM) models. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of SPI is minimized
in the same cluster to promote the representation probability distributions to
become more similar in Contrastive Divergence(CD) learning. In contrast, the KL
divergence of SPI is maximized in the different clusters to enforce the
representation probability distributions to become more dissimilar in CD
learning. To explore the representation learning capability under the
continuous stimulation of the SPI, we present a deep Micro-supervised
Disturbance Learning (Micro-DL) framework based on the Micro-DGRBM and
Micro-DRBM models and compare it with a similar deep structure which has not
any external stimulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed

maneuvers in both uncontrolled and uncertain environments while maintaining
high levels of safety and passengers' comfort. Ignoring these requirements
would inherently cause a significant degradation in the performance of the
control system, and consequently, could lead to life-threatening scenarios. In
this paper, we present a robust path following control of a self-driving
vehicle under mismatched perturbations due to the effect of parametric
uncertainties, vehicle side-slip angle, and road banking. In particular, the
proposed control framework includes two parts. The first part ensures that the
lateral and the yaw dynamics behave with nominal desired dynamics by canceling
undesired dynamics. The second part is composed of two extended high-gain
observers to estimate the system state variables and the perturbation terms.
Our stability analysis of the closed-loop systems confirms exponential
stability properties under the proposed control law. To validate the proposed
control system, the controller is implemented experimentally on an autonomous
vehicle research platform and tested in different road conditions that include
flat, inclined, and banked roads. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of the controller, they also illustrate the capability of the
controller in achieving comparable performance under inclined and banked roads

  Navigation: a Learning-Based Framework using Visual and Depth Cues","Preprint version of the article to appear at Journal of Intelligent &

of scenes with semantic information from RGB-D images. We propose a complete
framework to create an enhanced map representation of the environment with
object-level information to be used in several applications such as human-robot
interaction, assistive robotics, visual navigation, or in manipulation tasks.
Our formulation leverages a CNN-based object detector (Yolo) with a 3D
model-based segmentation technique to perform instance semantic segmentation,
and to localize, identify, and track different classes of objects in the scene.
The tracking and positioning of semantic classes is done with a dictionary of
Kalman filters in order to combine sensor measurements over time and then
providing more accurate maps. The formulation is designed to identify and to
disregard dynamic objects in order to obtain a medium-term invariant map
representation. The proposed method was evaluated with collected and publicly
available RGB-D data sequences acquired in different indoor scenes.
Experimental results show the potential of the technique to produce augmented
semantic maps containing several objects (notably doors). We also provide to
the community a dataset composed of annotated object classes (doors, fire
extinguishers, benches, water fountains) and their positioning, as well as the
source code as ROS packages.

portability of LBM i.e. the possibility of writing LB algorithms with a
high-level of abstraction while remaining efficient on a wide range of
architectures such as multicores x86, GPU NVIDIA, ARM, and so on. For such a
purpose, implementation of LBM is carried out by developing a unique code,
LBM_saclay written in the C++ language, coupled with the Kokkos library for
performance portability in the context of High Performance Computing. In this
paper, the LBM is used to simulate a phase-field model for two-phase flow
problems with phase change. The mathematical model is composed of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the conservative Allen-Cahn
model. Initially developed in the literature for immiscible binary fluids, the

between liquid and gas. For that purpose, a heat equation is added with a
source term involving the time derivative of the phase field. In the
phase-field equation a source term is added to approximate the mass production
rate at the interface. Several validations are carried out to check
step-by-step the implementation of the full model. Finally, computational times

Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains a

Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensor
network and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a Hidden

  Signals","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.06115",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique has received much attention in
reducing the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. However, the PTS technique requires an
exhaustive search of all combinations of the allowed phase factors, and the
search complexity increases exponentially with the number of sub-blocks. In
this paper, a novel method based on parametric minimum cross entropy (PMCE) is
proposed to search the optimal combination of phase factors. The PMCE algorithm
not only reduces the PAPR significantly, but also decreases the computational
complexity. The simulation results show that it achieves more or less the same
PAPR reduction as that of exhaustive search.

applications, however, confidence in the results of BNs are often moderate at
best. This is due in part to the inability to validate against some ground

one must justify insights generated by such analysis, preferably accompanying
them with uncertainty estimation. Here we propose a causal extension to the

properties mirroring characteristics of real data. We then recorded the results
given by state-of-the-art structure learning algorithms. These results were
used to populate the Causal Datasheet, and recommendations were automatically
generated dependent on expected performance. As a proof of concept, we used our
Causal Datasheet Generation Tool (CDG-T) to assign expected performance

to represent text samples is the use of the Vector Space Model to compute

reality. So far, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and its extensions are
all still inequalities form which hold the superior approximate estimations, a
precise estimation and environmental variables have never appeared in any
formula. With the indeterminism of observable quantities constrained by the
uncertainty principle. The question arises whether there might be some deeper
reality hidden beneath quantum mechanics, to be described by a more fundamental
theory that can always predict the outcome of each measurement with certainty,
this paper by using the QCPB attempts to answer this question. As a result of
the QCPB theory, we geometrically propose an equality called quantum
geomertainty relation (QGR) to modify the uncertainty relation based on the
fundamental theory QCPB to positively give a complete description of reality
that predicts the outcome of each measurement with certainty, meanwhile, the
uncertainty relation is just a derivation from this quantum geometric certainty
equality. It deals with the measurement in quantum equality for different
manifolds equipped with various mathematical or physical structure.
Accordingly, the environment joins the physical process, by taking environment
variable as a geometric structure function in the QCPB into consideration, it
has naturally solved the environment problem for the measurements. We
demonstrate that entanglement term exists between the observable and the
environment. Actually, the QCPB nicely explains how the environment has an
effect on the measurement which causes the unavoidable influences. Conversely,
we state that quantum mechanics is incomplete assuredly. Doubtlessly, the QCPB
is surely a new way for such complete description of reality.

Academy of Sciences (regarding the angular emission pattern of
electron-positron pairs from nuclear transitions from excited states in 8Be and

roughly 17 MeV. The so-called X17 particle constitutes a virtual state in the
process, preceding the emission of the electron-positron pair. Based on the
symmetry of the nuclear transitions ($1^+$ to $0^+$ and $0^-$ to $0^+$), the
X17 could either be a vector, or a pseudoscalar particle. Here, we calculate
the effective potentials generated by the X17, for hyperfine interactions in
simple atomic systems, for both the pseudoscalar as well as the vector X17
hypotheses. The effective Hamiltonians are obtained in a general form which is
applicable to both electronic as well as muonic bound systems. The effect of
virtual annihilation and its contribution to the hyperfine splitting also is
considered. Because of the short range of the X17-generated potentials, the
most promising pathway for the observation of the X17-mediated effects in bound
systems concerns hyperfine interactions, which, for $S$ states, are given by
modifications of short-range (Dirac-delta) potentials in coordinate space. For
the pseudoscalar hypothesis, the exchange of one virtual X17 quantum between
the bound lepton and the nucleus exclusively leads to hyperfine effects, but
does not affect the Lamb shift. Effects due to the X17 are shown to be
drastically enhanced for muonic bound systems. Prospects for the detection of
hyperfine effects mediated by X17 exchange are analyzed for muonic deuterium,
muonic hydrogen, muonium, true muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$ bound system), and

decentralize Random Finite Set (RFS) control of large collaborative swarms for
control of individual agents. The RFS control formulation assumes that the
topology underlying the swarm control is complete and uses the complete graph
in a centralized manner. To generalize the control topology in a localized or
decentralized manner, sparse LQR is used to sparsify the RFS control gain
matrix obtained using iterative LQR. This allows agents to use information of
agents near each other (localized topology) or only the agent's own information
(decentralized topology) to make a control decision. Sparsity and performance
for decentralized RFS control are compared for different degrees of
localization in feedback control gains which show that the stability and
performance compared to centralized control do not degrade significantly in
providing RFS control for large collaborative swarms.

known and are mainly provided by the improved sensitivity (fainter NGS) and
reduced sensitivity to spatial aliasing. However, robustness and tolerances of

island effect and their performance. We then focus on some performance
optimisation aspects of the AO design to explore the impact of the RTC latency
and the optical gain issues, which will in particular affect the high-contrast
mode of HARMONI. Finally, we investigate the influence of the quality of glass
pyramid prism itself, and of optical aberrations on the final AO performance.
By relaxing the tolerances on the fabrication of the prism, we are able to
reduce hardware costs and simplify integration. We show the importance of
calibration (i.e. updating the control matrix) to capture any displacement of
the telescope pupil and rotation of the support structure for M4. We also show
the importance of the number of pixels used for wavefront sensing to relax

with Roozbeh Hazrat, we achieve a further dramatic reduction of the generating
sets for commutators of relative elementary subgroups in Chevalley groups.
Namely, let $\Phi$ be a reduced irreducible root system of rank $\ge 2$, let
$R$ be a commutative ring and let $A,B$ be two ideals of $R$. We consider
subgroups of the Chevalley group $G(\Phi,R)$ of type $\Phi$ over $R$. The
unrelative elementary subgroup $E(\Phi,A)$ of level $A$ is generated (as a
group) by the elementary unipotents $x_{\alpha}(a)$, $\alpha\in\Phi$, $a\in A$,
of level $A$. Its normal closure in the absolute elementary subgroup
$E(\Phi,R)$ is denoted by $E(\Phi,R,A)$ and is called the relative elementary
subgroup of level $A$. The main results of [11,35] consisted in construction of
economic generator sets for the mutual commutator subgroups
$[E(\Phi,R,A),E(\Phi,R,B)]$, where $A$ and $B$ are two ideals of $R$. It turned
out that one can take Stein---Tits---Vaserstein generators of $E(\Phi,R,AB)$,
plus elementary commutators of the form
$y_{\alpha}(a,b)=[x_{\alpha}(a),x_{-\alpha}(b)]$, where $a\in A$, $b\in B$.
Here we improve these results even further, by showing that in fact it suffices
to engage only elementary commutators corresponding to {\it one\/} long root,
and that modulo $E(\Phi,R,AB)$ the commutators $y_{\alpha}(a,b)$ behave as
symbols. We discuss also some further variations and applications of these
results.

define the main contextual factors, such as who the audience of the explanation
is, the operational context, the level of harm that the system could cause, and
the legal/regulatory framework. This step will help characterize the
operational and legal needs for explanation, and the corresponding social

approaches (input perturbation, saliency maps...) and hybrid AI approaches.
Third, as function of the first two steps, choose the right levels of global

identify seven kinds of costs and emphasize that explanations are socially

representation learning by maximising the mutual information between the
representations produced from augmentations. The resulting representations are
then invariant to stochastic augmentation strategies, and can be used for
downstream tasks such as clustering or classification. Yet data augmentations
preserve many properties of an image and so there is potential for a suboptimal
choice of representation that relies on matching easy-to-find features in the
data. We demonstrate that greedy or local methods of maximising mutual
information (such as stochastic gradient optimisation) discover local optima of
the mutual information criterion; the resulting representations are also
less-ideally suited to complex downstream tasks. Earlier work has not
specifically identified or addressed this issue. We introduce deep hierarchical
object grouping (DHOG) that computes a number of distinct discrete
representations of images in a hierarchical order, eventually generating
representations that better optimise the mutual information objective. We also
find that these representations align better with the downstream task of
grouping into underlying object classes. We tested DHOG on unsupervised
clustering, which is a natural downstream test as the target representation is
a discrete labelling of the data. We achieved new state-of-the-art results on

non-recurrent models, such as Transformer models. Unlike RNN and LSTM, which
contain inductive bias by loading the input tokens sequentially, non-recurrent
models are less sensitive to position. The main reason is that position
information among input units is not inherently encoded, i.e., the models are
permutation equivalent; this problem justifies why all of the existing models
are accompanied by a sinusoidal encoding/embedding layer at the input. However,
this solution has clear limitations: the sinusoidal encoding is not flexible
enough as it is manually designed and does not contain any learnable
parameters, whereas the position embedding restricts the maximum length of
input sequences. It is thus desirable to design a new position layer that
contains learnable parameters to adjust to different datasets and different
architectures. At the same time, we would also like the encodings to
extrapolate in accordance with the variable length of inputs. In our proposed
solution, we borrow from the recent Neural ODE approach, which may be viewed as
a versatile continuous version of a ResNet. This model is capable of modeling
many kinds of dynamical systems. We model the evolution of encoded results
along position index by such a dynamical system, thereby overcoming the above
limitations of existing methods. We evaluate our new position layers on a

sensing different human vital signs, i.e. respiration and body motion, as a
function of modulated wireless signals that travel between WiFi devices.
Although a remarkable proposition, most of the existing research in this space
struggles to withstand robust performance beyond experimental conditions. To
this end, we take a careful look at the dynamics of WiFi signals under human
respiration and body motions in the wild. We first characterize the WiFi signal
components - multipath and signal subspace - that are modulated by human
respiration and body motions. We extrapolate on a set of transformations,
including first-order differentiation, max-min normalization and component
projections, that faithfully explains and quantifies the dynamics of
respiration and body motions on WiFi signals. Grounded in this
characterization, we propose two methods: 1) a respiration tracking technique
that models the peak dynamics observed in the time-varying signal subspaces and
2) a body-motion tracking technique built with a multi-dimensional clustering
of evolving signal subspaces. Finally, we reflect on the manifestation of these
techniques in a practical sleep monitoring application. Our systematic
evaluation with over 550 hours of data from 5 users covering both line-of-sight

can achieve comparable performance to purpose-built pulse-Doppler radar.

rapid changes in solar cosmic-ray flux, usually accredited with reproduction of
the events in trees at different locations and different laboratories, and
followed with equivalent peaks of other cosmogenic isotopes in polar ice cores.
In 2017, Wang et al. proposed a new event at 3372-3371 BCE based on a single
set of annual 14C data measured on a floating series of tree rings sampled from
a buried specimen of Chinese wingnut tree (Pterocarya stenoptera). We attempted
to reproduce this event in tree rings of an absolutely dated bristlecone pine
specimen (Pinus longaeva) from the White Mountains, California USA and a
subfossil European oak (Quercus sp.) from the Moselle River Valley in France.
Unfortunately, we are unable to determine whether there is any rapid 14C
excursion during this time, although the regular 11-year Schwabe cycle is
clearly observable. Therefore, the presence of a cosmic-ray event as suggested
at 3372-3371 BCE cannot be confirmed. It is possible the exposed 14C spike
occurred at some other time, the absolute age of which we cannot determine
unless the precise calendar age of the Chinese wingnut wood is properly
crossdated, although the other data of Wang et al. (2017) is not inconsistent

imagery. By introducing motor actions in the protocol, the subjects are able to
perform actual motor planning, rather than just visualizing the motor movement,
thus greatly improving the ease with which the motor movements can be imagined.
This study also probes the added advantage of administering somatosensory cues
in the subject, as opposed to the conventional auditory/visual cues. These
changes in the protocol show promise in terms of the aptness of the spatial
filters obtained on the data, on application of the well-known common spatial
pattern (CSP) algorithms. The regions highlighted by the spatial filters are
more localized and consistent across the subjects when the protocol is
augmented with somatosensory stimuli. Hence, we suggest that this may prove to
be a better EEG acquisition protocol for detecting brain activation in response
to intended motor commands in (clinically) paralyzed/locked-in patients.

  Directions",,,,,"cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human gait refers to a daily motion that represents not only mobility, but it
can also be used to identify the walker by either human observers or computers.
Recent studies reveal that gait even conveys information about the walker's
emotion. Individuals in different emotion states may show different gait
patterns. The mapping between various emotions and gait patterns provides a new
source for automated emotion recognition. Compared to traditional emotion
detection biometrics, such as facial expression, speech and physiological
parameters, gait is remotely observable, more difficult to imitate, and
requires less cooperation from the subject. These advantages make gait a
promising source for emotion detection. This article reviews current research
on gait-based emotion detection, particularly on how gait parameters can be
affected by different emotion states and how the emotion states can be
recognized through distinct gait patterns. We focus on the detailed methods and
techniques applied in the whole process of emotion recognition: data
collection, preprocessing, and classification. At last, we discuss possible
future developments of efficient and effective gait-based emotion recognition
using the state of the art techniques on intelligent computation and big data.

Jumping out of the box of conventional assumptions about the unpredictability
of the market noise, we modeled the changes of stock prices over time through
the Markov Decision Process, a discrete stochastic control process that aids
decision making in a situation that is partly random. We then did a ""Region of
Interest"" (RoI) Pooling of the stock time-series graphs in order to predict
future prices with existing ones. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is then
used based on a competing pair of supervised learning algorithms, to regenerate
future stock price projections on a real-time basis. The supervised learning
algorithm used in this research, moreover, is original to this study and will
have wider uses. With the ensemble of these algorithms, we are able to
identify, to what extent, each specific macroeconomic factor influences the
change of the Brownian/random market movement. In addition, our model will have
a wider influence on the predictions of other Brownian movements.

generation. As one of the most valuable literary and cultural heritages of
China, Chinese classical poetry is very familiar and loved by Chinese people
from generation to generation. It has many particular characteristics in its
language structure, ranging from form, sound to meaning, thus is regarded as an
ideal testing task for text generation. In this paper, we propose a GPT-2 based
uniformed framework for generating major types of Chinese classical poems. We
define a unified format for formulating all types of training samples by
integrating detailed form information, then present a simple form-stressed
weighting method in GPT-2 to strengthen the control to the form of the
generated poems, with special emphasis on those forms with longer body length.
Preliminary experimental results show this enhanced model can generate Chinese
classical poems of major types with high quality in both form and content,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The model has been
incorporated into Jiuge, the most influential Chinese classical poetry
generation system developed by Tsinghua University (Guo et al., 2019).

significant attention in recent years. Advanced deep learning techniques

techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without
prior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. However, most of
existing researches focused mainly on either sequence learning or spatial
learning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid flows
(Reichstein et al., 2019). In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fluid
model based on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network
(DCGAN) has been developed for predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions.
In deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional flows can be converted
into the low-dimensional ""latent"" representations. The complex features of flow
dynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. The above DCGAN fluid
model enables us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while
maintaining a high computational efficiency. The performance of the DCGAN is
illustrated for two test cases of Hokkaido tsunami with different incoming
waves along the coastal line. It is demonstrated that the results from the
DCGAN are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model
(Fluidity). The spatio-temporal flow features have been represented as the flow
evolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks can be captured accurately.
In addition, the results illustrate that the online CPU cost is reduced by five
orders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations.
The promising results show that the DCGAN can provide rapid and reliable
spatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear fluid flows.

perform Semantic Segmentation on the fully labeled isotropic biomedical source

target unlabelled dataset(SNEMI3D)which shares some similarities with the
source dataset in the context of different types of cellular bodies and other
cellular components. Although, the cellular components vary in size and shape.
So in this paper, we have proposed a novel approach in the context of
unsupervised domain adaptation while classifying each pixel of the target
volumetric data into cell boundary and cell body. Also, we have proposed a
novel approach to giving non-uniform weights to different pixels in the
training images while performing the pixel-level semantic segmentation in the
presence of the corresponding pixel-wise label map along with the training
original images in the source domain. We have used the Entropy Map or a
Distance Transform matrix retrieved from the given ground truth label map which
has helped to overcome the class imbalance problem in the medical image data
where the cell boundaries are extremely thin and hence, extremely prone to be
misclassified as non-boundary.

cavity in a solvent, by assuming this energy is dominated by the electrostatic
energy associated with creating the static (interface) potential inside the
cavity. The new model approximates the cavity-formation energy as that of a
shell capacitor: the inner, solute-shaped conductor is held at the static
potential, and the outer conductor (at the first solvation shell) is held at
zero potential. Compared to cavity energies computed using free-energy
pertubation with explicit-solvent molecular dynamics, the new model exhibits
surprising accuracy (Mobley test set, RMSE 0.45 kcal/mol). Combined with a
modified continuum model for solute-solvent van der Waals interactions, the
total nonpolar model has RMSE of 0.55 kcal/mol on this test set, which is
remarkable because the two terms largely cancel. The overall nonpolar model has
a small number of physically meaningful parameters and compares favorably to
other published models of nonpolar solvation. Finally, when the proposed
nonpolar model is combined with our solvation-layer interface condition (SLIC)
continuum electrostatic model, which includes asymmetric solvation-shell
response, we predict solvation free energies with an RMS error of 1.35 kcal/mol
relative to experiment, comparable to the RMS error of explicit-solvent FEP

meaning, and employing reasonable temperature dependencies yields remarkable
correlation with solvation entropies.
