counting problem, which are dynamic algorithms where the updates are batches of
edge insertions and deletions. We study this problem in the parallel setting,
where the goal is to obtain algorithms with low (polylogarithmic) depth. Our
first result is a new parallel batch-dynamic triangle counting algorithm with
$O(\Delta\sqrt{\Delta+m})$ amortized work and $O(\log^* (\Delta+m))$ depth with
high probability, and $O(\Delta+m)$ space for a batch of $\Delta$ edge
insertions or deletions. Our second result is an algebraic algorithm based on
parallel fast matrix multiplication. Assuming that a parallel fast matrix
multiplication algorithm exists with parallel matrix multiplication constant
$\omega_p$, the same algorithm solves dynamic $k$-clique counting with
$O\left(\min\left(\Delta m^{\frac{(2k - 1)\omega_p}{3(\omega_p + 1)}},
(\Delta+m)^{\frac{2(k + 1)\omega_p}{3(\omega_p + 1)}}\right)\right)$ amortized
work and $O(\log (\Delta+m))$ depth with high probability, and
$O\left((\Delta+m)^{\frac{2(k + 1)\omega_p}{3(\omega_p + 1)}}\right)$ space.
Using a recently developed parallel $k$-clique counting algorithm, we also
obtain a simple batch-dynamic algorithm for $k$-clique counting on graphs with
arboricity $\alpha$ running in $O(\Delta(m+\Delta)\alpha^{k-4})$ expected work
and $O(\log^{k-2} n)$ depth with high probability, and $O(m + \Delta)$ space.
Finally, we present a multicore CPU implementation of our parallel
batch-dynamic triangle counting algorithm. On a 72-core machine with two-way
hyper-threading, our implementation achieves 36.54--74.73x parallel speedup,
and in certain cases achieves significant speedups over existing parallel
algorithms for the problem, which are not theoretically-efficient.

Knowledge Distillation to teach portables Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

real-time applications using only RGB images while decreasing the hardware

images to a single LDR image is still a relevant challenge. Besides the general
need for simplification of the window setting method for the purpose of
diagnosis, there are specific clinical needs for the resection of malignant
lesions in the mandible, for example, where the lesions may exist in both the
soft tissue and the bone. A successful medical algorithm has to take into
account the requirement to variously expose the same range of specific gray
levels, when they are presented by different body tissues. As a solution, we
propose an adaptive multi-scale contrast companding (AMCC) algorithm that is
implemented by using soft threshold separation to two channels (bone and soft
tissue). This separation is determined by the HU intensity values (that are
already computed in the algorithm) in the specific resolution that is best
fitted to the teeth. Each channel contains different set of parameters. The
AMCC algorithm successfully and adaptively compands a large variety of
mandibular CT HDR images as well as natural images. Two collaborating
physicians who evaluated tumor boundaries, by the 'single presentation' method,
reported that 92% of the algorithm output images were at least as useful for
diagnosis as those in the window method, while 50% of the algorithm output
images were better. When each slice was evaluated simultaneously, by the window
setting method (bone and soft tissue) and algorithm output images, 93% of the
evaluations declared a preference for the output images of the algorithm. We
describe here a low-cost method for companding the HDR images with the ability
to facilitate resections of mandibular lesions by providing optimal boundary

from our second contribution, which shows that any plane curve $\gamma$, modulo
a basepoint condition, is transformed into an interior boundary by wrapping
around $\gamma$ with Jordan curves. Equivalently, the minimum homotopy area of
$\gamma$ is reduced to the minimal possible threshold, namely the winding area,
through wrapping. In fact, we show that $n+1$ wraps suffice, where $\gamma$ has

diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian describing the
three interfaced TSCs, complemented by an effective low-energy description
solely based on the coupling of the interfacial MBSs arising before the leads
get contacted. Considering the 2D synthetic space spanned by the two
independent superconducting phase differences, we demonstrate that the ABS
spectra may contain either point or line nodes, and identify $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological invariants to classify them. We show that the resulting type of
nodes depends on the number of preexisting interfacial MBSs, with nodal lines
necessarily appearing when two TSCs harbor an unequal number of MBSs.
Specifically, the precise number of interfacial MBSs determines the periodicity
of the spectrum under $2\pi$-slidings of the phase differences and, as a
result, also controls the shape of the nodal lines in synthetic space. When
chiral symmetry is preserved, the lines are open and coincide with
high-symmetry lines of synthetic space, while when it is violated the lines can
also transform into loops and chains. The nodal spectra are robust by virtue of
the inherent particle-hole symmetry of the BdG Hamiltonian, and give rise to
distinctive experimental signatures that we identify.

the fact that they are at the same time optimizing for prediction and for

benchmark on a toy grammar, that allows to automatically evaluate the language

a wider variety of correct language by randomly sampling the latent space. VAE
follows in performance for the toy dataset while, AE and Transformer follow for

hierarchies towards the stability number of $G$ is the exact subgraph hierarchy
(ESH). On the first level it computes the Lov\'{a}sz theta function
$\vartheta(G)$ as semidefinite program (SDP) with a matrix variable of order
$n+1$ and $n+m+1$ constraints. On the $k$-th level it adds all exact subgraph
constraints (ESC) for subgraphs of order $k$ to the SDP. An ESC ensures that
the submatrix of the matrix variable corresponding to the subgraph is in the
correct polytope. By including only some ESCs into the SDP the ESH can be
exploited computationally.
  In this paper we introduce a variant of the ESH that computes $\vartheta(G)$
through an SDP with a matrix variable of order $n$ and $m+1$ constraints. We
show that it makes sense to include the ESCs into this SDP and introduce the
compressed ESH (CESH) analogously to the ESH. Computationally the CESH seems
favorable as the SDP is smaller. However, we prove that the bounds based on the
ESH are always at least as good as those of the CESH. In computational
experiments sometimes they are significantly better.
  We also introduce scaled ESCs (SESCs), which are a more natural way to
include exactness constraints into the smaller SDP and we prove that including
an SESC is equivalent to including an ESC for every subgraph.

applications, yet remain notoriously hard to train over large graph datasets.
They need to compute node representations recursively from their neighbors.
Current GCN training algorithms suffer from either high computational costs
that grow exponentially with the number of layers, or high memory usage for
loading the entire graph and node embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel
efficient layer-wise training framework for GCN (L-GCN), that disentangles
feature aggregation and feature transformation during training, hence greatly
reducing time and memory complexities. We present theoretical analysis for
L-GCN under the graph isomorphism framework, that L-GCN leads to as powerful
GCNs as the more costly conventional training algorithm does, under mild
conditions. We further propose L$^2$-GCN, which learns a controller for each
layer that can automatically adjust the training epochs per layer in L-GCN.
Experiments show that L-GCN is faster than state-of-the-arts by at least an
order of magnitude, with a consistent of memory usage not dependent on dataset
size, while maintaining comparable prediction performance. With the learned
controller, L$^2$-GCN can further cut the training time in half. Our codes are
available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/L2-GCN.

superlinear rate of $(1/k)^{k/2}$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. We
also prove a similar local superlinear convergence result holds for the case

electron microscope (SEM) micropillar compression tests of single crystal
samples and ex situ digital image correlation (DIC) macroscale tensile tests of
polycrystalline samples. The hydrides decorate near basal planes in
orientation, and for micropillars orientated for <a> basal slip localised shear
at the hydride-matrix interface is favoured over slip in {\alpha}-Zr matrix due
to a lower shear stress required. In contrast, for pillars oriented for <a>
prismatic slip the shear stress needed to trigger plastic slip within the
hydride is slightly higher than the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for
the <a> prismatic slip system. In this case, slip in the hydride is likely
achieved through <110>-type shear which is parallel to the activated <a>-type
shear in the parent matrix. At a longer lengthscale, these results are used to
inform polycrystalline samples analysed using high spatial resolution DIC. Here
localised interface shear remains to be a significant deformation path which
can both cause and be caused by matrix slip on planes closely-oriented to the
phase boundaries. Matrix slip on planes nearly perpendicular to the adjacent
hydride-matrix interfaces can either result in plastic slip within the hydrides
or get arrested at the interfaces, generating local stress concentration.
Through these mechanisms, the presence of {\delta}-hydrides leads to enhanced
strain localisation in Zircaloy-4 early in the plastic regime.

joint spectrum from \textit{Fermi}-LAT and VERITAS deviates significantly from

important examples of symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian groups actions.
Constructing action-angle variables on these spaces is a challenging task. A
fundamental result in the field is the Guillemin-Sternberg construction of
Gelfand-Zeitlin integrable systems for the groups $K=U(n), SO(n)$. Extending
these results to groups of other types is one of the goals of this paper.
  Partial tropicalizations are Poisson spaces with constant Poisson bracket
built using techniques of Poisson-Lie theory and the geometric crystals of
Berenstein-Kazhdan. They provide a bridge between dual spaces of Lie algebras
${\rm Lie}(K)^*$ with linear Poisson brackets and polyhedral cones which
parametrize the canonical bases of irreducible modules of $G=K^\mathbb{C}$.
  We generalize the construction of partial tropicalizations to allow for
arbitrary cluster charts, and apply it to questions in symplectic geometry. For
each regular coadjoint orbit of a compact group $K$, we construct an exhaustion
by symplectic embeddings of toric domains. As a by product we arrive at a
conjectured formula for Gromov width of regular coadjoint orbits. We prove
similar results for multiplicity free $K$-spaces.

foundation in the recent decades. Even the quantum dynamics can be rigorously
defined, however, due to the tremendously non-polynomial character of the
gravitational interaction, the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt operator valued
distribution suffers from quantisation ambiguities that need to be fixed.
  In a very recent series of works we have employed methods from constructive
quantum field theory in order to address those ambiguities. Constructive QFT
trades quantum fields for random variables and measures thereby phrasing the
theory in the language of quantum statistical physics. The connection to the
canonical formulation is made via Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction. It is
well known in quantum statistics that the corresponding ambiguities in measures
can be fixed using renormalisation. The associated renormalisation flow can
thus be used to define a canonical renormalisation programme.

paper, we propose to learn data representations with a novel type of denoising

scales with a Laplacian pyramid representation of the input data. In this way,
the agent learns more robust representations that exploit the underlying data

we show traces the total mass density gradient $\gamma_{\rm tot}$ derived from
dynamical models and, more weakly, the bulge fraction. We confirm that
$\gamma_{\rm rms}$ increases with $\sigma_{\rm e}$, age and metallicity. We
additionally find that these correlations still exist at fixed $\sigma_{\rm
e}$, where galaxies with larger $\gamma_{\rm rms}$ are found to be older and
more metal-rich. It means that mass density gradients contain information of
the stellar population which is not fully accounted for by $\sigma_{\rm e}$.
This result puts an extra constraint on our understanding of galaxy quenching.
We compare our results with galaxies in the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical
simulations and find that, at fixed $\sigma_{\rm e}$, similar trends exist with
age, the bulge fraction, and the total mass density slope but, unlike
observations, no correlation with metallicity can be detected in the

the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people. From an initial individual
(the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates,
creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or
infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms
such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are
introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the
coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major
advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters
are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers
from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the
ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either.
Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some
iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number
recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in
subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed
in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search
space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined
with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the
training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time
series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.

Simmune's current approach to account for the cell geometry is limited to
deterministic models of reaction-diffusion processes, thus providing a
coarse-grained description that ignores stochastic local fluctuations. Here we
present an extension of Simmune that removes these limitations by employing an
alternative computational representation of cellular geometry that is smooth
and grid-free. These features make it possible to incorporate a fully
stochastic, spatially resolved description of the cellular biochemistry. The
alternative computational representation is compatible with Simmune's current
approach for specifying molecular interactions. This means that a modeler using
the approach needs to create a model of cellular biochemistry and morphology
only once to be able to use it for both, deterministic and stochastic

To reproduce this feature, we illustrate that anomalously slow-diffusion zone
for cosmic rays (CRs) must be existed in the local interstellar medium (ISM)
after also taking the dipole anisotropy of CRs into account. Assuming that the
diffusion coefficient is homogeneous in the nearby ISM, we show that the
diffusion coefficient is constrained to the magnitude of $10^{26}$ cm$^2$
s$^{-1}$ when normalized to 1 GeV, which is about 100 times smaller than the
average value in the Galaxy. We further discuss the spatial distribution of the
slow diffusion and find two distinct possibilities. In one case, the SNR is
several hundred of parsecs away from the solar system, meanwhile both the SNR
and the solar system are required to be included in a large slow-diffusion
zone. The homogeneous diffusion belongs to this case. In the other case, the
SNR is very close with a distance of $\sim50$ pc and the slow-diffusion zone is
only limited around the SNR. The required diffusion coefficient is further
smaller in the latter case. This work provides a new way of studying the CR

formation in large elliptical galaxies may be small since a disproportionately
larger number of gaseous planets are expected to form as a result of the
generally higher metallicity in large elliptical galaxies. Consequently, fewer
habitable planets will accrete if the gaseous planets inward migrations are
sufficiently slow. The sterilization events of Hypothesis (1) occurred at
earlier epochs (z $\geq$ 1) and so they must be effectively permanent, implying
two possible scenarios regarding the origin and evolution of life. In
connection with one of these scenarios, independent applications of the
Principle of Mediocrity suggest that M-dwarf stars are not significant hosts of
technological life.

  Traffic Scenes: A Comparative Study","Accepted for ICIAR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a multiple object tracker, called MF-Tracker, that
integrates multiple classical features (spatial distances and colours) and
modern features (detection labels and re-identification features) in its
tracking framework. Since our tracker can work with detections coming either
from unsupervised and supervised object detectors, we also investigated the
impact of supervised and unsupervised detection inputs in our method and for
tracking road users in general. We also compared our results with existing
methods that were applied on the UA-Detrac and the UrbanTracker datasets.
Results show that our proposed method is performing very well in both datasets
with different inputs (MOTA ranging from 0:3491 to 0:5805 for unsupervised
inputs on the UrbanTracker dataset and an average MOTA of 0:7638 for supervised
inputs on the UA Detrac dataset) under different circumstances. A well-trained
supervised object detector can give better results in challenging scenarios.
However, in simpler scenarios, if good training data is not available,
unsupervised method can perform well and can be a good alternative.

dilepton production from $q\overline{q}$ annihilation in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions have been investigated. The non-equilibrium corrections to the
momentum distribution function have been estimated within the framework of
ensemble-averaged diffusive Vlasov-Boltzmann equation, encoding the effects of
collisional processes and turbulent chromo-fields in the medium. The
contributions from the $2\rightarrow2$ elastic scattering processes have been
quantified for the thermal dilepton production rate. It is seen that the
collisional corrections enhance the equilibrium dilepton spectra at high $p_T$
and suppress at lower $p_T$. A comparative study between collisional and
anomalous contributions to the dilepton production rates has also been
explored. The collisional contributions are seen to be marginal over that due
to collisionless anomalous transport.

class of elliptic equations ($\mathscr{P}$) involving a general nonlocal
integrodifferential operator $\mathscr{L}_{\mathcal{A}K}$, two real parameters,
and two weight functions, which can be sign-changing. Considering different
situations concerning the growth of the nonlinearities involved in the problem
($\mathscr{P}$), we prove the existence of two nontrivial distinct solutions
and the existence of a continuous family of eigenvalues. The proofs of the main
results are based on ground state solutions using the Nehari method, Ekelands
variational principle, and the direct method of the calculus of variations. The
difficulties arise from the fact that the operator $\mathscr{L}_{\mathcal{A}K}$
is nonhomogeneous and the nonlinear term is undefined.

was serendipitously discovered through routine inspections while the 3XMM
catalogue was compiled. We analysed the archival XMM-Newton observation of the
source, obtained BUSCA photometry in three colours, and performed optical
spectroscopy with the LBT. These data were supplemented by archival
observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Based on its optical and X-ray
properties, 3XMM J000511.8+634018 is classified as a magnetic cataclysmic
variable, or polar. The flux is modulated with a period of 2.22 hr (8009.1 +-
0.2 s), which we identify with the orbital period. The bright phases are highly
variable in X-ray luminosity from one cycle to the next. The source shows a
thermal plasma spectrum typical of polars without evidence of a luminous soft
blackbody-like component. It is non-eclipsing and displays one-pole accretion.
The X-ray and BUSCA light curves show a stream absorption dip, which suggests
an inclination 50degr < i < 75degr. The phasing of this feature, which occurs
at the end of the bright phase, requires a somewhat special accretion geometry
with a stream running far around the white dwarf before it is magnetically
channelled. The period of this polar falls within the period gap of the
cataclysmic variables (2.15-3.18 h), but appears to fall just below the minimum
period when only polars are considered.

feasible pre-training images. Then the differences between spaceborne and
airborne datasets are examined in terms of spatial resolution and viewing
geometry. In this study we used two dual-polarimetric images acquired by
TerraSAR-X DLR. A novel method to produce training dataset with more supervised
information is developed. Specifically, a series of typical classified images
as well as intensity images serve as training datasets. A field survey is
conducted for an area of about 20 square kilometers to obtain a ground truth
dataset used for accuracy evaluation. Several transfer learning strategies are
made for aforementioned training datasets which will be combined in a
practicable order. Three DCNN models, including SegNet, U-Net, and LinkNet, are
implemented next.

enjoying the advantages of low-bandwidth, low-power and low-cost, applying SCI
to large-scale problems (HD or UHD videos) in our daily life is still
challenging. The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms; they are
either too slow (iterative optimization algorithms) or not flexible to the
encoding process (deep learning based end-to-end networks). In this paper, we
develop fast and flexible algorithms for SCI based on the plug-and-play (PnP)
framework. In addition to the widely used PnP-ADMM method, we further propose
the PnP-GAP (generalized alternating projection) algorithm with a lower
computational workload and prove the convergence of PnP-GAP under the SCI
hardware constraints. By employing deep denoising priors, we first time show
that PnP can recover a UHD color video ($3840\times 1644\times 48$ with PNSR
above 30dB) from a snapshot 2D measurement. Extensive results on both
simulation and real datasets verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm.

manipulation. While existing methods like deep image prior (DIP) capture
low-level image statistics, there are still gaps toward an image prior that
captures rich image semantics including color, spatial coherence, textures, and
high-level concepts. This work presents an effective way to exploit the image
prior captured by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on large-scale
natural images. As shown in Fig.1, the deep generative prior (DGP) provides
compelling results to restore missing semantics, e.g., color, patch,
resolution, of various degraded images. It also enables diverse image
manipulation including random jittering, image morphing, and category transfer.
Such highly flexible restoration and manipulation are made possible through
relaxing the assumption of existing GAN-inversion methods, which tend to fix
the generator. Notably, we allow the generator to be fine-tuned on-the-fly in a
progressive manner regularized by feature distance obtained by the
discriminator in GAN. We show that these easy-to-implement and practical
changes help preserve the reconstruction to remain in the manifold of nature
image, and thus lead to more precise and faithful reconstruction for real
images. Code is available at

(semantic PIR). In semantic PIR, a user retrieves a message out of $K$
independent messages stored in $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases
without revealing the identity of the desired message to any individual
database. The messages come with \emph{different semantics}, i.e., the messages
are allowed to have \emph{non-uniform a priori probabilities} denoted by
$(p_i>0,\: i \in [K])$, which are a proxy for their respective popularity of
retrieval, and \emph{arbitrary message sizes} $(L_i,\: i \in [K])$. This is a
generalization of the classical private information retrieval (PIR) problem,
where messages are assumed to have equal a priori probabilities and equal
message sizes. We derive the semantic PIR capacity for general $K$, $N$. The
results show that the semantic PIR capacity depends on the number of databases
$N$, the number of messages $K$, the a priori probability distribution of
messages $p_i$, and the message sizes $L_i$. We present two achievable semantic
PIR schemes: The first one is a deterministic scheme which is based on message
asymmetry. This scheme employs non-uniform subpacketization. The second scheme
is probabilistic and is based on choosing one query set out of multiple options
at random to retrieve the required message without the need for exponential
subpacketization. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the
semantic PIR capacity to exceed the classical PIR capacity with equal priors
and sizes. Our results show that the semantic PIR capacity can be larger than
the classical PIR capacity when longer messages have higher popularities.
However, when messages are equal-length, the non-uniform priors cannot be
exploited to improve the retrieval rate over the classical PIR capacity.

the Alternating Offers Protocol (AOP). Under this protocol, agents cannot
express any additional information to each other besides a counter offer. This
can lead to unnecessarily long negotiations when, for example, negotiations are
impossible, risking to waste bandwidth that is a precious resource at the edge
of the network. While alternative protocols exist which alleviate this problem,
these solutions are too complex for low power devices, such as IoT sensors
operating at the edge of the network. To improve this bottleneck, we introduce
an extension to AOP called Alternating Constrained Offers Protocol (ACOP), in
which agents can also express constraints to each other. This allows agents to
both search the possibility space more efficiently and recognise impossible
situations sooner. We empirically show that agents using ACOP can significantly
reduce the number of messages a negotiation takes, independently of the
strategy agents choose. In particular, we show our method significantly reduces
the number of messages when an agreement is not possible. Furthermore, when an
agreement is possible it reaches this agreement sooner with no negative effect

the exterior zone of the matter system and the PN field in the near zone,

the modelling of compact objects by delta-functions, that are treated with
dimensional regularization (DR). In future work we intend to systematically
study the IR divergences by means of dimensional regularization as well. Our

reduce their energy costs by exploiting electricity price fluctuations across

leader chooses a proper electricity pricing mechanism to maximize its own

balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of

11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established.
This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn

Moreover, through this experiment, we demonstrate that there can be an

advent of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), pruning has become
topical with automatic mechanism and searching based architecture optimization.
Yet, current automatic designs rely on either reinforcement learning or
evolutionary algorithm. Due to the non-differentiability of those algorithms,
the pruning algorithm needs a long searching stage before reaching the
convergence.
  To circumvent this problem, this paper introduces a differentiable pruning
method via hypernetworks for automatic network pruning. The specifically
designed hypernetworks take latent vectors as input and generate the weight
parameters of the backbone network. The latent vectors control the output
channels of the convolutional layers in the backbone network and act as a
handle for the pruning of the layers. By enforcing $\ell_1$ sparsity
regularization to the latent vectors and utilizing proximal gradient solver,
sparse latent vectors can be obtained. Passing the sparsified latent vectors
through the hypernetworks, the corresponding slices of the generated weight
parameters can be removed, achieving the effect of network pruning. The latent
vectors of all the layers are pruned together, resulting in an automatic layer
configuration. Extensive experiments are conducted on various networks for
image classification, single image super-resolution, and denoising. And the
experimental results validate the proposed method.

analyzing stellar emission along with cold dust and gas continuum emission in a

Distant Red Core (DRC). We combine new HST and Spitzer data with existing
Gemini, Herschel, and ALMA observations to derive individual galaxy-level
properties, and compare them to coeval field and other protocluster galaxies.
All of the protocluster members are massive ($>10^{10}$ M$_\odot$), but not
significantly more so than their coeval field counterparts. Within uncertainty,
all are nearly indistinguishable from galaxies on the star-forming vs. stellar
mass main-sequence relationship, and on the star formation efficiency plane.
Assuming no future major influx of fresh gas, we estimate that these gaseous
DSFGs will deplete their gas reservoirs in $\sim300$ Myr, becoming the massive
quiescent ellipticals dominating cluster cores by $z\sim3$. Using various
methodologies, we derive a total $z=4$ halo mass of $\sim10^{14}$ M$_\odot$,

properties of materials. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have
explored this possibility of controlling matter by light based on driving
many-body systems via strong classical electromagnetic radiation, leading to a
time-dependent Hamiltonian for electronic or lattice degrees of freedom. To
avoid inevitable heating, pump-probe setups with ultrashort laser pulses have
so far been used to study transient light-induced modifications in materials.
Here, we pursue yet another direction of controlling quantum matter by
modifying quantum fluctuations of its electromagnetic environment. In contrast
to earlier proposals on light-enhanced electron-electron interactions, we
consider a dipolar quantum many-body system embedded in a cavity composed of
metal mirrors, and formulate a theoretical framework to manipulate its
equilibrium properties on the basis of quantum light-matter interaction. We
analyze hybridization of different types of the fundamental excitations,
including dipolar phonons, cavity photons, and plasmons in metal mirrors,
arising from the cavity confinement in the regime of strong light-matter
interaction. This hybridization qualitatively alters the nature of the
collective excitations and can be used to selectively control energy-level
structures in a wide range of platforms. Most notably, in quantum
paraelectrics, we show that the cavity-induced softening of infrared optical
phonons enhances the ferroelectric phase in comparison with the bulk materials.
Our findings suggest an intriguing possibility of inducing a superradiant-type
transition via the light-matter coupling without external pumping. We also
discuss possible applications of the cavity-induced modifications in collective
excitations to molecular materials and excitonic devices.

been predominantly focused on understanding the implications of these resonant

treated as being perfectly homogeneous, \ie neglecting inhomogeneities in the

from dark photon dark matter in the presence of inhomogeneous structure (which
is particularly relevant for dark photons with masses in the range $10^{-15} \,
{\rm eV} \, \lesssim m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV), emphasizing both the
importance of inhomogeneous energy injection, as well as the sensitivity of
cosmological observations to the inhomogeneities themselves. More specifically,
we derive modified constraints on dark photon dark matter from the Ly-$\alpha$
forest, and show that the presence of inhomogeneities allows one to extend
constraints to masses outside of the range that would be obtainable in the
homogeneous limit, while only slightly relaxing their strength. We then project
sensitivity for near-future cosmological surveys that are hoping to measure the
21cm transition in neutral hydrogen prior to reionization, and demonstrate that
these experiments will be extremely useful in improving sensitivity to masses
near $\sim 10^{-14}$ eV, potentially by several orders of magnitude. Finally,

body effects in the Chern bands of these systems when they are partially filled
to a total integer filling $\nu_T = 1,3$ (including spin and valley degrees of

which predicts valley and spin polarization in the zero bandwidth limit,
similar to the ""quantum Hall ferromagnetism"" in Landau levels. Though valley
polarization is implied by the existing experiments, the fate of the spin
degree of freedom is not presently clear. In this paper we propose alternative
valley polarized - but not spin polarized - candidates for the observed QAH

describe a class of exotic Chern insulator phases through spin-charge
separation: charge is in a conventional Chern insulator phase with quantized
Hall conductivity, while the spin forms disordered spin liquid phase with
fractionalization, which we dub quantum Hall spin liquids. We construct a
simple class of $Z_2$ quantum Hall spin liquid as analogs of the familiar $Z_2$
spin liquid through slave fermion-schwinger boson parton theory. Condensation
of the spinon from the $Z_2$ quantum Hall spin liquid can lead to a quantum
Hall antiferromagnet which is yet another, less exotic, candidate for the

a two-stage galaxy formation where the red, metal-rich GCs were formed in the
parent halo and the blue metal-poor GCs were accreted. This interpretation,
however, crucially depends on the assumption that GCs are exclusively old
stellar systems with a linear colour-metallicity relation (CZR). The shape of
the CZR and range of GC ages are currently under debate, because their study
requires high quality spectra to derive reliable stellar population properties.
We determined metallicities with full spectral fitting from a sample of 187 GCs
with high spectral signal-to-noise ratio in 23 galaxies of the Fornax cluster
that were observed as part of the Fornax 3D project. The derived CZR from this
sample is non-linear and can be described by a piecewise linear function with a
break point at ($g - z$) $\sim$ 1.1 mag. The less massive galaxies in our
sample ($M_\ast < 10^{10} M_\odot$) appear to have slightly younger GCs, but
the shape of the CZR is insensitive to the GC ages. Although the least massive
galaxies lack red, metal-rich GCs, a non-linear CZR is found irrespective of
the galaxy mass, even in the most massive galaxies ($M_\ast \geq 10^{11}
M_\odot$). Our CZR predicts narrow unimodal GC metallicity distributions for
low mass and broad unimodal distributions for very massive galaxies, dominated
by a metal-poor and metal-rich peak, respectively, and bimodal distributions
for galaxies with intermediate masses (10$^{10}$ $\leq$ $M_\ast < 10^{11}
M_\odot$) as a consequence of the relative fraction of red and blue GCs. The
diverse metallicity distributions challenge the simple differentiation of GC
populations solely based on their colour.

We produce X-ray simulations that mirror our Chandra observation to filter our
preliminary catalogs and get a completeness level of > 91% and a reliability
level of 95% in each band. The catalogs in the three bands are then matched
into a final main catalog of 256 unique sources. Among them, 244, 193, and 208

of the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC), and is also covered by
optical imaging data from the Large Binocular Camera (LBC) at the Large
Binocular Telescope, near-IR imaging data from the Canada France Hawaii

be a stochastic process with variability on human time-scales. The
planetesimals tidally disrupt at the Roche radius, producing dusty debris
detectable as excess infrared emission. When sufficiently close to the white
dwarf, this debris sublimates and accretes on to the white dwarf and pollutes
its atmosphere. Studying this infrared emission around polluted white dwarfs
can reveal how this planetary material arrives in their atmospheres. We report
a near-infrared monitoring campaign of 34 white dwarfs with infrared excesses
with the aim to search for variability in the dust emission. Time series
photometry of these white dwarfs from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
(Wide Field Camera) in the J, H and K bands were obtained over baselines of up
to three years. We find no statistically significant variation in the dust
emission in all three near-infrared bands. Specifically, we can rule out
variability at ~1.3% for the 13 white dwarfs brighter than 16th mag in K band,
and at ~10% for the 32 white dwarfs brighter than 18th mag over time-scales of
three years. Although to date two white dwarfs, SDSS J095904.69-020047.6 and WD
1226+110, have shown K band variability, in our sample we see no evidence of
new K band variability at these levels. One interpretation is that the tidal
disruption events which lead to large variabilities are rare, occur on short
time-scales, and after a few years the white dwarfs return to being stable in
the near-infrared.

conditions to calculate the interior structure and evolution of
$0.001-0.075\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ objects. Our models include several key
improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the
literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He equation of state including ab
initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by
$\sim1-2\%$ at the stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling
tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key
improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO,
which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately
capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric
temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted
emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for
the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and
highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and
near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of
model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using
non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed
self-consistently with the pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere. We
show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude

$\gamma$-ray eclipse at the same phase as optical and X-ray eclipses at the

between the X-ray source and the $\gamma$-ray source, strengthening the tMSP
classification. However, analysis of several optical data sets and an X-ray
observation do not reveal a change in the source's median brightness over long
timescales or a bi-modality on short timescales. Instead, the light curve is
dominated by flickering which has a correlation time of 2.6 min alongside a
potential quasi-periodic oscillation at $\sim$21 min. The mass of the primary

Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity, which results to particularly
elegant, functionally simple and transparent gravitational equations of motion,
slow-roll indices and the corresponding observational indices. The main
requirement is that the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory has to be compatible with
the GW170817 event, so the gravitational wave speed $c_T^2$ is required to be
$c_T^2\simeq 1$ in natural units. This assumption was also made in a previous
work of ours, but in this work we express all the related quantities as
functions of the scalar field. The constraint $c_T^2\simeq 1$ restricts the
functional form of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ and of
the scalar potential $V(\phi)$, which must satisfy a differential equation.
However, by also assuming that the slow-roll conditions hold true, the
resulting equations of motion and the slow-roll indices acquire particularly
simple forms, and also the relation that yields the $e$-foldings number is
$N=\int_{\phi_i}^{\phi_f}\xi''/\xi'd \phi$, a fact that enables us to perform
particularly simple calculations in order to study the inflationary
phenomenological implications of several models. As it proves, the models we
presented are compatible with the observational data, and also satisfy all the
assumptions made during the process of extracting the gravitational equations
of motion. More interestingly, we also investigated the phenomenological
implications of an additional condition $\xi'/\xi''\ll 1$, which is motivated
by the slow-roll conditions that are imposed on the scalar field evolution and
on the Hubble rate, in which case the study is easier. Our approach opens a new
window in viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity.

a data symbolic quantization consisting of rank vectors called ordinal patterns
or just permutations. The reasons for the increasing popularity of this entropy
in time series analysis include that (i) it converges to the Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy of the underlying dynamics in the limit of ever longer permutations,
and (ii) its computation dispenses with generating and ad hoc partitions.
However, permutation entropy diverges when the number of allowed permutations
grows super-exponentially with their length, as is usually the case when time
series are output by random processes. In this Letter we propose a generalized
permutation entropy that is finite for random processes, including
discrete-time dynamical systems with observational or dynamical noise.

often also called clocks, on cosmological perturbations around a flat FLRW
universe. We derive the Mukhanov-Sasaki (MS) equation for the Brown-Kuchar (BK)
and Gaussian dust models, which both consider four dust fields as reference
fields. The reduced phase space of Dirac observables, that is the
gauge-invariant part of the theory, is constructed by means of an observable
map applied to all elementary phase space variables of the coupled system,
consisting of gravity, a massive scalar field and the dust degrees of freedom.
The evolution of these observables is governed by a so called physical
Hamiltonian which can be derived once the set of reference fields are chosen
and differs for each model. First, the reduced phase space as well as the
corresponding equations of motion are derived for full general relativity. Then
from this, the gauge-invariant version of the equations of motion for the
background are derived which contain a fingerprint of the dust reference
fields. Afterwards we study linear cosmological perturbations around a FLRW
metric using the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition and derive the equation of
motion for the MS variable in this formalism for a chosen set of variables on
the reduced phase space and expressed in terms of Dirac observables. The MS
equation involves additional contributions that can be understood as back
reactions from the dust reference fields. These additional dust contributions
to the MS equation were absent if the dust energy and momentum density as well
as their perturbations are vanishing. The nature of the correction terms
suggest that BK and Gaussian dust reference fields contribute differently.
Using numerical simulations we study the behavior of the dust contributions to
the MS equation during inflation.

promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like
earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently
stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of
plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent
progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth
obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered
that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and
cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait
is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a
method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and
orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support
using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the
snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most
challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake
robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with
variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly
and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As
step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of
flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in
the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the
robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll
instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing
traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly
than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.

the ubiquitous deployment of deep learning in many security-sensitive domains.
Many prior studies have shown external attacks such as adversarial examples
that tamper with the integrity of DNNs using maliciously crafted inputs.
However, the security implication of internal threats (i.e., hardware
vulnerability) to DNN models has not yet been well understood. In this paper,
we demonstrate the first hardware-based attack on quantized deep neural
networks-DeepHammer-that deterministically induces bit flips in model weights
to compromise DNN inference by exploiting the rowhammer vulnerability.
DeepHammer performs aggressive bit search in the DNN model to identify the most
vulnerable weight bits that are flippable under system constraints. To trigger
deterministic bit flips across multiple pages within reasonable amount of time,
we develop novel system-level techniques that enable fast deployment of victim
pages, memory-efficient rowhammering and precise flipping of targeted bits.
DeepHammer can deliberately degrade the inference accuracy of the victim DNN
system to a level that is only as good as random guess, thus completely
depleting the intelligence of targeted DNN systems. We systematically
demonstrate our attacks on real systems against 12 DNN architectures with 4
different datasets and different application domains. Our evaluation shows that
DeepHammer is able to successfully tamper DNN inference behavior at run-time
within a few minutes. We further discuss several mitigation techniques from
both algorithm and system levels to protect DNNs against such attacks. Our work
highlights the need to incorporate security mechanisms in future deep learning

shown that, under physiological conditions, capsid proteins initially bind to
the genome through an en masse mechanism and form nucleoprotein complexes in a
disordered state, which raises the questions as to how virions are assembled
into a highly ordered structure in the host cell. Using small-angle X-ray
scattering, we find out that a disorder-order transition occurs under
physiological conditions upon an increase in capsid protein concentrations. Our
cryo-transmission electron microscopy reveals closed spherical shells
containing in vitro transcribed viral RNA even at pH 7.5, in marked contrast
with the previous observations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to explain this
disorder-order transition and find that, as the shell grows, the structures of
disordered intermediates in which the distribution of pentamers does not belong
to the icosahedral subgroups become energetically so unfavorable that the caps
can easily dissociate and reassemble overcoming the energy barriers for the
formation of perfect icosahedral shells. In addition, we monitor the growth of
capsids under the condition that the nucleation and growth is the dominant
pathway and show that the key for the disorder-order transition in both en
masse and nucleation and growth pathways lies in the strength of elastic energy
compared to the other forces in the system including protein-protein
interactions and the chemical potential of free subunits. Our findings explain,
at least in part, why perfect virions with icosahedral order form under
different conditions including physiological ones.

positive predictions on image regions not containing any person. But how often
do these mistakes happen? Are our models negatively affected by this? In this
paper we analyze this problem in depth. In order to understand its magnitude,
we present an extensive analysis on five of the most important crowd counting
datasets. We present this analysis in two parts. First, we quantify the number
of mistakes made by popular crowd counting approaches. Our results show that
(i) mistakes on background are substantial and they are responsible for 18-49%
of the total error, (ii) models do not generalize well to different kinds of
backgrounds and perform poorly on completely background images, and (iii)
models make many more mistakes than those captured by the standard Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) metric, as counting on background compensates considerably
for misses on foreground. And second, we quantify the performance change gained
by helping the model better deal with this problem. We enrich a typical crowd
counting network with a segmentation branch trained to suppress background
predictions. This simple addition (i) reduces background error by 10-83%, (ii)
reduces foreground error by up to 26% and (iii) improves overall crowd counting
performance up to 20%. When compared against the literature, this simple
technique achieves very competitive results on all datasets, on par with the
state-of-the-art, showing the importance of tackling the background problem.

the leading edge vortex (LEV); hence, the lift under unsteady stall conditions.
As a pre-requisite, the parameters influencing the development of the LEV
topology must be fully understood, and this constitutes the main motivation of
the present experimental investigation. The aims of this study are twofold.
First, an approach is introduced to validate the comparability between flow
fields and LEV characteristics of two different facilities using water and air
as working media by making use of a common baseline case. The motivation behind
this comparison is that with two facilities the overall parameter range can be
greatly expanded. This comparison includes an overview of the respective
parameter ranges, control of the airfoil kinematics and careful scrutiny of how
post-processing procedures of velocity data from time-resolved particle image
velocimetry (PIV) influence the integral properties and topological features
used to characterise the LEV development. Second, and based on results coming
from both facilities, the appearance of secondary structures and their effect
on LEV detachment over an extended parameter range is studied. A Lagrangian
flow field analysis, based on finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) ridges,
allows precise identification of secondary structures and reveals that their
emergence is closely correlated to a vortex Reynolds number threshold computed
from the LEV circulation. This threshold is used to model the temporal onset of
secondary structures. Further analysis indicates that the emergence of
secondary structures causes the LEV to stop accumulating circulation if the
shear layer angle at the leading edge of the flat plate has ceased to increase.

hand pose estimation under single hand scenarios and hand-object interaction.
We show that the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods can drop, and that they
fail mostly on poses absent from the training set. Unfortunately, since the
space of hand poses is highly dimensional, it is inherently not feasible to
cover the whole space densely, despite recent efforts in collecting large-scale
training datasets. This sampling problem is even more severe when hands are
interacting with objects and/or inputs are RGB rather than depth images, as RGB
images also vary with lighting conditions and colors. To address these issues,
we designed a public challenge (HANDS'19) to evaluate the abilities of current
3D hand pose estimators (HPEs) to interpolate and extrapolate the poses of a
training set. More exactly, HANDS'19 is designed (a) to evaluate the influence
of both depth and color modalities on 3D hand pose estimation, under the
presence or absence of objects; (b) to assess the generalisation abilities
w.r.t. four main axes: shapes, articulations, viewpoints, and objects; (c) to
explore the use of a synthetic hand model to fill the gaps of current datasets.
Through the challenge, the overall accuracy has dramatically improved over the
baseline, especially on extrapolation tasks, from 27mm to 13mm mean joint
error. Our analyses highlight the impacts of: Data pre-processing, ensemble
approaches, the use of a parametric 3D hand model (MANO), and different HPE

  Gaussian Priors",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When solving ill-posed inverse problems, a good choice of the prior is
critical for the computation of a reasonable solution. A common approach is to
include a Gaussian prior, which is defined by a mean vector and a symmetric and
positive definite covariance matrix, and to use iterative projection methods to
solve the corresponding regularized problem. However, a main challenge for many
of these iterative methods is that the prior covariance matrix must be known
and fixed (up to a constant) before starting the solution process. In this
paper, we develop hybrid projection methods for inverse problems with mixed
Gaussian priors where the prior covariance matrix is a convex combination of
matrices and the mixing parameter and the regularization parameter do not need
to be known in advance. Such scenarios may arise when data is used to generate
a sample prior covariance matrix (e.g., in data assimilation) or when different
priors are needed to capture different qualities of the solution. The proposed
hybrid methods are based on a mixed Golub-Kahan process, which is an extension
of the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization, and a distinctive feature of
the proposed approach is that both the regularization parameter and the
weighting parameter for the covariance matrix can be estimated automatically
during the iterative process. Furthermore, for problems where training data are
available, various data-driven covariance matrices (including those based on
learned covariance kernels) can be easily incorporated. Numerical examples from
tomographic reconstruction demonstrate the potential for these methods.

atoms, a neural network can be trained to infer atomic coordinates from
Patterson maps. The network was trained entirely on synthetic data. For the
training set, the network outputs were 3D maps of randomly positioned atoms.
From each output map, a Patterson map was generated and used as input to the
network. The network generalized to cases not in the test set, inferring atom
positions from Patterson maps.
  A key finding in this work is that the Patterson maps presented to the
network input during training must uniquely describe the atomic coordinates
they are paired with on the network output or the network will not train and it
will not generalize. The network cannot train on conflicting data. Avoiding
conflicts is handled in 3 ways: 1. Patterson maps are invariant to translation.
To remove this degree of freedom, output maps are centered on the average of
their atom positions. 2. Patterson maps are invariant to centrosymmetric
inversion. This conflict is removed by presenting the network output with both
the atoms used to make the Patterson Map and their centrosymmetry-related
counterparts simultaneously. 3. The Patterson map does not uniquely describe a
set of coordinates because the origin for each vector in the Patterson map is
ambiguous. By adding empty space around the atoms in the output map, this
ambiguity is removed. Forcing output atoms to be closer than half the output

production. Using the color dipole framework, we analyze in detail the
contributions of the conventional two-pomeron fusion and the three-pomeron
fusion correction. In a parameter-free way we found that the three-pomeron
mechanism is significant for $D$-meson production in the small-$p_{T}$
kinematics, although it is less important at large $p_{T}$, as well as for
$B$-mesons. The inclusion of the three-pomeron mechanism significantly improves
the agreement of theoretical predictions with experimental data in the
small-$p_{T}$ kinematics. We also consider the non-prompt charmonia production,
and demonstrate that the theoretical results are in reasonable agreement with
experimental data. Finally, we compare the theoretical predictions for the
dependence on multiplicity of co-produced hadrons to experimental data recently
measured by the ALICE collaboration. We found that, contrary to naive
expectations, the contribution of the three-pomeron mechanism has only a mild
effect on the self-normalized observables in the range of multiplicities
studied at ALICE, and for this reason the two-pomeron fusion mechanism can
describe reasonably well the experimentally observed multiplicity dependence.

success, effective vaccines to prevent many high-burden diseases, including
HIV, have been slow to develop. Vaccine development can be aided by the
identification of immune response markers that serve as effective surrogates
for clinically significant infection or disease endpoints. However, measuring
immune response marker activity is often costly, which has motivated the usage
of two-phase sampling for immune response evaluation in clinical trials of
preventive vaccines. In such trials, the measurement of immunological markers
is performed on a subset of trial participants, where enrollment in this second
phase is potentially contingent on the observed study outcome and other
participant-level information. We propose nonparametric methodology for
efficiently estimating a counterfactual parameter that quantifies the impact of
a given immune response marker on the subsequent probability of infection.
Along the way, we fill in theoretical gaps pertaining to the asymptotic
behavior of nonparametric efficient estimators in the context of two-phase

Techniques for constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are
presented, and an open source software implementation of the methodology, the

Here we show an approach to compute the quadrupole $e$-ph interaction and

strongly impacts the $e$-ph matrix elements. Analysis of $e$-ph interactions
for different phonon modes reveals that the quadrupole term mainly affects
optical modes in silicon and acoustic modes in PbTiO$_3$, although the
quadrupole term is needed for all modes to achieve quantitative accuracy. The
effect of the quadrupole $e$-ph interaction on electron scattering processes

massive black hole (MBH) pairs with masses between $10^5$ and $10^7 M_{\odot}$
embedded in a circumnuclear gas disk (CND). An adiabatic equation of state is
adopted, with a range of adiabatic indices, which maintains a smooth flow.
Mergers between MBHs in this mass range would be detectable by the upcoming
Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The orbital evolution is followed
from the CND scale ($100$~pc) down to separations of $0.1$--$0.01$~pc at which
a circumbinary disk (CBD) could form. The decay is erratic and strongly
dependent on the gas flow within the disk, that ultimately determines the net
torques experienced by the sinking MBH. Overall, we can identify three
different evolutionary stages: (i) an initially slow decay that leads to no
significant change in the orbital angular momentum, resulting in some
circularization; (ii) a fast migration phase in which the orbital angular
momentum decreases rapidly; and (iii) a final, very slow decay phase, in which
orbital angular momentum can even increase, and a CBD can form. The fast
migration phase owes to disk-driven torques originating primarily from the
co-orbital region of the secondary MBH, at a distance of 1--3 Hill radii. We
find strong analogies with fast Type III migration for massive planets in
protoplanetary disks. The CBD forms only when the decay rate becomes small
enough to allow it enough time to carve a cavity around the primary MBH, at
scales $\lesssim 1$~pc; when this happens, the MBH separation nearly stalls in
our higher-resolution run. We suggest an empirically modified gap-opening
criterion that takes into account such timescale effects as well as other

When time reversal symmetry is explicitly broken, we obtain a gapped spin
liquid with a single chiral Majorana edge mode. We also investigate another
solvable model in which the time-reversal-invariant spin liquid is coupled to
conduction electrons in a superconductor. In the presence of a Kondo-like
coupling that involves the octupole moment of the localized spins, the
itinerant electrons hybridize with the emergent Majorana fermions in the spin

odd-frequency pairing. Our results suggest that $j_{\text{eff}}=\frac32$

However, existing methods only concentrate on the long-tailed distribution of
classes. Differently, we devote to the long-tailed domain distribution problem,
which refers to the fact that a small number of domains frequently appear while
other domains far less existing. The key challenge of the problem is that
domain labels are too complicated (related to race, age, pose, illumination,
etc.) and inaccessible in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel
Domain Balancing (DB) mechanism to handle this problem. Specifically, we first
propose a Domain Frequency Indicator (DFI) to judge whether a sample is from
head domains or tail domains. Secondly, we formulate a light-weighted Residual
Balancing Mapping (RBM) block to balance the domain distribution by adjusting
the network according to DFI. Finally, we propose a Domain Balancing Margin
(DBM) in the loss function to further optimize the feature space of the tail
domains to improve generalization. Extensive analysis and experiments on
several face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively enhances the generalization capacities and achieves superior
performance.

nanoscale vacuum gaps is through hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) waveguides. When
placed between a hot and cold reservoir, an ideal HMM can transmit surface
waves across several microns, enabling an extension of near-field enhancements.
However, when accounting for transmission loss due to realistic levels of
absorption within the waveguide, previous studies have shown that the
enhancements are significantly curtailed at wide separations. In our study, we
investigate the role of internal sources within realistic non-isothermal HMMs.
We demonstrate that, in some cases, the emission from the HMM accounts for over
90% of the total heat transfer to the receiver, and that these additional
sources can largely compensate for optical losses associated with decreased
transmission from the emitter to the receiver. Lastly, we investigate the
spectral transport in a realistic 3-body system which has mismatching optical
properties between the boundaries (emitter and receiver) and the waveguide
(HMM). Our model shows that the near-field thermal transport remains spectrally
selective to the boundaries, even as major radiative contributions come from
the waveguide. This work may enable the design of non-isothermal
emitter-waveguide-receiver systems that transmit near-field power levels over

impact parameter, resulting in variations in the transit shape and duration.
Detection of and upper limits on changes in impact parameter yield valuable
constraints on a planetary system's three dimensional architecture. Constraints
for warm Jupiters are particularly interesting because they allow us to test
origins theories that invoke a mutually inclined perturber. Because of warm
Jupiters' high signal-to-noise transits, changes in impact parameter are
feasible to detect. However, here we show that allowing the impact parameter to
vary uniformly and independently from transit to transit leads to incorrect
inferences about the change, propagating to incorrect inferences about the
perturber. We demonstrate that an appropriate prior on the change in impact
parameter mitigates this problem. We apply our approach to eight systems from

significantly different from L_X measured for He II emitters. The L_X per

models to infrared observations. For multiple free model parameters,
traditional methods such as Least-Squares fitting or Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo
methods become computationally too expensive. Consequently, the simultaneous
estimation of several thermophysical parameters together with their
corresponding uncertainties and correlations is often not computationally
feasible and the analysis is usually reduced to fitting one or two parameters.
Data assimilation methods have been shown to be robust while sufficiently
accurate and computationally affordable even for a large number of parameters.
This paper will introduce a standard sequential data assimilation method, the
Ensemble Square Root Filter, to thermophysical modelling of asteroid surfaces.
This method is used to re-analyse infrared observations of the MARA instrument,
which measured the diurnal temperature variation of a single boulder on the
surface of near-Earth asteroid (162173) Ryugu. The thermal inertia is estimated
to be $295 \pm 18$ $\mathrm{J\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}\,s^{-1/2}}$, while all five free

Based on this thermal inertia estimate the thermal conductivity of the boulder

porosity to be between 0.30 and 0.52. For the first time in thermophysical

coalitions in order to maximise the number of completed tasks. The current
state-of-the-art CFSTP solver, the Coalition Formation with Look-Ahead (CFLA)

with the number of agents. Second, as we show, its look-ahead technique is not

propose a sensitivity analysis framework for assessing how assumptions on the
noise across groups affect the predictive bias properties of the risk
assessment model as a predictor of reoffense. Our experimental results on two
real world criminal justice data sets demonstrate how even small biases in the

certain regimes, their properties are found to be independent of the
microscopic details of the underlying system. An example of such a situation is
the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid description of one-dimensional strongly
correlated bosonic or fermionic systems. Here we investigate how such a quantum
liquid responds under dissipative dephasing dynamics and, in particular, we
identify how the universal Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid properties melt away. Our
study, based on adiabatic elimination, shows that dephasing first translates
into the damping of the oscillations present in the density-density
correlations, a behavior accompanied by a change of the Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid exponent. This first regime is followed by a second one characterized by
the diffusive propagation of featureless correlations as expected for an
infinite temperature state. We support these analytical predictions by
numerically exact simulations carried out using a number-conserving
implementation of the matrix product states algorithm adapted to open systems.

method for the estimation and approximation of submanifold models of animal

manifold $Q$ that is a smooth, connected, regularly embedded Riemannian
submanifold of Euclidean space $X\approx \mathbb{R}^d$ for some $d>0$, and that
the manifold $Q$ is homeomorphic to a known smooth, Riemannian manifold $S$.
Estimation of the manifold is achieved by finding an unknown mapping

overall problem is cast as a distribution-free learning problem over the

between an existing single-agent planner/executor and existing computational

needed, transparently routes them to other robots for execution. PDRA is
pluggable: it can be integrated in an existing single-robot autonomy stack with

mixed-integer programming algorithm, solved in a shared-world fashion, that
models CPU resources, latency requirements, and multi-hop, periodic,
bandwidth-limited network communications; the algorithm can minimize overall

work made extensive use of sparse signal reconstruction frameworks (e.g
convolutional sparse coding). While this work was ultimately surpassed by deep
learning, it rested on a much more developed theoretical framework. Recent work
by Papyan et. al provides a bridge between the two approaches by showing how a

a convolutional sparse coding (CSC) problem. In this work we argue that for
some types of inverse problems the CNN approximation breaks down leading to
poor performance. We argue that for these types of problems the CSC approach
should be used instead and validate this argument with empirical evidence.
Specifically we identify JPEG artifact reduction and non-rigid trajectory
reconstruction as challenging inverse problems for CNNs and demonstrate state
of the art performance on them using a CSC method. Furthermore, we offer some
practical improvements to this model and its application, and also show how
insights from the CSC model can be used to make CNNs effective in tasks where

  SMBO algorithms are intrinsically modular, leaving the user with many
important design choices. Significant research efforts go into understanding
which settings perform best for which type of problems. Most works, however,
focus on the choice of the model, the acquisition function, and the strategy

achieve high-sensitivity imaging at low intensity levels, we adapt a detection
scheme -- which is used in quantum optics for providing information about
spectral correlations of photons -- into a standard spectral domain OCT system.
This detection scheme is based on the concept of Dispersive Fourier
Transformation, where a fibre introduces a wavelength-dependent time delay
measured by a single-pixel detector, usually a high-speed photoreceiver. Here,
we use a fast Superconducting Single-Photon Detector (SSPD) as a single-pixel
detector and obtain images of a glass stack and a slice of onion at the
intensity levels of the order of 10 pW. We also provide a formula for a
depth-dependent sensitivity fall-off in such a detection scheme which can be
treated as a temporal equivalent of diffraction-grating-based spectrometers.

galaxy luminosities for a sample of 146 galaxy clusters from the Yang SDSS

Gaussians (G) and Non-Gaussians (NG), and further divided by luminosity regime.
We performed a classification in the Age-SSFR plane providing three classes:
star-forming (SF), passive (PAS), and intermediate (GV -- green valley). We
show that galaxies evolve in the same way in G and NG systems, but also suggest
that their formation histories leads to different mixtures of galactic types
and infall patterns. Separating the GV into star-forming and passive
components, we find more bright galaxies in the passive mode of NG than in G
systems. We also find more intermediate faint galaxies in the star-forming
component of NG than in G systems. Our results suggest the GV as the stage
where the transition from types Sab and Scd to S0 must be taking place, but the
conversion between morphological types is independent of the dynamical stage of
the clusters. Analyzing the velocity dispersion profiles, we find that objects
recently infalling in clusters have a different composition between G and NG
systems. While all galaxy types infall onto G systems, Sab and Scd dominate the
infall onto NG systems. Finally, we find that faint Scd in the outskirts of NG
systems present higher asymmetries relative to the mean asymmetry of field
galaxies, suggesting environmental effects acting on these objects.

strategies, has been vastly studied. In this work, the modeling capabilities of
a powerful non-parametric Bayesian inference scheme, i.e., Gaussian Processes

multivariate regression with hidden variables, $Y = (\Ttheta)^TX + (B^*)^TZ +
E$, where $Y$ is a $m$-dimensional response vector, $X$ is a $p$-dimensional
vector of observable features, $Z$ represents a $K$-dimensional vector of
unobserved hidden variables, possibly correlated with $X$, and $E$ is an
independent error. The number of hidden variables $K$ is unknown and both $m$
and $p$ are allowed but not required to grow with the sample size $n$. Since
only $Y$ and $X$ are observable, we provide necessary conditions for the
identifiability of $\Ttheta$. The same set of conditions are shown to be
sufficient when the error $E$ is homoscedastic. Our identifiability proof is
constructive and leads to a novel and computationally efficient estimation
algorithm, called HIVE. The first step of the algorithm is to estimate the best
linear prediction of $Y$ given $X$ in which the unknown coefficient matrix
exhibits an additive decomposition of $\Ttheta$ and a dense matrix originated
from the correlation between $X$ and the hidden variable $Z$. Under the row
sparsity assumption on $\Ttheta$, we propose to minimize a penalized least
squares loss by regularizing $\Ttheta$ via a group-lasso penalty and
regularizing the dense matrix via a multivariate ridge penalty. Non-asymptotic
deviation bounds of the in-sample prediction error are established. Our second
step is to estimate the row space of $B^*$ by leveraging the covariance
structure of the residual vector from the first step. In the last step, we
remove the effect of hidden variable by projecting $Y$ onto the complement of
the estimated row space of $B^*$. Non-asymptotic error bounds of our final
estimator are established. The model identifiability, parameter estimation and
statistical guarantees are further extended to the setting with heteroscedastic
errors.

deals with the construction of variance functions associated with natural
exponential families of counting distributions on the set of nonnegative
integers and allows to find the corresponding generating measures. As
exponential dispersion models are based on natural exponential families, we
introduce in this paper two new classes of exponential dispersion models based
on their results. For these classes, which are associated with simple variance
functions, we derive their mean value parameterization and their associated
generating measures. We also prove that they have some desirable properties.
Both classes are shown to be overdispersed and zero-inflated in ascending
order, making them as competitive statistical models for those in use in both,
statistical and actuarial modeling. To our best knowledge, the classes of
counting distributions we present in this paper, have not been introduced or
discussed before in the literature. To show that our classes can serve as
competitive statistical models for those in use (e.g., Poisson, Negative
binomial), we include a numerical example of real data. In this example, we
compare the performance of our classes with relevant competitive models.

the human brain. They play a significant role in computational neuroscience and
artificial intelligence. The next generation of neural network models is based
on the spike timing activity of neurons: spiking neural networks (SNNs).
However, model parameters in SNNs are difficult to search and optimise.
Previous studies using genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation of SNNs were focused
mainly on simple, feedforward, or oscillatory networks, but not much work has
been done on optimising cortex-like recurrent SNNs. In this work, we
investigated the use of GAs to search for optimal parameters in recurrent SNNs
to reach targeted neuronal population firing rates, e.g. as in experimental
observations. We considered a cortical column based SNN comprising 1000
Izhikevich spiking neurons for computational efficiency and biologically
realism. The model parameters explored were the neuronal biased input currents.
First, we found for this particular SNN, the optimal parameter values for
targeted population averaged firing activities, and the convergence of
algorithm by ~100 generations. We then showed that the GA optimal population
size was within ~16-20 while the crossover rate that returned the best fitness
value was ~0.95. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of
implementing GA to optimise model parameters in a recurrent cortical based SNN.

is more complicated. For example, an initial point dipole field evolves to
produce an approximately closed equatorial flux tube containing at least one
predominantly toroidal and approximately closed field line surrounded by a
bundle of predominantly toroidal but open field lines. Inside the equatorial
flux tube, the field-line-averaged magnetic tension approaches zero, and the
fluid rotates differentially, adjusting its angular velocity on the viscous

with respect to their orbital motion) generally experience less severe
obliquity variations than those that rotate prograde (the same direction as
their orbital motion). Here we examine retrograde-rotating planets on eccentric
orbits and find a previously unknown secular spin-orbit resonance that can
drive significant obliquity variations. This resonance occurs when the
frequency of the planet's rotation axis precession becomes commensurate with an
orbital eigenfrequency of the planetary system. The planet's eccentricity
enables a participating orbital frequency through an interaction in which the
apsidal precession of the planet's orbit causes a cyclic nutation of the
planet's orbital angular momentum vector. The resulting orbital frequency
follows the relationship $f = 2 \dot{\varpi} - \dot{\Omega}$, where
$\dot{\varpi}$ and $\dot{\Omega}$ are the rates of the planet's changing
longitude of periapsis and ascending node, respectively. We test this mechanism
by simulating cases of a simple Earth-Jupiter system, and confirm the predicted
resonance. Over the course of 100 Myr, the test Earths with rotation axis
precession rates near the predicted resonant frequency experienced pronounced
obliquity variations of order $10^\circ$-$30^\circ$. These variations can be
significant, and suggest that while retrograde rotation is a stabilizing
influence most of the time, retrograde rotators can experience large obliquity
variations if they are on eccentric orbits and enter this spin-orbit resonance.

detectors can benefit from tracking which, for example, can help to smooth
predictions over time. In this paper we focus on the tracking-by-detection

propose a conceptually simple and efficient joint model of detection and
tracking, called RetinaTrack, which modifies the popular single stage RetinaNet
approach such that it is amenable to instance-level embedding training. We
show, via evaluations on the Waymo Open Dataset, that we outperform a recent

nonequilibrium phenomena, which involve many conceptual difficulties. However,
few studies have addressed the problem of understanding equilibrium itself.
Equilibrium is commonly assessed based on the assumption that its thermodynamic
state should be determined solely by temperature and pressure. However, this
assumption must be reappraised from the beginning through a rigorous definition
of equilibrium because no rigorous proof for this assumption exists. Previous
work showed that for solids, the equilibrium positions of all constituent atoms
of the solid are state variables (TC). In this study, this conclusion is
further elaborated starting from the principles of solid-state physics. This
theory has been applied to glass materials. Results show that first, the glass
state is an equilibrium state. Accordingly, the properties of a glass can be
solely described by the present positions of the atom, irrespective of their
previous history. Second, the glass transition, although a nonequilibrium
phenomenon, is well described using TCs if the thermal part of the energy is be
assumed to be well separated from the structural part. The only dynamic
parameter involved in this approach is the relaxation time, which is uniquely
determined using the present values of the TCs. Therefore, complicated
functions describing the past history are unnecessary. This implies that the
activation energy for the structural relaxation strongly depends on TCs. This
finding provides a reasonable understanding of the large deviations from the
Arrhenius law. The unrealistic values of the activation energy and of the
pre-exponential factor of the relaxation time can be resolved on this basis.
The theory is particularly suitable for experiments that do not involve
hypothetical quantities and models; therefore, all quantities are measurable.

engendered serious reliability concerns. A prominent example is hardware
transient faults that are growing in frequency due to the progressive

  This work proposes Ranger, a low-cost fault corrector, which directly
rectifies the faulty output due to transient faults without re-computation.
DNNs are inherently resilient to benign faults (which will not cause output
corruption), but not to critical faults (which can result in erroneous output).
Ranger is an automated transformation to selectively restrict the value ranges
in DNNs, which reduces the large deviations caused by critical faults and
transforms them to benign faults that can be tolerated by the inherent
resilience of the DNNs. Our evaluation on 8 DNNs demonstrates Ranger
significantly increases the error resilience of the DNNs (by 3x to 50x), with
no loss in accuracy, and with negligible overheads.

perpendicularly magnetized magnetic tunnel junction nanopillars and its
dependence on material parameters is critical to optimizing device performance.
Here we present a micromagnetic study of spin-torque switching in a disk-shaped
element as a function of the free layer's exchange constant and disk diameter.
The switching is shown to generally occur by 1) growth of the magnetization
precession amplitude in the element center; 2) an instability in which the
reversing region moves to the disk edge, forming a magnetic domain wall; and 3)
the motion of the domain wall across the element. For large diameters and small
exchange, step 1 leads to a droplet with a fully reversed core that experiences
a drift instability (step 2). While in the opposite case (small diameters and
large exchange), the central region of the disk is not fully reversed before
step 2 occurs. The origin of the micromagnetic structure is shown to be the
disk's non-uniform demagnetization field. Faster, more coherence and energy
efficient switching occur with larger exchange and smaller disk diameters,
showing routes to increase device performance.

former characterize the topological charge distribution and are therefore
sensitive probes of the topological structure of QCD. The latter depends on the
effective potential of axions, which is determined by the $\theta$-dependence
of QCD. The production of cold dark matter through the vacuum realignement
mechanism of axions can therefore be affected by higher topological charge
effects. This is discussed qualitatively in the deconfined phase at high
temperatures, where a description based on a dilute gas of instantons with
arbitrary topological charge is valid. As a result, topological
susceptibilities exhibit a characteristic temperature dependence due to
anharmonic modifications of the $\theta$-dependence. Furthermore,
multi-instanton effects give rise to a topological mechanism to increase the

Traditional methods of cave surveying are labor-intensive and dangerous due to
the risk of hypothermia when collecting data over extended periods of time in
cold and damp environments, the risk of injury when operating in darkness in
rocky or muddy environments, and the potential structural instability of the
subterranean environment. Although these dangers can be mitigated by deploying
robots to map dangerous passages and voids, real-time feedback is often needed
to operate robots safely and efficiently. Few state-of-the-art, high-resolution
perceptual modeling techniques attempt to reduce their high bandwidth
requirements to work well with low bandwidth communication channels. To bridge
this gap in the state of the art, this work compactly represents sensor
observations as Gaussian mixture models and maintains a local occupancy grid

objective function. The approach accommodates both limited field of view depth
cameras and larger field of view LiDAR sensors and is extensively evaluated in
long duration simulations on an embedded PC. An aerial system is leveraged to
demonstrate the repeatability of the approach in a flight arena as well as the
effects of communication dropouts. Finally, the system is deployed in Laurel

simulations indicate that the hot CGM of low-mass (M_*~10^{10.5} Msol),
high-sSFR (defined as the top one-third ranked by sSFR) central galaxies will
be detectable to a galactocentric radius r~30-50 kpc. Both simulations predict
lower luminosities at fixed stellar mass for the low-sSFR galaxies (the lower
third of sSFR) with Illustris-TNG predicting 3x brighter coronae around
high-sSFR galaxies than EAGLE. Both simulations predict detectable emission out
to r~150-200 kpc for stacks centered on high-mass (M_*~10^{11.0} Msol)

luminosity correlates strongly and positively with the mass of circumgalactic
gas within the virial radius (f_{CGM}). Prior analyses of both simulations have
established that f_{CGM} is reduced by expulsive feedback driven mainly by
black hole growth, which quenches galaxy growth by inhibiting replenishment of
the ISM. Both simulations predict that eROSITA stacks should not only
conclusively detect and resolve the hot CGM around L^* galaxies for the first
time, but provide a powerful probe of how the baryon cycle operates, for which
there remains an absence of consensus between state-of-the-art simulations.

exploring unknown environments and information gathering for environmental

failures when operating in adversarial environments. We introduce the Robust
Multiple-path Orienteering Problem (RMOP) where we seek worst-case guarantees
against an adversary that is capable of attacking at most $\alpha$ robots. We
consider two versions of this problem: RMOP offline and RMOP online. In the
offline version, there is no communication or replanning when robots execute
their plans and our main contribution is a general approximation scheme with a
bounded approximation guarantee that depends on $\alpha$ and the approximation
factor for single robot orienteering. In particular, we show that the algorithm
yields a (i) constant-factor approximation when the cost function is modular;
(ii) $\log$ factor approximation when the cost function is submodular; and
(iii) constant-factor approximation when the cost function is submodular but
the robots are allowed to exceed their path budgets by a bounded amount. In the
online version, RMOP is modeled as a two-player sequential game and solved
adaptively in a receding horizon fashion based on Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS). In addition to theoretical analysis, we perform simulation studies for

urgent need to develop countermeasures for preserving individual privacy. The

basic assumption of the former approach that the data collector is trustworthy
does not always hold true in reality, whereas the latter approach reduces the
value of data. In this paper, we investigate the privacy leakage issue from the
root source. Specifically, we take a fresh look to reverse the inferior
position of the data provider by making her dominate the game with the
collector to solve the dilemma in data trading. To that aim, we propose the
noisy-sequentially zero-determinant (NSZD) strategies by tailoring the
classical zero-determinant strategies, originally designed for the
simultaneous-move game, to adapt to the noisy sequential game. NSZD strategies
can empower the data provider to unilaterally set the expected payoff of the
data collector or enforce a positive relationship between her and the data
collector's expected payoffs. Both strategies can stimulate a rational data
collector to behave honestly, boosting a healthy data trading market. Numerical
simulations are used to examine the impacts of key parameters and the feasible
region where the data provider can be an NSZD player. Finally, we prove that
the data collector cannot employ NSZD to further dominate the data market for
deteriorating privacy leakage.

Although considerable improvement has been achieved, the quality of synthesized
images is far from satisfactory due to three largely unresolved challenges. 1)
The semantic labels do not provide detailed structural information, making it
difficult to synthesize local details and structures. 2) The widely adopted CNN
operations such as convolution, down-sampling, and normalization usually cause
spatial resolution loss and thus cannot fully preserve the original semantic
information, leading to semantically inconsistent results. 3) Existing semantic
image synthesis methods focus on modeling local semantic information from a
single input semantic layout. However, they ignore global semantic information
of multiple input semantic layouts, i.e., semantic cross-relations between
pixels across different input layouts. To tackle 1), we propose to use edge as
an intermediate representation which is further adopted to guide image
generation via a proposed attention guided edge transfer module. Edge
information is produced by a convolutional generator and introduces detailed
structure information. To tackle 2), we design an effective module to
selectively highlight class-dependent feature maps according to the original
semantic layout to preserve the semantic information. To tackle 3), inspired by
current methods in contrastive learning, we propose a novel contrastive
learning method, which aims to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to the same
semantic class to generate more similar image content than those from different
classes. Doing so can capture more semantic relations by explicitly exploring
the structures of labeled pixels from multiple input semantic layouts.
Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our ECGAN achieves
significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods.

Meanwhile, traditional machine learning-based methods apply various features

subtle facial textures involved. What makes it more complicated is the
correlations between different facial components, for example, the symmetry in
texture and structure between both eyes. While recent works adopted the
attention mechanism to learn the contextual relations among elements of the
face, they have largely overlooked the disastrous impacts of inaccurate
attention scores; in addition, they fail to pay sufficient attention to key
facial components, the completion results of which largely determine the
authenticity of a face image. Accordingly, in this paper, we design a
comprehensive framework for face completion based on the U-Net structure.
Specifically, we propose a dual spatial attention module to efficiently learn
the correlations between facial textures at multiple scales; moreover, we
provide an oracle supervision signal to the attention module to ensure that the
obtained attention scores are reasonable. Furthermore, we take the location of
the facial components as prior knowledge and impose a multi-discriminator on
these regions, with which the fidelity of facial components is significantly
promoted. Extensive experiments on two high-resolution face datasets including
CelebA-HQ and Flickr-Faces-HQ demonstrate that the proposed approach

In this paper, we use algorithms based on evolutionary strategies to

genetic algorithm (GA) approach which is capable of completely breaking a
locked analog circuit by finding either its obfuscation key or its obfuscated
parameters. We implement both the GA attack as well as a more naive
satisfiability modulo theory (SMT)-based attack on common analog benchmark
circuits obfuscated by combinational locking and parameter biasing. We find
that GA attack can unlock all the circuits using only the locked netlist and an
unlocked chip in minutes. On the other hand, while the SMT attack converges
faster, it requires circuit specification to execute and it also returns
multiple keys that need to be brute-forced by a post-processing step. We also

the discussion is emerging from, myths shared about the virus, and how much of

is able to handle uncertainties in the covariance of measurement noise.
Specifically, we consider two cases. In the first this covariance is fixed but
unknown, and in the second this covariance is slowly-varying. For our tests, we
only require knowledge of a set within which the covariance lies. Furthermore,
we connect this problem to that of algorithmic fairness and the nascent field
of fair hypothesis testing, and we show that our tests satisfy some notions of

max-min problem into an equivalent form based on the mean-square error method,
which facilities the design of an efficient suboptimal iterative algorithm. In
addition, we investigate two scenarios, namely the single-user system and the
multiuser system. For the former scenario, the optimal transmit beamforming is
obtained based on the dual subgradient method, while the phase shift matrix is
optimized based on the Majorization-Minimization method. For the latter
scenario, the transmit beamforming matrix and phase shift matrix are obtained
by the second-order cone programming and semidefinite relaxation techniques,
respectively. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance
improvement achieved by deploying an IRS. Furthermore, the proposed JP-CoMP

distant universe. The origin of their extended Ly$\alpha$ emission remains a
mystery. Some models posit that Ly$\alpha$ emission is produced when the cloud
is photoionized by UV emission from embedded or nearby sources, while others
suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ photons originate from an embedded galaxy or AGN
and are then resonantly scattered by the cloud. At least in the latter
scenario, the observed Ly$\alpha$ emission will be polarized. To test these
possibilities, we are conducting imaging polarimetric observations of seven
Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. Here we present our results for LABd05, a cloud at $z$ =
2.656 with an obscured, embedded AGN to the northeast of the peak of Ly$\alpha$
emission. We detect significant polarization. The highest polarization
fractions $P$ are $\sim$10-20% at $\sim$20-40 kpc southeast of the Ly$\alpha$
peak, away from the AGN. The lowest $P$, including upper-limits, are $\sim$5%
and lie between the Ly$\alpha$ peak and AGN. In other words, the polarization
map is lopsided, with $P$ increasing from the Ly$\alpha$ peak to the southeast.
The measured polarization angles $\theta$ are oriented northeast, roughly
perpendicular to the $P$ gradient. This unique polarization pattern suggests
that 1) the spatially-offset AGN is photoionizing nearby gas and 2) escaping
Ly$\alpha$ photons are scattered by the nebula at larger radii and into our
sightline, producing tangentially-oriented, radially-increasing polarization
away from the photoionized region. Finally we conclude that the interplay
between the gas density and ionization profiles produces the observed central
peak in the Ly$\alpha$ emission. This also implies that the structure of LABd05
is more complex than assumed by current theoretical spherical or cylindrical
models.

related to the pion-nucleon $\sigma$-term which is important for phenomenology.
However, the possible existence of a singular contribution proportional to

$\sigma$-term with $e(x)$ from experiment. There are two approaches to show the
existence. The first one is based on an operator identity. The second one is

mass. We show that all contributions proportional to $\delta (x)$ in the first
approach are in fact cancelled. To the second approach we find that $e(x)$ of a
multi-parton state with a massless quark has no contribution with $\delta (x)$.
Considering that a proton is essentially a multi-parton state, the effect of
the contribution with $\delta(x)$ is expected to be suppressed by light quark

context for the semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data. The problem is defined
as building a graph to represent the topology of a center segment with its
neighborhoods, then inferring the segment label. The node of graph is generated
from the segment on range image, which is suitable for both sparse and dense
point cloud. Edge weights that evaluate the correlations of center node and its
neighborhoods are automatically encoded by a neural network, therefore the
number of neighbor nodes is no longer a sensitive parameter. A system consists
of segment generation, graph building, edge weight estimation, node updating,
and node prediction is designed. Quantitative evaluation on a dataset of
dynamic scene shows that our method has better performance than unary CNN with
8% improvement, as well as normal GNN with 17% improvement.

Therefore, it is highly important for the application of ferroelectric
nanoelectronics. Hitherto, most CDW investigations are restricted in oxides,
and limited work has been reported in non-oxides to the contrary. Here, by
successfully synthesizing the non-oxide ferroelectric Sn2P2S6 single crystal,
we observed and confirmed the domain wall conductivity by using different
scanning probe techniques which origins from the nature of inclined domain
walls. Moreover, the domains separated by CDW also exhibit distinguishable
electrical conductivity due to the interfacial polarization charge with
opposite signs. The result provides a novel platform for understanding
electrical conductivity behavior of the domains and domain walls in non-oxide

waves (GWs) by PTAs has not been reported yet, many related theoretical studies
and some meaningful detection limits have been reported. In this study, we
focused on the nanohertz GWs from individual supermassive binary black holes.
Given specific pulsars (PSR J1909$-$3744, PSR J1713$+$0747, PSR J0437$-$4715),
the corresponding GW$-$induced timing residuals in PTAs with Gaussian white
noise can be simulated. Further, we report the classification of the simulated
PTA data and parameter estimation for potential GW sources using machine
learning based on neural networks. As a classifier, the convolutional neural
network shows high accuracy when the combined signal to noise ratio $\geq$1.33
for our simulated data. Further, we applied a recurrent neural network to
estimate the chirp mass ($\mathcal{M}$) of the source and luminosity distance
($\text{D}_{p}$) of the pulsars and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to obtain
the uncertainties of chirp mass estimation. Knowledge of the uncertainties is
crucial to astrophysical observation. In our case, the mean relative error of
chirp mass estimation is less than $13.6\%$. Although these results are
achieved for simulated PTA data, we believe that they will be important for
realizing intelligent processing in PTA data analysis.

history observations of two scenes that are correlative on their dynamic
changes, the purpose is to learn a cross-scene predictor, so that with the
observation of one scene, a robot can onlinely predict the dynamic state of
another. A method is proposed to solve the problem via modeling dynamic
correlation using latent space shared auto-encoders. Assuming that the inherent
correlation of scene dynamics can be represented by shared latent space, where
a common latent state is reached if the observations of both scenes are at an
approximate time, a learning model is developed by connecting two auto-encoders
through the latent space, and a prediction model is built by concatenating the
encoder of the input scene with the decoder of the target one. Simulation
datasets are generated imitating the dynamic flows at two adjacent gates of a
campus, where the dynamic changes are triggered by a common working and
teaching schedule. Similar scenarios can also be found at successive
intersections on a single road, gates of a subway station, etc. Accuracy of
cross-scene prediction is examined at various conditions of scene correlation
and pairwise observations. Potentials of the proposed method are demonstrated
by comparing with conventional end-to-end methods and linear predictions.

an investigation of essential features in quantum network dynamics accompanied
with a fluctuation of interaction. Variation of disorder parameter, kinetic
energy and effective mass of monomers in electron dynamics calculation reveal
how static disorder and dynamical fluctuation affects electron dynamics in a
large size of molecular aggregates. Disorder in aggregate structure suppress
charge separation while molecular motion can promote charge diffusion in cases
of smaller mass. These findings are obtained by using a newly introduced
formula for evaluating charge separation in molecular aggregates that is useful
for other analysis involved with charge migration dynamics in molecular/atom
aggregates. This work provides a way for obtaining a quantum mechanical
time-dependent picture of diffusion and migration of exciton and charge density
in general molecular aggregates, which offers a fundamental understanding of

have modified some of the model hypotheses in order to obtain an estimate of

then applied to the case of the recent advance of the epidemic in Brazil. In
this regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of
infectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly,
we evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the
population susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response
to quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the

adopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures. The extent of
such measures would be likely to cause thousands, millions or tens of millions

guarantee. This is in contrast to previous methods that either exhibit
prohibitive complexity as the population grows or do not guarantee convergence.
Our method is based on optimal transport, or more specifically, multi-marginal
optimal transport theory. In particular, we consider an inference problem with
aggregate observations, that can be seen as a structured multi-marginal optimal
transport problem where the cost function decomposes according to the
underlying graph. Consequently, the celebrated Sinkhorn/iterative scaling
algorithm for multi-marginal optimal transport can be leveraged together with
the standard belief propagation algorithm to establish an efficient inference
scheme which we call Sinkhorn belief propagation (SBP). We further specialize
the SBP algorithm to cases associated with hidden Markov models due to their
significance in control and estimation. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on applications such as inferring population flow from aggregate
observations. We also show that in the special case where the observations are
generated by a single individual, our algorithm naturally reduces to the
standard belief propagation algorithm.

formal statistical inference. Model-based clustering allows statistical
inference, yet research on distributed inference has emphasized nonparametric
Bayesian mixture models over finite mixture models. To fill this gap, we
introduce a nearly embarrassingly parallel algorithm for clustering under a
Bayesian overfitted finite mixture of Gaussian mixtures, which we term
distributed Bayesian clustering (DIB-C). DIB-C can flexibly accommodate data
sets with various shapes (e.g. skewed or multi-modal). With data randomly
partitioned and distributed, we first run Markov chain Monte Carlo in an
embarrassingly parallel manner to obtain local clustering draws and then refine
across workers for a final clustering estimate based on any loss function on
the space of partitions. DIB-C can also estimate cluster densities, quickly
classify new subjects and provide a posterior predictive distribution. Both
simulation studies and real data applications show superior performance of
DIB-C in terms of robustness and computational efficiency.

The resulting PMC scale for this $A_{\rm{FB}}$ is an order of magnitude smaller

reasonable behavior and reflects the virtuality of its QCD dynamics, which is
independent to the choice of renormalization scale. Our analyses show that the

be $\mu_r\ll M_Z$ other than the conventionally suggested $\mu_r=M_Z$.
Moreover, the convergence of perturbative QCD series for $A_{\rm{FB}}$ is
greatly improved using the PMC. Our prediction for the bare bottom quark

exemplar-memory based CIL methods, it is generally known that the forgetting is
commonly caused by the classification score bias that is injected due to the
data imbalance between the new classes and the old classes (in the
exemplar-memory). While several methods have been proposed to correct such
score bias by some additional post-processing, e.g., score re-scaling or
balanced fine-tuning, no systematic analysis on the root cause of such bias has
been done. To that end, we analyze that computing the softmax probabilities by
combining the output scores for all old and new classes could be the main cause
of the bias. Then, we propose a new method, dubbed as Separated Softmax for
Incremental Learning (SS-IL), that consists of separated softmax (SS) output
layer combined with task-wise knowledge distillation (TKD) to resolve such
bias. Throughout our extensive experimental results on several large-scale CIL
benchmark datasets, we show our SS-IL achieves strong state-of-the-art accuracy
through attaining much more balanced prediction scores across old and new
classes, without any additional post-processing.

the real world. Segmenting transparent objects is challenging because these
objects have diverse appearance inherited from the image background, making
them had similar appearance with their surroundings. Besides the technical
difficulty of this task, only a few previous datasets were specially designed
and collected to explore this task and most of the existing datasets have major
drawbacks. They either possess limited sample size such as merely a thousand of
images without manual annotations, or they generate all images by using
computer graphics method (i.e. not real image). To address this important
problem, this work proposes a large-scale dataset for transparent object
segmentation, named Trans10K, consisting of 10,428 images of real scenarios
with carefully manual annotations, which are 10 times larger than the existing
datasets. The transparent objects in Trans10K are extremely challenging due to
high diversity in scale, viewpoint and occlusion as shown in Fig. 1. To
evaluate the effectiveness of Trans10K, we propose a novel boundary-aware
segmentation method, termed TransLab, which exploits boundary as the clue to
improve segmentation of transparent objects. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans10K and validate the practicality
of learning object boundary in TransLab. For example, TransLab significantly
outperforms 20 recent object segmentation methods based on deep learning,
showing that this task is largely unsolved. We believe that both Trans10K and
TransLab have important contributions to both the academia and industry,
facilitating future researches and applications.

diverse styles of characters and abilities, and the real-time nature of the
game. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that combines Rolling Horizon

readily applicable to any 2-player video game. In contrast to conventional
RHEA, an opponent model is proposed and is optimized by supervised learning
with cross-entropy and reinforcement learning with policy gradient and
Q-learning respectively, based on history observations from opponent. The model
is learned during the live gameplay. With the learned opponent model, the
extended RHEA is able to make more realistic plans based on what the opponent
is likely to do. This tends to lead to better results. We compared our approach
directly with the bots from the FTGAIC 2018 competition, and found our method
to significantly outperform all of them, for all three character. Furthermore,
our proposed bot with the policy-gradient-based opponent model is the only one
without using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) among top five bots in the 2019

computer vision, where the most accurate approaches are based on fully
supervised learning models. However, the acquisition of accurate and large
ground truth data sets to model these fully supervised methods is a major
challenge for the further development of the area. Self-supervised methods
trained with monocular videos constitute one the most promising approaches to
mitigate the challenge mentioned above due to the wide-spread availability of
training data. Consequently, they have been intensively studied, where the main
ideas explored consist of different types of model architectures, loss
functions, and occlusion masks to address non-rigid motion. In this paper, we
propose two new ideas to improve self-supervised monocular trained depth
estimation: 1) self-attention, and 2) discrete disparity prediction. Compared
with the usual localised convolution operation, self-attention can explore a
more general contextual information that allows the inference of similar
disparity values at non-contiguous regions of the image. Discrete disparity
prediction has been shown by fully supervised methods to provide a more robust
and sharper depth estimation than the more common continuous disparity
prediction, besides enabling the estimation of depth uncertainty. We show that
the extension of the state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular trained depth
estimator Monodepth2 with these two ideas allows us to design a model that
produces the best results in the field in KITTI 2015 and Make3D, closing the

that the number of images used for the knowledge distillation should be small;

the complete orthogonality (at the microscopic level) evolves into the partial
spectral orthogonality between different ESSs at the mesoscopic level. As a

in the delivery of ads across users even when all advertisers bid in a
non-discriminatory manner. We study the design of ad auctions that, given fair
bids, are guaranteed to produce fair outcomes. Following the works of Dwork and
Ilvento (2019) and Chawla et al. (2020), our goal is to design a truthful
auction that satisfies ``individual fairness'' in its outcomes: informally
speaking, users that are similar to each other should obtain similar
allocations of ads. Within this framework we quantify the tradeoff between
social welfare maximization and fairness.
  This work makes two conceptual contributions. First, we express the fairness
constraint as a kind of stability condition: any two users that are assigned
multiplicatively similar values by all the advertisers must receive additively
similar allocations for each advertiser. This value stability constraint is
expressed as a function that maps the multiplicative distance between value
vectors to the maximum allowable $\ell_{\infty}$ distance between the
corresponding allocations. Standard auctions do not satisfy this kind of value
stability.
  Second, we introduce a new class of allocation algorithms called Inverse
Proportional Allocation that achieve a near optimal tradeoff between fairness
and social welfare for a broad and expressive class of value stability
conditions. These allocation algorithms are truthful and prior-free, and
achieve a constant factor approximation to the optimal (unconstrained) social
welfare. In particular, the approximation ratio is independent of the number of
advertisers in the system. In this respect, these allocation algorithms greatly
surpass the guarantees achieved in previous work. We also extend our results to
broader notions of fairness that we call subset fairness.

range of online booking and search services, including jobs, travel, housing,
bridal, dining, beauty, and where each service is among the biggest in Japan,

recent subjective search prototype (OpineDB) developed by Megagon Labs for
Recruit Group. Several components within OpineDB are enhanced to satisfy
production demands, including adding a BERT language model pre-trained on
massive hospitality domain review corpora. We also found that the challenges of
productionizing the system are beyond enhancing the components. In particular,
an important requirement in production-quality systems is to instrument a
proper way of measuring the search quality, which is extremely tricky when the
search results are subjective. This led to the creation of a high-quality
benchmark dataset from scratch, involving over 600 queries by user interviews
and a collection of more than 120,000 query-entity relevancy labels. Also, we
found that the existing search algorithms do not meet the search quality
standard required by production systems. Consequently, we enhanced the ranking
model by fine-tuning several search algorithms and combining them under a
learning-to-rank framework. The model achieves 5%-10% overall precision
improvement and 90+% precision on more than half of the benchmark testing
queries making these queries ready for AB-testing. While some enhancements can
be immediately applied to other verticals, our experience reveals that
benchmarking and fine-tuning ranking algorithms are specific to each domain and

simulation. We randomize the morphological information of SDSS galaxies without
affecting their spatial distribution and compare the mutual information in the
original and randomized datasets. We also divide the galaxy distribution into
smaller subcubes and randomly shuffle them many times keeping the morphological
information of galaxies intact. We compare the mutual information in the
original SDSS data and its shuffled realizations for different shuffling
lengths. Using a t-test, we find that a small but statistically significant (at
99.9% confidence level) mutual information between morphology and environment
exists upto the entire length scale probed. We also conduct another experiment
using mock datasets from a semi-analytic galaxy catalogue where we assign
morphology to galaxies in a controlled manner based on the density at their
locations. The experiment clearly demonstrate that mutual information can
effectively capture the physical correlations between morphology and
environment. Our analysis suggests that physical association between morphology
and environment may extend to much larger length scales than currently believed
and the information theoretic framework presented here, can serve as a
sensitive and useful probe of the assembly bias and large-scale environmental
dependence of galaxy properties.

forced federal and local governments to implement containment measures.
Moreover, the severity of the situation has sparked engagement by both the
research and clinical community with the goal of developing effective
treatments for the disease. This article proposes a time dynamic prediction
model with competing risks for the infected individual and develops a simple
tool for policy makers to compare different strategies in terms of when to
implement the strictest containment measures and how different treatments can
increase or suppress infected cases. Two types of containment strategies are
compared: (1) a constant containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of
citizens for a long period; and (2) an adaptive containment strategy whose
strict level changes across time. We consider how an effective treatment of the
disease can affect the dynamics in a pandemic scenario. For illustration we
consider a region with population 2.8 million and 200 initial infectious cases
assuming a 4% mortality rate compared with a 2% mortality rate if a new drug is
available. Our results show compared with a constant containment strategy,
adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and reduce maximum
daily number of cases. This, along with an effective treatment plan for the
disease can minimize death rate.

PoW into useful work, but they have many limitations, such as narrow

this paper, we introduce AxeChain, which can use the computing power of
blockchain to solve practical problems raised by users without greatly
compromising decentralization or security. AxeChain achieves this by coupling
hard problem solving with PoW mining. We model the security of AxeChain and
derive a balance curve between power utilization and system security. That is,
under the reasonable assumption that the attack power does not exceed 1/3 of
the total power, 1/2 of total power can be safely used to solve practical
problems. We also design a novel incentive model based on the amount of work
involved in problem solving, balancing the interests of both the users and

the thickness of the insulating layer covering the bottom plate tends to zero.
This asymptotic model inherits the dielectric properties of the insulating
layer. It involves the electrostatic potential in the device and the
deformation of the elastic plate defining the geometry of the device. The
electrostatic potential is given by an elliptic equation with mixed boundary
conditions in the possibly non-Lipschitz region between the two plates. The
deformation of the elastic plate is supposed to be a critical point of an
energy functional which, in turn, depends on the electrostatic potential due to
the force exerted by the latter on the elastic plate. The energy functional is
shown to have a minimizer giving the geometry of the device. Moreover, the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is computed and the maximal regularity of
the electrostatic potential is established.

outside Tokyo when production activities that are not essential to citizens'

as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of
27 trillion yen in Japan, or 5.3% of its annual GDP. Although the production
shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the

realistic noise removal for raw noisy videos is rarely studied due to the lack
of noisy-clean pairs for dynamic scenes. Clean video frames for dynamic scenes
cannot be captured with a long-exposure shutter or averaging multi-shots as was
done for static images. In this paper, we solve this problem by creating
motions for controllable objects, such as toys, and capturing each static
moment for multiple times to generate clean video frames. In this way, we
construct a dataset with 55 groups of noisy-clean videos with ISO values
ranging from 1600 to 25600. To our knowledge, this is the first dynamic video
dataset with noisy-clean pairs. Correspondingly, we propose a raw video
denoising network (RViDeNet) by exploring the temporal, spatial, and channel
correlations of video frames. Since the raw video has Bayer patterns, we pack
it into four sub-sequences, i.e RGBG sequences, which are denoised by the
proposed RViDeNet separately and finally fused into a clean video. In addition,
our network not only outputs a raw denoising result, but also the sRGB result
by going through an image signal processing (ISP) module, which enables users
to generate the sRGB result with their favourite ISPs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art video and raw image
denoising algorithms on both indoor and outdoor videos.

concentration of intense 3D research. However, existing point-based methods
usually are not adequate to extract the local features and the spatial pattern
of a point cloud for further shape understanding. This paper presents an
end-to-end framework, SK-Net, to jointly optimize the inference of spatial
keypoint with the learning of feature representation of a point cloud for a
specific point cloud task. One key process of SK-Net is the generation of
spatial keypoints (Skeypoints). It is jointly conducted by two proposed
regulating losses and a task objective function without knowledge of Skeypoint
location annotations and proposals. Specifically, our Skeypoints are not
sensitive to the location consistency but are acutely aware of shape. Another
key process of SK-Net is the extraction of the local structure of Skeypoints
(detail feature) and the local spatial pattern of normalized Skeypoints
(pattern feature). This process generates a comprehensive representation,
pattern-detail (PD) feature, which comprises the local detail information of a
point cloud and reveals its spatial pattern through the part district
reconstruction on normalized Skeypoints. Consequently, our network is prompted
to effectively understand the correlation between different regions of a point
cloud and integrate contextual information of the point cloud. In point cloud
tasks, such as classification and segmentation, our proposed method performs
better than or comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches. We also present
an ablation study to demonstrate the advantages of SK-Net.

likely origin of the observed correlation between pulse fraction and X-ray
photon energy. Pulsing is suppressed in systems with the neutron-star spin
closely aligned to the inner disc, explaining why some ULXs show cyclotron
features indicating strong magnetic fields, but do not pulse. We suggest that
alignment (or conceivably, field suppression through accretion) generally
occurs within a fairly short fraction of the ULX lifetime, so that most
neutron-star ULXs become unpulsed. As a result we further suggest that almost
all ULXs actually have neutron-star accretors, rather than black holes or white

typical top-down pipeline concentrates on two key issues: 1) how to effectively
model the intrinsic interaction between semantic segmentation and instance
segmentation, and 2) how to properly handle occlusion for panoptic
segmentation. Intuitively, the complementarity between semantic segmentation
and instance segmentation can be leveraged to improve the performance. Besides,
we notice that using detection/mask scores is insufficient for resolving the
occlusion problem. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel deep
panoptic segmentation scheme based on a bidirectional learning pipeline.
Moreover, we introduce a plug-and-play occlusion handling algorithm to deal
with the occlusion between different object instances. The experimental results

virtue of feedbacks and are thought to be co-eval across the Hubble time. This
relation is highlighted by an approximate proportionality between the BH mass
$M_\bullet$ and the mass of a stellar bulge $M_\ast$ of the host galaxy.
However, a large spread of the ratio $M_\bullet/M_\ast$ and a considerable
excess of BH mass at redshifts $z\sim8$, indicate that the coevolution of
central massive BHs and stellar populations in host galaxies may have
experienced variations in its intensity. These issues require a robust
determination of the relevant masses (BH, stars and gas), which is difficult in
the case of distant high-redshift galaxies that are unresolved. In this paper,
we seek to identify spectral diagnostics that may tell us about the relative
masses of the BH, the gas mass and stellar mass. We consider general features
of SEDs of galaxies that harbour growing massive BHs, forming stars and
interstellar/circumgalactic gas. We focus on observational manifestations of
possible predominances or intermittent variations in evolutionary episodes of
growing massive BHs and forming stellar populations. We consider simplified
scenarios for star formation and massive BHs growth, and simple models for
chemical composition of gas, for dust free gas as well as for gas with dust
mass fraction of $1/3$ of the metal content. We argue that wideband
multi-frequency observations (X-ray to submillimeter) of the composite emission
spectra of growing BH, stellar population and nebular emission of interstellar
gas are sufficient to infer their masses.

observed via near-equilibrium compression of silicon. In this study, confocal
Raman micro-spectroscopy and Raman imaging of arrays of microexplosions have
been conducted to search for Raman signatures of these novel allotropes of
silicon. A microexplosion is generated at the interface between a thick silicon
dioxide confinement layer and underlying silicon. It is characterised by a void
at the interface above a region of compressed silicon. Raman data show a rich
assembly of silicon phases within the modified silicon. Residual stresses up to
4.5 GPa in the modifications have been determined from the shift in the main
diamond-cubic Si Raman peak. The computed Raman spectra for a number of Si
allotropes show reasonable agreement with the experimental spectra. Two
structurally similar tetragonal phases of silicon (the rhombohedral r8 and the
body-centred bc8) phases as well as recently identified bt8-Si are all highly
likely to be contained in Raman spectra from many laser-modified sites.
Although the st12-Si phase, previously observed in our electron diffraction
studies of the highly compressively stressed laser-modified regions, was not
reliably identified from Raman data, we suggest this could be due to the
possible difference in residual stress level in the sites analysed by the
electron diffraction and Raman spectra. Several other unidentified Raman peaks
were observed, suggesting the presence of other unknown silicon phases. All of
these silicon phases are expected to have attractive semiconducting properties
including narrow band gap that open up novel applications.

irradiation, radiative region develops on top of the convective region.
Internal gravity waves are launched at the radiative-convective boundaries

angular momentum transport. By separating the gravitational and thermal forcing
terms, we identify the thermal effects for increasing the angular momentum
transport. For the low frequency (in the co-rotating frame with planets)
prograde (retrograde) tidal frequency, the angular momentum flux is positive
(negative). The tidal interactions tends to drive the planet to the synchronous
state. We find that the angular momentum transport associated with the internal
gravity wave is very sensitive to relative position between the RCB and the
penetration depth of the thermal forcing. If the RCB is in the vicinity of the
thermal forcing penetration depth, even with small amplitude thermal forcing,
the thermally driven angular momentum flux could be much larger than the flux
induced by gravitational forcing. The thermally enhanced torque could drive the
planet to the synchronous state in as short as a few $10^4$ years.

these penalties to its data structure, encoding, and addressing method. We then
run controlled experiments to illustrate how severe these problems can be.
Indeed, performance gain of one to two orders of magnitude can be achieved
simply by reformatting WARC files into Parquet or Avro formats. While these

correct predictions from out-of-distribution (OoD) samples is a major hindrance
to the application of ML in critical applications. Until the generalization
ability of ML methods is improved it is necessary to keep humans in the loop.
The need for human supervision can only be reduced if it is possible to
determining a level of confidence in predictions, which can be used to either
ask for human assistance or to abstain from making predictions. We show that
feature space distance is a meaningful measure that can provide confidence in
predictions. The distance between unseen samples and nearby training samples
proves to be correlated to the prediction error of unseen samples. Depending on
the acceptable degree of error, predictions can either be trusted or rejected
based on the distance to training samples. %Additionally, a novelty threshold
can be used to decide whether a sample is worth adding to the training set.
This enables earlier and safer deployment of models in critical applications
and is vital for deploying models under ever-changing conditions.

actions with the decomposition property. For instance, any partial action of a
finite group is an iterated extension of decomposable systems.
  Partial actions with the decomposition property are always globalizable and
amenable, regardless of the acting group, and their globalization can be
explicitly described in terms of certain global sub-systems. A direct
computation of their crossed products is also carried out. We show that partial
actions with the decomposition property behave in many ways like global actions
of finite groups (even when the acting group is infinite), which makes their
study particularly accessible. For example, there exists a canonical faithful
conditional expectation onto the fixed point algebra, which is moreover a
corner in the crossed product in a natural way. (Both of these facts are in
general false for partial actions of finite groups.) As an application, we show
that freeness of a topological partial action with the decomposition property
is equivalent to its fixed point algebra being Morita equivalent to its crossed
product. We also show by example that this fails for general partial actions of
finite groups.

  Prior","Accepted by CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of the Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task is to simultaneously
predict a completed 3D voxel representation of volumetric occupancy and
semantic labels of objects in the scene from a single-view observation. Since
the computational cost generally increases explosively along with the growth of
voxel resolution, most current state-of-the-arts have to tailor their framework
into a low-resolution representation with the sacrifice of detail prediction.
Thus, voxel resolution becomes one of the crucial difficulties that lead to the
performance bottleneck.
  In this paper, we propose to devise a new geometry-based strategy to embed
depth information with low-resolution voxel representation, which could still
be able to encode sufficient geometric information, e.g., room layout, object's
sizes and shapes, to infer the invisible areas of the scene with well
structure-preserving details. To this end, we first propose a novel 3D
sketch-aware feature embedding to explicitly encode geometric information
effectively and efficiently. With the 3D sketch in hand, we further devise a
simple yet effective semantic scene completion framework that incorporates a
light-weight 3D Sketch Hallucination module to guide the inference of occupancy
and the semantic labels via a semi-supervised structure prior learning
strategy. We demonstrate that our proposed geometric embedding works better
than the depth feature learning from habitual SSC frameworks. Our final model
surpasses state-of-the-arts consistently on three public benchmarks, which only
requires 3D volumes of 60 x 36 x 60 resolution for both input and output. The

sends parameter updates (gradients) based on local data. This protocol has been
designed not only to train neural networks data-efficiently, but also to
provide privacy benefits for users, as their input data remains on device and
only parameter gradients are shared. But how secure is sharing parameter
gradients? Previous attacks have provided a false sense of security, by
succeeding only in contrived settings - even for a single image. However, by
exploiting a magnitude-invariant loss along with optimization strategies based
on adversarial attacks, we show that is is actually possible to faithfully
reconstruct images at high resolution from the knowledge of their parameter
gradients, and demonstrate that such a break of privacy is possible even for
trained deep networks. We analyze the effects of architecture as well as
parameters on the difficulty of reconstructing an input image and prove that
any input to a fully connected layer can be reconstructed analytically
independent of the remaining architecture. Finally we discuss settings
encountered in practice and show that even averaging gradients over several
iterations or several images does not protect the user's privacy in federated

hierarchical and layerwise features sharing/fusing scheme across them. This
enables us to design a novel and general task-agnostic search space, which
inserts cross-task edges (i.e., feature fusion connections) into fixed
single-task network backbones. Moreover, we also propose a novel single-shot
gradient-based search algorithm that closes the performance gap between the
searched architectures and the final evaluation architecture. This is realized
with a minimum entropy regularization on the architecture weights during the
search phase, which makes the architecture weights converge to near-discrete
values and therefore achieves a single model. As a result, our searched model
can be directly used for evaluation without (re-)training from scratch. We
perform extensive experiments using different single-task backbones on various

In this article we develop consistent 3-point statistics with tensor modes for
all possible correlators (auto and mixed) for NBD initial states in the light

Theory of inflation. We also construct the templates of the corresponding
nonlinearity parameters $f_{NL}$ for different shapes of relevance and
investigate if any of the 3-point correlators could be of interest for future

technology will cover the pseudo-rapidity region of $2.4<|\eta|<4.0$ with two
end caps on each side and a total area of 6.4 $m^2$. The timing performance can
be improved by implanting an internal gain layer that can produce signal with a
fast rising edge, which improve significantly the signal-to-noise ratio. The
required average timing resolution per track for a minimum-ionising particle is
30 ps at the start and 50 ps at the end of the HL-LHC operation. This is
achieved with several layers of LGAD. The innermost region of the detector
would accumulate a 1 MeV-neutron equivalent fluence up to $2.5 \times 10^{15}
cm^{-2}$ before being replaced during the scheduled shutdowns. The addition of
this new detector is expected to play an important role in the mitigation of
high pile-up at the HL-LHC. The layout and performance of the various versions
of LGAD prototypes produced by Hamamatsu (HPK) have been studied by the ATLAS
Collaboration. The breakdown voltages, depletion voltages, inter-pad gaps,
collected charge as well as the time resolution have been measured and the
production yield of large size sensors has been evaluated.

the forces and charging behaviour of conducting spheroids under a variety of
conditions and benchmarked against previous numerical results. The floating
potentials of spheres in isothermal, collisionless, hydrogen plasmas as a
function of magnetic field strength and size relative to Debye length are
studied using DiMPl and compared with new results from the N-body tree code

simulations are similar, identifying a small range at modest ion magnetisation
parameters over which the electron current is reduced relative to the ion
current. The potential as a function of magnetic field strength is found to be
relatively insensitive to dust size for dust smaller than the Debye length. The
potential of large dust is found to depend less strongly on flow speed for
modest magnetic field strengths and to decrease with increasing flow speed in
the presence of strong magnetic fields for smaller dust. A semi-empirical model
for the potential of small dust in a collisionless plasma as a function of

acquisition of volumetric dynamic MR data, in a synchronous and controlled way.
Since NMES is a potent resource for rehabilitation, MRI synchronized with NMES
presents a valuable validation tool. Our aim was to show how minimal
NMES-induced muscle contraction characterization, as evaluated through phase
contrast MRI, differs between senior and young volunteers. $\textbf{Materials
and Methods}$ Simultaneous NMES of the quadriceps muscle and phase contrast
imaging were applied at 3T to 11 senior (75 $\pm$ 3 years) and 6 young
volunteers (29 $\pm$ 7 years). A current sufficient to induce muscle twitch
without knee extension was applied to both groups. $\textbf{Results}$ Strain
vectors were extracted from the velocity fields and strain datasets were
compared with non-parametric tests and descriptive statistics. Strain values
were noticeably different between both groups at both current intensities and
significant differences were observed in the regions of interest between the
two electrodes. $\textbf{Discussion}$ In conclusion, NMES-synchronized MRI
could be successfully applied in senior volunteers with strain results clearly
different from the younger volunteers. Also, differences within the senior
group were detected both in the magnitude of strain and in the position of
maximum strain pixels.

of fundamental and growing commercial interest. Although many different caching
algorithms are in use today, the fundamental performance limits of network
caching algorithms from an online learning point-of-view remain poorly
understood to date. In this paper, we resolve this question in the following
two settings: (1) a single user connected to a single cache, and (2) a set of
users and a set of caches interconnected through a bipartite network. Recently,
an online gradient-based coded caching policy was shown to enjoy sub-linear
regret. However, due to the lack of known regret lower bounds, the question of
the optimality of the proposed policy was left open. In this paper, we settle
this question by deriving tight non-asymptotic regret lower bounds in both of
the above settings. In addition to that, we propose a new
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader-based uncoded caching policy with near-optimal
regret. Technically, the lower-bounds are obtained by relating the online
caching problem to the classic probabilistic paradigm of balls-into-bins. Our
proofs make extensive use of a new result on the expected load in the most
populated half of the bins, which might also be of independent interest. We
evaluate the performance of the caching policies by experimenting with the
popular MovieLens dataset and conclude the paper with design recommendations
and a list of open problems.

of all classes to be seen in a timely manner as long as the system is stable.
We demonstrate however that if accumulating priorities are used in the heavy

priorities are applied, then one can ensure that the highest-priority patients

supernovae (SNe IIb), and find that extra mass removal by jets increases the
parameter space for the formation of SNe IIb in this channel. To explore the
role of eccentricity and the extra mass removal by jets we use the stellar
evolutionary code MESA binary. The initial primary and secondary masses are
M1i=15Mo and M2i=2.5Mo. We examine initial semi-major axes of 600-1000Ro, and
eccentricities of e=0-0.9. Both Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and mass removal by
jets, followed by a wind, leave a hydrogen mass in the exploding star of
M(H,f)=0.05Mo, compatible with a SN IIb progenitor. When the initial orbit is
not circular the final orbit might have a very high eccentricity. In many
cases, with and without the extra mass removal by jets, the system can enter a
common envelope evolution (CEE) phase, and then gets out from it. For some
ranges of eccentricities the jets are more efficient in preventing the CEE.
Despite the large uncertainties, extra mass removal by jets substantially
increases the likelihood of the system to get out from a CEE. This strengthens
earlier conclusions for circular orbits. In some cases RLOF alone, without mass
removal by jets, can form SN IIb progenitors. We estimate that the extra mass
removal by jets in the GEE channel increases the number of progenitors relative
to that by RLOF alone by about a factor of two.

constrain the progenitor and explosion models of collapsing stars. In the light

events during a year. In the current study, we examine the analytic formulae
derived by Shussman et al. (2016). We use four red supergiant models from their
study, while running explosions with the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA.
We conclude that there is a good agreement between analytic and numerical
approaches for bolometric luminosity and colour temperature during SBO. The
analytic formulae for the SBO signal based on the global supernova parameters
can be used instead of running time-consuming numerical simulations. We define
spectral range where analytic formulae for the SBO spectra are valid. We
provide improved analytical expression for the SBO spectral energy
distribution. We confirm dependence of colour temperature on radius derived by

progenitor radius. Additionally we show the prediction for the SBO signal from

preserve not only the confidentiality, integrity and freshness of their data

  Zero-Shot Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) learns models for recognizing new classes. One of
the main challenges in ZSL is the domain discrepancy caused by the category
inconsistency between training and testing data. Domain adaptation is the most
intuitive way to address this challenge. However, existing domain adaptation
techniques cannot be directly applied into ZSL due to the disjoint label space
between source and target domains. This work proposes the Transferrable
Semantic-Visual Relation (TSVR) approach towards transductive ZSL. TSVR
redefines image recognition as predicting the similarity/dissimilarity labels
for semantic-visual fusions consisting of class attributes and visual features.
After the above transformation, the source and target domains can have the same
label space, which hence enables to quantify domain discrepancy. For the
redefined problem, the number of similar semantic-visual pairs is significantly
smaller than that of dissimilar ones. To this end, we further propose to use
Domain-Specific Batch Normalization to align the domain discrepancy.

mean-performance, then there exists a sharp-restart protocol that performs as
good or better. This paper, the first of a duo, presents a comprehensive
mean-performance analysis of sharp restart. Using statistical methods, the

improves or worsens mean-performance, i.e., decreases or increases mean
first-passage/completion times. These criteria are akin to those recently
discovered for the most widely applied restart protocols -- ""exponential

exponential-restart criteria cover only the case of slow timers, the
sharp-restart criteria established here further cover the cases of fast,
critical, and general timers; moreover, the latter criteria address the very

scenario for which: sharp restart improves mean-performance, whereas
exponential restart worsens mean-performance. The potency of the novel results

As a countermeasure, Android malware detection systems are occasionally
implemented. However, these systems are often vulnerable to \emph{evasion
attacks}, in which an adversary manipulates malicious instances so that they
are misidentified as benign. In this paper, we launch various innovative
evasion attacks against several Android malware detection systems. The
vulnerability inherent to all of these systems is that they are part of
Androguard~\cite{desnos2011androguard}, a popular open source library used in
Android malware detection systems. Some of the detection systems decrease to a
0\% detection rate after the attack. Therefore, the use of open source
libraries in malware detection systems calls for caution.
  In addition, we present a novel evaluation scheme for evasion attack
generation that exploits the weak spots of known Android malware detection
systems. In so doing, we evaluate the functionality and maliciousness of the
manipulated instances created by our evasion attacks. We found variations in
both the maliciousness and functionality tests of our manipulated apps. We show
that non-functional apps, while considered malicious, do not threaten users and
are thus useless from an attacker's point of view. We conclude that evasion
attacks must be assessed for both functionality and maliciousness to evaluate
their impact, a step which is far from commonplace today.

channel fading, noise and interference, the signal arriving at the receiver
will be distorted. The receiver needs to recover the original information from
the distorted signal. In this paper, we propose a new receiver model, namely
DeepReceiver, that uses a deep neural network to replace the traditional
receiver's entire information recovery process. We design a one-dimensional
convolution DenseNet (1D-Conv-DenseNet) structure, in which global pooling is
used to improve the adaptability of the network to different input signal
lengths. Multiple binary classifiers are used at the final classification layer
to achieve multi-bit information stream recovery. We also exploit the
DeepReceiver for unified blind reception of multiple modulation and coding
schemes (MCSs) by including signal samples of corresponding MCSs in the
training set. Simulation results show that the proposed DeepReceiver performs
better than traditional step-by-step serial hard decision receiver in terms of
bit error rate under the influence of various factors such as noise, RF
impairments, multipath fading, cochannel interference, dynamic environment, and
unified reception of multiple MCSs.

between branes, which are not anymore BPS, in such a way that the weak gravity

tension of the branes is reduced by one-loop quantum effects, so that there are
long-range repulsive forces. The correlation of the non-vanishing brane
potential with the presence of a running modulus and of possible D branes bound
states nicely connects to other swampland conjectures. For magnetized branes in
type II strings, we check that non-BPS branes experience a long-range repulsion

stringy objects in the discussion makes it compelling to further understand
swampland conjectures in strings with broken SUSY, let alone their

availability of accurate kinetics data, in particular, for surface processes.
We study the sensitivity of gas-grain chemical models to the energy barrier Ea
of the important surface reaction between some of the most abundant species: C
and H2 (surface C + surface H2 = surface CH2). We used the gas-grain code
ALCHEMIC to model the time-dependent chemical evolution over a 2D grid of
densities (nH: 10^{3} - 10^{12}cm^{-3}) and temperatures (T: 10 - 300 K),
assuming UV-dark (Av = 20 mag) and partly UV-irradiated (Av = 3 mag) conditions
that are typical of the dense interstellar medium. We considered two values for
the energy barrier of the surface reaction, Ea = 2500 K (as originally
implemented in the networks) and Ea = 0 K (as measured in the laboratory and
computed by quantum chemistry simulations). We find that if the C + H2 = CH2
surface reaction is barrierless, a more rapid conversion of the surface carbon
atoms into methane ice occurs. Overproduction of the CHn hydrocarbon ices
affects the surface formation of more complex hydrocarbons, cyanides and
nitriles, and CS-bearing species at low temperatures < 10-15 K. The surface
hydrogenation of CO and hence the synthesis of complex (organic) molecules
become affected as well. As a result, important species whose abundances may
change by more than a factor of two at 1 Myr include atomic carbon, small
mono-carbonic (C1) and di-carbonic (C2) hydrocarbons, CO2, CN, HCN, HNC, HNCO,
CS, H2CO, H2CS, CH2CO, and CH3OH (in either gas and/or ice). The abundances of
key species, CO, H2O, and N2 as well as O, HCO+, N2H+, NH3, NO, and most of the
S-bearing molecules, remain almost unaffected. Further accurate laboratory
measurements and quantum chemical calculations of the surface reaction barriers
will be crucial to improve the accuracy of astrochemical models.

environmental strain of the individual actors, but it is dependent on how well

manage or optimize such networks remains an open issue. In this paper we put
forward a simulation model of by-product flow between industrial actors. The
goal is to introduce a method for modelling symbiotic exchanges from a macro
perspective. The model takes into account the effect of two main mechanisms on
a multi-objective optimization of symbiotic processes. First it allows us to
study the effect of geographical properties of the economic system, said
differently, where actors are divided in space. Second, it allows us to study
the effect of clustering complementary actors together as a function of
distance, by means of a spatial correlation between the actors' by-products.
Our simulations unveil patterns that are relevant for macro-level policy.
First, our results show that the geographical properties are an important
factor for the macro performance of symbiotic processes. Second, spatial
correlations, which can be interpreted as planned clusters such as
Eco-industrial parks, can lead to a very effective macro performance, but only
if these are strictly implemented. Finally, we provide a proof of concept by
comparing the model to real world data from the European Pollutant Release and

triangles and quadrilaterals, suitable for FEM-based or isogeometric analysis.
In this context, a mesh is considered to be a partition of a planar polygonal
domain into triangles and/or quadrilaterals. The proposed space combines the
Argyris triangle, cf. (Argyris, Fried, Scharpf; 1968), with the $C^1$
quadrilateral element introduced in (Brenner, Sung; 2005) and (Kapl, Sangalli,
Takacs; 2019) for polynomial degrees $p\geq 5$. The space is assumed to be
$C^2$ at all vertices and $C^1$ across edges, and the splines are uniquely
determined by $C^2$-data at the vertices, values and normal derivatives at
chosen points on the edges, and values at some additional points in the
interior of the elements.
  The motivation for combining the Argyris triangle element with a recent $C^1$
quadrilateral construction, inspired by isogeometric analysis, is two-fold: on
one hand, the ability to connect triangle and quadrilateral finite elements in
a $C^1$ fashion is non-trivial and of theoretical interest. We provide not only
approximation error bounds but also numerical tests verifying the results. On
the other hand, the construction facilitates the meshing process by allowing
more flexibility while remaining $C^1$ everywhere. This is for instance
relevant when trimming of tensor-product B-splines is performed.
  In the presented construction we assume to have (bi)linear element mappings
and piecewise polynomial function spaces of arbitrary degree $p\geq 5$. The
basis is simple to implement and the obtained results are optimal with respect
to the mesh size for $L^\infty$, $L^2$ as well as Sobolev norms $H^1$ and

discriminative visual patterns while overlooking the holistic object structure.
Though important, structure modeling usually requires significant manual
annotations and therefore is labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose to
""look into object"" (explicitly yet intrinsically model the object structure)
through incorporating self-supervisions into the traditional framework. We show
the recognition backbone can be substantially enhanced for more robust
representation learning, without any cost of extra annotation and inference
speed. Specifically, we first propose an object-extent learning module for
localizing the object according to the visual patterns shared among the
instances in the same category. We then design a spatial context learning
module for modeling the internal structures of the object, through predicting
the relative positions within the extent. These two modules can be easily
plugged into any backbone networks during training and detached at inference
time. Extensive experiments show that our look-into-object approach (LIO)
achieves large performance gain on a number of benchmarks, including generic
object recognition (ImageNet) and fine-grained object recognition tasks (CUB,
Cars, Aircraft). We also show that this learning paradigm is highly
generalizable to other tasks such as object detection and segmentation (MS
COCO). Project page: https://github.com/JDAI-CV/LIO.

stars have the strongest magnetic fields of any main-sequence stars. Some have
been shown to have rotation periods of months to centuries. The astrophysical
cause of their slow rotation -- the braking mechanism -- is not known with

periods. The magnetic Ap stars have long-lived spots that allow precise
determination of their rotation periods. We show that most Ap stars with TESS

than a TESS sector of 27 d. We find 60 Ap stars in the southern ecliptic
hemisphere TESS data with no rotational variability, of which at most a few can
be pole-on, and six likely have nearly aligned magnetic and rotation axes. Of
the other 54, 31 were previously known to have long rotation periods or low
projected equatorial velocities, which proves our technique; 23 are new

dependence of N(EF) for BaRh2P2, on the other hand, is monotonic; decreasing
with increasing pressure up to 15 GPa and saturating at higher pressure.
Pressure dependence of N(EF) is reflected in the pressure dependent
superconducting transition temperature. The Debye temperature increases with
increasing pressure. The variation of the optical parameters (real and

absorption coefficient, and loss function) with photon energy show metallic
behavior complementing the features of electronic band structure calculations.
The absorption spectra of BaNi2P2 show strong optical absorption in the

classification in which textual units are assigned to an emotion from a
predefined inventory, for instance following the fundamental emotion classes
proposed by Paul Ekman (fear, joy, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise) or Robert
Plutchik (adding trust, anticipation). This approach ignores existing
psychological theories to some degree, which provide explanations regarding the
perception of events. For instance, the description that somebody discovers a
snake is associated with fear, based on the appraisal as being an unpleasant
and non-controllable situation. This emotion reconstruction is even possible
without having access to explicit reports of a subjective feeling (for instance
expressing this with the words ""I am afraid.""). Automatic classification
approaches therefore need to learn properties of events as latent variables
(for instance that the uncertainty and the mental or physical effort associated
with the encounter of a snake leads to fear). With this paper, we propose to
make such interpretations of events explicit, following theories of cognitive
appraisal of events, and show their potential for emotion classification when
being encoded in classification models. Our results show that high quality
appraisal dimension assignments in event descriptions lead to an improvement in
the classification of discrete emotion categories. We make our corpus of
appraisal-annotated emotion-associated event descriptions publicly available.

connection to classic SSMs. The use of deep SSMs as a black-box identification
model can describe a wide range of dynamics due to the flexibility of deep
neural networks. Additionally, the probabilistic nature of the model class
allows the uncertainty of the system to be modelled. In this work a deep SSM
class and its parameter learning algorithm are explained in an effort to extend
the toolbox of nonlinear identification methods with a deep learning based
method. Six recent deep SSMs are evaluated in a first unified implementation on
nonlinear system identification benchmarks.

surface in terms of depth and flatness can affect the reaction dynamics. We
formulate depth and flatness in the context of one and two degree-of-freedom
(DOF) Hamiltonian normal form for the saddle-node bifurcation and quantify
their influence on chemical reaction dynamics. In a recent work,
Garc\'ia-Garrido, Naik, and Wiggins illustrated how changing the well-depth of
a potential energy surface (PES) can lead to a saddle-node bifurcation. They
have shown how the geometry of cylindrical manifolds associated with the rank-1
saddle changes en route to the saddle-node bifurcation. Using the formulation
presented here, we show how changes in the parameters of the potential energy
control the depth and flatness and show their role in the quantitative measures
of a chemical reaction. We quantify this role of the depth and flatness by
calculating the ratio of the bottleneck-width and well-width, reaction
probability (also known as transition fraction or population fraction), gap
time (or first passage time) distribution, and directional flux through the
dividing surface (DS) for small to high values of total energy. The results
obtained for these quantitative measures are in agreement with the qualitative
understanding of the reaction dynamics.

to the pursuit of quantum optics for decades. Traditionally, this has been done
by coupling emitters, typically natural atoms and ions, to quantized
electromagnetic fields in optical and microwave cavities. In these systems, the
emitter is approximated as an idealized dipole, as its physical size is orders
of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of light. Recently, artificial atoms
made from superconducting circuits have enabled new frontiers in light-matter
coupling, including the study of ""giant"" atoms which cannot be approximated as
simple dipoles. Here, we explore a new implementation of a giant artificial
atom, formed from a transmon qubit coupled to propagating microwaves at
multiple points along an open transmission line. The nature of this coupling
allows the qubit radiation field to interfere with itself leading to some
striking giant-atom effects. For instance, we observe strong
frequency-dependent couplings of the qubit energy levels to the electromagnetic
modes of the transmission line. Combined with the ability to in situ tune the
qubit energy levels, we show that we can modify the relative coupling rates of
multiple qubit transitions by more than an order of magnitude. By doing so, we
engineer a metastable excited state, allowing us to operate the giant transmon
as an effective lambda system where we clearly demonstrate electromagnetically
induced transparency.

different frequencies, the inter-cavity crosstalk is significantly reduced.
Since only one coupler qutrit is used, the circuit resources is minimized. The
entanglement transfer is completed with a single-step operation only, thus this
proposal is quite simple. The third energy level of the coupler qutrit is not
populated during the state transfer, therefore decoherence from the higher
energy level is greatly suppressed. Our numerical simulations show that
high-fidelity transfer of two-cqubit entangled states from two transmission
line resonators to the other two transmission line resonators is feasible with
current circuit QED technology. This proposal is universal and can be applied
to accomplish the same task in a wide range of physical systems, such as four
microwave or optical cavities, which are coupled to a natural or artificial
three-level atom.

Gradual Freeze-out of an Optimal Estimation via Optimization of Parameter
Quantification - GFOOEOPQ, is designed for the socially awkward. The socially
awkward among us possess little instinct for pulling off such a maneuver, and
may benefit from a machine to do it for us. The method rests upon Bayes'
Theorem, where the probability of a future model state depends on current
knowledge of the model. Here, model state vectors are party attendees, and the
future event of interest is their disposition toward us at times following the
party. We want these dispositions to be favorable. To this end, we first
interact so as to make favorable impressions, or at least ensure that these
people remember having seen us there. Then we identify the exit that minimizes
the chance that anyone notes how early we high-tailed it. Now, poorly-resolved
estimates will correspond to degenerate solutions. As noted, we possess no
instinct to identify a global optimum by ourselves. This can have disastrous
consequences. For this reason, GFOOEOPQ employs annealing to iteratively home
in on this optimum. The method is illustrated via a simulated event hosted by
someone in the physics department (I am not sure who), in a two-bedroom
apartment on the fifth floor of an elevator building in Manhattan, with viable
Exit parameters: front door, side door to a stairwell, fire escape, and a

qubits are generated by using N-group qutrits placed in the N cavities. Here,
""qutrit"" refers to a three-level quantum system with the two lowest levels

necessary for the GHZ state creation. This proposal does not depend on the
architecture of the cavity-based quantum network and the way for coupling the

states are prepared deterministically because no measurement on the states of
qutrits or cavities is needed. In addition, the third energy level of the
qutrits during the entire operation is virtually excited and thus decoherence

motivated us to consider their bodies (a bigger context) to analyze in order to
recognize the characters. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the
bodies of $Mary$ and $Gabriel$ are able to learn person related features and
ultimately improve the performance of character recognition. We introduce a new
technique that generates more data with similar styles, effectively creating
data in the similar domain. We present experiments and analysis on three
different models and show that the model trained on domain related data gives
the best performance for recognizing character. Additionally, we analyze the

lower working-speed condition but less capable at higher transport velocities.
To enhance overall efficiency, we have improved the powertrain design by
combining a hydrostatic transmission with a dual-clutch transmission (DCT).
Compared with other mechanical gearboxes, the DCT avoids the interruption of
torque transmission in the process of shifting without sacrificing more
transmission efficiency. However, there are some problems of unstable torque
transmission during the shifting process, and an excessive torque drop
occurring at the end of the gear shift, which result in a poor drive comfort.
To enhance the performance of the novel structural possibility of powertrain
design, we designed a novel control strategy for the motor torque and the
clutch torques during the shifting process. The controller's task is tracking
the target drive torque and completing the gear shift as quickly as possible
with acceptable smoothness requirements. In the process of the controller
design, a specific control algorithm is firstly designed for a 10 ton wheel
loader. The model-based simulation has validated the control effect. As a
result, the control strategy employing clutch and motor torque control to
achieve a smooth shifting process is feasible since drive torque is well
tracked, and highly dynamical actuators are not required. Furthermore, only two
calibration parameters are designed to adjust the control performance
systematically. The novel control strategy is generalized for other mobile
machines with different sizes.

performance of automated vehicles (AVs) without communication capabilities,
especially in situations when the vehicles (or agents) need to be cooperative
to accomplish their maneuver. Lane change maneuvers in dense traffic, e.g., are
very challenging for non-connected AVs. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
holistic distributed lane change control scheme for CAVs which relies on
vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The originally centralized optimal control
problem is embedded into a consensus-based Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers framework to solve it in a distributed receding horizon fashion.
Although agent dynamics render the underlying optimal control problem
nonconvex, we propose a problem reformulation that allows to derive convergence
guarantees. In the distributed setting, every agent needs to solve a nonlinear
program (NLP) locally. To obtain a real-time solution of the local NLPs, we
utilize the optimization engine OpEn which implements the proximal averaged
Newton method for optimal control (PANOC). Simulation results prove the
efficacy and real-time capability of our approach.

developed does not require the construction of the reachability graph and has

develop the theory of categorical polynomial entropy, refining the categorical

by showing that for an automorphism of a smooth projective variety, the

hSBM topics with sentiment analysis. The feature spaces are optimized using the
recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) strategy.
  In our experiments we investigate whether there is a characteristic change in
the topics distribution or sentiment features before or after micro-events take
place and we thoroughly evaluate the capacity of each variant of our analysis
pipeline to detect micro-events. Additionally, we perform a detailed
statistical analysis of the models, including influential cases, variance
inflation factors, validation of the linearity assumption, pseudo R squared

micro-event detection, we design a method for generating micro-event synthetic

identify the micro-event detectability threshold for each of the evaluated

problems in the streaming literature do not admit sublinear-space deterministic
algorithms; on the other hand, classical space-efficient randomized algorithms
for these problems are generally not adversarially robust. This raises the
natural question of whether there exist efficient adversarially robust
(randomized) streaming algorithms for these problems.
  In this work, we show that the answer is positive for various important
streaming problems in the insertion-only model, including distinct elements and
more generally $F_p$-estimation, $F_p$-heavy hitters, entropy estimation, and
others. For all of these problems, we develop adversarially robust
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms whose required space matches that of
the best known non-robust algorithms up to a $\text{poly}(\log n,
1/\varepsilon)$ multiplicative factor (and in some cases even up to a constant
factor). Towards this end, we develop several generic tools allowing one to
efficiently transform a non-robust streaming algorithm into a robust one in
various scenarios.

annotating each frame in a video is cumbersome and costly. Weakly supervised

video only the list of actions is given that occur in the video, but not when,
how often, and in which order they occur. In order to address this task, we
propose an approach that can be trained end-to-end on such data. The approach
divides the video into smaller temporal regions and predicts for each region
the action label and its length. In addition, the network estimates the action
labels for each frame. By measuring how consistent the frame-wise predictions
are with respect to the temporal regions and the annotated action labels, the
network learns to divide a video into class-consistent regions. We evaluate our
approach on three datasets where the approach achieves state-of-the-art

vision navigates to a destination given natural language instructions. The act
of manually annotating these instructions is timely and expensive, such that
many existing approaches automatically generate additional samples to improve
agent performance. However, these approaches still have difficulty generalizing
their performance to new environments. In this work, we investigate the popular
Room-to-Room (R2R) VLN benchmark and discover that what is important is not
only the amount of data you synthesize, but also how you do it. We find that
shortest path sampling, which is used by both the R2R benchmark and existing
augmentation methods, encode biases in the action space of the agent which we
dub as action priors. We then show that these action priors offer one
explanation toward the poor generalization of existing works. To mitigate such
priors, we propose a path sampling method based on random walks to augment the

generalize better to unknown environments compared to the baseline,
significantly improving model performance in the process.

besides the attractive interaction, the repulsive interaction can also dominate
among the microstructures for the small black hole with high temperature in a
charged or neutral black hole system. This is quite different from the
five-dimensional neutral black hole, for which only dominant attractive
interaction can be found. The critical behaviors of the normalized scalar

the scalability of existing EV charging control paradigms are limited by either
the number of EVs or the distribution network dimension, largely impairing EVs'

a latent space and a generator that generates images from vectors in the latent
space. Unlike most recent works, which rely on access to large amounts of
unlabeled data, GLICO does not require access to any additional data other than
the small set of labeled points. In fact, GLICO learns to synthesize completely
new samples for every class using as little as 5 or 10 examples per class, with
as few as 10 such classes without imposing any prior. GLICO is then used to
augment the small training set while training a classifier on the small sample.
To this end, our proposed method samples the learned latent space using
spherical interpolation, and generates new examples using the trained
generator. Empirical results show that the new sampled set is diverse enough,
leading to improvement in image classification in comparison with the state of
the art, when trained on small samples obtained from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and

Unfortunately, these systems inherently suffer from an inexact mapping between

alleviation of this difficulty. The scheme involves control over the laser
oscillator amplitude through modification of individual laser oscillator loss.
We demonstrate this approach in a laser network classical XY model simulator

binary discovered by the Next Generation Transit Survey. The system period of
7.618 days is greater than many known eclipsing M-dwarf binary systems. Its
orbital eccentricity of $0.323^{+0.0014}_{-0.0037}$, is large relative to the
period and semi-major axis of the binary. Global modelling of photometry and
radial velocities indicate stellar masses of $M_A$=$0.426
^{+0.0056}_{-0.0049}$, $M_B$=$0.455 ^{+0.0058}_{-0.0052}$ and stellar radii
$R_A$=$0.461 ^{+0.038}_{-0.025}$ $R_B$=$0.411 ^{+0.027}_{-0.039}$,
respectively. Comparisons with stellar models for low mass stars show that one
star is consistent with model predictions whereas the other is substantially
oversized. Spectral analysis of the system suggests a primary of spectral type
M3V, consistent with both modelled masses and radii, and with SED fitting of
NGTS photometry. As the most eccentric eclipsing M-dwarf binary known, NGTS
J214358.5-380102 provides an interesting insight into the strength of tidal
effects in the circularisation of stellar orbits.

features: They concentrate along the boundary of the optical cavity at high
polar frequencies and they are associated with complex scattering resonances
very close to the real axis.
  As a classical simplification of the full Maxwell system, we consider
two-dimensional Helmholtz equations governing transverse electric [TE] or
magnetic [TM] modes. Even in this 2D framework, very few results provide
asymptotic expansion of WGM resonances at high polar frequency $m\to\infty$ for
cavities with radially varying optical index.
  In this work, using a direct Schr\""odinger analogy we highlight three typical
behaviors in such optical micro-disks, depending on the sign of an effective
curvature that takes into account the radius of the disk and the values of the
optical index and its derivative. Accordingly, this corresponds to abruptly
varying effective potentials (step linear or step harmonic) or more classical
harmonic potentials, leading to three distinct asymptotic expansions for ground
state energies.
  Using multiscale expansions, we design a unified procedure to construct
families of quasi-resonances and associate quasi-modes that have the WGM
structure and satisfy eigenequations modulo a super-algebraically small
residual $O(m^{-\infty})$.
  We show using the black box scattering approach that quasi-resonances are
$O(m^{-\infty})$ close to true resonances.

quasi-threshold graph. This problem is NP-hard but fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT) in the number of edits by using a branch-and-bound algorithm and admits a
simple integer linear programming formulation (ILP). Both methods are also
applicable to the general $F$-free editing problem for any finite set of graphs
$F$. For the FPT algorithm, we introduce a fast heuristic for computing
high-quality lower bounds and an improved branching strategy. For the ILP, we
engineer several variants of row generation. We evaluate both methods for
quasi-threshold editing on a large set of protein similarity graphs. For most

Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT)-gravity. Macroscopic loop operators define the

in Effective Field Theories (EFT) which are non-perturbative at leading order
is presented. The Renormalisation Group evolution of an observable predicts the
functional form of its residual cutoff dependence on the breakdown scale of an
EFT, on the low-momentum scales, and on the order of the calculation. Passing
this test is a necessary but not sufficient consistency criterion for a
suggested power counting whose exact nature is disputed. In Chiral Effective
Field Theory (ChiEFT) with more than one nucleon, a lack of universally
accepted analytic solutions obfuscates the convergence pattern in results. This
led to proposals which predict different sets of Low Energy Coefficients (LECs)
at the same chiral order, and at times even predict a different ordering
long-range contributions. The method may independently check whether an
observable is renormalised at a given order, and proves estimates of both the
breakdown scale and the momentum-dependent order-by-order convergence pattern.
Conversely, it helps identify those LECs (and long-range pieces) which ensure
renormalised observables at a given order. I also discuss assumptions and the

low-dimensional vector representation of high-dimensional and often sparse
graphs. Most studies explore the structure and metadata associated with the
graph using random walks and employ an unsupervised or semi-supervised learning
schemes. Learning in these methods is context-free, resulting in only a single
representation per node. Recently studies have argued on the adequacy of a
single representation and proposed context-sensitive approaches, which are
capable of extracting multiple node representations for different contexts.
This proved to be highly effective in applications such as link prediction and
ranking.
  However, most of these methods rely on additional textual features that
require complex and expensive RNNs or CNNs to capture high-level features or
rely on a community detection algorithm to identify multiple contexts of a
node.
  In this study we show that in-order to extract high-quality context-sensitive
node representations it is not needed to rely on supplementary node features,
nor to employ computationally heavy and complex models. We propose GOAT, a
context-sensitive algorithm inspired by gossip communication and a mutual
attention mechanism simply over the structure of the graph. We show the
efficacy of GOAT using 6 real-world datasets on link prediction and node
clustering tasks and compare it against 12 popular and state-of-the-art (SOTA)
baselines. GOAT consistently outperforms them and achieves up to 12% and 19%
gain over the best performing methods on link prediction and clustering tasks,
respectively.

of base token to get a transformation weight and we could thus represent the
whole vocabulary by only the ""base tokens"". This variant, called pruned WIG

achieve high accuracy. I also provide a \textit{wigpy} module in Python to

intelligent transportation systems (ITS) protocols. Despite the implementation
of long sought ITS protocols poses the crucial need to detail how the features
of optical stages influence the overall performances of a VLC system in
realistic configurations, such characterization has rarely been addressed at
present. We carried out an experimental investigation in a realistic
configuration where a regular traffic light (TX), enabled for VLC transmission,
sends digital information towards a receiving stage (RX), composed by an
optical condenser and a dedicated amplified photodiode stage. We performed a
detailed measurements campaign of VLC performances encompassing a broad set of
optical condensers, and for TX-RX distances in the range 3 - 50 m, in terms of
both effective field of view (EFOV) and packet error rate (PER). The results
show several nontrivial behaviors for different lens sets as a function of
position on the measurement grid, highlighting critical aspects as well as
identifying most suitable optical configurations depending on the specific
application and on the required EFOV. In this paper we also provide a
theoretical model for both the signal intensity and the EFOV as a function of
several parameters, such as distance, RX orientation and focal length of the
specific condenser. Our results could be very relevant in the near future to
assess a most suited solution in terms of acceptance angle when designing a VLC
system for real applications, where angle-dependent misalignment effects play a
non-negligible role, and we argue that it could have more general implications
with respect to the pristine I2V case mentioned here.

financial markets today. Many challenges still currently remain, and various
researches related thereto have been actively conducted. Especially, recent

attracted much attention. However, previous researches do not deal with the
financial market forecasting method based on LSTM which has good performance in
time series data. There is also a lack of comparative analysis in the
performance of neural network-based prediction techniques and traditional
prediction techniques. In this paper, we propose a financial market trend
forecasting method using LSTM and analyze the performance with existing
financial market trend forecasting methods through experiments. This method
prepares the input data set through the data preprocessing process so as to
reflect all the fundamental data, technical data and qualitative data used in
the financial data analysis, and makes comprehensive financial market analysis
through LSTM. In this paper, we experiment and compare performances of existing
financial market trend forecasting models, and performance according to the
financial market environment. In addition, we implement the proposed method
using open sources and platform and forecast financial market trends using
various financial data indicators.

  Neural Network onto NoC-based Neuromorphic Platform","Accepted by GLSVLSI2020",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking neural network (SNN), as the third generation of artificial neural
networks, has been widely adopted in vision and audio tasks. Nowadays, many
neuromorphic platforms support SNN simulation and adopt Network-on-Chips (NoC)
architecture for multi-cores interconnection.
  However, interconnection brings huge area overhead to the platform. Moreover,
run-time communication on the interconnection has a significant effect on the
total power consumption and performance of the platform. In this paper, we
propose a toolchain called SNEAP for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic platforms
with multi-cores, which aims to reduce the energy and latency brought by spike
communication on the interconnection.
  SNEAP includes two key steps: partitioning the SNN to reduce the spikes
communicated between partitions, and mapping the partitions of SNN to the NoC
to reduce average hop of spikes under the constraint of hardware resources.
SNEAP can reduce more spikes communicated on the interconnection of NoC and
spend less time than other toolchains in the partitioning phase. Moreover, the
average hop of spikes is reduced more by SNEAP within a time period, which
effectively reduces the energy and latency on the NoC-based neuromorphic
platform.
  The experimental results show that SNEAP can achieve 418x reduction in
end-to-end execution time, and reduce energy consumption and spike latency, on
average, by 23% and 51% respectively, compared with SpiNeMap.

interest in two-dimensional and three-dimensional real-time computer generated
holography. Phase randomisation is an integral part of holographic projection
as it ensures independence in sub-frame techniques and reduces the edge
enhancement seen in flat-phase images. Phase randomisation requires, however,
the availability of a pseudo-random number generator as well as trigonometric
functions such as cos and sin. On embedded devices such as field programmable
gate arrays and digital signal processors this can be an unacceptable load and
necessitate the use of proprietary intellectual property cores. Lookup tables
are able to reduce the computational load but can run to many megabytes for
even low-resolution systems.
  This paper introduces the use of lookup tables (LUTs) in the context of two
common algorithms used for real-time holographic projection: Gerchberg-Saxton
and One-Step Phase-Retrieval. A simulated study is carried out to investigate
the use of relatively small lookup tables where random numbers are repeated in
sequence. We find that the increase in error is low and tunable to under 5\%
even for small look up tables. This result is also demonstrated experimentally.
Finally, the implications of this study are discussed and conclusions drawn.

map. Specifically, we employ the phone inertial sensors to keep track of the
user's path. To compensate for the error accumulation due to the low-cost
inertial sensors, DynamicSLAM leverages unique points in the environment
(anchors) as observations to reduce the estimated location error. DynamicSLAM
introduces the novel concept of mobile human anchors that are based on the
encounters with other users in the environment, significantly increasing the
number and ubiquity of anchors and boosting localization accuracy. We present
different encounter models and show how they are incorporated in a unified
probabilistic framework to reduce the ambiguity in the user location.
Furthermore, we present a theoretical proof for system convergence and the
human anchors ability to reset the accumulated error. Evaluation of DynamicSLAM
using different Android phones shows that it can provide a localization
accuracy with a median of 1.1m. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art
techniques by 55%, highlighting DynamicSLAM promise for ubiquitous indoor

is missing in financial services. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, in a
first-of-its-kind-study, we define the reliability of a bank/firm in terms of
the financial ratios connoting the financial health of the bank to withstand
the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy. For the purpose of estimating the
reliability of a bank, we invoke a statistical and machine learning algorithm
namely, logistic regression (LR). Once, the parameters are estimated in the 1st
stage, we fix them and treat the financial ratios as decision variables. Thus,
in the 1st stage, we accomplish the hitherto unknown way of estimating the
reliability of a bank. Subsequently, in the 2nd stage, in order to maximize the
reliability of the bank, we formulate an unconstrained optimization problem in
a single-objective environment and solve it using the well-known particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm. Thus, in essence, these two stages correspond to
predictive and prescriptive analytics respectively. The proposed 2-stage
strategy of using them in tandem is beneficial to the decision-makers within a
bank who can try to achieve the optimal or near-optimal values of the financial
ratios in order to maximize the reliability which is tantamount to safeguarding
their bank against solvency or bankruptcy.

non-invasive anti-cancer therapies. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), is a near
room temperature ionized gas composed of reactive species, charged particles,
neutral particles, and electrons. CAP also has several physical factors
including thermal radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and electromagnetic
(EM) waves. Most of the previously reported biological effects of CAP have
relied on direct contact between bulk plasma and cells, resulting in the
chemical effects generally seen after CAP treatment. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the electromagnetic emission produced by CAP can lead to the
death of B16F10 melanoma cancer cells via a transbarrier contactless method.
When compared with the effect of reactive species, the effect of the physical
factors causes much greater growth inhibition. The physical-triggered growth
inhibition is due to a new type of cell death, characterized by rapid leakage
of bulk water from the cells, resulting in bubbles on the cell membrane, and
cytoplasm shrinkage. The results of this study introduce a new possible
mechanism of CAP induced cancer cell death and build a foundation for CAP to be
used as a non-invasive cancer treatment in the future.
