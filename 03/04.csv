the impact and efficacy of policies that aim to control climate change, such as
carbon taxes and subsidies. A major characteristic of IAMs is that their
geophysical sector determines the mean surface temperature increase over the
preindustrial level, which in turn determines the damage function. Most of the
existing IAMs are perfect-foresight forward-looking models, assuming that we
know all of the future information. However, there are significant
uncertainties in the climate and economic system, including parameter
uncertainty, model uncertainty, climate tipping risks, economic risks, and
ambiguity. For example, climate damages are uncertain: some researchers assume
that climate damages are proportional to instantaneous output, while others
assume that climate damages have a more persistent impact on economic growth.
Climate tipping risks represent (nearly) irreversible climate events that may
lead to significant changes in the climate system, such as the Greenland ice
sheet collapse, while the conditions, probability of tipping, duration, and
associated damage are also uncertain. Technological progress in carbon capture
and storage, adaptation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency are uncertain
too. In the face of these uncertainties, policymakers have to provide a
decision that considers important factors such as risk aversion, inequality
aversion, and sustainability of the economy and ecosystem. Solving this problem
may require richer and more realistic models than standard IAMs, and advanced
computational methods. The recent literature has shown that these uncertainties
can be incorporated into IAMs and may change optimal climate policies
significantly.

transmission experience. Besides the communication service, channel state
information (CSI) of the WiFi signals is widely employed for numerous Internet
of Things (IoT) applications. Recently, most of these applications are based on
analysis of the microwave reflections caused by physical movement of the
objective. In this paper, a novel contactless wireless sensing technique named
WiEps is developed to measure the dielectric properties of the material,
exploiting the transmission characteristics of the WiFi signals. In WiEps, the
material under test is placed between the transmitter antenna and receiver
antenna. A theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively describe the
relationship between CSI data and dielectric properties of the material. During
the experiment, the phase and amplitude of the transmitted WiFi signals are
extracted from the measured CSI data. The parameters of the theoretical model
are calculated using measured data from the known materials. Then, WiEps is
utilized to estimate the dielectric properties of unknown materials. The
proposed technique is first applied to the ethanol/water mixtures. Then,
additional liquids are measured for further verification. The estimated
permittivities and conductivities show good agreement with the actual values,
with the average error of 4.0% and 8.9%, respectively, indicating the efficacy
of WiEps. By measuring the dielectric property, this technique is promising to
be applied to new IoT applications using ubiquitous WiFi signals, such as food
engineering, material manufacturing process monitoring, and security check.

successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in

require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for
real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good
representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better
policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality
helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL
algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet)

deep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually
supposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL
agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation
than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger
feature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search
space) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus
improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the
proposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms

vision applications, including landmark detection. A major challenge for
accurate anatomical landmark detection in volumetric images such as clinical CT
scans is that large-scale data often constrain the capacity of the employed
neural network architecture due to GPU memory limitations, which in turn can
limit the precision of the output. We propose a multi-scale, end-to-end deep
learning method that achieves fast and memory-efficient landmark detection in
3D images. Our architecture consists of blocks of shift-equivariant networks,
each of which performs landmark detection at a different spatial scale. These
blocks are connected from coarse to fine-scale, with differentiable resampling
layers, so that all levels can be trained together. We also present a noise
injection strategy that increases the robustness of the model and allows us to
quantify uncertainty at test time. We evaluate our method for carotid artery
bifurcations detection on 263 CT volumes and achieve a better than
state-of-the-art accuracy with mean Euclidean distance error of 2.81mm.

TGT identifies the differences between each pair of groups using compressed

design agents that can efficiently learn to understand and generalize to

following feasible paths that avoid obstacles in obstacle-cluttered

algorithms, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms in a
synergistic way. The key idea is to decouple the navigation problem into
planning and control, the former of which is achieved by supervised learning
whereas the latter is done by reinforcement learning. Specifically, we train a
deep convolutional network that can predict collision-free paths based on a map
of the environment-- this is then used by a reinforcement learning algorithm to
learn to closely follow the path. This allows the trained agent to achieve good
generalization while learning faster. We test our proposed method in the
recently proposed Safety Gym suite that allows testing of safety-constraints

ultracold atoms. The standard procedure involves the division of two frames
acquired at successive exposures, one with the atomic absorption signal and one
without. A well-known problem is the presence of residual structured noise in
the final image, due to small differences between the imaging light in the two
exposures. Here we solve this problem by performing absorption imaging with
only a single exposure, where instead of a second exposure the reference frame
is generated by an unsupervised image-completion autoencoder neural network.
The network is trained on images without absorption signal such that it can
infer the noise overlaying the atomic signal based only on the information in
the region encircling the signal. We demonstrate our approach on data captured
with a quantum degenerate Fermi gas. The average residual noise in the
resulting images is below that of the standard double-shot technique. Our
method simplifies the experimental sequence, reduces the hardware requirements,
and can improve the accuracy of extracted physical observables. The trained

formation is still not well understood. In particular, planet formation models
predict that many of them should have accreted enough gas to become gas giants.
Here we examine the role of the protoplanetary disk in the cooling and
contraction of the protoplanetary envelope. In particular, we investigate the
effects of 1) the thermal state of the disk as set by the relative size of
heating by accretion or irradiation, and whether its energy is transported by
radiation or convection, and 2) advection of entropy into the outer envelope by
disk flows that penetrate the Hill sphere, as found in 3D global simulations.
We find that, at 5 and 1 AU, this flow at the level reported in the
non-isothermal simulations where it penetrates only to ~ 0.3 times the Hill
radius has little effect on the cooling rate since most of the envelope mass is
concentrated close to the core, and far from the flow. On the other hand, at
0.1 AU, the envelope quickly becomes fully-radiative, nearly isothermal, and
thus cannot cool down, stalling gas accretion. This effect is significantly
more pronounced in convective disks, leading to envelope mass orders of
magnitude lower. Entropy advection at 0.1 AU in either radiative or convective
disks could therefore explain why super-Earths failed to undergo runaway
accretion. These results highlight the importance of the conditions and energy
transport in the protoplanetary disk for the accretion of planetary envelopes.

addresses some open problems posed in Brualdi and Dahl's article, firstly by
characterising how pairs of ASHMs with the same corresponding ASHL relate to
one another and providing a tight lower bound on $n$ for which two $n \times n

find that a magnetic field, independently of its orientation, has only a weak
influence on the critical electric field that identifies the transition from
the superconducting state to a phase with vanishing critical supercurrent. This
observation points to the absence of a direct coupling between the electric
field and the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter or $2\pi$-phase
slips via vortex generation. The magnetic field effect observed in the presence

classical scale invariance which not only provide a possibility for an
alternative symmetry breaking mechanism but also partially address the gauge
hierarchies through dimensional transmutation. As outlined in our discussion
section, when the couplings are not large, models with CW symmetry-breaking
mechanisms have also been shown to naturally provide the strong first-order
phase transition necessary for stochastic gravitational wave signals. A full
understanding of the CW-MS scheme transformation of couplings thus becomes
important in the era of gravitational wave detection and precision coupling
measurements. A generalized Coleman-Weinberg (GCW) renormalization scheme is
formulated and methods for transforming scalar self-couplings between the GCW

$\lambda\Phi^4$ theory with global $O(4)$ symmetry is explicitly studied up to
six-loop order to explore the magnitude of this scheme transformation effect on
the couplings. The dynamical rescaling of renormalization scales between the
GCW and MS schemes can lead to significant (order of 10\%) differences in the
coupling at any order, and consequently GCW-MS scheme transformation effects

simulations employing hybrid density functionals are of great interest as it
offers more accurate description of structural and dynamic properties than the
GGA functionals. However, computational cost for carrying out calculations
using hybrid functionals and plane wave basis set is at least two order of
magnitude higher than GGA functionals. Recently, we proposed a strategy that
combined the adaptively compressed exchange operator formulation and the
multiple time step integration scheme to reduce the computational cost about an
order of magnitude [J. Chem. Phys. 151, 151102 (2019)]. In this work, we
demonstrate the application of this method to study chemical reactions, in
particular, formamide hydrolysis in alkaline aqueous medium. By actuating our
implementation with the well-sliced metadynamics scheme, we are able to compute
the two-dimensional free energy surface of this reaction at the level of
hybrid-DFT. Accuracy of PBE0 (hybrid) and PBE (GGA) functionals in predicting
the free energetics of the chemical reaction is investigated here.

non-smooth Lipschitz functions and composition of a (potentially) non-smooth
function and a smooth function, with or without strong convexity. Based on the
flexibility offered by our optimization model we consider several variants of
stochastic first order methods, such as the stochastic proximal gradient and
the stochastic proximal point algorithms. Usually, the convergence theory for
these methods has been derived for simple stochastic optimization models
satisfying restrictive assumptions, the rates are in general sublinear and hold
only for specific decreasing stepsizes. Hence, we analyze the convergence rates
of stochastic first order methods with constant or variable stepsize under
general assumptions covering a large class of objective functions. For constant
stepsize we show that these methods can achieve linear convergence rate up to a
constant proportional to the stepsize and under some strong stochastic bounded

stepsize is chosen we derive sublinear convergence rates for these stochastic

of meter readings challenge the monitoring and control of today's power systems
(PS). In this context, to maintain a comprehensive view of the system in real
time, fast and robust state estimation (SE) methods are urgently needed.
Conventional PSSE solvers typically entail minimizing a nonlinear and nonconvex
least-squares by e.g., the workhorse Gauss-Newton method. Those iterative
solvers however, are sensitive to initialization and may get stuck in local
minima. To overcome these hurdles and inspired by recent image denoising
techniques, this paper advocates a learnable regularization term for PSSE that
uses a deep neural network (DNN) prior. For the resultant regularized PSSE
problem, a ""Gauss-Newton-like"" alternating minimization solver is first
developed. To accommodate real-time monitoring, a novel end-to-end DNN is
constructed by unrolling the proposed alternating minimization solver.
Interestingly, the power network topology can be easily incorporated into the
DNN by designing a graph neural network (GNN) based prior. To further endow the
physics-based DNN with robustness against bad data, an adversarial DNN training
method is discussed. Numerical tests using real load data on the IEEE $118$-bus
benchmark system showcase the improved estimation and robustness performance of
the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art alternatives.

Model assertions are arbitrary functions over a model's input and output that
indicate when errors may be occurring, e.g., a function that triggers if an
object rapidly changes its class in a video. We propose methods of using model
assertions at all stages of ML system deployment, including runtime monitoring,
validating labels, and continuously improving ML models. For runtime
monitoring, we show that model assertions can find high confidence errors,
where a model returns the wrong output with high confidence, which
uncertainty-based monitoring techniques would not detect. For training, we
propose two methods of using model assertions. First, we propose a bandit-based
active learning algorithm that can sample from data flagged by assertions and
show that it can reduce labeling costs by up to 40% over traditional
uncertainty-based methods. Second, we propose an API for generating
""consistency assertions"" (e.g., the class change example) and weak labels for

number limit, $Ek \rightarrow 0$. The Prandtl number ($Pr$) and the
asymptotically scaled Rayleigh number ($\widetilde{Ra} = Ra Ek^{4/3}$, where
$Ra$ is the typical Rayleigh number) are varied systematically. For
sufficiently vigorous convection, an inverse kinetic energy cascade leads to
the formation of a depth-invariant large-scale vortex (LSV). With respect to
the kinetic energy, we find a transition from convection dominated states to
LSV dominated states at an asymptotically reduced (small-scale) Reynolds number
of $\widetilde{Re} \approx 6$ for all investigated values of $Pr$. The ratio of
the depth-averaged kinetic energy to the kinetic energy of the convection
reaches a maximum at $\widetilde{Re} \approx 24$, then decreases as
$\widetilde{Ra}$ is increased. This decrease in the relative kinetic energy of
the LSV is associated with a decrease in the convective correlations with
increasing Rayleigh number. The scaling behavior of the convective flow speeds
is studied; although a linear scaling of the form $\widetilde{Re} \sim
\widetilde{Ra}/Pr$ is observed over a limited range in Rayleigh number and
Prandtl number, a clear departure from this scaling is observed at the highest
accessible values of $\widetilde{Ra}$. Calculation of the forces present in the

simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films in two dimensions via a
sharp-interface model, which is governed by surface diffusion and contact line
(point) migration together with proper boundary conditions. By reformulating
the relaxed contact angle condition into a Robin-type boundary condition and
then treating it as a natural boundary condition, we obtain a new variational
formulation for the problem, in which the interface curve and its contact
points are evolved simultaneously. Then, the variational problem is discretized
in space by using piecewise linear elements. A full discretization is presented
by adopting the backward Euler method in time, and the well-posedness and
energy dissipation of the full discretization are established. The numerical
method is semi-implicit (i.e., a linear system to be solved at each time step
and thus efficient), unconditionally energy-stable with respect to the time
step, and second-order in space measured by a manifold distance between two
curves. In addition, it demonstrates equal mesh distribution when the solution
reaches its equilibrium, i.e., long-time dynamics. Numerical results are
reported to show accuracy and efficiency as well as some good properties of the
proposed numerical method.

one edge between any pair $V_i,V_j$, how large can $n$ be such that there will
always be an independent transversal? They showed that the maximal $n$ is at
most $(1+o(1))k^2$, by providing an explicit construction with these parameters
and no independent transversal. They also proved a lower bound which is smaller
by a $2e$-factor.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that their upper bound
construction is best possible: if $n\le (1-o(1))k^2$, there will always be an
independent transversal. In fact, this result is a very special case of a much
more general theorem which concerns independent transversals in arbitrary

between each pair of parts is relatively small. In this setting, Loh and
Sudakov provided a global \emph{maximum} degree condition for the existence of
an independent transversal. We show that this can be relaxed to an

automation for interactive theorem provers such as Lean and Coq, for which the
exponential blowup of term-tree sizes has proved to be both common and
difficult to prevent. All that is needed to recover the optimal scaling is the
ability to perform simple operations on the memory addresses of terms, and yet
allowing these operations to be used freely would clearly violate the basic

its energy density and pressure. Plugging these quantities in the energy

coordinate system, at a differential equation for the temperature as a function
of the proper time. The numerical solution of this equation leads finally to
the proper time evolution of the temperature. The latter is then used to
determine the evolution of a large number of thermodynamic quantities in this

Couette shear flow, where we characterize the linear growth of the compressible
part of the fluid while proving time decay for the incompressible part
(inviscid damping with slower rates). Then we extend the analysis to monotone
shear flows near Couette, where we are able to give an upper bound, superlinear
in time, for the compressible part of the fluid. The incompressible part enjoys
an inviscid damping property, analogous to the Couette case. In the pure
Couette case, we exploit the presence of an additional conservation law (which
connects the vorticity and the density on the moving frame) in order to reduce
the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The result then follows by
using weighted energy estimates. In the general case, unfortunately, this
conservation law no longer holds. Therefore we define a suitable weighted
energy functional for the whole system, which can be used to estimate the
irrotational component of the velocity but does not provide sharp bounds on the
solenoidal component. However, even in the absence of the aforementioned
additional conservation law, we are still able to show the existence of a
functional relation which allows us to recover somehow the vorticity from the
density, on the moving frame. By combining the weighted energy estimates with
the functional relation we also recover the inviscid damping for the solenoidal
component of the velocity.

nonpotential components, magnetic energy and relative helicity can both also be
decomposed into two quantities: potential and free energies, and
volume-threading and current-carrying helicities. In this study, we perform a
coupled analysis of their behaviors in a set of parametric 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of solar-like eruptions. We present the
general formulations for the time-varying components of energy and helicity in
resistive MHD. We calculated them numerically with a specific gauge, and
compared their behaviors in the numerical simulations, which differ from one
another by their imposed boundary-driving motions. Thus, we investigated the
impact of different active regions surface flows on the development of the
energy and helicity-related quantities. Despite general similarities in their
overall behaviors, helicities and energies display different evolutions that
cannot be explained in a unique framework. While the energy fluxes are similar
in all simulations, the physical mechanisms that govern the evolution of the
helicities are markedly distinct from one simulation to another: the evolution
of volume-threading helicity can be governed by boundary fluxes or helicity
transfer, depending on the simulation. The eruption takes place for the same
value of the ratio of the current-carrying helicity to the total helicity in
all simulations. However, our study highlights that this threshold can be
reached in different ways, with different helicity-related processes dominating
for different photospheric flows. This means that the details of the
pre-eruptive dynamics do not influence the eruption-onset helicity-related
threshold. Nevertheless, the helicity-flux dynamics may be more or less
efficient in changing the time required to reach the onset of the eruption.

lobes connected by a narrow neck, rotating at low spin period (15.92 h), and
having high obliquity (~98 deg), similar to other KBO contact-binaries inferred
through photometric observations. The origin of such peculiar configurations is
puzzling, and all scenarios suggested for the origins of contact-binaries fail
to reproduce such properties and their likely high frequency. Here we show that
semi-secular perturbations operating only on ultra-wide (~0.1-0.4 Hill-radius)
KBO-binaries can robustly lead to gentle, slow-speed binary mergers at
arbitrarily high obliquities, but low rotational velocities, that can reproduce
MU69's (and similar oblique contact binaries) characteristics. Using N-body
simulations, we find that ~15% of all ultra-wide binaries with cosine-uniform
inclination distribution are likely to merge through this process. Moreover, we
find that such mergers are sufficiently gentle as to only slightly deform the
KBO shape, and can produce the measured rotation speed of MU69. The
semi-secular contact-binary formation channel not only explains the observed
properties of MU69, but could also apply for other Kuiper/asteroid belt

to a strong imbalance in the ionisation equilibrium of Mn I and Mn II lines. Mn
I produces systematically (up to 0.6 dex) lower abundances compared to the Mn

satisfies the ionisation equilibrium across the entire metallicity range, -3 <

exhibits a continuous transition at zero temperature between a gapless
deconfined phase, described by three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics, and a
gapped confined phase, in which the system develops valence-bond-solid order.
We argue that the quantum critical point is in the universality class of the
QED$_3$-Gross-Neveu-XY model. We study this field theory within a $1/N_f$
expansion in fixed dimension as well as a renormalization group analysis in
$4-\epsilon$ space-time dimensions. The consistency between numerical and
analytical results is revealed from large to intermediate flavor number.

regarded as a FIMP candidate. We implement the Type-I Seesaw mechanism for
generating the masses of the Standard Model (SM) neutrinos and consider three
heavy neutrinos, responsible for mediating the interactions between the hidden
and the SM sectors. We assume that an early matter-dominated era (EMDE) took
place for some period between inflation and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, making
the Universe to expand faster than in the standard radiation-dominated era. In
this case, the hidden and SM sectors are easily decoupled and larger couplings
between FIMPs and SM particles are needed from the relic density constraints.
In this context, we discuss the dynamics of dark matter throughout the modified
cosmic history, evaluate the relevant constraints of the model and discuss the
consequences of the duration of the EMDE for the dark matter production.
Finally, we show that if the heavy neutrinos are not part of the thermal bath,
this scenario becomes testable through indirect detection searches.

parameters for the streams as they enter the halo virial radius, $R_{\rm v}$,
as a function of halo mass and redshift. For $10^{12}M_{\odot}$ halos at $z=2$,
we find the Hydrogen number density in streams to be $n_{\rm H,s}\sim
(0.1-5)\times 10^{-2}{\rm cm}^{-3}$, a factor of $\delta \sim (30-300)$ times
denser than the hot CGM density, while the stream radii are in the range
$R_{\rm s}\sim (0.03-0.50)R_{\rm v}$. As the streams accelerate towards the
halo centre, they become denser and narrower. The stream-CGM interaction
induces Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI), which leads to entrainment of CGM
mass by the stream and therefore to stream deceleration by momentum
conservation. Assuming that the entrainment rates derived by Mandelker et al.
2019 in the absence of gravity can be applied locally at each halocentric
radius, we derive equations of motion for the stream in the halo. Using these,
we derive the net acceleration, mass growth, and energy dissipation induced by
the stream-CGM interaction, as a function of halo mass and redshift, for
different CGM density profiles. For the range of model parameters considered,
we find that the interaction can induce dissipation luminosities $L_{\rm
diss}>10^{42}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ within $\le 0.6 R_{\rm v}$ of halos with
$M_{\rm v}>10^{12}M_{\odot}$ at $z=2$, with the emission scaling with halo mass
and redshift approximately as $\propto M_{\rm v}\,(1+z)^2$. The magnitude and
spatial extent of the emission produced in massive halos at high redshift is
consistent with observed Ly$\alpha$ blobs, though better treatment of the UV
background and self-shielding is needed to solidify this conclusion.

allowing us to calculate daily and annual solar energy yields. We examine the
variation in our daily and annual estimates as a result of taking different
subsets of pvoutput systems with certain specifications such as orientation,

be 875 kWh/kWp, meaning the yields were underestimated and overestimated for

solar energy yields per municipality. This research demonstrates that an
irradiance based measure of solar energy generation is necessary to obtain more

on the intrinsic curvature-enhanced spin-orbit coupling of the nanotubes, as

Tuning experimental parameters, we show that a half-metallic state may be
induced in the nanotube. Coupling the system to an Ising superconductor, with
an appreciable spin-triplet component, can then drive the nanotube into a
topological superconducting phase. The proposed scheme is investigated by means
of real-space tight-binding simulations, accompanied by an effective continuum
low-energy theory, which allows us to gain some insight on the roles of
different terms in the Hamiltonian. We calculate the topological phase diagram
and ascertain the existence of localized Majorana zero modes near the edges.
Moreover, we find that in the absence of a magnetic field, a regime exists

the disk settling instability. Some of the key properties explained by our
models include the sudden change in the growth rate of the streaming
instability when the dust-to-gas-mass ratio surpasses one, the slow growth rate
of the streaming instability compared to the settling instability for smaller
grains, and the main physical processes underlying the growth of the most
unstable modes in different regimes. As well as providing helpful simplified

discuss the first step in the process of estimating planet yields: generating
synthetic planetary systems consistent with observed occurrence rates from
multiple detection methods. In an attempt to self-consistently populate stars
with orbiting planets, it is found that naive extrapolation of occurrence rates
(mass, semi-major axis) results in an unrealistically large number-density of
Neptune-mass planets beyond the ice-line ($a \gtrsim 5$au), causing dynamic
interactions that would destabilize orbits. We impose a stability criterion for
multi-planet systems based on mutual Hill radii separation. Considering the
influence of compact configurations containing Jovian-mass and Neptune-mass
planets results in a marked suppression in the number of terrestrial planets
that can exist at large radii. This result has a pronounced impact on planet
yield calculations particularly in regions accessible to high-contrast imaging
and microlensing. The dynamically compact configurations and occurrence rates
that we develop may be incorporated as input into joint RV and direct imaging
yield calculations to place meaningful limits on the number of detectable
planets with future missions.

Landau quantization in situations where different species of charge carriers
contribute to magnetotransport. Landau fan charts, mapping the conductivity $
\sigma_{xx}(V_g, B) $ in the whole magnetic field - gate voltage range, can be
divided into six areas, depending on the state of the participating carrier
species. Key findings are: (i) the interplay of bulk holes (spin-degenerate)
and Dirac surface electrons (non-degenerate), coexisting for $ E_F $ in the
valence band, leads to a periodic switching between odd and even filling
factors and thus odd and even quantized Hall voltage values. (ii) A similar
though less pronounced behavior we found for coexisting Dirac surface and
conduction band electrons. (iii) In the bulk gap, quantized Dirac electrons on
the top-surface coexist at lower B with non-quantized ones on the bottom side,
giving rise to quantum Hall plateau values depending - for a given filling
factor - on the magnetic field strength. In stronger $ B $ fields, Landau level
separation increases, charge transfer between different carrier species becomes
energetically favorable and leads to the formation of a global (i.e. involving

problem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our
knowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows
the exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted

objective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their
decision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network.
Information exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that
encode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives. This paper
provides a proof of convergence, performance bounds, and explicit limits for
the results of agents' computations. Simulation results with different sizes of
networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and how the choice

known mechanism must be in want of a causal estimate. However, causal
estimation from observational data often relies on the (untestable) assumption
of `no unobserved confounding'. Violations of this assumption can induce bias
in effect estimates. In principle, such bias could invalidate or reverse the
conclusions of a study. However, in some cases, we might hope that the
influence of unobserved confounders is weak relative to a `large' estimated
effect, so the qualitative conclusions are robust to bias from unobserved
confounding. The purpose of this paper is to develop \emph{Austen plots}, a
sensitivity analysis tool to aid such judgments by making it easier to reason
about potential bias induced by unobserved confounding. We formalize
confounding strength in terms of how strongly the confounder influences
treatment assignment and outcome. For a target level of bias, an Austen plot
shows the minimum values of treatment and outcome influence required to induce
that level of bias. Domain experts can then make subjective judgments about
whether such strong confounders are plausible. To aid this judgment, the Austen
plot additionally displays the estimated influence strength of (groups of) the
observed covariates. Austen plots generalize the classic sensitivity analysis
approach of Imbens [Imb03]. Critically, Austen plots allow any approach for
modeling the observed data and producing the initial estimate. We illustrate
the tool by assessing biases for several real causal inference problems, using
a variety of machine learning approaches for the initial data analysis. Code is

strong correlations associated with localized transition metal $d$ electrons
and (2) significant van der Waals (vdW) interactions in layered systems, both
of which are not accurately captured by standard approximations to density
functional theory (DFT). Here, we perform a systematic benchmark of electronic

the voltage, crystal structure, and electronic structure with and without
extensions to incorporate on-site Hubbard interactions and vdW interactions.
Within pure DFT (i.e., without corrections for on-site Hubbard interactions),
SCAN is a significant improvement over PBE for describing cathode materials,
decreasing the mean absolute voltage error by more than 50%. Although explicit
vdW interactions are not critical and in cases even detrimental when applied in
conjunction with SCAN, Hubbard $U$ corrections are still in general necessary
to achieve reasonable agreement with experiment. We show that no single method
considered here can accurately describe the voltage and overall structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties (i.e., errors no more than 5% for voltage,
volume, band gap, and magnetic moments) of battery cathode materials,
motivating a strong need for improved electronic structure approaches for such

meaning it obeys constraints like the robot's dynamics and obstacle avoidance;
it should have liveness, meaning the robot does not stop to plan so frequently
that it cannot accomplish tasks; and it should be optimal, meaning that the
robot tries to satisfy a user-specified cost function such as reaching a goal
location as quickly as possible. Reachability-based Trajectory Design (RTD) is
a planning method that can generate provably dynamically-feasible plans.
However, RTD solves a nonlinear polynmial optimization program at each planning
iteration, preventing optimality guarantees; furthermore, RTD can struggle with
liveness because the robot must brake to a stop when the solver finds local
minima or cannot find a feasible solution. This paper proposes RTD*, which
certifiably finds the globally optimal plan (if such a plan exists) at each
planning iteration. This method is enabled by a novel Parallelized Constrained
Bernstein Algorithm (PCBA), which is a branch-and-bound method for polynomial
optimization. The contributions of this paper are: the implementation of PCBA;
proofs of bounds on the time and memory usage of PCBA; a comparison of PCBA to

than that for normal galaxies. The stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) in each
band varies little with absolute magnitude, but increases with higher M*. This
trend of M/L with M* is even stronger in bluer bands. In addition, the M/L for
our LSBGs slightly declines from the r band to the longer wavelength bands. The
log M/L_j (j=g,r,i,and z) have relatively tight relations with optical colors
of g-r and g-i. Compared with several representative M/L-color relations
(MLCRs) from literature, our MLCRs based on LSBG data are consistently among
those literature MLCRs previously defined on diverse galaxy samples, and the
existing minor differences between the MLCRs are more caused by the differences

samples, and photometric zero-point as well, rather than the galaxy surface
brightness itself which distinguishes LSBGs from HSBGs. Our LSBGs would be very

important factor in applications that provide rapid feedback. In particular,
the state-of-the-art uses bi-directional recurrent networks, where a
uni-directional network may be more appropriate. Teacher-student learning is a
natural approach to use to improve a uni-directional model, but when using a
CTC objective, this is limited by poor alignment of outputs to evidence. We
address this limitation by trying two loss terms for improving the alignments
of our models. One loss is an ""alignment loss"" term that encourages outputs
only when features do not resemble silence. The other loss term uses a
uni-directional model as teacher model to align the bi-directional model. Our
proposed model uses these aligned bi-directional models as teacher models.
Experiments on the CSLU kids' corpus show that these changes decrease the
latency of the outputs, and improve the detection rates, with a trade-off

parameterized pooling leading to better speckle suppression and feature
enhancement than traditional difference images. 2) Two different parameter
Sigmoid nonlinear mapping are applied to the DDI to get two mapped DDIs.
Parallel FCM are utilized on these two mapped DDIs to obtain three types of

intermediate pixels to be changed or unchanged. Three imbalanced multi-temporal

results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and robust for

contrast to the broad and asymmetric Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles commonly
present in black hole binaries at high accretion rates. The narrow line, with
weak relativistic broadening, indicates that the Fe K$\alpha$ line is produced
at a large disk radius. Fitting with disk reflection models assuming standard
disk emissivity finds a large disk truncation radius (a few tens to a few
hundreds of gravitational radii, depending on the disk inclination). In
addition, we detect a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) varying in frequency
between $11.6\pm0.2$~mHz and $2.8\pm0.1$~mHz. The very low QPO frequencies
suggest a large size for the optically-thin Comptonization region according to
the Lense-Thirring precession model, supporting that the accretion disk recedes
from the ISCO and is replaced by advection-dominated accretion flow at low
accretion rates. We also discuss the possibility of an alternative accretion
geometry that the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line is produced by a lamppost corona

first evidence that the MPs phenomenon is the same regardless of cluster age

compared. By complementing those data with new images from the Hubble Space

NGC 2121 ($\sim$2.5Gyr) and NGC 1783 ($\sim$1.5Gyr), from the Large Magellanic

cluster having larger $\sigma(C_{F275W,F343N,F438W})^{RGB}$ and vice-versa.
Unfortunately, the $\sigma$ values cannot be directly linked to the N-abundance

effects of differential nodal precession that alter its flat structure.
However, a gas disc with embedded well coupled solids around the eccentric
binary may evolve to a polar configuration as a result of pressure forces that
maintain the disc flatness and as a result of viscous dissipation that allows
the disc to increase its tilt. Once the gas disc disperses, the debris disc is
in a polar aligned state in which there is little precession. We use
three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, linear theory, and particle
dynamics to study the evolution of a misaligned circumbinary gas disc and
explore the effects of the initial disc tilt, mass, and size. We find that for
a wide range of parameter space, the polar alignment timescale is shorter than
the lifetime of the gas disc. Using the observed level of alignment of 3 deg.
from polar, we place an upper limit on the mass of the gas disc of about 0.014

we employ a recently developed statistical mechanical theory that connects
geometric properties of network representations and the separability of classes
to probe how information is untangled within neural networks trained to
recognize speech. We observe that speaker-specific nuisance variations are
discarded by the network's hierarchy, whereas task-relevant properties such as
words and phonemes are untangled in later layers. Higher level concepts such as
parts-of-speech and context dependence also emerge in the later layers of the
network. Finally, we find that the deep representations carry out significant
temporal untangling by efficiently extracting task-relevant features at each

deep auditory models process time dependent input signals to achieve invariant
speech recognition, and show how different concepts emerge through the layers

and heuristic, leaving it open whether good subnetworks provably exist, how to
find them efficiently, and if network pruning can be provably better than
direct training using gradient descent. We answer these problems positively by
proposing a simple greedy selection approach for finding good subnetworks,
which starts from an empty network and greedily adds important neurons from the
large network. This differs from the existing methods based on backward
elimination, which remove redundant neurons from the large network.
Theoretically, applying the greedy selection strategy on sufficiently large

than networks directly trained with gradient descent. Our results also apply to
pruning randomly weighted networks. Practically, we improve prior arts of
network pruning on learning compact neural architectures on ImageNet, including

model them. However, this requirement is very hard to satisfy in practice.
Data-driven approaches such as Gaussian processes (GPs) have proved quite
effective by employing regression based methods to capture the unmodeled
dynamical effects. However, GPs scale cubically with data, and is often a
challenge to perform real-time regression. In this paper, we propose a
semi-parametric framework exploiting sparsity for learning-based control. We
combine the parametric model of the system with multiple sparse GP models to
capture any unmodeled dynamics. Multi-Sparse Gaussian Process (MSGP) divides
the original dataset into multiple sparse models with unique hyperparameters
for each model. Thereby, preserving the richness and uniqueness of each sparse
model. For a query point, a weighted sparse posterior prediction is performed
based on $N$ neighboring sparse models. Hence, the prediction complexity is
significantly reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(Npu^2)$, where
$p$ and $u$ are data points and pseudo-inputs respectively for each sparse
model. We validate MSGP's learning performance for a quadrotor using a
geometric controller in simulation. Comparison with GP, sparse GP, and local GP
shows that MSGP has higher prediction accuracy than sparse and local GP, while
significantly lower time complexity than all three. We also validate MSGP on a
hardware quadrotor for unmodeled mass, inertia, and disturbances. The

(TE) such as death is also observed on the same unit, since the RCRs are
generally informative about death, we develop joint dynamic models that
simultaneously model the RCRs and the TE. A key interest of such joint dynamic

from a circumbinary disc onto their personal discs. We suspect that in many
cases a wide molecular wind will envelope a collimated atomic jet emanating
from close to an orbiting young star. This so-called Circumbinary Scenario is
explored here in order to find common identifiable properties. The dynamical
set up is studied with three dimensional simulations with chemistry and cooling
included. We extract the properties on scales of order 100\,AU and compare to
the Co-Orbital Scenario in which the wind and jet sources are in orbit.
  We find that the rapid orbital motion generates a wide ionised sheath around
the jet core with a large opening angle at the base. This is independent of the
presence of the surrounding molecular outflow. However, the atomic jet is
recollimated beyond ~ 55 AU when the molecular outflow restricts the motion of
the ambient medium which, in turn, confines the jet. These physical properties
are relayed to the optical H-alpha imaging, providing a means of distinguishing
between models. The high excitation sheath and recollimation region can be
explored on these scales through the next generation of instruments. However,
in general, the amount and location of the ionised material, whether in the
knots or the sheath, will depend on several parameters including the orbital
period, axis alignment and pulse amplitude.

many-body systems ranging from condensed matter systems all the way to neutron
stars. Gaussian states are common at equilibrium when the interactions are
weak. Recently it was proposed that they can also emerge dynamically from a
non-Gaussian initial state evolving under non-interacting dynamics. In this
work, we present the experimental observation of such a dynamical emergence of
Gaussian correlations in a quantum many-body system. This non-equilibrium
evolution is triggered by abruptly switching off the effective interaction
between the observed collective degrees of freedom, while leaving the
interactions between the microscopic constituents unchanged. Starting from
highly non-Gaussian correlations, consistent with the sine-Gordon model, we
observe a Gaussian state to emerge over time as revealed by the decay of the
fourth and sixth order connected correlations in the quantum field. A
description of this dynamics requires a novel mechanism for the emergence of
Gaussian correlations, which is relevant for a wide class of quantum many-body
systems. In our closed system with non-interacting effective degrees of
freedom, we do not expect full thermalization. This memory of the initial state
is confirmed by observing recurrences of non-Gaussian correlations.

express e.g. the positivity of mass or the attractiveness of gravity. Perhaps

to prove singularity theorems and the non-existence of wormholes and similar
exotic phenomena. However, the delicate balance between conceptual simplicity,
general validity and strong results has faced serious challenges, because all
pointwise energy conditions are systematically violated by quantum fields and
also by some rather simple classical fields. In response to these challenges,
weaker statements were introduced, such as quantum energy inequalities and
averaged energy conditions. These have a larger range of validity and may still
suffice to prove at least some of the earlier results. One of these conditions,
the achronal averaged null energy condition, has recently received increased
attention. It is expected to be a universal property of the dynamics of all
gravitating physical matter, even in the context of semiclassical or quantum

whose vertices are the $k$-colourings of $G$ and two colourings are joined by
an edge in $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$ if they differ in colour on exactly one vertex.
For a $k$-colourable graph $G$, we investigate the connectivity and diameter of

property that $\mathcal{R}_{k+1}(G)$ is connected. On the other hand,
$\mathcal{R}_{k+1}(G)$ is connected and of diameter $O(n^2)$ for several

increase on several NLP tasks, however, the models become more and more
computationally demanding. Therefore, this paper tackles the domain of
computationally efficient algorithms for NLP tasks. In particular, it
investigates distributed representations of n-gram statistics of texts. The
representations are formed using hyperdimensional computing enabled embedding.
These representations then serve as features, which are used as input to
standard classifiers. We investigate the applicability of the embedding on one
large and three small standard datasets for classification tasks using nine
classifiers. The embedding achieved on par F1 scores while decreasing the time
and memory requirements by several times compared to the conventional n-gram
statistics, e.g., for one of the classifiers on a small dataset, the memory
reduction was 6.18 times; while train and test speed-ups were 4.62 and 3.84
times, respectively. For many classifiers on the large dataset, memory
reduction was ca. 100 times and train and test speed-ups were over 100 times.
Importantly, the usage of distributed representations formed via
hyperdimensional computing allows dissecting strict dependency between the
dimensionality of the representation and n-gram size, thus, opening a room for
tradeoffs.

heating rate due to free magnetic energy dissipation. Here we present a first
test of a new model developed to determine if the times of increases in the
resistive heating rate in active region (AR) photospheres are correlated with
the subsequent occurrence of M and X flares in the corona. A data driven, 3 D,
non-force-free magnetohydrodynamic model restricted to the near-photospheric
region is used to compute time series of the complete current density and the
resistive heating rate per unit volume $(Q(t))$ in each pixel in neutral line
regions (NLRs) of 14 ARs. The model is driven by time series of the magnetic
field ${\bf B}$ measured by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager on the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Spurious Doppler periods due to SDO
orbital motion are filtered out of the time series for ${\bf B}$ in every AR
pixel. For each AR, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of
the NLR area integral $Q_i(t)$ of $Q(t)$ is found to be a scale invariant power
law distribution essentially identical to the observed CDF for the total energy
released in coronal flares. This suggests that coronal flares and the
photospheric $Q_i$ are correlated, and powered by the same process. The model
predicts spikes in $Q_i$ with values orders of magnitude above background
values. These spikes are driven by spikes in the non-force free component of
the current density. The times of these spikes are plausibly correlated with
times of subsequent M or X flares a few hours to a few days later. The spikes
occur on granulation scales, and may be signatures of heating in horizontal
current sheets. It is also found that the times of relatively large values of
the rate of change of the NLR unsigned magnetic flux are also plausibly
correlated with the times of subsequent M and X flares, and spikes in $Q_i$.

show that this approach not only allows to train spectral consistent GANs that
are avoiding high frequency errors. Also, we show that a correct approximation

of this letter is to showcase a complete NDAE model of WDN followed by
computing Lipschitz constants of the vector-valued nonlinearity in that model.
The computation of Lipschitz constants of hydraulic models is crucial as it
paves the way to apply a plethora of control-theoretic studies for water system

and Blue (RYGB) LDs for each AP. An angle diversity receiver (ADR) is used in
each system with different orientations. The optimised resource allocations in
terms of wavelengths and access point (AP) is obtained by using a mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP) model. The channel bandwidth and SINR are determined
in the two scenarios in all systems. The results show that a change in the
orientation of the receiver can affect the level of channel bandwidth and SINR.
However, SINRs in both scenarios for all users are above the threshold (15.6
dB). The SINR obtained can support t data rate of 5.7 Gbps in both scenarios in
all systems.

architecture needs to be versatile in order to handle a variety of use cases.
While network slicing has been proposed as a way to provide such versatility,
it is also important to ensure that slices do not adversely interfere with each
other. In other words, isolation among network slices is needed. Additionally,
the large number of use cases also implies a large number of users, making it
imperative that 5G architectures scale efficiently. In this paper we propose
IsoRAN, which provides isolation and scaling along with the flexibility needed
for 5G architecture. In IsoRAN, users are processed by daemon threads in the
Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN) architecture. Our design allows users from
different use cases to be executed, in a distributed manner, on the most
efficient hardware to ensure that the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met
while minimising power consumption. Our experiments show that IsoRAN handles
users with different SLA while providing isolation to reduce interference. This
increased isolation reduces the drop rate for different users from 42% to
nearly 0% in some cases. Finally, we run large scale simulations on real traces
to show the benefits for power consumption and cost reduction scale while
increasing the number of base stations.

protostellar jets are launched from the dust-sublimation regions of the
accretion disks (<0.3 au). However, formation and survival of molecules in
inner protostellar disk winds, in the presence of a harsh FUV radiation field
and the absence of dust, remain unexplored. We aim at determining if simple
molecules can be synthesized and spared in fast and collimated dust-free disk
winds or if a fraction of dust is necessary to explain the observed molecular
abundances. This work is based on the Paris-Durham shock code designed to model
irradiated environments. Fundamental properties of the dust-free chemistry are
investigated from single point models. A laminar 1D disk wind model is then
built using a parametric flow geometry. This model includes time-dependent
chemistry and the attenuation of the radiation field by gas-phase
photoprocesses. We show that a small fraction of H2 (< 1e-2), primarily formed
through the H- route, can efficiently initiate molecule synthesis such as CO
and SiO above TK ~ 800 K. The attenuation of the radiation field by atomic
species (eg. C, Si, S) proceeds through continuum self-shielding. This process
ensures efficient formation of CO, OH, SiO, H2O through neutral-neutral
reactions, and the survival of these molecules. Class 0 dust-free winds with
high mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}_w >$ 2e-6 Msun/yr) are predicted to be rich in
molecules if warm (TK > 800 K). The molecular content of disk winds is very
sensitive to the presence of dust and a mass-fraction of surviving dust as
small as 1e-5 significantly increases the H2O and SiO abundances. Chemistry of
high-velocity jets is a powerful tool to probe their content in dust and
uncover their launching point. Models of internal shocks are required to fully
exploit the current (sub-)millimeter observations and prepare future JWST
observations.

clinical practice. When a prediction model is developed in a given source
cohort, there is often a great interest to apply the model to other cohorts.
However, due to potential discrepancy in baseline disease incidences between
different cohorts and shifts in patient composition, the risk predicted by the
original model often under- or over-estimates the risk in the new cohort. The
remedy of such a poorly calibrated prediction is needed for proper medical
decision-making. In this article, we assume the relative risks of predictors
are the same between the two cohorts, and propose a novel weighted estimating
equation approach to re-calibrating the projected risk for the targeted
population through updating the baseline risk. The recalibration leverages the
knowledge about the overall survival probabilities for the disease of interest
and competing events, and the summary information of risk factors from the
targeted population. The proposed re-calibrated risk estimators gain efficiency
if the risk factor distributions are the same for both the source and target
cohorts, and are robust with little bias if they differ. We establish the
consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform very well
in terms of robustness and efficiency in finite samples. A real data
application to colorectal cancer risk prediction also illustrates that the
proposed method can be used in practice for model recalibration.

estimates of these features. Unfortunately, in general, such estimators may not
be asymptotically efficient, which often makes these estimators difficult to
use as a basis for inference. Though there are several existing methods to
construct asymptotically efficient plug-in estimators, each such method either
can only be derived using knowledge of efficiency theory or is only valid under
stringent smoothness assumptions. Among existing methods, sieve estimators
stand out as particularly convenient because efficiency theory is not required

and they are universal in the sense that the same fits lead to efficient
plug-in estimators for a rich class of estimands. Inspired by these desirable
properties, we propose two novel universal approaches for estimating

Compared to traditional sieve estimators, these approaches are valid under more

posteriori risk classification mechanism to set the premium for the next
contract period based on a policyholder's claim history. Even though recent
literature reports evidence of a significant dependence between frequency and
severity, the current BMS practice is to use a frequency-based transition rule
while ignoring severity information. Although Oh et al. (2019) claim that the
frequency-driven BMS transition rule can accommodate the dependence between
frequency and severity, their proposal is only a partial solution, as the
transition rule still completely ignores the claim severity and is unable to
penalize large claims. In this study, we propose to use the BMS with a
transition rule based on both frequency and size of claim, based on the
bivariate random effect model, which conveniently allows dependence between
frequency and severity. We analytically derive the optimal relativities under
the proposed BMS framework and show that the proposed BMS outperforms the
existing frequency-driven BMS. Later numerical experiments are also provided
using both hypothetical and actual datasets in order to assess the effect of
various dependencies on the BMS risk classification and confirm our theoretical
findings.

important to develop robust benchmarking techniques to gauge the capacity of
quantum hardware specifically for the purpose of fermionic simulation. Here we
propose using the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model as an application
benchmark for variational quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices.
Since the one-dimensional Hubbard model is both strongly correlated and exactly
solvable with the Bethe ansatz, it provides a reference ground state energy
that a given device with limited coherence will be able to approximate up to a
maximal size. The length of the largest chain that can be simulated provides an
effective fermionic length. We use variational quantum eigensolver to
approximate the ground state energy values of Fermi-Hubbard instances and show
how the fermionic length benchmark can be used in practice to assess the
performance of bounded-depth devices in a scalable fashion.

dream engine, which is not prohibited by the thermodynamic second law. Some
years ago, a two-terminal heat engine with {\em asymmetric} Onsager

Casati [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 230602 (2011)], as a prototypical system to
make such a dream come true with non-divergent system parameter values.
However, such a system has never been realized in spite of many trials. Here,
we introduce an exactly solvable two-terminal Brownian heat engine with the
asymmetric Onsager coefficients in the presence of a Lorenz (magnetic) force.
Nevertheless, we show that the dream engine regime cannot be accessible even
with the asymmetric Onsager coefficients, due to an instability keeping the
engine from reaching its steady state. This is consistent with recent trade-off
relations between the engine power and efficiency, where the (cyclic)
steady-state condition is implicitly presumed. We conclude that the
inaccessibility to the dream engine originates from the steady-state constraint
on the engine.

classifier to obtain the labels of the environment. The transference of
semantic information between the labelled image and the lidar point cloud is

probabilities to all the semantic classes contained in the labelled images.
Then, the lidar points are corrected to compensate for the vehicle's motion
given the difference between the timestamps of each lidar scan and camera
image. In a third step, we calculate the pixel coordinate for the corresponding
camera image. In the last step we perform the transfer of semantic information
from the heuristic probability images to the lidar frame, while removing the

the drifting coefficient of the field cluster mass function is presented.
Analyzing the data from the Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations, we first
determine the numerical mass functions of the field clusters at various
redshifts. Then, we compare the numerical results with the analytical model
characterized by a single parameter called the drifting coefficient which
measures the drifts of the collapse density threshold, $\delta_{c}$, from the
Einstein-de Sitter spherical value, $\delta_{sc}$, at a given mass scale. It is
found that the analytic model for the field cluster mass function is found to
work excellently even in the presence of massive neutrinos and that its
drifting coefficient evolves differently in the cosmologies with different
values of $M_{\nu}$. At low redshifts ($z\lesssim 0.3$) the more massive
neutrinos drift $\delta_{c}$ further from $\delta_{sc}$, while the opposite
trend is found at higher redshifts ($z\gtrsim0.3$). Speculating that this
distinct redshift-dependent effect of massive neutrinos on the drifting
coefficient of the field cluster mass function might help break the
$\sigma_{8}$-$M_{\nu}$ degeneracy, we also show that the sensitivity of this
new diagnostics to $M_{\nu}$ is high enough to discriminate the case of
$M_{\nu}=0.1\,{\rm eV}$ from that of massless neutrinos.

Meta-learning for few-shot learning offers a potential solution to this
problem: by learning to learn across data from many previous tasks, few-shot
learning algorithms can discover the structure among tasks to enable fast
learning of new tasks. However, a critical challenge in few-shot learning is
task ambiguity: even when a powerful prior can be meta-learned from a large
number of prior tasks, a small dataset for a new task can simply be very
ambiguous to acquire a single model for that task. The Bayesian meta-learning
models can naturally resolve this problem by putting a sophisticated prior
distribution and let the posterior well regularized through Bayesian decision
theory. However, currently known Bayesian meta-learning procedures such as
VERSA suffer from the so-called {\it information preference problem}, that is,
the posterior distribution is degenerated to one point and is far from the
exact one. To address this challenge, we design a novel meta-regularization
objective using {\it cyclical annealing schedule} and {\it maximum mean
discrepancy} (MMD) criterion. The cyclical annealing schedule is quite
effective at avoiding such degenerate solutions. This procedure includes a
difficult KL-divergence estimation, but we resolve the issue by employing MMD
instead of KL-divergence. The experimental results show that our approach
substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms.

Mochizuki which asserts that a $p$-adic field is determined by its absolute
Galois group equipped with its (upper numbering) ramification filtration.
However as there exist many non-isomorphic $p$-adic fields with topologically
isomorphic Galois groups, the ramification filtration itself is fluid i.e. a
variable and this variable controls amongst many other things, the additive
structure of a $p$-adic local field, and Mochizuki's remarkable suggestion is
that this fluidity can and should be exploited in proving theorems in number
theory. In this paper I provide a number of results which illustrate the

lack of the reliable observed negative data. A popular and effective approach
for implicit recommendation is to treat unobserved data as negative but
downweight their confidence. Naturally, how to assign confidence weights and
how to handle the large number of the unobserved data are two key problems for
implicit recommendation models. However, existing methods either pursuit fast
learning by manually assigning simple confidence weights, which lacks
flexibility and may create empirical bias in evaluating user's preference; or
adaptively infer personalized confidence weights but suffer from low
efficiency. To achieve both adaptive weights assignment and efficient model
learning, we propose a fast adaptively weighted matrix factorization (FAWMF)
based on variational auto-encoder. The personalized data confidence weights are
adaptively assigned with a parameterized neural network (function) and the
network can be inferred from the data. Further, to support fast and stable
learning of FAWMF, a new specific batch-based learning algorithm fBGD has been
developed, which trains on all feedback data but its complexity is linear to
the number of observed data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FAWMF and its learning algorithm

prescribed rules, to investigate the flow rate enhancement from a hopper. This
phenomenon was originally reported in the literature as a feature of placing an
obstacle at an optimal location near the exit of a hopper discharging athermal
granular particles under gravity. We find that this phenomenon is limited to a
system of sufficiently many particles. In addition to the waiting room effect,
another mechanism able to explain and create the flow rate enhancement is the
concentration mechanism of particles on their way to reaching the hopper exit
after passing the obstacle. We elucidate the concentration mechanism by
decomposing the flow rate into its constituent variables: the local area
packing fraction $\phi_l^E$ and the averaged particle velocity $v_y^E$ at the
hopper exit. In comparison to the case without an obstacle, our results show
that an optimally placed obstacle can create a net flow rate enhancement of
relatively weakly driven particles, caused by the exit-bottleneck coupling if
$\phi_l^E > \phi_o^c$, where $\phi_o^c$ is a characteristic area packing
fraction marking a transition from fast to slow flow regimes of Tetris
particles. Utilizing the concentration mechanism by artificially guiding
particles into the central sparse space under the obstacle or narrowing the
hopper exit angle under the obstacle, we can create a man-made flow rate peak
of relatively strongly-driven particles that initially exhibit no flow rate
peak. Additionally, the enhanced flow rate can be maximized by an optimal
obstacle shape, particle acceleration rate towards the hopper exit, or exit
geometry of the hopper.

event-driven message that carries emergency warning information in
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Three important characteristics that distinguish
warning messages from ordinary vehicular messages are sporadicity, crowding,
and ultra-time-criticality. In other words, warning messages come only once in
a while in a sporadic manner; however, when they come, they tend to come as a
crowd and they need to be delivered in short order. This paper puts forth a
medium-access control (MAC) protocol for warning messages. To circumvent
potential inefficiency arising from sporadicity, we propose an override network
architecture whereby warning messages are delivered on the spectrum of the
ordinary vehicular messages. Specifically, a vehicle with a warning message
first sends an interrupt signal to pre-empt the transmission of ordinary
messages, so that the warning message can use the wireless spectrum originally
allocated to ordinary messages. In this way, no exclusive spectrum resources
need to be pre-allocated to the sporadic warning messages. To meet the crowding
and ultra-time-criticality aspects, we use advanced channel access techniques
to ensure highly reliable delivery of warning messages within an ultra-short
time in the order of 10 ms. In short, the overall MAC protocol operates by
means of interrupt-and-access.

were detected in both of these wavebands with a dominant period of $\sim 47$
days. The $\gamma$-ray QPO lasted for over 450 days (from MJD 56800 to 57250)
resulting in over nine observed cycles which is among the highest number of
periods ever detected in a blazar light curve. The optical light curve was not
well sampled for almost half of the $\gamma$-ray QPO span due to the daytime
transit of the source, which could explain the lower significance of the
optical QPO. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling of the
light curve revealed a significant, exponentially decaying, trend in the light
curve during the QPO, along with the $47$ days periodicity. We explore several
physical models to explain the origin of this transient quasi-periodic
modulation and the overall trend in the observed flux with a month-like period.
These scenarios include a binary black hole system, a hotspot orbiting close to
the innermost stable circular orbit of the supermassive black hole, and
precessing jets. We conclude that the most likely scenario involves a region of
enhanced emission moving helically inside a curved jet. The helical motion
gives rise to the QPO and the curvature ($\sim 0.05^{\circ}$ pc$^{-1}$) of the

The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two losses,

from preserving the relative ordering of hash codes. A novel discrete
optimization strategy based on straight through estimator (STE) with guidance
is proposed. The principal idea is to avoid gradient magnification in
back-propagation of STE with continuous embedding guidance, in which we begin
from learning an easier network that mimic the continuous embedding and let it
evolve during the training until it finally goes back to STE. Comprehensive

radio frequency with milliseconds duration. Observationally, FRBs can be
divided into two classes, repeating FRBs and non-repeating FRBs. At present,
twenty repeating FRBs have been discovered with unknown physical origins.
Localization of the first repeating FRB 121102 and discovery of an associated
persistent radio source support that FRBs are powered by young millisecond
magnetars, which could be formed by core-collapses of massive stars or binary
neutron stars mergers. These two formation channels can be distinguished by
gravitational waves generated by binary neutron stars mergers. We first
calculate the lower limit of the local formation rate of repeating FRBs

young magnetars from binary neutron star mergers, basing on the gravitational
wave detections by the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO/Virgo

a new dataset called ETRI-Activity3D, focusing on the daily activities of the

follows: 1) practical action categories that are selected from the close
observation of the daily lives of the elderly; 2) realistic data collection,
which reflects the robot's working environment and service situations; and 3) a
large-scale dataset that overcomes the limitations of the current 3D activity
analysis benchmark datasets. The proposed dataset contains 112,620 samples
including RGB videos, depth maps, and skeleton sequences. During the data
acquisition, 100 subjects were asked to perform 55 daily activities.
Additionally, we propose a novel network called four-stream adaptive CNN
(FSA-CNN). The proposed FSA-CNN has three main properties: robustness to
spatio-temporal variations, input-adaptive activation function, and extension
of the conventional two-stream approach. In the experiment section, we
confirmed the superiority of the proposed FSA-CNN using NTU RGB+D and
ETRI-Activity3D. Further, the domain difference between both groups of age was
verified experimentally. Finally, the extension of FSA-CNN to deal with the

predictors. The main question we address is whether one can improve over the
minimax regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for learning over $T$ rounds, when the
total error of the predictor $\mathcal{E} \leq T$ is relatively small. We
provide a complete answer to this question, including upper and lower bounds
for various settings: adversarial versus stochastic environments, known versus
unknown $\mathcal{E}$, and single versus multiple predictors. We show several
surprising results, such as 1) the optimal regret is
$\mathcal{O}(\min\{\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{\mathcal{E}}T^\frac{1}{4}\})$ when
$\mathcal{E}$ is known, a sharp contrast to the standard and better bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\mathcal{E}})$ for non-contextual problems (such as
multi-armed bandits); 2) the same bound cannot be achieved if $\mathcal{E}$ is
unknown, but as a remedy, $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\mathcal{E}}T^\frac{1}{3})$ is
achievable; 3) with $M$ predictors, a linear dependence on $M$ is necessary,
even if logarithmic dependence is possible for non-contextual problems.
  We also develop several novel algorithmic techniques to achieve matching
upper bounds, including 1) a key action remapping technique for optimal regret
with known $\mathcal{E}$, 2) implementing Catoni's robust mean estimator
efficiently via an ERM oracle leading to an efficient algorithm in the
stochastic setting with optimal regret, 3) constructing an underestimator for
$\mathcal{E}$ via estimating the histogram with bins of exponentially
increasing size for the stochastic setting with unknown $\mathcal{E}$, and 4) a
self-referential scheme for learning with multiple predictors, all of which
might be of independent interest.

calculations of the J-integral on a single-edge-notch-bend (SENB) specimen,
with individual bars modeled as beams having a linear elastic or a power-law
elasto-plastic constitutive behavior and a maximum strain-based damage model.
Results for three 2D isotropic lattice topologies (triangular, hexagonal and
kagome) and two constituent materials (representative of a brittle ceramic
(silicon carbide) and a strain hardening elasto-plastic metal (titanium alloy))
are presented. We extract initial fracture toughness and R-curves for all
lattices and show that (i) elastic brittle triangular lattices exhibit
toughening (rising R-curve), and (ii) elasto-plastic triangular lattices
display significant toughening, while elasto-plastic hexagonal lattices fail in
a brittle manner. We show that the difference in such failure behavior can be
explained by the size of the plastic zone that grows upon crack propagation,
and conclude that the nature of crack propagation in lattices (brittle vs
ductile) depends both on the constituent material and the lattice architecture.
While results are presented for 2D truss-lattices, the proposed approach can be
easily applied to 3D truss and shell-lattices, as long as the crack tip lies
within the empty space of a unit cell.

trapped EE contribution to ZFZF generation is dominated by EE responses to eBAE
in the ideal region, and is comparable to thermal plasma contribution to
Reynolds and Maxwell stresses.

well-tuned fully supervised baseline that yielded a balanced accuracy (BA) of

estimate the final spin of a rotating binary black hole merger in STU
supergravity. According to the BKL recipe, the final spin can be viewed as the
sum of the individual spins plus the orbital angular momentum of the binary
system which could be approximated as the angular momentum of a test particle
orbiting at the innermost stable circular orbit around the final black hole.
Unlike previous works, we consider the contribution of the orbital angular
momentum of the binary system to the final spin by requiring the test particle
to preserve the scaling symmetry in the Lagrangian of supergravity. We find
some subtle differences between two cases corresponding to whether the symmetry
is taken into account or not. In the equal initial spin configuration, when the
initial black holes are non-spinning, the final spin of the merger is always
larger than that in the case in which the symmetry is not imposed although the
general behaviors are similar. The difference increases firstly and then
decreases as the initial mass ratio approaches unity. Besides, as the initial
spins exceed a threshold, the final spin is always smaller than that in the
case where the scaling symmetry is not considered. The difference decreases
constantly as the equal initial mass limit is approached. All these features
exist in the merger of a binary STU black hole with different charge
configurations. We also study the final spin's difference between different
charge configurations and different initial spin configurations.

optical flow between video frames, especially to solve the occlusion problem.
Occlusion is caused by the movement of an object or the movement of the camera,
defined as when certain pixels are visible in one video frame but not in
adjacent frames. Due to the lack of pixel correspondence between frames in the
occluded area, incorrect photometric loss calculation can mislead the optical
flow training process. In the video sequence, we found that the occlusion in
the forward ($t\rightarrow t+1$) and backward ($t\rightarrow t-1$) frame pairs
are usually complementary. That is, pixels that are occluded in subsequent
frames are often not occluded in the previous frame and vice versa. Therefore,
by using this complementarity, a new weighted loss is proposed to solve the
occlusion problem. In addition, we calculate gradients in multiple directions
to provide richer supervision information. Our method achieves competitive
optical flow accuracy compared to the baseline and some supervised methods on

a centralized approach, in which all baseband data received by each antenna has
to be sent to a central processing unit (CPU) to be processed. Due to the
enormous amount of antennas expected in massive MIMO base stations (BSs), the
number of connections to the CPU required in centralized massive MIMO is not
scalable. In recent literature decentralized approaches have been proposed to
reduce the number of connections between the antennas and the CPU. However, the
reduction in the connections to the CPU requires more outputs per antenna to be
generated. We study the trade-off between number of connections to the CPU and
number of outputs per antenna. We propose a generalized architecture that
allows exploitation of this trade-off, and we define a novel matrix
decomposition that allows lossless linear equalization within our proposed
architecture.

fraction of resonant systems to non-resonant systems provides clues about their
formation history. We investigated the orbital stability of planets in resonant
chains by considering the long-term evolution of planetary mass and stellar
mass and using orbital calculations. We found that while resonant chains were
stable, they can be destabilized by a change of $\sim$10% in planetary mass.
Such a mass evolution can occur by atmospheric escape due to photoevaporation.
We also found that resonant chains can be broken by a stellar mass loss of
$\lesssim1$%, which would be explained by stellar winds or coronal mass
ejections. The long-term mass change of planets and stars plays an important

develop the Weighted Recurrent Quality Enhancement (WRQE) network, which takes

WRQE, the memory and update signal are weighted by quality features to
reasonably leverage multi-frame information for enhancement. In our HLVC

high quality information facilitates the compression and enhancement of low

from the CFD community. However, the introduction of a machine learning (ML)
model introduces a new source of uncertainty, the ML model itself.
Quantification of this uncertainty is essential since the predictive capability
of a data-driven model diminishes when predicting physics not seen during
training. In this work, we explore the suitability of Mondrian forests (MF's)
for data-driven turbulence modelling. MF's are claimed to possess many of the
advantages of the commonly used random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm,
whilst offering principled uncertainty estimates. An example test case is
constructed, with a turbulence anisotropy constant derived from high fidelity
turbulence resolving simulations. Shapley values, borrowed from game theory,
are used to interpret the MF predictions. Predictive uncertainty is found to be
large in regions where the training data is not representative. Additionally,
the MF predictive uncertainty is found to exhibit stronger correlation with
predictive errors compared to an a priori statistical distance measure, which
indicates it is a better measure of prediction confidence. The MF predictive
uncertainty is also found to be better calibrated and less computationally
costly than the uncertainty estimated from applying jackknifing to random
forest predictions. Finally, Mondrian forests are used to predict the Reynolds
discrepancies in a convergent-divergent channel, which are subsequently
propagated through a modified CFD solver. The resulting flowfield predictions
are in close agreement with the high fidelity data. A procedure for sampling
the Mondrian forests' uncertainties is introduced. Propagating these samples
enables quantification of the uncertainty in output quantities of interest.

Flow-based analysis can reveal important information. For instance, financial

networks with significant flow of money transfers. In this paper, we introduce
the flow computation problem in an interaction network or a subgraph thereof.
We propose and study two models of flow computation, one based on a greedy flow

the greedy flow computation problem can be easily solved by a single scan of
the interactions in time order. For the harder maximum flow problem, we propose
graph precomputation and simplification approaches that can greatly reduce its
complexity in practice. As an application of flow computation, we formulate and
solve the problem of flow pattern search, where, given a graph pattern, the
objective is to find its instances and their flows in a large interaction

the techniques proposed in this paper can greatly reduce the cost of flow

first phase, the method relies on the Deep Optimal Stopping algorithm, which
learns the optimal stopping rule from Monte-Carlo samples of the underlying
risk factors. Cashflow-paths are then created by applying the learned stopping
strategy on a new set of realizations of the risk factors. Furthermore, in a
second phase the risk factors are regressed against the cashflow-paths to
obtain approximations of pathwise option values. The regression step is carried
out by ordinary least squares as well as neural networks, and it is shown that
the latter produces more accurate approximations.
  The expected exposure is formulated, both in terms of the cashflow-paths and
in terms of the pathwise option values and it is shown that a simple
Monte-Carlo average yields accurate approximations in both cases. The potential
future exposure is estimated by the empirical $\alpha$-percentile.
  Finally, it is shown that the expected exposures, as well as the potential
future exposures can be computed under either, the risk neutral measure, or the
real world measure, without having to re-train the neural networks.

Bose-Einstein condensates via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Both
energetic instability during avoided crossings and dynamical instability during
chaotic intervals limit adiabaticity and impose {\em low} sweep-rate boundaries
on the efficiency of the process. For the diabatic traverse of avoided
crossings, we find a reciprocal power-law dependence of the final unconverted
population on sweep rate. For the traverse of chaos, we find a sharp low-rate
boundary determined by the dynamical instability parameters. The interplay of
these two mechanisms determines which instability controls the failure of
molecular production. A judicious choice of sweep parameters is hence required
to restore the process efficiency.

Amazon, OneWeb, and others, with over 26,000 satellites, constituting a
representative distribution. This study uses a series of simplifications and
assumptions to obtain conservative, order-of-magnitude estimates of the
effects.
  The number of illuminated satellites from the constellations above the
horizon ranges from ~1600 right after sunset, decreasing to 1100 at the end of
astronomical twilight, most of them (~85%) close to the horizon (< 30deg). The
large majority of these satellites will be too faint to be seen with the naked
eye: at astronomical twilight, 110 brighter than mag 5. Most of them (~95%)
will be close to the horizon. The number of naked-eye satellites plummets as
the Sun reaches 30-40 deg below the horizon, depending on the latitude and
season.
  The light trails caused by satellites would ruin a small fraction (below the
1% level) of exposures using narrow to normal field imaging or spectroscopic
techniques in the visible and near IR during the first and last hours of the
night. Similarly, the thermal emission of the satellite would affect only a
negligible fraction of thermal IR observations. However, wide-field exposures,
as well as long medium-field exposures,would be affected at the 3% level during
the first and last hours of the night. Furthermore, ultra-wide imaging
exposures on a very large telescope (eg NSF's Rubin Observatory, LSST), would
be significantly affected, with 30 to 40% of such exposures being compromised
during the first and last hours of the night.
  Coordination between the astronomical community, satellites companies, and
government agencies is therefore critical to minimise and mitigate the effect
on astronomical observations, in particular on survey telescopes.

easy to fool, assuming that an adversary is able to slightly modify their
inputs. Many papers have proposed adversarial attacks, defenses and methods to
measure robustness to such adversarial perturbations. However, most commonly
considered adversarial examples are based on $\ell_p$-bounded perturbations in
the input space of the neural network, which are unlikely to arise naturally.
Recently, especially in computer vision, researchers discovered ""natural"" or
""semantic"" perturbations, such as rotations, changes of brightness, or more
high-level changes, but these perturbations have not yet been systematically
utilized to measure the performance of classifiers. In this paper, we propose
several metrics to measure robustness of classifiers to natural adversarial
examples, and methods to evaluate them. These metrics, called latent space
performance metrics, are based on the ability of generative models to capture
probability distributions, and are defined in their latent spaces. On three
image classification case studies, we evaluate the proposed metrics for several
classifiers, including ones trained in conventional and robust ways. We find
that the latent counterparts of adversarial robustness are associated with the
accuracy of the classifier rather than its conventional adversarial robustness,
but the latter is still reflected on the properties of found latent
perturbations. In addition, our novel method of finding latent adversarial
perturbations demonstrates that these perturbations are often perceptually
small.

contrast-agnostic semantic segmentation of completely unpreprocessed brain MRI
scans, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning for new modalities.
Classical Bayesian methods address this segmentation problem with unsupervised
intensity models, but require significant computational resources. In contrast,
learning-based methods can be fast at test time, but are sensitive to the data
available at training. Our proposed learning method, SynthSeg, leverages a set
of training segmentations (no intensity images required) to generate synthetic
sample images of widely varying contrasts on the fly during training. These
samples are produced using the generative model of the classical Bayesian
segmentation framework, with randomly sampled parameters for appearance,
deformation, noise, and bias field. Because each mini-batch has a different
synthetic contrast, the final network is not biased towards any MRI contrast.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach on four datasets comprising over 1,000
subjects and four types of MR contrast. The results show that our approach
successfully segments every contrast in the data, performing slightly better
than classical Bayesian segmentation, and three orders of magnitude faster.
Moreover, even within the same type of MRI contrast, our strategy generalizes
significantly better across datasets, compared to training using real images.
Finally, we find that synthesizing a broad range of contrasts, even if
unrealistic, increases the generalization of the neural network. Our code and
model are open source at https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg.

during the period June 1-30, 2015 (MJD 57174-57203). The highest emission state
in the $\gamma$-ray band detected by the \emph{Fermi}-LAT exhibits a peak flux
of $\sim$ 2$\times$10$^{-7}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ which is more than 25 times
the flux level measured in the low activity state of the source. The temporal
analysis of the daily \emph{Fermi}-LAT light curve suggests that the giant
flaring episode has characteristic rise and decay times less than one day. The
optical daily light curves in B, V, R, and J bands also indicate the flaring
activity from 3C 279 with flux levels peaking for two days on June 16-17, 2015
(MJD 57189-57190). The discrete correlation function analysis indicates a time
lag of 1 day or longer between the $\gamma$-ray and optical peaks during the
flaring episode. The $\gamma$-ray emission is also observed to show a
harder-when-brighter behaviour whereas optical emission exhibits an opposite
behaviour. The $\gamma$-ray emission region during the flare is observed to be
very compact and is located close to the base of the jet. The degree of linear
polarization in the wavelength range 500-700 nm measured using SPOL during this
period is also highly variable with a peak of $\sim$ 30$\%$ one day after the
$\gamma$-ray flare. Near simultaneous $\gamma$-ray flux points show a linear
anti-correlation with the degree of polarization during the period of
$\gamma$-ray flare. The significant drop in the degree of linear polarization
suggests a sudden increase in the tangled magnetic field strength in the
emission region.

After decades of quiescence, the $\rm{M_w}$ 6.8 Elaz{\i}\u{g} earthquake
(January 24, 2020) has recently reminded us that the East Anatolian Fault (EAF)
is also capable of producing significant earthquakes. To better estimate the
seismic hazard associated with these two faults, we jointly invert
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and GPS data to image the
spatial distribution of interseismic coupling along the eastern part of both
the North and East Anatolian Faults. We perform the inversion in a Bayesian
framework, enabling to estimate uncertainties on both long-term relative plate
motion and coupling. We find that coupling is high and deep (0-20 km) on the
NAF and heterogeneous and superficial (0-5 km) on the EAF. Our model predicts
that the Elaz{\i}\u{g} earthquake released between 200 and 250 years of
accumulated moment, suggesting a bi-centennial recurrence time.

magnetorotationally (MR) driven shock expansion immediately initiates after
bounce in our rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized model. We show that the
expansion of the MR-driven flows toward the polar directions is predominantly
driven by the magnetic pressure, whereas the shock expansion toward the
equatorial direction is supported by neutrino heating. Our detailed analysis
indicates that the growth of the so-called kink instability may hinder the
collimation of jets, resulting in the formation of broader outflows.
Furthermore we find a dipole emission of lepton number, only in the MR
explosion model, whose asymmetry is consistent with the explosion morphology.
Although it is similar to the lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry

that it is not associated with the LESA. We also report several unique neutrino

open question. Some learned image compression methods use multiple networks for
multiple rates, while others use one single model at the expense of
computational complexity increase and performance degradation. In this paper,
we propose a continuously rate adjustable learned image compression framework,
Asymmetric Gained Variational Autoencoder (AG-VAE). AG-VAE utilizes a pair of
gain units to achieve discrete rate adaptation in one single model with a
negligible additional computation. Then, by using exponential interpolation,
continuous rate adaptation is achieved without compromising performance.
Besides, we propose the asymmetric Gaussian entropy model for more accurate
entropy estimation. Exhaustive experiments show that our method achieves
comparable quantitative performance with SOTA learned image compression methods
and better qualitative performance than classical image codecs. In the ablation

efficient construction for integer alphabets (Farach-Colton, 1997). However,
these solutions require $\Theta(n)$ space, which is prohibitive in many

notion of closure-phase invented in the context of interferometry, but that
applies to well corrected diffraction dominated images produced by an arbitrary
aperture. The linear model upon which it relies theoretically leads to the
formation of observable quantities robust against residual aberrations. In
practice, detection limits reported thus far seem to be dominated by systematic
errors induced by calibration biases not sufficiently filtered out by the
kernel projection operator. This paper focuses on the impact the initial
modeling of the aperture has on these errors and introduces a strategy to
mitigate them, using a more accurate aperture transmission model. The paper
first uses idealized monochromatic simulations of a non trivial aperture to
illustrate the impact modeling choices have on calibration errors. It then
applies the outlined prescription to two distinct data-sets of images whose
analysis has previously been published. The use of a transmission model to
describe the aperture results in a significant improvement over the previous
type of analysis. The thus reprocessed data-sets generally lead to more
accurate results, less affected by systematic errors. As kernel-phase observing
programs are becoming more ambitious, accuracy in the aperture description is
becoming paramount to avoid situations where contrast detection limits are
dominated by systematic errors. Prescriptions outlined in this paper will
benefit any attempt at exploiting kernel-phase for high-contrast detection.

to efficient heating of the planet well into temperate climates, by limiting
CH$_4$ amounts, which would otherwise run into anti-greenhouse for such planets

spectral observations: First, NO$_2$ becomes the major absorber in the visible,
which greatly impacts the Rayleigh slope. Second, H$_2$O features can be masked
by CH$_4$ (near infra-red) and CO$_2$ (mid to far infra-red), making them
non-detectable in transmission. Third, O$_3$ is destroyed and instead HNO$_3$
features become clearly visible in the mid to far infra-red. Lastly, assuming a
few percent of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere, CO$_2$ absorption at 5.3 $\mu$m
becomes significant (for flare and non-flare cases), strongly overlapping with

disordered porous media. As the reference system a hard spherocylinder fluid in
a disordered porous medium is considered and described in the framework of the
scaled particle theory with the Carnahan-Starling and Parsons-Lee corrections.
The attractive part of interaction is treated in the framework of the mean
field approximation in which due to orientational dependence of the excluded
volume of two spherocylinders, a coupling between attractive and repulsive
contributions is found. We focus on spherocylinder fluids with sufficiently
long particle lengths for which the nematic-nematic transition was established.
It is shown that these two nematic phases have different densities and are
characterized by different orientational ordering. Strong influence of the type
of interparticle attraction on the phase behaviour of anisotropic fluids in
disordered porous media is established. Three simple models for this purpose
are considered, namely a model with the Lennard-Jones anisotropic attraction, a
model with modified Lennard-Jones attraction and a model with anisotropic
square-well potential. For all considered models, the phase diagram shifts to
the region of lower densities and lower temperatures as the porosity decreases.

distributions (SEDs) of large-scale jet knots in 3C 273 is presented for
revealing their X-ray radiation mechanism. We show that these SEDs cannot be
explained with a single electron population model when the Doppler boosting
effect is either considered or not. By adding a more energetic electron (the
leptonic model) or proton (the hadronic model) population, the SEDs of all
knots are well represented. In the leptonic model, the electron population that
contributes the X-ray emission is more energetic than the one responsible for
the radio-optical emission by almost two orders of magnitude; the derived
equipartition magnetic field strengths (B_eq) are ~0.1 mG. In the hadronic
model, the protons with energy of ~20 PeV are required to interpret the
observed X-rays; the B_eq values are several mG, larger than that in the
leptonic model. Based on the fact that no resolved substructures are observed
in these knots and the fast cooling-time of the high-energy electrons is
difficult to explain the observed X-ray morphologies, we argue that two
distinct electron populations accelerated in these knots are unreasonable and
their X-ray emission would be attributed to the proton synchrotron radiation
accelerated in these knots. In case of these knots have relativistic motion
towards the observer, the super-Eddington issue of the hadronic model could be
avoided. Multiwavelength polarimetry and the gamma-ray observations with high
resolution may be helpful to discriminate these models.

could potentially perturb motion of these comets. We aim to announce a publicly
available database containing an up to date list of stars and stellar systems
potentially perturbing long period comets motion. We add new objects and revise
previously published lists. Special emphasis was placed on stellar systems.
Discussion on masses estimation is included. Using the astrometry, preferably
from Gaia DR2, augmented with data from other sources, we calculate spatial
positions and velocities for each star. To filter studied objects on the basis
of their minimal heliocentric distances we numerically integrate motion of
stars under the Galactic potential and their mutual interactions. We announce
the updated list of stellar perturbers of cometary motion, including masses of
perturbers along with the publicly available database interface. These data are
ready to be used with the observed long period comets orbits to study an
individual influence of a whole sample of perturbers, or specific stars, on a
dynamical past or future of a specific comet. 147 new perturbers were added in
comparison to the previously published sources. We demonstrate that a new set
of potential perturbers constitute an important tool in studies of cometary
dynamics. The usage of our data significantly changes results of the past and
future comet motion analysis. We point out a puzzling object in our list, star
ALS 9243. The Gaia DR2 astrometry suggests a very close encounter of this star
with the Sun however, its astrophysical parameters result in a completely
different current distance of ALS 9243 and its large mass.

devices to train a machine learning model collaboratively in wireless networks.
By exploiting the superposition nature of wireless waveforms, over-the-air
computation (AirComp) can accelerate model aggregation and hence facilitate
communication-efficient FL. Due to channel fading, power control is crucial in
AirComp. Prior works assume that the signals to be aggregated from each device,
i.e., local gradients have identical statistics. In FL, however, gradient
statistics vary over both training iterations and feature dimensions, and are
unknown in advance. This paper studies the power control problem for
over-the-air FL by taking gradient statistics into account. The goal is to
minimize the aggregation error by optimizing the transmit power at each device
subject to peak power constraints. We obtain the optimal policy in closed form
when gradient statistics are given. Notably, we show that the optimal transmit
power is continuous and monotonically decreases with the squared multivariate
coefficient of variation (SMCV) of gradient vectors. We then propose a method
to estimate gradient statistics with negligible communication cost.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed gradient-statistics-aware
power control achieves higher test accuracy than the existing schemes for a
wide range of scenarios.

for immutable data, namely Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT), Merkle Bucket Tree
(MBT), and Pattern-Oriented-Split Tree (POS-Tree). Although these structures
have been adopted in real applications, there is no systematic evaluation of
their pros and cons in the literature. This makes it difficult for
practitioners to choose the right index structure for their applications, as
there is only a limited understanding of the characteristics of each index.
  To alleviate the above deficiency, we present a comprehensive analysis of the
existing index structures for immutable data, evaluating both their asymptotic
and empirical performance. Specifically, we show that MPT, MBT, and POS-Tree
are all instances of a recently proposed framework, dubbed \my{Structurally
Invariant and Reusable Indexes (SIRI)}. We propose to evaluate the SIRI
instances based on five essential metrics: their efficiency for four index
operations (i.e., lookup, update, comparison, and merge), as well as their
\my{deduplication ratios} (i.e., the size of the index with deduplication over
the size without deduplication). We establish the worst-case guarantees of each

indexes in a large variety of settings. Based on our theoretical and empirical
analysis, we conclude that POS-Tree is a favorable choice for indexing

rates, terminal velocities, and emergent fluxes from basic stellar parameters.
We applied our wind code for parameters corresponding to evolutionary stages
between the asymptotic giant branch and white dwarf phases. We study the
influence of metallicity and wind inhomogeneities (clumping) on the wind
properties. Line-driven winds appear very early after the star leaves the
asymptotic giant branch (at the latest for $T_\rm{eff}\approx10\,$kK) and fade
away at the white dwarf cooling track (below $T_\rm{eff}=105\,$kK). Their
mass-loss rate mostly scales with the stellar luminosity and, consequently, the
mass-loss rate only varies slightly during the transition from the red to the
blue part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. There are the following two
exceptions to the monotonic behavior: a bistability jump at around $20\,$kK,
where the mass-loss rate decreases by a factor of a few (during evolution) due
to a change in iron ionization, and an additional maximum at about
$T_\rm{eff}=40-50\,$kK. On the other hand, the terminal velocity increases from
about a few hundreds of $\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ to a few thousands of
$\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ during the transition as a result of stellar radius
decrease. The wind terminal velocity also significantly increases at the
bistability jump. Derived wind parameters reasonably agree with observations.
The effect of clumping is stronger at the hot side of the bistability jump than
at the cool side. Derived fits to wind parameters can be used in evolutionary
models and in studies of planetary nebula formation. A predicted bistability
jump in mass-loss rates can cause the appearance of an additional shell of
planetary nebula.

This condition makes users desensitized to notifications, causing them to

graph filtering on a graph about which we only know a model. To do this we
leverage the theory of graphons proposed by L. Lovasz and B. Szegedy. We make
three key contributions to the emerging field of graph signal processing. We
show first that filters defined over the scaled adjacency matrix of a random
graph drawn from a graphon converge to filters defined over the Fredholm
integral operator with the graphon as its kernel. Second, leveraging classical
findings from the theory of the numerical solution of Fredholm integral
equations, we define the Fourier-Galerkin shift operator. Lastly, using the
Fourier-Galerkin shift operator, we derive a graph filter design algorithm
which only depends on the graphon, and thus depends only on the probabilistic
structure of the graph instead of the particular graph itself. The derived
graphon filtering algorithm is verified through simulations on a variety of
random graph models.

the state of a dynamical system from partial observations depends crucially on
the prescribed uncertainty of the model dynamics and of the observations. These
are not usually known and have to be inferred. Many approaches have been
proposed to tackle this problem, including fully Bayesian, likelihood
maximization and innovation-based techniques. This work focuses on maximization
of the likelihood function via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to
infer the model error covariance combined with ensemble Kalman filters and
particle filters to estimate the state. The classical application of the EM
algorithm in a data assimilation context involves filtering and smoothing a
fixed batch of observations in order to complete a single iteration. This is an
inconvenience when using sequential filtering in high-dimensional applications.
Motivated by this, an adaptation of the algorithm that can process observations
and update the parameters on the fly, with some underlying simplifications, is
presented. The proposed technique was evaluated and achieved good performance
in experiments with the Lorenz-63 and the 40-variable Lorenz-96 dynamical
systems designed to represent some common scenarios in data assimilation such
as non-linearity, chaoticity and model misspecification.

and improve heat transfer rates due to a low nucleation free-energy barrier and
high droplet mobility. Topographical differences in the oil surface cause water
microdroplets to rigorously self-propel long distances, continuously
redistributing the oil film and potentially refreshing the surface for
re-nucleation. Using high-speed microscopy, we reveal that during water
condensation on LISs, the smallest visible droplets (diameter ~ 1um,
qualitatively representing nucleation) predominantly emerge in oil-poor regions
due to a smaller thermal activation barrier. Considering the significant heat
transfer performance of microdroplets (< 10um) and transient characteristic of
microdroplet movement, we compare the apparent nucleation rate density and
water collection rate for LISs with oils of different viscosity and a solid
hydrophobic surface at a wide range of subcooling temperatures. Generally, the
lowest lubricant viscosity leads to the highest nucleation rate density. We
characterize the length and frequency of microdroplet movement and attribute
the nucleation enhancement primarily to higher droplet mobility and surface
refreshing frequency. Interestingly and unexpectedly, hydrophobic surfaces
outperform high-viscosity LISs at high subcooling temperatures, but are
generally inferior to any of the tested LISs at low temperature differences. To
explain the observed non-linearity between LISs and the solid hydrophobic
surface, we introduce two dominant regimes that influence the condensation
efficiency: mobility-limited and coalescence-limited. Our findings advance the
understanding of dynamic water-lubricant interactions and provide new design
rationales for choosing surfaces for enhanced dropwise condensation and water
collection efficiencies.

and the groomed jet radius ($R_{\rm{g}}$), as defined in the SoftDrop algorihm,
are reported in \pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV collected by the STAR
experiment. These substructure observables are differentially measured for jets
of varying resolution parameters from $R = 0.2 - 0.6$ in the transverse
momentum range $15 < p_{\rm{T, jet}} < 60$ GeV$/c$. These studies show that, in
the $p_{\rm{T, jet}}$ range accessible at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV and with
increasing jet resolution parameter and jet transverse momentum, the
$z_{\rm{g}}$ distribution asymptotically converges to the DGLAP splitting
kernel for a quark radiating a gluon. The groomed jet radius measurements
reflect a momentum-dependent narrowing of the jet structure for jets of a given
resolution parameter, i.e., the larger the $p_{\rm{T, jet}}$, the narrower the
first splitting. For the first time, these fully corrected measurements are
compared to Monte Carlo generators with leading order QCD matrix elements and
leading log in the parton shower, and to state-of-the-art theoretical
calculations at next-to-leading-log accuracy. We observe that PYTHIA 6 with
parameters tuned to reproduce RHIC measurements is able to quantitatively
describe data, whereas PYTHIA 8 and HERWIG 7, tuned to reproduce LHC data, are
unable to provide a simultaneous description of both $z_{\rm{g}}$ and
$R_{\rm{g}}$, resulting in opportunities for fine parameter tuning of these
models for \pp collisions at RHIC energies. We also find that the theoretical
calculations without non-perturbative corrections are able to qualitatively
describe the trend in data for jets of large resolution parameters at high
$p_{\rm{T, jet}}$, but fail at small jet resolution parameters and low jet
transverse momenta.

galaxies, using a well-defined sample of Main Sequence galaxies from MaNGA and
our earlier measurements of the ratio of the SFR averaged within the last 5 Myr
to that averaged over the last 800 Myr. We explore the assumptions of
stationarity and ergodicity that are implicit in this approach. We assume a
single power-law form of the PSD but introduce an additional free parameter,
the ""intrinsic scatter"", to try to account for any non-ergodicity introduced
from various sources. We analyze both an ""integrated"" sample consisting of
global measurements of all of the galaxies, and also 25 sub-samples obtained by
considering five radial regions and five bins of integrated stellar mass.
Assuming that any intrinsic scatter is not the dominant contribution to the
Main Sequence dispersion of galaxies, we find that the PSDs have slopes between
1.0 and 2.0, indicating that the power (per log interval of frequency) is
mostly contributed by longer timescale variations. We find a correlation
between the returned PSDs and the inferred gas depletion times ($\tau_{\rm
dep,eff}$) obtained from application of the extended Schmidt Law, in that
regions with shorter gas depletion times show larger integrated power and
flatter PSD. Intriguingly, it is found that shifting the PSDs by the inferred
$\tau_{\rm dep,eff}$ causes all of the 25 PSDs to closely overlap, at least in
that region where the PSD is best constrained and least affected by
uncertainties about any intrinsic scatter. A possible explanation of these
results is the dynamical response of the gas regulator system of Lilly et al.
2013 to a uniform time-varying inflow, as previously proposed in Wang et al.

$(x_t)_{t<T}$ using (exponential) moving ML estimator $\theta_T=\arg\max_\theta
l_T$ for $l_T=\sum_{t<T} \eta^{T-t} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_t))$ and some

power distribution (EPD) family, which covers wide range of tail behavior like
Gaussian ($\kappa=2$) or Laplace ($\kappa=1$) distribution. It is also
convenient for such adaptive estimation of scale parameter $\sigma$ as its

just replacing average with exponential moving average:
$(\sigma_{T+1})^\kappa=\eta(\sigma_T)^\kappa +(1-\eta)|x_T-\mu|^\kappa$ we can
inexpensively make it adaptive. It is tested on daily log-return series for
DJIA companies, leading to essentially better log-likelihoods than standard

non-odd-transversal if it is non-odd-transversal but deleting any edge results

characterization of the minimal non-odd-transversal hypergraphs by the degrees

use optimization platforms featuring automatic differentiation. Training data

several large international collaborations such as the Euclid space mission,
the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey
(PAUS) and the Marenostrum Institut de Ci\`encies de l'Espai (MICE) numerical
simulations. While originally developed as a PostgreSQL relational database web

Apache Hive, which facilitates scalable reading, writing and managing huge
datasets. As CosmoHub's datasets are seldomly modified, Hive it is a better
fit.
  Over 60 TiB of catalogued information and $50 \times 10^9$ astronomical
objects can be interactively explored using an integrated visualization tool
which includes 1D histogram and 2D heatmap plots. In our current

consider an ocean setting with inertial particles elastically connected forming
a network that floats at the interface with the atmosphere. The network evolves
according to a recently derived and validated Maxey--Riley equation for
inertial particle motion in the ocean. We rigorously show that, under
sufficiently calm wind conditions, rotationally coherent quasigeostrophic
vortices (which have material boundaries that resist outward filamentation)
always possess finite-time attractors for elastic networks if they are
anticyclonic, while if they are cyclonic provided that the networks are
sufficiently stiff. This result is supported numerically under more general
wind conditions and, most importantly, is consistent with observations of rafts
of pelagic \emph{Sargassum}, for which the elastic inertial networks represent
a minimal model. Furthermore, our finding provides an effective mechanism for
the long range transport of \emph{Sargassum}, and thus for its connectivity
between accumulation regions and remote sources.

considerable amount of literature evaluating the accuracy of the original solar

to locations in Europe. This work combines the new ERA5-land reanalysis data
set and PV_LIB to generate hourly time series of photovoltaic electricity
generation for several years and validates the results using individual data of
57 large photovoltaic plants located in Chile. Results are also compared with
PV output for these locations calculated using renewables.ninja, a platform
relying on MERRA-2, a global reanalysis with five times lower spatial
resolution. Accuracy and bias indicators are satisfactory for plants that do
not present severe anomalies in their generation profiles and where basic plant
characteristics such as size and orientation match our model assumptions.
However, the improvements in indicators over results obtained with
renewables.ninja from MERRA-2 are minor. The validation process serves not only
to confirm the suitability of the proposed workflow to model the output of
individual photovoltaic plants, but also to list and discuss data quality and

(AQE) to estimate the gradient. In particular, during back-propagation, the
graph that relates inputs to output remains smoothness and differentiability.
At the end of training, the weights and activations have been quantized to
low-precision because of the asymptotic behaviour of AQE. Meanwhile, we propose
a M-bit Inputs and N-bit Weights Network (MINW-Net) trained by AQE, a quantized
neural network with 1-3 bits weights and activations. In the inference phase,
we can use XNOR or SHIFT operations instead of convolution operations to
accelerate the MINW-Net. Our experiments on CIFAR datasets demonstrate that our
AQE is well defined, and the QNNs with AQE perform better than that with
Straight-Through Estimator (STE). For example, in the case of the same ConvNet
that has 1-bit weights and activations, our MINW-Net with AQE can achieve a
prediction accuracy 1.5\% higher than the Binarized Neural Network (BNN) with

fracture process with a localized mesh refinement that provides notable gains
in computational efficiency. The implementation is validated against
experimental data and other numerical experiments on orthotropic materials with
different material orientations. The results reveal an increase in the
stiffness and the maximum force with increasing material orientation angle. The
study is then extended to the analysis of orthotropic FGMs. It is observed
that, if the gradation in fracture properties is neglected, the material
gradient plays a secondary role, with the fracture behaviour being dominated by
the orthotropy of the material. However, when the toughness increases along the

similar patches are grouped to learn adaptive sub-dictionary, generating a more

efficient information filtering models during the sudden onset of a new crisis.
We present a novel method to classify relevant tweets during an ongoing crisis

incident streams. Specifically, we construct a customized multi-task
architecture with a multi-domain discriminator for crisis analytics: multi-task
domain adversarial attention network. This model consists of dedicated
attention layers for each task to provide model interpretability; critical for
real-word applications. As deep networks struggle with sparse datasets, we show
that this can be improved by sharing a base layer for multi-task learning and
domain adversarial training. Evaluation of domain adaptation for crisis events
is performed by choosing a target event as the test set and training on the
rest. Our results show that the multi-task model outperformed its single task
counterpart. For the qualitative evaluation of interpretability, we show that
the attention layer can be used as a guide to explain the model predictions and
empower emergency services for exploring accountability of the model, by
showcasing the words in a tweet that are deemed important in the classification
process. Finally, we show a practical implication of our work by providing a

generalized quantum statistics. Two ways to approach generalized quantum
statistics: (1) in quantum mechanics, generalize the permutation symmetry of
the wave function and (2) in statistical mechanics, generalize the maximum
occupation number of quantum statistics. The connection between these two
approaches, however, is obscure. In this paper, we suggest a unified framework
to describe various kinds of generalized quantum statistics. We first provide a
general formula of canonical partition functions of ideal $N$-particle gases
obeying various kinds of generalized quantum statistics. Then we reveal the
connection between the permutation phase of the wave function and the maximum
occupation number, through constructing a method to obtain the permutation
phase and the maximum occupation number from the canonical partition function.
In our scheme, the permutation phase of wave functions is generalized to a
matrix phase, rather than a number. It is commonly accepted that different
kinds of statistics are distinguished by the maximum number. We show that the
maximum occupation number is not sufficient to distinguish different kinds of
generalized quantum statistics. As examples, we discuss a series of generalized
quantum statistics in the unified framework, giving the corresponding canonical
partition functions, maximum occupation numbers, and the permutation phase of
wave functions. Especially, we propose three new kinds of generalized quantum
statistics which seem to be the missing pieces in the puzzle. The mathematical
basis of the scheme are the mathematical theory of the invariant matrix, the
Schur-Weyl duality, the symmetric function, and the representation theory of
the permutation group and the unitary group. The result in this paper builds a

frame-invariant fractional-order approach to nonlocal thermoelasticity in
solids. For this purpose, thermodynamic and mechanical balance laws are derived
for nonlocal solids modeled using the fractional-order continuum theory. This
includes revisiting the Cauchy's hypothesis for surface traction vector in
order to account for long-range interactions across the domain of nonlocal
solid. Remarkably, it is shown that the fractional-order model allows the
rigorous localized application of thermodynamic balance principles unlike
existing integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity. Further, the mechanical
governing equations of motion for the fractional-order solids obtained here are
consistent with existing results from variational principles. These
fractional-order governing equations involve self-adjoint operators and admit
unique solutions, in contrast to analogous studies following the local Cauchy's
hypothesis. To illustrate the efficacy of this framework, case-studies for the
linear and the geometrically nonlinear responses of nonlocal beams subject to
combined thermomechanical loads are considered here. Comparisons with existing
integer-order integral nonlocal approaches highlight a consistent softening
response of nonlocal structures predicted by the fractional-order framework,
irrespective of the boundary and thermomechanical loading conditions. This
latter aspect addresses an important incongruence often observed in
strain-based integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity.

multiplicative multivectors. We prove a canonical decomposition formula of
elements in $\mathfrak{X}_{\mathrm{mult}}^\bullet(\mathcal{G})$ and establish a
key relation between ${R}_{\mathrm{mult}}^k$ and the cohomology $\mathrm{H}
^1(\mathfrak{J} \mathcal{G},\wedge^k A)$ where $\mathfrak{J} \mathcal{G}$ is
the jet groupoid of $\mathcal{G}$ and $1\leqslant k\leqslant \mathrm{rank} A$.
We also study ${R}_{\mathrm{diff}}^\bullet $, the reduced space of Lie
algebroid differentials on $A$. By taking infinitesimals, $\bar{\delta}: $
${R}_{\mathrm{mult}}^\bullet $ $\to $ ${R}_{\mathrm{diff}}^\bullet $, the two
reduced spaces are related. We find that the kernel of $\bar{\delta}$ is
isomorphic to the kernel of the Van Est map $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathcal{G},\wedge^k
\ker\rho)\to \mathrm{H}^1(A,\wedge^k \ker\rho)$, where $\rho$ is the anchor of
$A$.

strong plasma dispersion effect of the transparent conductive oxides,
ultra-compact silicon modulators with heterogeneously integrated
indium-tin-oxide (ITO) can potentially achieve unprecedented energy efficiency
to atto-joule per bit. In this article, we report the first high-speed silicon
nanocavity modulator driven by an ITO gate, achieving 2.2 GHz bandwidth.
On-off-key modulation is measured up to 5 Gb/s with only 2 V voltage swing and
18.3 fJ/bit energy efficiency. In addition, we perform in-depth analysis of the
energy efficiency and high frequency simulation of the nanocavity modulator,
revealing the critical role played by the semiconductor conduction path and the
overlapping factor between the accumulated free carriers and the cavity
resonant mode. Based on our analysis, we propose a strategy to further improve
the modulation bandwidth to 23.5 GHz by node-matched doping and reduce the
energy consumption to the range of hundreds of atto-joule per bit.

with lumped mass at the nodes to obtain energetically consistent models
providing accurate descriptions of the acoustic behavior of the discrete
system. The equation of motion of the lattice is transformed according to a
unitary approach aimed to identify equivalent non-local continuum models of
integral-differential and gradient type, the latter obtained through standard
or enhanced continualization. The bilateral Z-transform of the difference
equation of motion is matched to the governing integral-differential equation
of the equivalent continuum in the transformed Fourier space, which has the
same frequency band structure as the Lagrangian one. Firstly, it is shown that
the approximation of the kernels via Taylor polynomials leads to the
differential field equations of higher order continua endowed with non-local
constitutive terms. The field equations derived from such approach corresponds
to the ones obtained through the so called standard continualization. However,
the differential problem turns out to be ill-posed because the non-positive
definiteness of the potential energy density of the higher order continuum.
Energetically consistent equivalent continua have been identified through a
proper mapping correlating the transformed macro-displacements in the Fourier
space with a new auxiliary regularizing continuum macro-displacement field in
the same space. Specifically, the mapping here introduced has zeros at the edge
of the first Brillouin zone. The integral-differential governing equation and
the corresponding differential one has been reformulated through an enhanced
continualization that is characterized by energetically consistent differential
equations. The constitutive and inertial kernels of the integral-differential
equation exhibit polar singularities at the edge of the first Brillouin zone.
