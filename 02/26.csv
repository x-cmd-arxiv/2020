electroencephalogram (EEG) helps us understand how the brain processes speech
and has various applications in neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. In
this context, so far mainly linear models have been used. However, the decoding
performance of the linear model is limited due to the complex and highly
non-linear nature of the auditory processing in the human brain. We present a
novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based architecture as a non-linear model
for the classification problem of whether a given pair of (EEG, speech
envelope) correspond to each other or not. The model maps short segments of the
EEG and the envelope to a common embedding space using a CNN in the EEG path
and an LSTM in the speech path. The latter also compensates for the brain
response delay. In addition, we use transfer learning to fine-tune the model
for each subject. The mean classification accuracy of the proposed model
reaches 85%, which is significantly higher than that of a state of the art
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model (73%) and the linear model
(69%).

problems such as optimization of retirement plans or target dated funds. In
such problems, an investor seeks to achieve a financial goal by making periodic
investments in the portfolio while being employed, and periodically draws from
the account when in retirement, in addition to the ability to re-balance the
portfolio by selling and buying different assets (e.g. stocks). Instead of
relying on a utility of consumption, we present G-Learner: a reinforcement
learning algorithm that operates with explicitly defined one-step rewards, does
not assume a data generation process, and is suitable for noisy data. Our
approach is based on G-learning - a probabilistic extension of the Q-learning
method of reinforcement learning.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how G-learning, when applied to a quadratic
reward and Gaussian reference policy, gives an entropy-regulated Linear
Quadratic Regulator (LQR). This critical insight provides a novel and
computationally tractable tool for wealth management tasks which scales to high
dimensional portfolios. In addition to the solution of the direct problem of
G-learning, we also present a new algorithm, GIRL, that extends our goal-based
G-learning approach to the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
where rewards collected by the agent are not observed, and should instead be
inferred. We demonstrate that GIRL can successfully learn the reward parameters
of a G-Learner agent and thus imitate its behavior. Finally, we discuss
potential applications of the G-Learner and GIRL algorithms for wealth
management and robo-advising.

process in hadron physics and is of considerable interest for various
phenomena. In this paper, we will apply the Principle of Maximum Conformality
(PMC) to provide a comprehensive analysis of these processes. The PMC provides
a systematic, unambiguous method for determining the renormalization scales of
the QCD coupling constant for single-scale and multiple-scale applications. The
resulting predictions eliminate any renormalization scheme-and-scale
ambiguities, eliminate the factorial renormalon divergences, and are consistent
with the requirements of the renormalization group. It is remarkable that two
distinctly different scales are determined by using the PMC for heavy fermion
pair production near the threshold region. One scale is the order of the
fermion mass $m_f$, which enters the hard virtual corrections, and the other
scale is of order $ v\,m_f$, where $v$ is the quark velocity, which enters the
Coulomb rescattering amplitude. The PMC scales yield the correct physical
behavior and reflect the virtuality of the propagating gluons (photons) for the
QCD (QED) processes. Moreover, we demonstrate the consistency of PMC scale
setting from QCD to QED. Perfect agreement between the Abelian unambiguous
Gell-Mann-Low and the PMC scale-setting methods in the limit of zero number of

boosting segmentation performance while only minimally increasing the model

3D networks. In contrast to existing modules, Project \& Excite does not
perform global average pooling but compresses feature maps along different
spatial dimensions of the tensor separately to retain more spatial information
that is subsequently used in the excitation step. We evaluate the modules on
two challenging tasks, whole-brain segmentation of MRI scans and whole-body

works on chance-constrained trajectory planning under agent or obstacle
uncertainty either assume Gaussian uncertainty or linear constraints, which is
limiting, or requires sampling, which can be computationally intractable to
encode in an optimization problem. In this paper, we extend the
state-of-the-art by presenting a methodology to upper-bound chance-constraints
defined by polynomials and mixture models with potentially non-Gaussian
components. Our method achieves its generality by using statistical moments of
the distributions in concentration inequalities to upper-bound the probability
of constraint violation. With this method, optimization-based trajectory
planners can plan trajectories that are chance-constrained with respect to a
wide range of distributions representing predictions of agent future positions.
In experiments, we show that the resulting optimization problem can be solved
with state-of-the-art nonlinear program solvers to plan trajectories fast

methods produce valid morphological subwords. Despite the contrasting
trade-offs between LIT vs. LST methods, their performance on downstream NLP
tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we empirically compare the two approaches
using semantic similarity measurement as an evaluation task across a diverse
set of languages. Our experimental results covering eight languages show that
LST consistently outperforms LIT when the vocabulary size is large, but LIT can
produce comparable or better results than LST in many languages with
comparatively smaller (i.e. less than 100K words) vocabulary sizes, encouraging
the use of LIT when language-specific resources are unavailable, incomplete or

time and value. Functional network models often employ rate units that are
continuously coupled by analog signals. Is there a qualitative difference
implied by these two forms of signaling? We develop a unified mean-field theory
for large random networks to show that first- and second-order statistics in
rate and binary networks are in fact identical if rate neurons receive the
right amount of noise. Their response to presented stimuli, however, can be
radically different. We quantify these differences by studying how nearby state
trajectories evolve over time, asking to what extent the dynamics is chaotic.
Chaos in the two models is found to be qualitatively different. In binary
networks we find a network-size-dependent transition to chaos and a chaotic
submanifold whose dimensionality expands stereotypically with time, while rate
networks with matched statistics are nonchaotic. Dimensionality expansion in
chaotic binary networks aids classification in reservoir computing and optimal
performance is reached within about a single activation per neuron; a fast
mechanism for computation that we demonstrate also in spiking networks. A
generalization of this mechanism extends to rate networks in their respective
chaotic regimes.

\epsilon_n e^{\gamma(a) T}$ and rate function $\gamma(a) \leq 0.$ The proof is
based on the spectral estimates for the iterations of the Ruelle operators with
two complex parameters and on a new Tauberian theorem for sequence of functions

Epsilon Eridani (440 Myr), one of the youngest solar-like stars with a known
chromospheric CaII cycle. By analyzing the most recent Mount Wilson S-index
CaII data of this star, we found that the chromospheric cycle lasts 2.92 +/-
0.02 yr, in agreement with past results. From the long-term X-ray lightcurve,
we find clear and systematic X-ray variability of our target, consistent with
the chromospheric CaII cycle. The average X-ray luminosity results to be 2 x
10^28 erg/s, with an amplitude that is only a factor 2 throughout the cycle. We
apply a new method to describe the evolution of the coronal emission measure
distribution of Epsilon Eridani in terms of solar magnetic structures: active
regions, cores of active regions and flares covering the stellar surface at
varying filling fractions. Combinations of these magnetic structures can
describe the observed X-ray emission measure of Epsilon Eridani only if the
solar flare emission measure distribution is restricted to events in the decay
phase. The interpretation is that flares in the corona of Epsilon Eridani last
longer than their solar counterparts. We ascribe this to the lower metallicity
of Epsilon Eridani. Our analysis revealed also that the X-ray cycle of Epsilon
Eridani is strongly dominated by cores of active regions. The coverage fraction
of cores throughout the cycle changes by the same factor as the X-ray
luminosity. The maxima of the cycle are characterized by a high percentage of
covering fraction of the flares, consistent with the fact that flaring events
are seen in the corresponding short-term X-ray lightcurves predominately at the
cycle maxima. The high X-ray emission throughout the cycle of Epsilon Eridani
is thus explained by the high percentage of magnetic structures on its surface.

human-machine interaction. This has been tackled by research in Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. Recently,
WSD and many other NLP tasks have taken advantage of embeddings-based
representation of words, sentences, and documents. However, when it comes to
WSD, most embeddings models suffer from ambiguity as they do not capture the
different possible meanings of the words. Even when they do, the list of
possible meanings for a word (sense inventory) has to be known in advance at
training time to be included in the embeddings space. Unfortunately, there are
situations in which such a sense inventory is not known in advance (e.g., an
ontology selected at run-time), or it evolves with time and its status diverges
from the one at training time. This hampers the use of embeddings models for
WSD. Furthermore, traditional WSD techniques do not perform well in situations
in which the available linguistic information is very scarce, such as the case
of keyword-based queries. In this paper, we propose an approach to keyword
disambiguation which grounds on a semantic relatedness between words and senses
provided by an external inventory (ontology) that is not known at training
time. Building on previous works, we present a semantic relatedness measure
that uses word embeddings, and explore different disambiguation algorithms to
also exploit both word and sentence representations. Experimental results show
that this approach achieves results comparable with the state of the art when
applied for WSD, without training for a particular domain.

the combination of ionic gating and boron substitution, in hydrogenated thin
films epitaxially grown on (111)- and (110)-oriented single crystals.
Gate-dependent electric transport measurements show that the effect of boron
doping strongly depends on the crystal orientation. In the (111) surface, it
strongly suppresses the charge-carrier mobility and moderately increases the
gate-induced doping, while in the (110) surface it strongly increases the
gate-induced doping with a moderate reduction in mobility. In both cases the
maximum total carrier density remains below $2{\cdot}10^{14}\,$cm$^{-2}$, three
times lower than the value theoretically required for high-temperature
superconductivity. Density-functional theory calculations show that this
strongly orientation-dependent effect is due to the specific energy-dependence

optimization algorithm has been employed recently to formalize the process of
finding a configuration of thread windings that fuses into a given greyscale

two-dimensional distribution of isotropic material, computed by a conventional
topology optimization algorithm. An optimal composite design is thus found as a
result of the following two-stage process. At the first stage, topology
optimization procedure produces regular grid of greyscale values of stiffness.
At the second stage, this distribution is approximated with a polyline,
representing the stiff reinforcement fiber in a soft matrix, according to

depinning, emulsion mobilization is not triggered by large-scale avalanches but
merely requires the coordinated motion of small groups of particles.
Criticality arises from the correlations of seemingly erratic depinning events

microscopic origin of these self-organized flow patterns: contact interactions
and hydrodynamic focusing conspire to mobilize emulsion out of disorder. We

superlattices with more than 10.000 bands, remedying the need to employ ad hoc
restrictions to effective low-energy theories of a few bands and/or effective
continuum theories. This provides a description on the atomic scale, allowing
one to absorb available ab-initio information on the model parameters and
therefore lending the analysis a more concrete quantitative character. For the
case of twisted bilayer graphene models, we explore the leading ordering
tendencies depending on the band filling and the range of interactions. The
results indicate a delicate balance between distinct magnetically ordered
ground states, as well as the occurrence of a charge modulation within the
moir\'e unit cell for sufficiently non-local repulsive interaction.

whether these variations are caused by different physical parameters of
translucent clouds.
  For this purpose we used spectra of two stars seen through two different
single clouds: HD34078 (AE Aur) \& HD73882 acquired using
  two different instruments: the MIKE spectrograph, fed with the 6.5 m Magellan
telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the UVES, fed with the 8 m Kueyen

at 6196, 6203, 6376, 6379 and 6614 \AA\ with respect to the well known
interstellar atomic and molecular lines (K{\sc i} and CH) have been measured.
The mentioned shift is seemingly absent in the DIBs at 4726, 4964, 4763, and
4780 \AA. In addition the considered profiles may show (in HD34078) extended
red wings. The observed phenomena are likely related to physical parameters of
intervening clouds (rotational temperatures of molecular species) and may help
in the identification of the DIB carriers.

across different fields of research. While lying has been studied before in
well-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are rarely
well-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by
networks. Here we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution
of lying in the sender-receiver game in a one-parameter family of networks,
systematically covering complete networks, small-world networks, and
one-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to
the receiver, the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on
networks than they do in well-mixed populations. Honesty is thus more likely to
evolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the cost for
the receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world
networks, but less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the
receiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called altruistic white lies, we show
that honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed
populations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the
one-dimensional ring, whereas in small-world networks it is present only when
the cost to the sender is greater than the benefit for the receiver. Lastly,
for lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called Pareto
white lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of
lying, but this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than
the benefit for the receiver. In this case again the small-world topology acts
as an amplifier of the effect, while other network topologies fail to do the
same.

ubiquitously found by high-resolution ALMA observations. Under the hypothesis
that they are opened by planets, in this paper we investigate how the minimum
planet mass needed to open a gap varies across different stellar host masses
and distances from the star. The dependence on the stellar host mass is
particularly interesting because, at least in principle, gap opening around low
mass stars should be possible for lower mass planets, giving us a look into the
young, low mass planet population. Using dusty hydrodynamical simulations, we
find however the opposite behaviour, as a result of the fact that discs around
low mass stars are geometrically thicker: gap opening around low mass stars can
require more massive planets. Depending on the theoretical isochrone employed
to predict the relationship between stellar mass and luminosity, the gap
opening planet mass could also be independent of stellar mass, but in no case
we find that gap opening becomes easier around low mass stars. This would lead
to the expectation of a {\it lower} incidence of such structures in lower mass
stars, since exoplanet surveys show that low mass stars have a lower fraction
of giant planets. More generally, our study enables future imaging observations
as a function of stellar mass to be interpreted using information on the mass

commodity hardware, NFV envisions a shift towards a more agile and open service
provisioning paradigm with much lower capital expenditure (CapEx) and
operational expenditure (OpEx). Nonetheless, just like any complex system, NFV
platforms commonly consist of abounding software and hardware components and
usually incorporate disparate design choices based on distinct motivations or
use cases. This broad collection of convoluted alternatives makes it extremely
arduous for network operators to make proper choices. Although numerous efforts
have been devoted to investigating different aspects of NFV, none of them

phenomena in mesoscopic systems. Here, we provide a detailed derivation of this
method for nano-scale conductors that are driven by oscillating electric or
magnetic fields. Our approach is based on an extension of the conventional
Lippmann-Schwinger formalism to systems with a periodically time dependent
Hamiltonian. As a key result, we obtain a systematic perturbation scheme for
the Floquet scattering amplitudes that describe the transition of a transport
carrier through a periodically driven sample. Within a general multi-terminal
setup, we derive microscopic expressions for the mean values and
time-integrated correlation functions, or zero-frequency noise, of matter and
energy currents, thus unifying the results of earlier studies. We show that
this framework is inherently consistent with the first and the second law of
thermodynamics and prove that the mean rate of entropy production vanishes only
if all currents in the system are zero. As an application, we derive a
generalized Green-Kubo relation, which makes it possible to express the
response of any mean currents to small variations of temperature and chemical
potential gradients in terms of time integrated correlation functions between
properly chosen currents. Finally, we discuss potential topics for future
studies and further reaching applications of the Floquet scattering approach to
quantum transport in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.

on the inferred stellar quantities; and second to determine how well
'non-standard' prescriptions, such as microscopic diffusion and overshoot, are
constrained. I used a Bayesian statistical model to infer the values of the
stellar parameters of 16 Cyg A and B. I sampled the posterior density of the
stellar parameters via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, tested
different physical prescription, and examined the impact of using different
seismic diagnostics. General good agreement is found with several recent
modelling studies on these stars, even though some discrepancies subsist
regarding the precise estimates of the uncertainties on the parameters. An age
of $6.88\pm0.12$ Gyr is estimated for the binary system. The inferred masses,
$1.07\pm0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ for Cyg A and $1.05\pm0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ for Cyg B,
are shown to be stable with respect to changes in the physical prescriptions
considered for the modelling. For both stars, microscopic diffusion has a
significant effect on the estimates of the initial metallicity. Overshoot is
confined to very small regions below the convective zone. I show that a proper
treatment of the seismic constraints is necessary to avoid biases in the
estimate of the mass.

with long patterned edges. The angular distribution of x-ray diffuse scattering

studies based on a time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire model show that
the preferred direction of the alignment results from lowering of the bulk and

robust to perturbations on the input data, but usually at the expense of
decrease in the standard accuracy. To mitigate this issue, it is commonly
believed that more training data will eventually help such adversarially robust
models generalize better on the benign/unperturbed test data. In this paper,
however, we challenge this conventional belief and show that more training data
can hurt the generalization of adversarially robust models in the
classification problems. We first investigate the Gaussian mixture
classification with a linear loss and identify three regimes based on the
strength of the adversary. In the weak adversary regime, more data improves the
generalization of adversarially robust models. In the medium adversary regime,
with more training data, the generalization loss exhibits a double descent
curve, which implies the existence of an intermediate stage where more training
data hurts the generalization. In the strong adversary regime, more data almost
immediately causes the generalization error to increase. Then we move to the
analysis of a two-dimensional classification problem with a 0-1 loss. We prove
that more data always hurts the generalization performance of adversarially
trained models with large perturbations. To complement our theoretical results,
we conduct empirical studies on Gaussian mixture classification, support vector

applications. As training a good model often needs massive high-quality data
and computation resources, the learned models often have significant business
values. However, these valuable deep models are exposed to a huge risk of
infringements. For example, if the attacker has the full information of one
target model including the network structure and weights, the model can be
easily finetuned on new datasets. Even if the attacker can only access the
output of the target model, he/she can still train another similar surrogate
model by generating a large scale of input-output training pairs. How to
protect the intellectual property of deep models is a very important but
seriously under-researched problem. There are a few recent attempts at
classification network protection only. In this paper, we propose the first
model watermarking framework for protecting image processing models. To achieve
this goal, we leverage the spatial invisible watermarking mechanism.
Specifically, given a black-box target model, a unified and invisible watermark
is hidden into its outputs, which can be regarded as a special task-agnostic
barrier. In this way, when the attacker trains one surrogate model by using the
input-output pairs of the target model, the hidden watermark will be learned
and extracted afterward. To enable watermarks from binary bits to
high-resolution images, both traditional and deep spatial invisible
watermarking mechanism are considered. Experiments demonstrate the robustness
of the proposed watermarking mechanism, which can resist surrogate models
learned with different network structures and objective functions. Besides deep
models, the proposed method is also easy to be extended to protect data and
traditional image processing algorithms.

reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are attracting increasing interest. In order to
realize these surfaces in practice, however, several challenges need to be
addressed. One of these main challenges is how to configure the reflecting
coefficients on these passive surfaces without requiring massive channel
estimation or beam training overhead. Earlier work suggested leveraging
supervised learning tools to design the IRS reflection matrices. While this
approach has the potential of reducing the beam training overhead, it requires
collecting large datasets for training the neural network models. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for predicting
the IRS reflection matrices with minimal training overhead. Simulation results
show that the proposed online learning framework can converge to the optimal
rate that assumes perfect channel knowledge. This represents an important step
towards realizing a standalone IRS operation, where the surface configures
itself without any control from the infrastructure.

often removed as noise when training image recognition models, to increase
stability and reduce training time. However, in the field of image generation,
the moments play a much more central role. Studies have shown that the moments
extracted from instance normalization and positional normalization can roughly
capture style and shape information of an image. Instead of being discarded,
these moments are instrumental to the generation process. In this paper we
propose Moment Exchange, an implicit data augmentation method that encourages
the model to utilize the moment information also for recognition models.
Specifically, we replace the moments of the learned features of one training
image by those of another, and also interpolate the target labels -- forcing
the model to extract training signal from the moments in addition to the
normalized features. As our approach is fast, operates entirely in feature
space, and mixes different signals than prior methods, one can effectively
combine it with existing augmentation approaches. We demonstrate its efficacy
across several recognition benchmark data sets where it improves the
generalization capability of highly competitive baseline networks with
remarkable consistency.

for wireless powered communication networks, where the relays harvest energy
from the source radio frequency signals. A single source-destination pair is
considered without a direct link. The connecting relay nodes are equipped with
storage batteries of infinite size. We assume that the channel state
information (CSI) on the source-relay link is available at the relay nodes.
Depending on the availability of the CSI on the relay-destination link at the
relay node, we propose two relay selection schemes and evaluate their outage
probability. Availability of the CSI at the relay node on the relay-destination
link considerably improves the performance due to additional flexibility in the
relay selection mechanism. Due to absence of CSI throughout the network at the
time of transmission path selection, the analysis of the problem is not
tractable. Therefore, we relax our assumptions on availability of CSI and
closed-form expressions of the outage probability as a function of the amount
of the available harvested energy are derived for both CSI availability cases.
Finally, we numerically quantify the performance for the proposed schemes and
compare the outage probability for fixed and equal number of wireless powered

create a 2-D pi-bonded structure. This new polymorphic structure resolves many

constrain the atmosphere to be H$_2$-rich with a H$_2$O volume mixing ratio of
$0.02-14.8$%, consistent with previous studies, and find a depletion of CH$_4$

clouds/hazes in the observable atmosphere. We use the bulk parameters and
retrieved atmospheric properties to constrain the internal structure and
thermodynamic conditions in the planet. The constraints on the interior allow
multiple scenarios between rocky worlds with massive H/He envelopes and water
worlds with thin envelopes. We constrain the mass fraction of the H/He envelope
to be $\lesssim 6$%; spanning $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ for a predominantly water
world to $\sim6$% for a pure iron interior. The thermodynamic conditions at the

clear UV lags behind X-ray in several local active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The
UV to X-ray lags are often larger (by a factor up to ~ 20) than expected if the
UV variation is simply due to the X-ray reprocessing. We previously developed a
model in which the UV/optical variations are attributed to disk turbulences,
and the effect of large-scale turbulence is considered. Our model, which
overcomes many severe challenges to the reprocessing scheme, can well explain
the observed variations in NGC 5548, particularly the correlations and lags
among the UV/optical bands. In this work, assuming the corona heating is
associated with turbulences in the inner accretion disk, we extend our study to
model the correlations and lags between the X-ray and UV/optical bands. We find
that our model, without the need of light echoing, can well reproduce the
observed UV to X-ray lags and the optical to UV lags simultaneously in four
local Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 4151, NGC 4395, NGC 4593, and NGC 5548.
In our scenario, relatively larger UV to X-ray lag is expected for AGN with
smaller innermost disk radius and thus more compact corona. Interestingly, for
these Seyfert galaxies studied in this work, sources with relatively larger UV
to X-ray lags do have broader Fe Ka lines, indicative of relativistic
broadening due to more compact corona and smaller innermost disk radius. If
confirmed with more X-ray and UV monitoring campaigns, this interesting
discovery would provide a new probe to the inner disk/corona.

more efficient production of ionizing photons in these lower-luminosity,

total masses of 10^12-15.2 Msun. At fixed stellar mass, the satellite SHMR
exhibits a distinct shift towards lower dynamical mass compared to the SHMR of
centrals. Conversely, at fixed dynamical mass, satellite galaxies appear to
have larger stellar-to-total mass fractions than centrals by up to a factor of
a few. The systematic deviation from the central SHMR is larger for satellites
in more massive hosts, at smaller cluster-centric distances, with earlier
infall times, and that inhabit higher local density environments; moreover, it
is in place already at early times (z < 2). Systematic environmental effects
might contribute to the perceived galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the measured
SHMR when galaxies cannot be separated into satellites and centrals. The SHMR
of satellites exhibits a larger scatter than centrals, over the whole range of
dynamical mass (by up to 0.8 dex). The shift of the satellite SHMR results
mostly from tidal stripping of their dark matter, which affects satellites in
an outside-in fashion: the departure of the satellite SHMR from the centrals'
relation diminishes for measurements of dynamical mass in progressively smaller
apertures. Finally, we provide a family of fitting functions for the SHMR
predicted by IllustrisTNG.

of compression ratio $\mathcal{R}$, the spectral index of the accelerated
particles is $s_E=1+N/(\mathcal{R}-1)$; this curiously yields, for any $N$, the
familiar $s_E=2$ (i.e., equal energy per logarithmic particle energy bin) for a
strong shock in a mono-atomic gas. A precise relation between $s_E$ and the
anisotropy along an arbitrary relativistic shock is derived, and is used to
obtain an analytic expression for $s_E$ in the case of isotropic angular
diffusion, affirming an analogous result in 3D. In particular, this approach
yields $s_E = (1+\sqrt{13})/2 \simeq 2.30$ in the ultra-relativistic shock

0.04$, driven by a low matter density parameter, $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.179^{+0.031}_{-0.038}$, with $\sigma_8-\Omega_{\rm m}$ posteriors in
$2.4\sigma$ tension with the DES Y1 3x2pt results, and in $5.6\sigma$ with the
Planck CMB analysis. These results include the impact of post-unblinding
changes to the analysis, which did not improve the level of consistency with
other data sets compared to the results obtained at the unblinding. The fact
that multiple cosmological probes (supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations,
cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and CMB anisotropies), and other galaxy cluster
analyses all favor significantly higher matter densities suggests the presence
of systematic errors in the data or an incomplete modeling of the relevant
physics. Cross checks with X-ray and microwave data, as well as independent
constraints on the observable--mass relation from SZ selected clusters, suggest
that the discrepancy resides in our modeling of the weak lensing signal rather
than the cluster abundance. Repeating our analysis using a higher richness
threshold ($\lambda \ge 30$) significantly reduces the tension with other
probes, and points to one or more richness-dependent effects not captured by
our model.

SIDM is largely identical to that of CDM, but in WDM early star formation is
instead suppressed. The time at which LG haloes can begin to form stars through
atomic cooling is delayed by $\sim$200~Myr in WDM models compared to CDM. It
will be necessary to measure stellar ages of old populations to a precision of
better than 100~Myr, and to address degeneracies with the redshift of

sequence stars, and these may survive on to later stages of evolution.
Observations of depressed dipole modes in red giant stars have been touted as
evidence for these fields, but the predictions of existing magnetic theories
have difficulty accommodating several aspects, including the need to return a
fraction of wave energy from the core to the envelope, and the persistent
gravity-like character of affected modes. In this work we perform a Hamiltonian
ray tracing study investigating the dynamics of magneto-gravity waves in full
spherical geometry, using realistic stellar models and magnetic field
configurations. This technique applies in the limit where wavelengths are much
shorter than scales of background variation. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of parameter space, examining the roles of wave frequency,
spherical harmonic degree, wavevector polarisation, incoming latitude, field
strength, field radius, and evolutionary state. We demonstrate that even in the
presence of a strong field, there exist trajectories where waves remain
predominantly gravity-like in character, and these are able to undergo
reflection out of the core much like pure gravity waves. The remaining
trajectories are ones where waves acquire significant Alfven character,
becoming trapped and eventually dissipated. Orientation effects, i.e.
wavevector polarisation and incoming latitude, are found to be crucial factors
in determining the outcome (trapped versus reflected) of individual wave
packets. The allowance for partial energy return from the core offers a
solution to the conundrum faced by the magnetic hypothesis.

this, we measure projected rotation rates (vsini) for both the star and the
companion using new near-infrared high-resolution spectra with NIRSPEC at Keck

from TESS and a published companion rotation period from HST to obtain spin

the stellar obliquity marginally prefers alignment, the companion obliquity

spectropolarimetric features originating from the supernova explosion and

calculate viewing-angle dependent flux and polarisation spectra for a 3D model
simulating the deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and, for a
second model, simulating the ejecta interaction with a main-sequence star. We
find that the intrinsic signal is weakly polarised and only mildly
viewing-angle dependent, owing to the overall spherical symmetry of the
explosion and the depolarising contribution of iron-group elements dominating
the ejecta composition. The interaction with the companion star carves out a
cavity in the ejecta and produces a detectable, but modest signal that is
significant only at relatively blue wavelengths ($\lesssim$ 5000
$\unicode{x212B}$). In particular, increasingly fainter and redder spectra are
predicted for observer orientations further from the cavity, while a modest
polarisation signal $P\sim0.2$ per cent is found at blue wavelengths for
orientations 30$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$ away from the cavity. We find a
reasonable agreement between the interaction model viewed from these
orientations and spectropolarimetric data of SN 2005hk and interpret the
maximum-light polarisation signal seen at blue wavelengths for this event as a
possible signature of the ejecta-companion interaction. We encourage further
polarimetric observations of SNe Iax to test whether our results can be

nearby solar twins. It has been suggested that this depletion is a signpost of
planet formation. The exoplanet statistics are now good enough to show that the
origin of this depletion does not arise from the sequestration of refractory
material inside the planets themselves. This conclusion arises because most
sun-like stars host close-in planetary systems that are on average more massive
than the Sun's. Using evolutionary models for the protoplanetary discs that
surrounded the young Sun and solar twins we demonstrate that the origin of the
depletion likely arises due to the trapping of dust exterior to the orbit of a
forming giant planet. In this scenario a forming giant planet opens a gap in
the gas disc, creating a pressure trap. If the planet forms early enough, while
the disc is still massive, the planet can trap $\gtrsim 100 $M$_\oplus$ of dust
exterior to its orbit, preventing the dust from accreting onto the star in
contrast to the gas. Forming giant planets can create refractory depletions of
$\sim 5-15$%, with the larger values occurring for initial conditions that
favour giant planet formation (e.g. more massive discs, that live longer). The
incidence of solar-twins that show refractory depletion matches both the
occurrence of giant planets discovered in exoplanet surveys and ""transition""
discs that show similar depletion patterns in the material that is accreting

context that describes the item. However, the seller is not aware of the
relationship between the context and buyers' valuations, i.e., buyers'
preferences. The seller's goal is to design a learning policy to set reserve
prices via observing the past sales data, and her objective is to minimize her
regret for revenue, where the regret is computed against a clairvoyant policy
that knows buyers' heterogeneous preferences. Given the seller's goal,
utility-maximizing buyers have the incentive to bid untruthfully in order to
manipulate the seller's learning policy. We propose learning policies that are
robust to such strategic behavior. These policies use the outcomes of the
auctions, rather than the submitted bids, to estimate the preferences while
controlling the long-term effect of the outcome of each auction on the future
reserve prices. When the market noise distribution is known to the seller, we
propose a policy called Contextual Robust Pricing (CORP) that achieves a
T-period regret of $O(d\log(Td) \log (T))$, where $d$ is the dimension of {the}

complement our data with further spectroscopic measurements from previous
studies that used the same instrumental configuration and proper motions from

stellar kinematic data, we find that the SMC centre of mass presents a
conspicuous offset from the velocity centre of its associated $\mbox{H\,{\sc

equilibrium. Furthermore, we find evidence that the SMC is currently undergoing
tidal disruption by the LMC within 2\,kpc of the centre of the SMC, and
possibly all the way in to the very core. This is evidenced by a net outward
motion of stars from the SMC centre along the direction towards the LMC and
apparent tangential anisotropy at all radii. The latter is expected if the SMC
is undergoing significiant tidal stripping, as we demonstrate using a suite of
$N$-body simulations of the SMC/LMC system disrupting around the Milky Way.
These results suggest that dynamical models for the SMC that assume a steady

stars and gas in star-forming regions as well as older clusters and
associations. It quantifies the amount of structure using the ratio of the
average length of a minimum spanning tree, mbar, to the average length within
the complete graph, sbar. The interpretation of the Q-parameter often relies on
comparing observed values of Q, mbar and sbar to idealised synthetic
geometries, where there is little or no match between the observed star-forming
regions and the synthetic regions. We measure Q, mbar, and sbar over 10 Myr in
N-body simulations which are compared to IC 348, NGC 1333, and the ONC. For
each star-forming region we set up simulations that approximate their initial
conditions for a combination of different virial rations and fractal
dimensions. We find that dynamical evolution of idealised fractal geometries
can account for the observed Q, mbar, and sbar values in nearby star-forming
regions. In general, an initially fractal star-forming region will tend to
evolve to become more smooth and centrally concentrated. However, we show that
initial conditions, as well as where the edge of the region is defined, can
cause significant differences in the path that a star-forming region takes
across the mbar-sbar plot as it evolves. We caution that the observed
Q-parameter should not be directly compared to idealised geometries. Instead,
it should be used to determine the degree to which a star-forming region is
either spatially substructured or smooth and centrally concentrated.

obtaining the phase-space distribution of the stars that form the tails is
quite challenging. Our goal is to produce a catalogue of RR Lyrae stars of
Sagittarius and obtain an empiric measurement of the trends along the stream in
sky position, distance and tangential velocities. We generate two initial
samples from the Gaia DR2 RR Lyrae catalogue: one, selecting only the stars
within \pm20deg of the orbital plane of Sagittarius (Strip) and the other, the
result of applying the Pole Count Map (nGC3) algorithm. We then use the
model-independent, deterministic method developed in this work to remove most
of the contamination by detecting and isolating the stream in distance and
proper motions. The output is two empiric catalogues: the Strip sample
(higher-completeness, lower-purity) which contains 11 677 stars, and the nGC3
sample (higher-purity, lower-completeness) with 6 608 stars. We characterise
the changes along the stream in all the available dimensions, the 5 astrometric
ones plus the metallicity, covering more than 2pi rad in the sky and obtain new
estimates for the apocentres and the mean [Fe/H] of the RR Lyrae population.
Also, we show the first map of the two components of the tangential velocity,
thanks to the combination of distances and proper motions. Finally, we detect
the bifurcation in the leading arm and report no significant difference between
the two branches, either in metallicity, kinematics or distance. We provide the
largest sample of RR Lyrae candidates of Sagittarius, which can be used as an
input for a spectroscopic follow-up or as a reference for the new generation of
models of the stream through the interpolators in distance and velocity that we
have constructed.

to knowledge graph (KG) entities is a crucial step for question answering over
KGs. It is often based on measuring the string similarity between the entity
label and its mention in the question. The relation referred to in the question
can help to disambiguate between entities with the same label. This can be
misleading if an incorrect relation has been identified in the relation linking
step. However, an incorrect relation may still be semantically similar to the
relation in which the correct entity forms a triple within the KG; which could
be captured by the similarity of their KG embeddings. Based on this idea, we
propose the first end-to-end neural network approach that employs KG as well as
word embeddings to perform joint relation and entity classification of simple
questions while implicitly performing entity disambiguation with the help of a
novel gating mechanism. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed
approach achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art entity linking

the equation of state of a cell fluid model in the low-temperature region

collective variables approach. Mathematical description within the grand
canonical ensemble is illustrated by an example of the Morse interaction
potential possessing the Fourier transform. A specific feature of the proposed
method lies in the possibility to use exclusively microscopic characteristics
of a fluid (parameters of the interaction potential) for calculating
macroscopic quantities (pressure and other thermodynamic quantities) without
involving the hard-spheres reference system. The grand partition function,
thermodynamic potential, and equation of state of the model near the critical
point are derived taking into account the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution
of order parameter fluctuations. A nonlinear equation, which links the density
and the chemical potential, is presented and solved. Graphs of the dependence
of the density on the chemical potential are plotted for various values of the
relative temperature. The numerical estimates of the critical-point parameters
for potassium, obtained in addition to the estimates for sodium, are given. The
calculated critical-point parameters for liquid alkali metals (sodium and
potassium) are in accord with experimental data. The coexistence curve for

Neural Network (DNN) accelerators due to their ability to natively execute
massively parallel vector-matrix multiplications within dense memory arrays.
However, crossbar-based computations face a major challenge due to a variety of
device and circuit-level non-idealities, which manifest as errors in the
vector-matrix multiplications and eventually degrade DNN accuracy. To address
this challenge, there is a need for tools that can model the functional impact
of non-idealities on DNN training and inference. Existing efforts towards this
goal are either limited to inference, or are too slow to be used for
large-scale DNN training. We propose TxSim, a fast and customizable modeling
framework to functionally evaluate DNN training on crossbar-based hardware
considering the impact of non-idealities. The key features of TxSim that
differentiate it from prior efforts are: (i) It comprehensively models
non-idealities during all training operations (forward propagation, backward
propagation, and weight update) and (ii) it achieves computational efficiency
by mapping crossbar evaluations to well-optimized BLAS routines and
incorporates speedup techniques to further reduce simulation time with minimal
impact on accuracy. TxSim achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in
simulation speed over prior works, and thereby makes it feasible to evaluate
training of large-scale DNNs on crossbars. Our experiments using TxSim reveal
that the accuracy degradation in DNN training due to non-idealities can be
substantial (3%-10%) for large-scale DNNs, underscoring the need for further
research in mitigation techniques. We also analyze the impact of various device
and circuit-level parameters and the associated non-idealities to provide key
insights that can guide the design of crossbar-based DNN training accelerators.

theory}. Most Bayesian methods for modelling exchangeable relational data can
be attributed to this framework by exploiting different forms of graphons.
However, the graphons adopted by existing Bayesian methods are either
piecewise-constant functions, which are insufficiently flexible for accurate
modelling of the relational data, or are complicated continuous functions,
which incur heavy computational costs for inference. In this work, we introduce
a smoothing procedure to piecewise-constant graphons to form {\em smoothing
graphons}, which permit continuous intensity values for describing relations,
but without impractically increasing computational costs. In particular, we
focus on the Bayesian Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and demonstrate how to adapt
the piecewise-constant SBM graphon to the smoothed version. We initially
propose the Integrated Smoothing Graphon (ISG) which introduces one smoothing
parameter to the SBM graphon to generate continuous relational intensity
values. We then develop the Latent Feature Smoothing Graphon (LFSG), which
improves on the ISG by introducing auxiliary hidden labels to decompose the
calculation of the ISG intensity and enable efficient inference. Experimental
results on real-world data sets validate the advantages of applying smoothing
strategies to the Stochastic Block Model, demonstrating that smoothing graphons
can greatly improve AUC and precision for link prediction without increasing
computational complexity.

three-dimensional discs. We show that a wind-driven laminar accretion flow
through the surface layers of the disc does not significantly modify the
migration torque experienced by embedded planets. More importantly, we find
that 3D effects lead to a dramatic change in the behaviour of the dynamical
corotation torque compared to earlier 2D theory and simulations. Although it
was previously shown that the dynamical corotation torque could act to slow and
essentially stall the inward migration of a low-mass planet, our results in 3D
show that the dynamical corotation torque has the complete opposite effect and
speeds up inward migration. Our numerical experiments implicate buoyancy
resonances as the cause. These have two effects: (i) they exert a direct torque
on the planet, whose magnitude relative to the Lindblad torque is measured in
our simulations to be small; (ii) they torque the gas librating on horseshoe
orbits in the corotation region and drive evolution of its vortensity, leading
to the negative dynamical corotation torque. This indicates that at low
turbulent viscosity, the detailed vertical thermal structure of the
protoplanetary disc plays an important role in determining the migration
behaviour of embedded planets. If this result holds up under a more refined
treatment of disc thermal evolution, then it has important implications for
understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems.

the equations of small-scale processes on high-resolution grids embedded within
the low-resolution grids of large-scale processes. Recently, studies have used
machine learning (ML) to develop data-driven parameterization (DD-P) schemes.
Here, we propose a new approach, data-driven SP (DD-SP), in which the equations
of the small-scale processes are integrated data-drivenly using ML methods such
as recurrent neural networks. Employing multi-scale Lorenz 96 systems as
testbed, we compare the cost and accuracy (in terms of both short-term
prediction and long-term statistics) of parameterized low-resolution (LR), SP,
DD-P, and DD-SP models. We show that with the same computational cost, DD-SP
substantially outperforms LR, and is better than DD-P, particularly when scale
separation is lacking. DD-SP is much cheaper than SP, yet its accuracy is the
same in reproducing long-term statistics and often comparable in short-term
forecasting. We also investigate generalization, finding that when models
trained on data from one system are applied to a system with different forcing
(e.g., more chaotic), the models often do not generalize, particularly when the
short-term prediction accuracy is examined. But we show that transfer-learning,
which involves re-training the data-driven model with a small amount of data
from the new system, significantly improves generalization. Potential
applications of DD-SP and transfer-learning in climate/weather modeling and the
expected challenges are discussed.

approximation factor. (Throughout, $m$, $n$, $f$, and $C$ are parameters
denoting the maximum number of sets, number of elements, frequency, and the
cost range.) In the high-frequency range, when $f=\Omega(\log n)$, this was
achieved by a deterministic $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm with $O(f \log

the line of work by Gupta et al. [STOC'17], Abboud et al. [STOC'19], and
Bhattacharya et al. [ICALP'15, IPCO'17, FOCS'19] led to a deterministic
$(1+\epsilon)f$-approximation algorithm with $O(f \log (Cn)/\epsilon^2)$

  1. $(1+\epsilon)f$-approximation ratio in $O(f\log^2 (Cn)/\epsilon^3)$
worst-case update time: No non-trivial worst-case update time was previously
known for dynamic set cover. Our bound subsumes and improves by a logarithmic
factor the $O(\log^3 n/\text{poly}(\epsilon))$ worst-case update time for
unweighted dynamic vertex cover (i.e., when $f=2$ and $C=1$) by Bhattacharya et

for most values of $f$ in the low-frequency range, i.e. whenever $f=o(\log n)$.
It is the first that is independent of $m$ and $n$. It subsumes the constant

Reptile [Nichol et al., 2018] being for convex models. This work shows that
convex-case analysis might be insufficient to understand the success of
meta-learning, and that even for non-convex models it is important to look
inside the optimization black-box, specifically at properties of the
optimization trajectory. We construct a simple meta-learning instance that
captures the problem of one-dimensional subspace learning. For the convex
formulation of linear regression on this instance, we show that the new task
sample complexity of any initialization-based meta-learning algorithm is
$\Omega(d)$, where $d$ is the input dimension. In contrast, for the non-convex
formulation of a two layer linear network on the same instance, we show that
both Reptile and multi-task representation learning can have new task sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, demonstrating a separation from convex
meta-learning. Crucially, analyses of the training dynamics of these methods
reveal that they can meta-learn the correct subspace onto which the data should

By employing the language of coherence orders largely applied in NMR systems,
quantum coherence has been currently addressed in terms of multiple quantum
coherences (MQCs). Here we investigate the $\alpha$-MQCs, a novel class of
multiple quantum coherences which is based on $\alpha$-relative purity, an
information-theoretic quantifier analogous to quantum fidelity and closely
related to R\'{e}nyi relative entropy of order $\alpha$. Our framework enables
linking $\alpha$-MQCs to Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information (WYDSI), an
asymmetry monotone finding applications in quantum thermodynamics and quantum
metrology. Furthermore, we derive a family of bounds on $\alpha$-MQCs,
particularly showing that $\alpha$-MQC define a lower bound to quantum Fisher
information (QFI). We illustrate these ideas for quantum systems described by
single-qubit states, two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, and a wide class of
multiparticle mixed states. Finally, we investigate the time evolution of the
$\alpha$-MQC spectrum and the overall signal of relative purity, by simulating
the time reversal dynamics of a many-body all-to-all Ising Hamiltonian and
comment on applications to physical platforms such as NMR systems, trapped
ions, and ultracold atoms.

greater than 1 GHz with a few exceptions at 800 MHz. The recent discoveries of
FRBs at 400 MHz from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)

while many other low frequency surveys in the past have failed to find any
FRBs. Here, we present results from a FRB survey recently conducted at the
Jodrell Bank Observatory at 332 MHz with the 76-m Lovell telescope for a total
of 58 days. We did not detect any FRBs in the survey and report a 90$\%$ upper
limit of 5500 FRBs per day per sky for a Euclidean Universe above a fluence
threshold of 46 Jy ms. We discuss the possibility of absorption as the main
cause of non-detections in low frequency (< 800 MHz) searches and invoke
different absorption models to explain the same. We find that Induced Compton
Scattering alone cannot account for absorption of radio emission and that our
simulations favour a combination of Induced Compton Scattering and Free-Free
Absorption to explain the non-detections. For a free-free absorption scenario,
our constraints on the electron density are consistent with those expected in
the post-shock region of the ionized ejecta in Super-Luminous SuperNovae

underpinning and remedy for this problem by first constructing a discriminator
in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This enables us to leverage
sample complexity and mean embedding to theoretically relate the error
probability bound of the KL estimates to the complexity of the discriminator in
RKHS. Based on this theory, we then present a scalable way to control the
complexity of the discriminator for a reliable estimation of KL divergence. We
support both our proposed theory and method to control the complexity of the

paramagnetic FeO under pressure using a refined version of our recently derived
many-body effective energy theory (MEET). We show that, within a nonmagnetic
description of the paramagnetic phase, the MEET gives an overall good
description of the photoemission spectrum at ambient pressure as well as the
changes it undergoes by increasing pressure. In particular at ambient pressure
the band gap opens between the mixed Fe $t_{2g}$ and O $2p$ states and the Fe
4s states and, moreover, a $d$-$d$ gap opens, which is compatible with a
high-spin configuration (hence nonzero local magnetic moments as observed in
experiment), whereas decreasing pressure the band gap tends to close, $t_{2g}$
states tend to become fully occupied and $e_{g}$ fully unoccupied, which is
compatible with a low-spin configuration (hence a collapse of the magnetic
moments as observed in experiment). This is a remarkable result, since, within
a nonmagnetic description of the paramagnetic phase, the MEET is capable to
correctly describe the photoemission spectrum and the spin configuration at
ambient as well as high pressure. For comparison we report the band gap values
obtained using density-functional theory with a hybrid functional containing
screened exchange (HSE06) and a variant of the $GW$ method (self-consistent
COHSEX), which are reliable for the description of the antiferromagnetic phase.
Both methods open a gap at ambient pressure, although, by construction, they
give a low-spin configuration; increasing pressure they correctly describes the
band gap closing. We also report the photoemission spectrum of the metallic
phase obtained with one-shot fully-dynamical $GW$ on top of LDA, which gives a
spectrum very similar to DMFT results from literature.

enrich the physics, for example by incorporating dissipative processes. Such
augmentation allows for including additional processes in a classic Newtonian
N-body integrator without alterations to the underlying code. These additional
processes include for example the Yarkovsky effect, dynamical friction or
relativistic dynamics. Some of these processes operate on all particles whereas
others apply only to a subset.
  The presented method is non-intrusive in the sense that the underlying

Nevertheless, mobility induces temporal correlations in the communication beams

data transmission and handover is proposed, that learns and exploits these
temporal correlations to reduce the beam training overhead and optimally
trade-off throughput and power consumption. At each time-slot, the serving base
station (BS) decides to perform either beam training, data communication, or
handover when blockage is detected, under uncertainty in the system state. The
decision problem is cast as a partially observable Markov decision process, and
the goal is to maximize the throughput delivered to the UE, under an average
power constraint. To address the high dimensional optimization, an approximate
constrained point-based value iteration (C-PBVI) method is developed, which
simultaneously optimizes the primal and dual functions to meet the power
constraint. Numerical results demonstrate a good match between the analysis and
a simulation based on 2D mobility and 3D analog beamforming via uniform planar
arrays at both BSs and UE, and reveal that C-PBVI performs near-optimally, and
outperforms a baseline scheme with periodic beam training by 38% in spectral
efficiency. Motivated by the structure of the C-PBVI policy, two heuristics are
proposed, that trade complexity with sub-optimality, and achieve only 4% and
15% loss in spectral efficiency.

intensities of electromagnetic radiation delivered by multi-petawatt laser
facilities. Using two model intensity distributions in the focus of a laser
beam, we show how the resulting yields of highly charged ions generated in the
process of multiple sequential tunneling of electrons from atoms, depend on the
shape of these distributions. Our findings lead to the conclusion that an
accurate extraction of the peak laser intensity can be made either in the
near-threshold regime when the production of the highest charge state happens
only in a small part of the laser focus close to the point where the intensity
is maximal, or through the determination of the points where the ion yields of
close charges become equal. We show that, for realistic parameters of the gas
target, the number of ions generated in the central part of the focus in the
threshold regime should be sufficient for a reliable measurement with highly
sensitive time-of-flight detectors. Although positions of the intersection
points generally depend on the focal shape, they can be used to localize the
peak intensity value in a certain interval. Additionally to this analysis, we
discuss the method in comparison to other recently proposed approaches for
direct measurement of extreme laser intensities.

By a proper choice of the constitutive relations for the Helmholtz free energy

that this choice is well motivated from the point of view of physics) and for
the energy dissipation, we are able to prove that $\mathbb{B}$ enjoys the same

This enables us to handle any kind of objective derivative of $\mathbb{B}$,
thus obtaining existence results for the class of diffusive Johnson-Segalman
models as well. Moreover, using a suitable approximation scheme, we are able to
show that $\mathbb{B}$ remains positive definite if the initial datum was a
positive definite matrix (in a pointwise sense). We also show how the model we

the distributions of magnitude changes (dm) over time intervals (dt) for a

reversion constrains forecasts by gradually drawing them to an average of
previously observed dynamics. This corrects deviations in forecasts caused by
irregularities such as chaotic, non-linear, and stochastic trends. The key
features of the approach include (1) it enforces mean reversion, (2) it
provides a means to model both short and long-term dynamics, (3) it is able to
apply mean reversion to select structural state-space components, and (4) it is
simple to implement. Our mean reversion approach is demonstrated on various

obtaining adversarial robustness of trained models. However, it is conservative
or even pessimistic so that it sometimes hurts the natural generalization. In
this paper, we raise a fundamental question---do we have to trade off natural
generalization for adversarial robustness? We argue that adversarial training
is to employ confident adversarial data for updating the current model. We
propose a novel approach of friendly adversarial training (FAT): rather than
employing most adversarial data maximizing the loss, we search for least
adversarial (i.e., friendly adversarial) data minimizing the loss, among the
adversarial data that are confidently misclassified. Our novel formulation is
easy to implement by just stopping the most adversarial data searching
algorithms such as PGD (projected gradient descent) early, which we call
early-stopped PGD. Theoretically, FAT is justified by an upper bound of the
adversarial risk. Empirically, early-stopped PGD allows us to answer the
earlier question negatively---adversarial robustness can indeed be achieved
without compromising the natural generalization.

requires that the model represents these natural processes correctly no matter

can lead to genetic aberrations. In particular, evolutionary events akin to
segmental duplications or deletions can alter the copy-number profile (CNP) of
a set of genes in a genome. Our aim is to compute the evolutionary distance
between two cells for which only CNPs are known. This asks for the minimum
number of segmental amplifications and deletions to turn one CNP into another.
This was recently formalized into a model where each event is assumed to alter
a copy-number by $1$ or $-1$, even though these events can affect large
portions of a chromosome. We propose a general cost framework where an event
can modify the copy-number of a gene by larger amounts. We show that any cost
scheme that allows segmental deletions of arbitrary length makes computing the
distance strongly NP-hard. We then devise a factor $2$ approximation algorithm
for the problem when copy-numbers are non-zero and provide an implementation
called \textsf{cnp2cnp}. We evaluate our approach experimentally by
reconstructing simulated cancer phylogenies from the pairwise distances
inferred by \textsf{cnp2cnp} and compare it against two other alternatives,
namely the \textsf{MEDICC} distance and the Euclidean distance. The
experimental results show that our distance yields more accurate phylogenies on
average than these alternatives if the given CNPs are error-free, but that the
\textsf{MEDICC} distance is slightly more robust against error in the data. In
all cases, our experiments show that either our approach or the \textsf{MEDICC}

that the progenitors of cQGs are cSFGs, and cSFGs are at a transitional phase
between eSFGs and cQGs. The prevalence of X-ray selected AGNs ($\sim 28\%$) is
confirmed in the cSFGs at $1<z<2$ which indicates that the violent gas-rich
processes such as merger and disk instability could drive the structure to be
more compact, and trigger both star formation and black hole growth in the
central regions. Our results support the ""two-step"" scenario that the cSFGs at
$1<z<2$ are the intermediate population after compaction but before a quick
quenching. Our analysis of parametric and nonparametric morphologies shows that
cQGs (eQGs) are more concentrated and have less substructures than cSFGs
(eSFGs), and quenching and compactness should be associated with each other.
The cSFGs at $1.5<z<2$ ($1<z<1.5$) prefer to be in higher (lower) density
environment, similar as cQGs (eSFGs). It suggests that merger or strong
interaction might be the main driving mechanism of compaction at higher
redshifts, whereas the disk instability of individual galaxies might play a
more important role on the formation of cSFGs at lower redshifts.

introduce a new framework, Covariate Balance via Discrepancy Minimization

multivariate). We establish theoretical guarantees for our framework that both
offer generalizations of properties known when the treatment is binary, and
give a better grasp on what hyperparameters to choose in non-binary settings.

analytically be represented as graphs. Having access to this graph, which is
sometimes trivially evident from domain knowledge, provides a better
representation of the data and facilitates various information processing
tasks. However, in cases where the underlying graph is unavailable, it needs to
be learned from the data itself for data representation, data processing and
inference purposes. Existing literature on learning graphs from data has mostly
considered arbitrary graphs, whereas the graphs generating real-world data tend
to have additional structure that can be incorporated in the graph learning
procedure. Structure-aware graph learning methods require learning fewer
parameters and have the potential to reduce computational, memory and sample
complexities. In light of this, the focus of this paper is to devise a method
to learn structured graphs from data that are given in the form of product
graphs. Product graphs arise naturally in many real-world datasets and provide
an efficient and compact representation of large-scale graphs through several
smaller factor graphs. To this end, first the graph learning problem is posed
as a linear program, which (on average) outperforms the state-of-the-art graph
learning algorithms. This formulation is of independent interest itself as it
shows that graph learning is possible through a simple linear program.
Afterwards, an alternating minimization-based algorithm aimed at learning
various types of product graphs is proposed, and local convergence guarantees
to the true solution are established for this algorithm. Finally the
performance gains, reduced sample complexity, and inference capabilities of the
proposed algorithm over existing methods are also validated through numerical
simulations on synthetic and real datasets.

still uncertain, as are the boundaries of the stellar BH mass function. Stellar
evolution models predict a dearth of BHs both at masses $\gtrsim 50$ M$_\odot$
and $\lesssim 5$ M$_\odot$, thus leaving low- and high-mass gaps in the BH mass
function. A natural way to form BHs of these masses is through mergers of
neutron stars (NSs; for the low-mass gap) or lower-mass BHs (for the high-mass
gap); the low- or high-mass-gap BH produced as a merger product can then be
detected by LIGO-Virgo if it merges again with a new companion. We show that
the evolution of a 2+2 quadruple system can naturally lead to BH mergers with
component masses in the low- or high-mass gaps. In our scenario, the BH in the
mass gap originates from the merger of two NSs, or two BHs, in one of the two
binaries and the merger product is imparted a recoil kick (from anisotropic
gravitational wave emission), which triggers its interaction with the other
binary component of the quadruple system. The outcome of this three-body
interaction is usually a new eccentric compact binary containing the BH in the
mass gap, which can then merge again. The merger rate is $\sim 10^{-7} -
10^{-2}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim 10^{-3} - 10^{-2}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$

gravitational wave detectors improves, tighter constraints will soon be placed
on the stellar BH mass function.

Attacks against wireless communication venues of IoT (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle

allows the establishment of the secure communicating channels for IoT devices
without a prior relationship, is thus a paramount capability. Existing secure
pairing protocols require auxiliary equipment/peripheral (e.g., displays,
speakers and sensors) to achieve authentication, which is unacceptable for
low-priced devices such as smart lamps. This paper studies how to design a
peripheral-free secure pairing protocol. Concretely, we design the protocol,
termed SwitchPairing, via out-of-box power supplying chargers and on-board
clocks, achieving security and economics at the same time. When a user wants to
pair two or more devices, he/she connects the pairing devices to the same power
source, and presses/releases the switch on/off button several times. Then, the
press and release timing can be used to derive symmetric keys. We implement a
prototype via two CC2640R2F development boards from Texas Instruments (TI) due
to its prevalence. Extensive experiments and user studies are also conducted to
benchmark our protocol in terms of efficiency and security.

governing the spatio-temporal variability of tropical water vapor, the behavior

organization of tropical convection, we hereby introduce a new organization

self-aggregation in idealized cloud-resolving simulations of

synthesis and design space exploration. When applied in engineering design,
existing generative models face three challenges: 1) generated designs lack
diversity and do not cover all areas of the design space, 2) it is difficult to
explicitly improve the overall performance or quality of generated designs, and
3) existing models generally do not generate novel designs, outside the domain
of the training data. In this paper, we simultaneously address these challenges
by proposing a new Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for
probabilistic modeling of diversity and quality. With this new loss function,
we develop a variant of the Generative Adversarial Network, named ""Performance
Augmented Diverse Generative Adversarial Network"" or PaDGAN, which can generate
novel high-quality designs with good coverage of the design space. Using three
synthetic examples and one real-world airfoil design example, we demonstrate
that PaDGAN can generate diverse and high-quality designs. In comparison to a
vanilla Generative Adversarial Network, on average, it generates samples with a
28% higher mean quality score with larger diversity and without the mode
collapse issue. Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new
designs by interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that
PaDGAN expands the design space boundary outside the training data towards
high-quality regions. The proposed method is broadly applicable to many tasks
including design space exploration, design optimization, and creative solution

We call such ODEs neural parametric Fokker-Planck equations. The fact that the

we design a variational semi-implicit scheme for the time discretization of the

Fokker-Planck equations in higher dimensional spaces. Moreover, we also
establish bounds for the asymptotic convergence analysis of the neural
parametric Fokker-Planck equation as well as the error analysis for both the

rotations is commonly attained via equivariant models (e.g., StdCNNs, GCNNs)
and training augmentation, whereas adversarial robustness is typically achieved
by adversarial training. In this paper, we prove a quantitative trade-off
between spatial and adversarial robustness in a simple statistical setting. We
complement this empirically by showing that: (a) as the spatial robustness of
equivariant models improves by training augmentation with progressively larger
transformations, their adversarial robustness worsens progressively, and (b) as
the state-of-the-art robust models are adversarially trained with progressively
larger pixel-wise perturbations, their spatial robustness drops progressively.
Towards achieving pareto-optimality in this trade-off, we propose a method
based on curriculum learning that trains gradually on more difficult
perturbations (both spatial and adversarial) to improve spatial and adversarial

of the optimization of the commute distance or the economic profit.
Incorporating more general objective functions into such optimization framework
may be useful, helping the policy decisions to meet various social and economic
demands. As an example, we consider how hospitals should be distributed to
minimize the total fatalities of tuberculosis (TB). The empirical data of Korea
shows that the fatality rate of TB in a district decreases with the areal
density of hospitals, implying their correlation and the possibility of
reducing the nationwide fatalities by adjusting the hospital distribution
across districts. Approximating the fatality rate by the probability of a
patient not to visit a hospital in her/his residential district for the
duration period of TB and evaluating the latter probability in the random-walk
framework, we obtain the fatality rate as an exponential function of the
hospital density with a characteristic constant related to each district's
effective lattice constant estimable empirically. This leads us to the optimal
hospital distribution which finds the hospital density in a district to be a
logarithmic function of the rescaled patient density. The total fatalities is
reduced by 13\% with this optimum. The current hospital density deviates from
the optimized one in different manners from district to district, which is
analyzed in the proposed model framework. The assumptions and limitations of
our study are also discussed.

variance increase with model complexity, leading to a U-shaped risk curve.
Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other
over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models
generalize better. We provide a simple explanation for this by measuring the
bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is monotonically
decreasing as in the classical theory, the variance is unimodal or bell-shaped:
it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network
architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance
unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the
sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes
depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent
curve observed in recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these
empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with
random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that
most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases
by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease
bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
data.

combines the nonlinear operation of rotation with the linear operations of
multiplication and (optionally) addition. Compared to conventional linear-only
PRNGs, this mixture of linear and nonlinear operations achieves a greater
degree of randomness using the same number of arithmetic operations. Or
equivalently, it achieves the same randomness with fewer operations, resulting
in higher speed. The statistical properties of these generators are strong, as
they pass BigCrush and PractRand -- the most stringent test suites available.
In addition, Romu generators take maximum advantage of instruction-level
parallelism in modern superscalar processors, giving them an output latency of
zero clock-cycles when inlined, thus adding no delay to an application.
Scaled-down versions of these generators can be created and tested, enabling
one to estimate the maximum number of values the full-size generators can
supply before their randomness declines, ensuring the success of large jobs.
Such capacity-estimates are rare for conventional PRNGs. A linear PRNG has a
single cycle of states of known length comprising almost all possible states.
However, a Romu generator computes pseudo-random permutations of those states,
creating multiple cycles with pseudo-random lengths which cannot be determined
by theory. But the ease of creating state-sizes of 128 or more bits allows (1)
short cycles to be constrained to vanishingly low probabilities, and (2)
thousands of parallel streams to be created having infinitesimal probabilities
of overlap.

tasks, while the mainstream models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) rely on the gating
mechanism (in control of how information flows between hidden states). However,
the vanilla gates in RNN (e.g., the input gate in LSTM) suffer from the problem
of gate undertraining, which can be caused by various factors, such as the
saturating activation functions, the gate layouts (e.g., the gate number and
gating functions), or even the suboptimal memory state etc.. Those may result
in failures of learning gating switch roles and thus the weak performance. In
this paper, we propose a new gating mechanism within general gated recurrent
neural networks to handle this issue. Specifically, the proposed gates directly
short connect the extracted input features to the outputs of vanilla gates,
denoted as refined gates. The refining mechanism allows enhancing gradient
back-propagation as well as extending the gating activation scope, which can
guide RNN to reach possibly deeper minima. We verify the proposed gating
mechanism on three popular types of gated RNNs including LSTM, GRU and MGU.
Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic tasks, 3 language modeling tasks and 5

including the effect of the acoustic modes. The Landau damping and resonant
destabilization effects are added via the closure relation. On-axis and
off-axis NBI current drive modifies the rotational transform which becomes
strongly distorted as the intensity of the neutral beam current drive (NBCD)
increases, leading to wider continuum gaps and modifying the magnetic shear.
The simulations with on-axis NBI injection show that a counter (ctr-) NBCD in
inward shifted and default configurations leads to a lower growth rate of the
PM, although strong n=1 and 2 AEs can be destabilized. For the outward shifted
configurations, a co-NBCD improves the AEs stability but the PM are further
destabilized if the co-NBCD intensity is 30 kA/T. If the NBI injection is
off-axis, the plasma stability is not significantly improved due to the further
destabilization of the AE and energetic particle modes (EPM) in the middle and
outer plasma region.

methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the
number of iterations, there are no methods which combine the benefits of both
gradient compression and acceleration. In this paper, we remedy this situation
and propose the first accelerated compressed gradient descent (ACGD) methods.
In the single machine regime, we prove that ACGD enjoys the rate
$O\Big((1+\omega)\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\Big)$ for
$\mu$-strongly convex problems and
$O\Big((1+\omega)\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$ for convex problems,
respectively, where $\omega$ is the compression parameter. Our results improve
upon the existing non-accelerated rates $O\Big((1+\omega)\frac{L}{\mu}\log
\frac{1}{\epsilon}\Big)$ and $O\Big((1+\omega)\frac{L}{\epsilon}\Big)$,
respectively, and recover the optimal rates of accelerated gradient descent as
a special case when no compression ($\omega=0$) is applied. We further propose
a distributed variant of ACGD (called ADIANA) and prove the convergence rate
$\widetilde{O}\Big(\omega+\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}+\sqrt{\big(\frac{\omega}{n}+\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{n}}\big)\frac{\omega
L}{\mu}}\Big)$, where $n$ is the number of devices/workers and $\widetilde{O}$
hides the logarithmic factor $\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This improves upon the
previous best result $\widetilde{O}\Big(\omega + \frac{L}{\mu}+\frac{\omega
L}{n\mu} \Big)$ achieved by the DIANA method of Mishchenko et al. (2019).
Finally, we conduct several experiments on real-world datasets which

can be useful for OR planning and anesthesia dose estimation. With the recent
success of deep learning-based methods in computer vision, several neural
network approaches have been proposed for fully automatic RSD prediction based
solely on visual data from the endoscopic camera. We investigate whether RSD
prediction can be improved using unsupervised temporal video segmentation as an
auxiliary learning task. As opposed to previous work, which presented
supervised surgical phase recognition as auxiliary task, we avoid the need for
manual annotations by proposing a similar but unsupervised learning objective
which clusters video sequences into temporally coherent segments. In multiple
experimental setups, results obtained by learning the auxiliary task are
incorporated into a deep RSD model through feature extraction, pretraining or
regularization. Further, we propose a novel loss function for RSD training
which attempts to counteract unfavorable characteristics of the RSD ground
truth. Using our unsupervised method as an auxiliary task for RSD training, we
outperform other self-supervised methods and are comparable to the supervised
state-of-the-art. Combined with the novel RSD loss, we slightly outperform the
supervised approach.

problem, with gradient-based approaches as predominant methods. When modelling
multivariate likelihoods, a usual but undesirable outcome is that the learned

this work, we study this problem through the lens of multitask learning (MTL),
where similar effects have been broadly studied. While MTL solutions do not
directly apply in the probabilistic setting (as they cannot handle the
likelihood constraints) we show that similar ideas may be leveraged during data
preprocessing. First, we show that data standardization often helps under
common continuous likelihoods, but it is not enough in the general case,
specially under mixed continuous and discrete likelihood models. In order for
balance multivariate learning, we then propose a novel data preprocessing,
Lipschitz standardization, which balances the local Lipschitz smoothness across
variables. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that Lipschitz
standardization leads to more accurate multivariate models than the ones
learned using existing data preprocessing techniques. The models and datasets

interest in the design of \emph{recoverable concurrent objects} that are robust

algorithms that, in addition to ensuring object consistency, also provide
\emph{detectability}, a correctness condition requiring that the recovery code
can infer if the failed operation was linearized or not and, in the former

contributions. First, we present the first wait-free bounded-space detectable
read/write and CAS object implementations. Second, we prove that the bit
complexity of every $N$-process obstruction-free detectable CAS implementation,
assuming values from a domain of size at least $N$, is $\Omega(N)$. Finally, we
prove that the following holds for obstruction-free detectable implementations
of a large class of objects: their recoverable operations must be provided with
\emph{auxiliary state} -- state that is not required by the non-recoverable
counterpart implementation -- whose value must be provided from outside the
operation, either by the system or by the caller of the operation. In contrast,
this external support is, in general, not required if the recoverable algorithm

electrostatic plasma in the presence of a constant external magnetic field. The
Bernstein-Landau paradox consists in that in the presence of the magnetic
field, the electric field and the charge density fluctuation have an
oscillatory behavior in time. This is radically different from Landau damping,
in the case without magnetic field, where the electric field tends to zero for
large times. We consider this problem from a new point of view. Instead of
analyzing the linear magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system, as it is usually done,
we study the linear magnetized Vlasov-Amp\`ere system. We formulate the
magnetized Vlasov-Amp\`ere system as a Schr\""odinger equation with a
selfadjoint magnetized Vlasov-Amp\`ere operator in the Hilbert space of states
with finite energy. The magnetized Vlasov-Amp\`ere operator has a complete set
of orthonormal eigenfunctions, that include the Bernstein modes. The expansion
of the solution of the magnetized Vlasov-Amp\`ere system in the eigenfunctions
shows the oscillatory behavior in time. We prove the convergence of the
expansion under optimal conditions, assuming only that the initial state has
finite energy. This solves a problem that was recently posed in the literature.
The Bernstein modes are not complete. To have a complete system it is necessary
to add eigenfunctions that are associated with eigenvalues at all the integer
multiples of the cyclotron frequency. These special plasma oscillations
actually exist on their own, without the excitation of the other modes. In the
limit when the magnetic fields goes to zero the spectrum of the magnetized
Vlasov-Amp\`ere operator changes drastically from pure point to absolutely
continuous in the orthogonal complement to its kernel, due to a sharp change on
its domain. This explains the Bernstein-Landau paradox.

to deliver information from hosting servers to users in the most efficient way.
In 2014, Maddah-Ali and Niessen formulated caching into a formal information

that the caching schemes proposed by Ali-Niesen and Yu et. al. are optimal,
that is, they require the least number of transmissions from the server to
satisfy all users' demands. However for these schemes to work, each file needs
to be partitioned into $F^*$ subfiles ($F^*$ is called the subpacketization
level of files) with $F^*$ growing exponentially in the number $K$ of users. As
a result, it is problematic to apply these schemes in practical situations,
where $K$ tends to be very large. There rise the following questions: (1) are
there optimal schemes in which each file is partitioned into $F$ subfiles,
where $F$ is not exponential, say polynomial for example, in $K$? (2) if the
answer to this question is no, is there a near-optimal scheme, a scheme which
is as asymptotically good as the one in \cite{ali1,yu}, with $F$ polynomial in
$K$? Both these questions are open.
  Our main contribution in this paper is to provide answers to above questions.
Firstly, we prove that under some mild restriction on user's cache rate, there
are no optimal schemes with $F$ smaller than $F^*$. Moreover, we give necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal schemes in this case.
Secondly, we provide an affirmative answer to the second question raised above

dollars for thousands of startups in the past two years. Existing ICO
mechanisms place more emphasis on the short-term benefits of maximal
fundraising while ignoring the problem of unbalanced token allocation, which
negatively impacts subsequent fundraising and has bad effects on introducing
new investors and resources. We propose a new ICO mechanism which uses the
concept of Gini index for the very first time as a mechanism design constraint
to control allocation inequality. Our mechanism maintains an elegant and
straightforward structure. It allows the agents to modify their bids as a price
discovery process, while limiting the bids of whales. We analyze the agents'
equilibrium behaviors under our mechanism. Under natural technical assumptions,
we show that most agents have simple dominant strategies and the equilibrium
revenue approaches the optimal revenue asymptotically in the number of agents.
We verify our mechanism using real ICO dataset we collected, and confirm that
our mechanism performs well in terms of both allocation fairness and revenue.

they share no similarity whatsoever with the standard triangle diagram chiral
anomaly calculation. We provide a new computation of the same helicity
four-point amplitude by a method designed to mimic the chiral anomaly
derivation. This is done by using the momentum conservation to rewrite the
logarithmically divergent four-point amplitude as a sum of linearly and then
quadratically divergent integrals. These integrals are then seen to vanish

network removes noise and adjusts the kernel of the inputted LR image; then,
the corrected clean LR image is upscaled by the SR network. In the training
phase, the correction network also produces a pseudo-clean LR image from the
inputted HR image, and then a mapping from the pseudo-clean LR image to the
inputted HR image is learned by the SR network in a paired manner. Because our
SR network is independent of the correction network, well-studied existing
network architectures and pixel-wise loss functions can be integrated with the
proposed framework. Experiments on diverse datasets show that the proposed
method is superior to existing solutions to the unpaired SR problem.

often use invasive markers and require intricate equipment with complicated

that can convert the subwavelength image information contained in the

absorption losses, which has so far largely hindered their practical
applications. Here, we solve this vexing problem and show that this limitation
can be turned into an advantage when metalenses are combined with deep learning
techniques. We demonstrate that combining deep learning with lossy metalenses
allows recognizing and imaging largely subwavelength features directly from the
far field. Our acoustic learning experiment shows that, despite being thirty
times smaller than the wavelength of sound, the fine details of images can be
successfully reconstructed and recognized in the far field, which is crucially
enabled by the presence of absorption. We envision applications in acoustic

localization of the target vertebral level (i.e. the position of a vertebra in

either higher chances of procedure failure or exposure to ionizing radiation.
Preliminary studies have been conducted in the literature, suggesting that
ultrasound imaging may be a precise and safe alternative to X-ray for spine
level detection. However, ultrasound data are noisy and complicated to
interpret. In this study, a robotic-ultrasound approach for automatic vertebral
level detection is introduced. The method relies on the fusion of ultrasound
and force data, thus providing both ""tactile"" and visual feedback during the
procedure, which results in higher performances in presence of data corruption.
A robotic arm automatically scans the volunteer's back along the spine by using
force-ultrasound data to locate vertebral levels. The occurrences of vertebral
levels are visible on the force trace as peaks, which are enhanced by properly
controlling the force applied by the robot on the patient back. Ultrasound data
are processed with a Deep Learning method to extract a 1D signal modelling the
probabilities of having a vertebra at each location along the spine. Processed
force and ultrasound data are fused using a 1D Convolutional Network to compute
the location of the vertebral levels. The method is compared to pure image and
pure force-based methods for vertebral level counting, showing improved
performance. In particular, the fusion method is able to correctly classify
100% of the vertebral levels in the test set, while pure image and pure
force-based method could only classify 80% and 90% vertebrae, respectively. The
potential of the proposed method is evaluated in an exemplary simulated

duplicates the geometry of a lattice. We observe a fundamental difference
between the states on a comb with even and odd number of sites per tooth, which
resembles an even-odd effect in spin-1/2 ladders. The comb with odd teeth is
always critical, not only along the teeth, but also along the backbone, which
leads to a competition between two critical regimes in orthogonal directions.
In addition, we show that in a weak-backbone limit the excitation energy scales
as $1/(NL)$, and not as $1/N$ or $1/L$ typical for 1D systems. For even teeth
in the weak backbone limit the system corresponds to a collection of decoupled
critical chains of length $L$, while in the strong backbone limit, one spin
from each tooth forms the backbone, so the effective length of a critical tooth
is one site shorter, $L-1$. Surprisingly, these two regimes are connected via a
state where a critical chain spans over two nearest neighbor teeth, with an

detailed study of Galactic cosmic-ray transport. We constrain previously
derived benchmark scenarios (based on AMS-02 B/C data only) using other
secondary-to-primary ratios, to test the universality of transport and the
presence of a low-rigidity diffusion break. We use the 1D thin disc/thick halo
propagation model of USINE and a $\chi^2$ minimisation accounting for a
covariance matrix of errors (AMS-02 systematics) and nuisance parameters
(cross-sections and solar modulation uncertainties). The combined analysis of
AMS-02 Li/C, Be/C, and B/C strengthens the case for a diffusion slope of
$\delta=0.50\pm 0.03$ with a low-rigidity break or upturn of the diffusion
coefficient at GV rigidities. Our simple model can successfully reproduce all
considered data (Li/C, Be/C, B/C, N/O, and 3He/4He), although several issues
remain: (i) the quantitative agreement depends on the assumptions made on the
not well constrained correlation lengths of AMS-02 data systematics; (ii)
combined analyses are very sensitive to production cross sections, and we find
post-fit values differing by $\sim5-15\%$ from their most likely values
(roughly within currently estimated nuclear uncertainties); (iii) two very
distinct regions of the parameter space remain viable, either with
reacceleration and convection, or with purely diffusive transport. To take full
benefit of combined analyses of AMS-02 data, better nuclear data and a better
handle on energy correlations in the data systematic are required. AMS-02 data
on heavier species are eagerly awaited to further explore cosmic-ray
propagation scenarios.

Such optimal configuration changes depending on the body blockage probability,
leading to a necessity for network designers to carefully consider their

Moreover, each network layer exhibits a different ability to separate between

both $p\to K^0\mu^+$ and $p\to K^+\bar{\nu}_\mu$ decays at Hyper-Kamiokande,
thereby gaining a hint for the minimal renormalizable SUSY $SO(10)$ GUT.

$SU(5)$ GUT, it allows us to distinguish the minimal renormalizable SUSY
$SO(10)$ GUT from the minimal $SU(5)$ GUT. In the main body of the paper, we
perform a fitting of the quark and lepton masses and flavor mixings with the

large authenticate data set of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) online

primarily divided into two categories. First category is auto-encoder (AE) and
the second one is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we
have evaluated various kinds of AE as well as GANs and have compared their

then show that the contraction of the system's distinction -- relative to the
minimally dissipative state -- exactly quantifies its thermodynamic
dissipation. The quantum component of this dissipation is the change in
coherence relative to the minimally dissipative state. Implications for quantum

self-consistently with the atmosphere model, instead of assuming a simplified
deep-heated atmosphere in radiative equilibrium. We used exact Compton
scattering formalism to model the properties of the emergent X-ray radiation.
The deep-heating approximation was found to be valid only if most of the heat
originates from ultra-relativistic bombarding particles with Lorentz factors of
$\gamma \gtrsim 100$. In the opposite regime, the atmosphere attains a distinct
two-layer structure with an overheated optically thin skin on top of an
optically thick cool plasma. The overheated skin strongly modifies the emergent
radiation: it produces a Compton-upscattered high-energy tail in the spectrum
and alters the radiation beaming pattern from limb darkening to limb
brightening for emitted hard X-rays. This kind of drastic change in the
emission properties can have a significant impact on the inferred NS pulse
profile parameters as performed, for example, by Neutron star Interior

reaches the sink as early as possible given the pattern of the rest of the

relatively recent. In particular, the derivatives of dynamic equilibria have

flows with resetting as linear complementarity problem and its analysis. We
present a constructive proof of existence for dynamic equilibria if the inflow

Advanced methods take into considerations the correlations in the video

optical flow, or extracting the frame representations with other frames, which
may lead to inaccurate results or unbalanced latency. In this work, we process
efficient semantic video segmentation in a per-frame fashion during the
inference process. Different from previous per-frame models, we explicitly
consider the temporal consistency among frames as extra constraints during the
training process and embed the temporal consistency into the segmentation
network. Therefore, in the inference process, we can process each frame
independently with no latency, and improve the temporal consistency with no
extra computational cost and post-processing. We employ compact models for
real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and
large models, new knowledge distillation methods are designed. Our results
outperform previous keyframe based methods with a better trade-off between the
accuracy and the inference speed on popular benchmarks, including the
Cityscapes and Camvid. The temporal consistency is also improved compared with

division, there are $n$ agents with valuations over the interval $[0,1]$, and
the goal is to divide the interval into pieces and assign a label ""$+$"" or
""$-$"" to each piece, such that every agent values the total amount of ""$+$"" and
the total amount of ""$-$"" almost equally. The problem was recently proven by
Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [2019] to be the first ""natural"" complete problem
for the computational class PPA, answering a decade-old open question.
  In this paper, we examine the extent to which the problem becomes easy to
solve, if one restricts the class of valuation functions. To this end, we
provide the following contributions. First, we obtain a strengthening of the
PPA-hardness result of [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg, 2019], to the case when
agents have piecewise uniform valuations with only two blocks. We obtain this
result via a new reduction, which is in fact conceptually much simpler than the
corresponding one in [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg, 2019]. Then, we consider the
case of single-block (uniform) valuations and provide a parameterized
polynomial time algorithm for solving $\varepsilon$-Consensus-Halving for any
$\varepsilon$, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for $\varepsilon=1/2$.
Finally, an important application of our new techniques is the first hardness
result for a generalization of Consensus-Halving, the Consensus-$1/k$-Division
problem [Simmons and Su, 2003]. In particular, we prove that
$\varepsilon$-Consensus-$1/3$-Division is PPAD-hard.

photodetectors able to guarantee increased sensitivity, high spatial and
temporal resolution and ease of integration into modern microscopy
architectures. Recent advances in single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)
fabricated with industry-standard microelectronic processes allow the
development of new detection systems tailored to address the requirements of
advanced imaging techniques (such as image-scanning microscopy). To this aim,
we present the complete design and characterization of two bidimensional SPAD
arrays composed of 25 fully independent and asynchronously-operated pixels,
both having fill-factor of about 50% and specifically designed for being
integrated into existing laser scanning microscopes. We used two different
microelectronics technologies to fabricate our detectors: the first technology
exhibiting very low noise (roughly 200 dark counts per second at room
temperature), and the second one showing enhanced detection efficiency (more
than 60% at a wavelength of 500 nm). Starting from the silicon-level device
structures and moving towards the in pixel and readout electronics description,
we present performance assessments and comparisons between the two detectors.
Images of a biological sample acquired after their integration into our custom
image-scanning microscope finally demonstrate their exquisite on-field
performance in terms of spatial resolution and contrast enhancement. We
envisage that this work can trigger the development of a new class of
SPAD-based detector arrays able to substitute the typical single-element sensor
used in fluorescence laser scanning microscopy.

collisions have been going on for a decade, and so far there is no conclusive
evidence for its existence. Recently, the Signed Balance Function (SBF), based
on the idea of examining the momentum ordering of charged pairs along the in-
and out-of-plane directions, has been proposed as a probe of CME. In this
approach, a pair of observables is invoked: one is $r_{\mathrm{rest}}$, the
out-of-plane to in-plane ratio of $\Delta B$ measured in pair's rest frame,
where $\Delta B$ is the difference between signed balance functions; The other
is a double ratio, $R_{\mathrm{B}} = r_{\mathrm{rest}}/r_{\mathrm{lab}}$, where
$r_{\mathrm{lab}}$ is a measurement similar to $r_{\mathrm{rest}}$ but measured
in the laboratory frame. These two observables give opposite responses to the
CME-driven charge separation compared to the background correlations arising
from resonance flow and global spin alignment. Both $r_{\mathrm{rest}}$ and
$R_{\mathrm{B}}$ being larger than unity can be regarded as a case in favor of
the existence of CME. It is found experimentally that $r_{\mathrm{rest}}$,
$r_{\mathrm{lab}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{B}}$ are larger than unity in Au+Au
collisions at 200 GeV, and larger than realistic model calculations with no CME
implemented. These findings are difficult to be explained by a background-only
scenario.

toward a pure Nash equilibrium via a local search method. The quality of the
equilibrium reached may depend heavily on the order by which players are chosen
to perform their best response moves. A {\em deviator rule} $S$ is a method for
selecting the next deviating player. We provide a measure for quantifying the
performance of different deviator rules. The {\em inefficiency} of a deviator
rule $S$ is the maximum ratio, over all initial profiles $p$, between the
social cost of the worst equilibrium reachable by $S$ from $p$ and the social
cost of the best equilibrium reachable from $p$. This inefficiency always lies
between $1$ and the {\em price of anarchy}.
  We study the inefficiency of various deviator rules in network formation
games and job scheduling games (both are congestion games, where BR dynamics
always converges to a pure NE). For some classes of games, we compute optimal
deviator rules. Furthermore, we define and study a new class of deviator rules,
called {\em local} deviator rules. Such rules choose the next deviator as a
function of a restricted set of parameters, and satisfy a natural condition
called {\em independence of irrelevant players}. We present upper bounds on the
inefficiency of some local deviator rules, and also show that for some classes
of games, no local deviator rule can guarantee inefficiency lower than the
price of anarchy.

specific impacts on wellbeing remained unexplored. In this work, we propose an
orientation-driven migration approach for mobile individuals in combination

cooperation can be greatly promoted when individuals are more inclined to
escape away from their defective neighbors. On the contrary, cooperation cannot
be effectively maintained when individuals are more motivated to approach their
cooperative neighbors. In addition, compared with random migration, movement by
leaving defectors can promote cooperation more effectively. By means of
theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we further find that when
individuals only choose to escape away from their defective neighbors, the
average distance between cooperators and defectors can be enlarged, hence the
natural invasion of defection can be efficiently blocked. Our work, thus,
provides further insight on how different migration preferences influence the

is nevertheless possible in the polar phase of p-wave superfluid $^3$He, which
features a Dirac node line in the energy spectrum of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.
The fluid is driven by rotation of the whole cryostat, and superflow breakdown
is seen as the appearance of single- or half-quantum vortices. Vortices are
detected using the relaxation rate of a Bose-Einstein condensate of magnons,
created within the fluid. The superflow in the polar phase is found to be
stable up to a finite critical velocity $v_{\rm c}\approx 0.2\,$cm/s, despite
the zero value of the Landau critical velocity. We suggest that the stability
of the superflow above $v_{\mathrm{cL}}$ but below $v_{\rm c}$ is provided by
the accumulation of the flow-induced quasiparticles into pockets in the
momentum space, bounded by Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. In the polar phase this
surface has non-trivial topology which includes two pseudo-Weyl points.
Vortices forming above the critical velocity are strongly pinned in the
confining matrix, used to stabilize the polar phase, and hence stable
macroscopic superflow can be maintained even when the external drive is brought

encountered in waste segregation or in any task that requires disassembly of
structures. Often there are no object models, and, especially with cluttered
irregularly shaped objects, the robot can not create a model of the scene due
to occlusion. One of our key insights is that based on previous sensory input
we are only interested in moving an object out of the disentanglement around
obstacles. That is, we only need to know where the robot can successfully move
in order to plan the disentangling. Due to the uncertainty we integrate
information about blocked movements into a probability map. The map defines the
probability of the robot successfully moving to a specific configuration. Using
as cost the failure probability of a sequence of movements we can then plan and
execute disentangling iteratively. Since our approach circumvents only
previously encountered obstacles, new movements will yield information about
unknown obstacles that block movement until the robot has learned to circumvent
all obstacles and disentangling succeeds. In the experiments, we use a special
probabilistic version of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for
planning and demonstrate successful disentanglement of objects both in 2-D and
3-D simulation, and, on a KUKA LBR 7-DOF robot. Moreover, our approach

taxonomies that focus on specific scenarios, e.g., indiscriminate or targeted,
have enabled defenses for the corresponding subset of known attacks. Yet, this
introduces an inevitable arms race between adversaries and defenders. In this
work, we study the feasibility of an attack-agnostic defense relying on
artifacts that are common to all poisoning attacks. Specifically, we focus on a
common element between all attacks: they modify gradients computed to train the
model. We identify two main artifacts of gradients computed in the presence of
poison: (1) their $\ell_2$ norms have significantly higher magnitudes than
those of clean gradients, and (2) their orientation differs from clean
gradients. Based on these observations, we propose the prerequisite for a
generic poisoning defense: it must bound gradient magnitudes and minimize
differences in orientation. We call this gradient shaping. As an exemplar tool
to evaluate the feasibility of gradient shaping, we use differentially private
stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), which clips and perturbs individual
gradients during training to obtain privacy guarantees. We find that DP-SGD,
even in configurations that do not result in meaningful privacy guarantees,
increases the model's robustness to indiscriminate attacks. It also mitigates
worst-case targeted attacks and increases the adversary's cost in multi-poison
scenarios. The only attack we find DP-SGD to be ineffective against is a
strong, yet unrealistic, indiscriminate attack. Our results suggest that, while
we currently lack a generic poisoning defense, gradient shaping is a promising
direction for future research.

maximize the overall network rate while maintaining fairness among the D2D

impact the initial mass function (IMF) of the first stars. We perform 200
high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D), magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of the collapse of primordial clouds with different initial turbulent magnetic
field strengths as predicted from turbulent dynamo theory in the early

day. Additionally, strong fields shift the transition point where stars go from
being mostly single to mostly multiple to higher masses. However, irrespective
of the field strength, individual simulations are highly chaotic, show
different levels of fragmentation and clustering, and the outcome depends on
the exact realisation of the turbulence in the primordial clouds. While these
are still idealised simulations that do not start from cosmological initial

magnetization/demagnetization processes in increasing/decreasing magnetic
fields were investigated by means of magnetic-force-microscopy (MFM) images at
low temperatures. The observed domain structure is typical for a ferromagnet
with strong uniaxial anisotropy. The evolution of magnetic domains during
cooling of the crystal below TC has also been manifested by MFM images.
Analysis of the available data reveals that the high uniaxial
magnetocrystalline energy in combination with the relatively small
ferromagnetic exchange interaction in UCoGa gives rise to the formation of very
narrow domain walls formed by the pairs of the nearest U neighbor ions with
antiparallel magnetic moments within the basal plane. Since the very high
anisotropy energy is a common feature of the majority of the uniaxial U

formation in multicomponent-liquid droplet combustion. Both the gas-to-particle
conversion and droplet-to-particle conversion routes of different solution
properties are investigated, together with the population balance model and the
droplet drying model. For multi-component droplets without precursors, the
droplet combustion is limited by the species diffusion in the liquid phase. The
model can well predict the droplet shrinkage history observed by previous PDA
measurements. For the precursor with a low boiling point than its thermal
decomposition temperature, the precursor in the droplet can then transform into
nanoparticles through the gas-to-particle conversion route. The population
balance model reveals that the generated nanoparticle size relies on both the
precursor mass fraction and the residence time, which is consistent with the
vapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis. For the precursor that tends to decompose or
precipitate in the liquid, it then undergoes the droplet-to-particle conversion
route. The droplet behavior can be classified by the ratio of droplet
evaporation time and precursor reaction or precipitation time. For small
droplets with short evaporation time, the nanoparticle formation obeys the
one-droplet-one-particle rule. For large droplets with long evaporation time,
the competition among precipitation, thermal decomposition, and evaporation
determines the final nanoparticle morphology. The single droplet model
established in this study can potentially guide the precursor design and be
coupled with the turbulent flame simulation of the whole flame spray pyrolysis
burner.

  Kamilov","Boosting the Performance of Plug-and-Play Priors via Denoiser Scaling",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Plug-and-play priors (PnP) is an image reconstruction framework that uses an
image denoiser as an imaging prior. Unlike traditional regularized inversion,
PnP does not require the prior to be expressible in the form of a
regularization function. This flexibility enables PnP algorithms to exploit the
most effective image denoisers, leading to their state-of-the-art performance
in various imaging tasks. In this paper, we propose a new denoiser scaling
technique to explicitly control the amount of PnP regularization.
Traditionally, the performance of PnP algorithms is controlled via intrinsic
parameters of the denoiser related to the noise variance. However, many
powerful denoisers, such as the ones based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), do not have tunable parameters that would allow controlling their
influence within PnP. To address this issue, we introduce a scaling parameter
that adjusts the magnitude of the denoiser input and output. We theoretical
justify the denoiser scaling from the perspectives of proximal optimization,
statistical estimation, and consensus equilibrium. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments demonstrating the ability of denoiser scaling to
systematically improve the performance of PnP for denoising CNN priors that do
not have explicitly tunable parameters.

clustering. Given n objects and a pairwise similarity measure, the goal is to
cluster the objects so that, to the best possible extent, similar objects are
put in the same cluster and dissimilar objects are put in different clusters.
  A main drawback of correlation clustering is that it requires as input the
$\Theta(n^2)$ pairwise similarities. This is often infeasible to compute or
even just to store. In this paper we study \emph{query-efficient} algorithms
for correlation clustering. Specifically, we devise a correlation clustering
algorithm that, given a budget of $Q$ queries, attains a solution whose
expected number of disagreements is at most $3\cdot OPT + O(\frac{n^3}{Q})$,
where $OPT$ is the optimal cost for the instance. Its running time is $O(Q)$,
and can be easily made non-adaptive (meaning it can specify all its queries at
the outset and make them in parallel) with the same guarantees. Up to constant
factors, our algorithm yields a provably optimal trade-off between the number
of queries $Q$ and the worst-case error attained, even for adaptive algorithms.
  Finally, we perform an experimental study of our proposed method on both
synthetic and real data, showing the scalability and the accuracy of our
algorithm.

interplay of electric dipole and electric quadrupole/magnetic dipole
transitions for light propagating along the low-symmetry directions [111] or

allowed for excitation along the [110]-axis and even the high-symmetry cubic
direction [001]. Combining a symmetry analysis and a microscopic theory, we
uncover the two key contributions to the magnetic-field-induced SHG: the Zeeman
effect and the magneto-Stark effect. We demonstrate systematic dependencies of
the SHG intensity on the linear polarization angles of the ingoing fundamental
laser and the outgoing SHG beam. In general, the resulting contour plots in
combination with a symmetry analysis allow one to determine uniquely the
character of involved transitions. Moreover, we can separate in magnetic field
the Zeeman and the magneto-Stark effect through appropriate choice of the
experimental geometry and polarization configuration. We present a microscopic
theory of the second harmonic generation of excitons in a centrosymmetric cubic
semiconductor taking into account the symmetry and the band structure of
cuprous oxide. Based on the developed microscopic theory we identify the main
contributions to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility of $S$-, $P$- and
$D$-excitons. We analyze the redistribution of SHG intensities between the
excitonic states both in the absence and presence of the magnetic field and
show good agreement with the experimental data. With increasing exciton
principal quantum number the magneto-Stark effect overpowers the influence of

view. We show that adversarial attacks and defenses form an infinite zero-sum
game where classical results (e.g. Sion theorem) do not apply. We demonstrate
the non-existence of a Nash equilibrium in our game when the classifier and the
Adversary are both deterministic, hence giving a negative answer to the above
question in the deterministic regime. Nonetheless, the question remains open in
the randomized regime. We tackle this problem by showing that, undermild
conditions on the dataset distribution, any deterministic classifier can be
outperformed by a randomized one. This gives arguments for using randomization,
and leads us to a new algorithm for building randomized classifiers that are
robust to strong adversarial attacks. Empirical results validate our
theoretical analysis, and show that our defense method considerably outperforms
Adversarial Training against state-of-the-art attacks.

we propose a complete video captioning system including both a novel model and
an effective training strategy. Specifically, we propose an object relational
graph (ORG) based encoder, which captures more detailed interaction features to
enrich visual representation. Meanwhile, we design a teacher-recommended
learning (TRL) method to make full use of the successful external language
model (ELM) to integrate the abundant linguistic knowledge into the caption
model. The ELM generates more semantically similar word proposals which extend
the ground-truth words used for training to deal with the long-tailed problem.
Experimental evaluations on three benchmarks: MSVD, MSR-VTT and VATEX show the
proposed ORG-TRL system achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extensive
ablation studies and visualizations illustrate the effectiveness of our system.

train for as long as possible; there are numerous studies that show, both

harm the generalization performance of the classifier. In this paper, we
empirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep
networks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial
perturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm
robust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training
across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and
perturbation models ($\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$). Based upon this observed
effect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic
improvements upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early
stopping. We also show that effects such as the double descent curve do still
occur in adversarially trained models, yet fail to explain the observed
overfitting. Finally, we study several classical and modern deep learning
remedies for overfitting, including regularization and data augmentation, and
find that no approach in isolation improves significantly upon the gains

research, as decision processes are increasingly driven by models that learn
from data. Unfortunately, any biases present in the data may be learned by the
model, thereby inappropriately transferring that bias into the decision making
process. We identify the connection between the task of bias reduction and that
of isolating factors common between domains whilst encouraging domain specific
invariance. To isolate the common factors we combine the theory of deep latent
variable models with information bottleneck theory for scenarios whereby data
may be naturally paired across domains and no additional supervision is
required. The result is the Nested Variational AutoEncoder (NestedVAE). Two
outer VAEs with shared weights attempt to reconstruct the input and infer a
latent space, whilst a nested VAE attempts to reconstruct the latent
representation of one image, from the latent representation of its paired
image. In so doing, the nested VAE isolates the common latent factors/causes
and becomes invariant to unwanted factors that are not shared between paired
images. We also propose a new metric to provide a balanced method of evaluating
consistency and classifier performance across domains which we refer to as the
Adjusted Parity metric. An evaluation of NestedVAE on both domain and attribute
invariance, change detection, and learning common factors for the prediction of
biological sex demonstrates that NestedVAE significantly outperforms

structure at different scales, and is often dealt with a data-dependent
methodology. In this paper, we introduce a general two-step methodology for
model-based hierarchical clustering. Considering the integrated classification
likelihood criterion as an objective function, this work applies to every
discrete latent variable models (DLVMs) where this quantity is tractable. The
first step of the methodology involves maximizing the criterion with respect to
the partition. Addressing the known problem of sub-optimal local maxima found
by greedy hill climbing heuristics, we introduce a new hybrid algorithm based
on a genetic algorithm efficiently exploring the space of solutions. The
resulting algorithm carefully combines and merges different solutions, and
allows the joint inference of the number $K$ of clusters as well as the
clusters themselves. Starting from this natural partition, the second step of
the methodology is based on a bottom-up greedy procedure to extract a hierarchy
of clusters. In a Bayesian context, this is achieved by considering the
Dirichlet cluster proportion prior parameter $\alpha$ as a regularization term
controlling the granularity of the clustering. A new approximation of the
criterion is derived as a log-linear function of $\alpha$, enabling a simple
functional form of the merge decision criterion. This second step allows the
exploration of the clustering at coarser scales. The proposed approach is
compared with existing strategies on simulated as well as real settings, and
its results are shown to be particularly relevant. A reference implementation

these works by investigating the attosecond ionization of a molecular system

distinguish different pathways leading to ionization, be it direct ionization

entities calculate SVs and a new block is created based on the proof of Shapley
(PoSap) protocol. It is in contrast to the popular BitCoin network where
consensus entities ""mine"" new blocks by solving meaningless puzzles. Based on
the computed SVs, a scheme for dividing the incentive payoffs among FL clients
with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties is proposed. Experimental
results based on real-world data show that FedCoin can promote high-quality
data from FL clients through accurately computing SVs with an upper bound on
the computational resources required for reaching consensus. It opens
opportunities for non-data owners to play a role in FL.

at the same time irreversibly reshaping travellers behaviour by facilitating
their accessibility to different transport modes using shared economy concepts.
Managing the complex multimodal and intermodal system of quickly emerging MaaS,
requires a holistic modelling framework of transport network incorporating all
the influential aspects and means involved. In this paper, we mathematically
formulate a novel MaaS-based activity travel pattern (ATP) generator to
facilitate ridesharing in a system in which drivers and passengers interact by
sharing their full activity diary. The proposed formulation extends the
definition of MaaS beyond an intermodal trip planner, by incorporating an
inclusive set of travel attributes including the choices of activity, activity
sequence, departure time, and mode, and the transitions among the modes in ATPs
of all participants. Furthermore, this paper introduces a dynamic
rideshare-oriented MaaS model in which the conventional rideshare modelling
structure is synchronised with the proposed MaaS-based ATP generator in a
unified structure. These models explicitly bridge the gaps in the missed-out
connection between ATPs planning and rideshare models in the current
literature. At last, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the
significant impacts of the MaaS-based planning on the ridesharing systems
performance.

interest has attracted more attention from various science fields, including
applied mathematics and theoretical computer science, in the past. Here, we
first study this problem on an arbitrary graph and obtain the closed-form
formula for calculating the theoretical lower bound of average trapping time
($ATT$), a quantity that evaluates trapping efficiency of graph in question,
using methods from spectral graph theory. The results show that the choice of
the trap's location has a significant influence on determining parameter $ATT$.
As a result, we consider the problem on star-type graphs, a special graph
family which will be introduced shortly, with a single trap $\theta$ and then
derive using probability generating functions the exact solution to quantity
$ATT$. Our results suggest that all star-type graphs have most optimal trapping
efficiency by achieving the corresponding theoretical lower bounds of $ATT$.
More importantly, we further find that a given graph is most optimal only if
its underlying structure is star-type when considering the trapping problem. At
meantime, we also provide the upper bounds for $ATT$ of several graphs in terms
of well-known Holder inequality, some of which are sharp. By using all the
consequences obtained, one may be able to design better control scheme for
complex networks from respect of trapping efficiency, to some extent, which are
in well agreement with many other previous thoughts.

programming (ADP), integral reinforcement learning (IRL) has been proposed as
an alternate formulation of Bellman equation.However control coupling dynamics
is still needed to obtain closed form expression of optimal control effort. In
addition to this, initial stabilizing controller and two sets of neural
networks (NN) (known as Actor-Critic) are required to implement IRL scheme. In
this paper, a stabilizing term in the critic update law is leveraged to avoid
the requirement of an initial stabilizing controller in IRL framework to solve
optimal tracking problem with actuator constraints. With such a term, only one
NN is needed to generate optimal control policies in IRL framework. This critic
network is coupled with an experience replay (ER) enhanced identifier to
obviate the necessity of control coupling dynamics in IRL algorithm. The
weights of both identifier and critic NNs are simultaneously updated and it is
shown that the ER-enhanced identifier is able to handle parametric variations
better than without ER enhancement. The most salient feature of the novel
update law is its variable learning rate, which scales the pace of learning
based on instantaneous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) error. Variable learning
rate in critic NN coupled with ER technique in identifier NN help in achieving
tighter residual set for state error and error in NN weights as shown in

hypersurface, the general relation between the Einstein equation and
thermodynamics is established. Starting from trivial entropy that is
generalized by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the entropic mass of matter emerges
naturally together with Unruh temperature. The key idea is that the cause of
mass formation comes down to trivial entropy, and mass density is just the
external manifestation of mass. The full Einstein equation with the
cosmological constant is derived from the requirement that entropic mass and
proper mass are equivalent. This perspective suggests that trivial entropy that
causes mass in gravitation may be the best choice for the origin of space-time
geometry.

formulate the kernel matrix computation of GPGC in an iterative analytical
form. Finally, we derive a conditional distribution for the labels of
unobserved nodes based on the graph structure, labels for the observed nodes,

enough large-scale labeled data to train deep neural networks to their full

labeled source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain becomes
an appealing alternative. However, direct transfer often results in significant
performance decay due to domain shift. Domain adaptation (DA) addresses this
problem by minimizing the impact of domain shift between the source and target
domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) is a powerful extension in which
the labeled data may be collected from multiple sources with different
distributions. Due to the success of DA methods and the prevalence of
multi-source data, MDA has attracted increasing attention in both academia and

domain generation. Finally, we discuss future research directions for MDA.

problem because coagulation processes on Earth are normally associated with

study coagulation of inertial particles in compressible turbulence using
high-resolution direct and shock-capturing numerical simulations with a wide
range of Mach numbers from nearly incompressible to moderately supersonic. The
particle dynamics is simulated by representative particles and the effects on
the size distribution and coagulation rate due to increasing Mach number is
explored. We show that the time evolution of particle size distribution mainly
depends on the compressibility (Mach number). We find that the average
coagulation kernel $\langle C_{ij}\rangle$ scales linearly with the average
Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms}$ multiplied by the combined size of the
colliding particles, that is, $\langle C_{ij}\rangle \sim \langle (a_i +

consistent with expectations from analytical estimates. A quantitative
correction $\langle C_{ij}\rangle \sim \langle(a_i + a_j)^3\rangle(v_{\rm

interest as the third generation of artificial neural networks that can enable
low-power event-driven data analytics. The best performing SNNs for image
recognition tasks are obtained by converting a trained Analog Neural Network
(ANN), consisting of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), to SNN composed of
integrate-and-fire neurons with ""proper"" firing thresholds. The converted SNNs
typically incur loss in accuracy compared to that provided by the original ANN

accuracy. We find that performance degradation in the converted SNN stems from
using ""hard reset"" spiking neuron that is driven to fixed reset potential once
its membrane potential exceeds the firing threshold, leading to information
loss during SNN inference. We propose ANN-SNN conversion using ""soft reset""
spiking neuron model, referred to as Residual Membrane Potential (RMP) spiking

to automatically acquire new skills, a critical challenge in deploying
learning-based systems is scale: acquiring enough data for the robot to
effectively generalize broadly. Imitation learning, in particular, has remained
a stable and powerful approach for robot learning, but critically relies on
expert operators for data collection. In this work, we target this challenge,
aiming to build an imitation learning system that can continuously improve
through autonomous data collection, while simultaneously avoiding the explicit
use of reinforcement learning, to maintain the stability, simplicity, and
scalability of supervised imitation. To accomplish this, we cast the problem of
imitation with autonomous improvement into a multi-task setting. We utilize the
insight that, in a multi-task setting, a failed attempt at one task might
represent a successful attempt at another task. This allows us to leverage the
robot's own trials as demonstrations for tasks other than the one that the
robot actually attempted. Using an initial dataset of multi-task demonstration
data, the robot autonomously collects trials which are only sparsely labeled
with a binary indication of whether the trial accomplished any useful task or
not. We then embed the trials into a learned latent space of tasks, trained
using only the initial demonstration dataset, to draw similarities between
various trials, enabling the robot to achieve one-shot generalization to new
tasks. In contrast to prior imitation learning approaches, our method can
autonomously collect data with sparse supervision for continuous improvement,
and in contrast to reinforcement learning algorithms, our method can
effectively improve from sparse, task-agnostic reward signals.

approaches in imitation learning circumvent the correspondence problem, for
example, kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation, which are performed on the

introducing a distance measure between dissimilar embodiments. This measure is
then used as a loss function for static pose imitation and as a feedback signal
within a model-free deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic movement
imitation between two anthropomorphic robotic arms in simulation. We find that
the measure is well suited for describing the similarity between embodiments

numerical weather and climate prediction with major efforts put forward
worldwide. The core issue is the scale separation acting as a barrier that
hampers the propagation of the information across model components. We provide
a brief survey of CDA, and then focus on CDA using the ensemble Kalman filter
(EnKF). We consider first coupled equations with temporal scale difference and
deduce that: (i) cross components effects are strong from the slow to the fast
scale, but, (ii) intra-component effects are much stronger in the fast scale.
While observing the slow scale is desirable and benefits the fast, the latter
must be observed with high frequency otherwise the error will affect the slow
scale. Experiments are performed using the atmosphere-ocean model, MAOOAM. Six
configurations are considered, differing for the strength of the
atmosphere-ocean coupling and/or the number of model modes. A comprehensive
dynamical characterisation of the model configurations is provided by examining
the Lyapunov spectrum, Kolmogorov entropy and Kaplan-Yorke attractor dimension.
We also compute the covariant Lyapunov vectors and use them to explain how
model instabilities act on different model's modes according to the coupling
strength. The experiments confirm the importance of observing the fast scale,
but show also that, despite its slow temporal scale, frequent observations in
the ocean are beneficial. The relation between the ensemble size and the
unstable subspace dimension has been studied. Results largely ratify what known
for uncoupled system: the condition N>n0 is necessary for the EnKF to converge.
But the quasi-degeneracy of the Lyapunov spectrum of MAOOAM, with many
near-zero exponents, is potentially the cause of the smooth gradual reduction
of the analysis error observed for some model configurations, even when N>n0.

of a memristor emulating the multistate synapse is employed to capture the
metaplastic behavior. An integrated neural network study for learning and
memory retention is performed by integrating the synapse in a $5\times3$
crossbar at the circuit level and $128\times128$ network at the architectural
level. An on-device training circuitry ensures the dynamic learning in the
network. In the $128\times128$ network, it is observed that the number of input
patterns the multistate synapse can classify is $\simeq$ 2.1x that of a simple
binary synapse model, at a mean accuracy of $\geq$ 75% .
