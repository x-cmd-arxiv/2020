solving the semi-classical Einstein equation $G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G \langle
\psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle$ and quantum matter fields in a self-consistent
manner. As the matter fields we consider $N$ massless free scalar fields ($N$
is large). We find a spherically symmetric self-consistent solution of the
metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and state $|\psi\rangle$. Here, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is locally
$AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry, and $|\psi\rangle$ provides $\langle
\psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle=\langle0|T_{\mu\nu}|0
\rangle+T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$, where $|0\rangle$ is the ground state of the
matter fields in the metric and $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$ consists of the
excitation of s-waves that describe the collapsing matter and Hawking radiation
with the ingoing negative energy flow. This object is supported by a large
tangential pressure $\langle0|T^\theta{}_\theta|0 \rangle$ due to the vacuum
fluctuation of the bound modes with large angular momenta. This describes the
interior of the black hole when the back reaction of the evaporation is
considered. The black hole is a compact object with a surface (instead of
horizon) that looks like a conventional black hole from the outside and
eventually evaporates without a singularity. If we count the number of
self-consistent configurations $\{|\psi\rangle\}$, we reproduce the area law of
the entropy. This tells that the information is carried by the s-waves inside
the black hole. $|\psi\rangle$ also describes the process that the negative
ingoing energy flow created with Hawking radiation is superposed on the
collapsing matter to decrease the total energy while the total energy density
remains positive. As a special case, we consider conformal matter fields and
show that the interior metric is determined by the matter content of the
theory, which leads to a new constraint to the matter content.

communication between the vehicles, the VANET interface is donated by the

the MANETs nodes, VANET nodes are moving very fast. Impound a permanent route

very challenging task. Therefore, routing plays a significant duty in VANETs.
decreasing network overhead, avoiding network congestion, increasing traffic
congestion and packet delivery ratio are the most important issues associated
with routing in VANETs. In addition, VANET network is subject to various
security attacks. In base VANET systems, an algorithm is used to dicover
attacks at the time of confirmation in which overhead delay occurs. This paper
proposes (P-Secure) approach which is used for the detection of DoS attacks
before the confirmation time. This reduces the overhead delays for processing

P-Secure approach, is more efficient than OBUmodelVaNET approach in terms of

316.5~Hz (3.16~ms) and a dispersion measure of 35.45 pc cm$^{-3}$. The pulsar
is a member of a binary system with an orbital period of 0.20~days around a
low-mass companion which has a median mass of $\sim$0.18~\Ms. From observations
so far, at least two eclipsing events have been observed in each orbit. The
longer one lasted for ~5000~s in the orbital phase range 0.1--0.5. The other
lasted for ~500~s and occurred between 1000--2000~s before or after the longer
eclipsing event. The lengths of these two eclipsing events also change. These
properties suggest that J1717+4308A is a ``red-back'' system with a low-mass
main sequence or sub-giant companion. Timing observations of the pulsar and
further searches of the data for additional pulsars are ongoing.

receives much attention since it respects data security and privacy between

method to address the distributed optimal energy flow (OEF) problem in the
IEGS. First, a multi-block IEGS model is obtained by dividing it into N blocks
according to physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then
convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with its
ECH-based constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of
multipliers (J-ADMM) algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and
minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution
for the convexified problem is checked, and a sufficient condition is
developed. The optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem is recovered
from that for the convexified problem if the sufficient condition is satisfied.
Test results reveal that this method is tractable and effective in obtaining
the feasible optimal solution for radial gas networks.

GHz frequency can stimulate superconductivity, whereas fast vortex motion can
trigger an instability abruptly quenching the superconducting state. Here, we
advance or delay such dynamical quenching of the vortex state in Nb thin films

spatio-temporal dynamics in dissipative, spatially extended systems. In this
paper, we provide a conceptual approach to various properties of spiral waves.
Rather than studying existence in a specific equation, we study properties of
spiral waves in general reaction-diffusion systems. We show that many features
of spiral waves are robust and to some extent independent of the specific model
analyzed. To accomplish this, we present a suitable analytic framework, spatial
radial dynamics, that allows us to rigorously characterize features such as the
shape of spiral waves and their eigenfunctions, properties of the
linearization, and finite-size effects. We believe that our framework can also
be used to study spiral waves further and help analyze bifurcations, as well as
provide guidance and predictions for experiments and numerical simulations.
From a technical point of view, we introduce non-standard function spaces for
the well-posedness of the existence problem which allow us to understand
properties of spiral waves using dynamical systems techniques, in particular
exponential dichotomies. Using these pointwise methods, we are able to bring
tools from the analysis of one-dimensional coherent structures such as fronts
and pulses to bear on these inherently two-dimensional defects.

the non-linear saturation of the instability and is not stationary. The average

Coulomb interaction projected onto the narrow bands of twisted bilayer graphene
within a spinless one-valley model. The Hilbert space of the narrow bands is
constructed from a pair of hybrid Wannier states with opposite Chern numbers.
Depending on the parameters in the BM model, the DMRG in this basis determines
the ground state at one particle per unit cell to be either QAH state or a
state with no Hall effect which is nearly a product state. Based on this form,
we then apply the variational method to study their competition, thus
identifying three states: the QAH, a gapless $C_2T$ symmetric nematic, and a
gapped $C_2T$ symmetric stripe. All three states are nearly degenerate at the
realistic parameters of the BM model. The single particle spectrum of the
nematic contains either a quadratic node or two close Dirac nodes near
$\Gamma$. Motivated by the Landau level degeneracy found in this state, we
propose it to be the state observed at the charge neutrality point once spin
and valley degeneracies are restored. The optimal period for the $C_2T$ stripe
state is found to be $2$ unit cells. In addition, using the fact that the
topological charge of the nodes in the $C_2T$ nematic phase is no longer
described simply by their winding numbers once the translation symmetry is
broken, but rather by certain elements of a non-Abelian group that was recently
pointed out, we identify the mechanism of the gap opening within the $C_2T$
stripe state. Although the nodes at the Fermi energy are locally stable, they
can be annihilated after braiding with other nodes connecting them to adjacent
(folded) bands. Therefore, if the translation symmetry is broken, the gap at
one particle per unit cell can open even if the system preserves the $C_2T$ and
valley $U(1)$ symmetries, and the gap to remote bands remains open.

explicitly calculating both the direct contribution due to the 2PN acceleration

self-interaction of the 1PN acceleration ${\boldsymbol A}^\mathrm{1PN}$ in the
orbital average accounting for the instantaneous shifts induced by
${\boldsymbol A}^\mathrm{1PN}$ itself. Explicit formulas are straightforwardly
obtained for both the point particle and full two-body cases without recurring
to simplifying assumptions on the eccentricity $e$. Two different numerical
integrations of the equations of motion confirm our analytical results for both
the direct and indirect precessions. The values of the resulting effects for

learning take place within the very earliest iterations or epochs of training.
For example, sparse, trainable sub-networks emerge (Frankle et al., 2019),
gradient descent moves into a small subspace (Gur-Ari et al., 2018), and the
network undergoes a critical period (Achille et al., 2019). Here, we examine
the changes that deep neural networks undergo during this early phase of
training. We perform extensive measurements of the network state during these
early iterations of training and leverage the framework of Frankle et al.
(2019) to quantitatively probe the weight distribution and its reliance on
various aspects of the dataset. We find that, within this framework, deep
networks are not robust to reinitializing with random weights while maintaining
signs, and that weight distributions are highly non-independent even after only
a few hundred iterations. Despite this behavior, pre-training with blurred
inputs or an auxiliary self-supervised task can approximate the changes in
supervised networks, suggesting that these changes are not inherently
label-dependent, though labels significantly accelerate this process. Together,
these results help to elucidate the network changes occurring during this

is induced by laser dressing the atoms to a highly excited Rydberg state. For a
homogeneous condensate, the long-range interaction drastically alters the
dispersion relation of the excitation, supporting both roton and maxon modes.
Rotons are typically responsible for the creation of supersolids, while maxons
are normally dynamically unstable in BECs with dipolar interactions. We show
that maxon modes in the Rydberg-dressed condensate, on the contrary, are
dynamically stable. We find that the maxon modes can be excited through an
interaction quench, i.e. turning on the soft-core interaction instantaneously.
The emergence of the maxon modes is accompanied by oscillations at high
frequencies in the quantum depletion, while rotons lead to much slower
oscillations. The dynamically stable excitation of the roton and maxon modes
leads to persistent oscillations in the quantum depletion. Through a
self-consistent Bogoliubov approach, we identify the dependence of the maxon
mode on the soft-core interaction. Our study shows that maxon and roton modes
can be excited dynamically and simultaneously by quenching Rydberg-dressed
long-range interactions. This is relevant to current studies in creating and

symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We propose a semantic world
modeling approach based on bottom-up object anchoring using an object-centered
representation of the world. Perceptual anchoring processes continuous
perceptual sensor data and maintains a correspondence to a symbolic
representation. We extend the definitions of anchoring to handle multi-modal
probability distributions and we couple the resulting symbol anchoring system
to a probabilistic logic reasoner for performing inference. Furthermore, we use
statistical relational learning to enable the anchoring framework to learn
symbolic knowledge in the form of a set of probabilistic logic rules of the
world from noisy and sub-symbolic sensor input. The resulting framework, which
combines perceptual anchoring and statistical relational learning, is able to
maintain a semantic world model of all the objects that have been perceived
over time, while still exploiting the expressiveness of logical rules to reason
about the state of objects which are not directly observed through sensory
input data. To validate our approach we demonstrate, on the one hand, the
ability of our system to perform probabilistic reasoning over multi-modal
probability distributions, and on the other hand, the learning of probabilistic
logical rules from anchored objects produced by perceptual observations. The
learned logical rules are, subsequently, used to assess our proposed
probabilistic anchoring procedure. We demonstrate our system in a setting
involving object interactions where object occlusions arise and where
probabilistic inference is needed to correctly anchor objects.

caused by a number of processes, such as magnetically-driven spots or
inhomogeneous cloud coverage. Recent models have shown that turbulent flows and
waves, including internal gravity waves, may play an important role in cloud
evolution.
  The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of IGW on dust nucleation
and dust growth, and whether observations of the resulting cloud structures
could be used to recover atmospheric density information.
  For a simplified atmosphere in two dimensions, we numerically solved the
governing fluid equations to simulate the effect on dust nucleation and mantle
growth as a result of the passage of an IGW. Furthermore, we derived an
expression that relates the properties of the wave-induced cloud structures to
observable parameters in order to deduce the atmospheric density.
  Numerical simulations show that the $\rho, p, T$ variations caused by gravity
waves lead to an increase of the nucleation rate by up to a factor 20, and an
increase of the mantle growth rate by up to a factor 1.6, compared to their
equilibrium values. An exploration of the wider parameter space shows that in
absolute terms, the increase in nucleation due to IGW is stronger in cooler (T
dwarfs) and TiO2-rich sub-stellar atmospheres. The relative increase, however,
is greater in warmer (L dwarf) and TiO2-poor atmospheres due to conditions less
suited for efficient nucleation at equilibrium. These variations lead to banded
areas in which dust formation is much more pronounced, similar to the cloud
structures observed on Earth.
  We show that IGW in the atmosphere of sub-stellar objects can produce banded
clouds structures similar to that observed on Earth. We propose a method with
which potential observations of banded clouds could be used to estimate the
atmospheric density of sub-stellar objects.

better architectures or predict the accuracy of given architectures. However,
training the controller requires both abundant and high-quality pairs of

architecture and obtain its accuracy. In this paper, we propose SemiNAS, a
semi-supervised NAS approach that leverages numerous unlabeled architectures
(without evaluation and thus nearly no cost). Specifically, SemiNAS 1) trains
an initial accuracy predictor with a small set of architecture-accuracy data
pairs; 2) uses the trained accuracy predictor to predict the accuracy of large
amount of architectures (without evaluation); and 3) adds the generated data
pairs to the original data to further improve the predictor. The trained
accuracy predictor can be applied to various NAS algorithms by predicting the
accuracy of candidate architectures for them. SemiNAS has two advantages: 1) It
reduces the computational cost under the same accuracy guarantee. On
NASBench-101 benchmark dataset, it achieves comparable accuracy with
gradient-based method while using only 1/7 architecture-accuracy pairs. 2) It
achieves higher accuracy under the same computational cost. It achieves 94.02%
test accuracy on NASBench-101, outperforming all the baselines when using the

9%, 7% improvements over the baseline respectively.

vulnerable system against persistent and stealthy attacks. To protect a system,
a defender proactively changes the system configurations to limit the exposure
of security vulnerabilities to potential attackers. In doing so, the defender
creates asymmetric uncertainty and complexity for the attackers, making it much
harder for them to compromise the system. In practice, the defender incurs a
switching cost for each migration of the system configurations. The switching
cost usually depends on both the current configuration and the following
configuration. Besides, different system configurations typically require a
different amount of time for an attacker to exploit and attack. Therefore, a
defender must simultaneously decide both the optimal sequences of system
configurations and the optimal timing for switching. In this paper, we propose
a Markov Stackelberg Game framework to precisely characterize the defender's
spatial and temporal decision-making in the face of advanced attackers. We
introduce a relative value iteration algorithm that computes the defender's
optimal moving target defense strategies. Empirical evaluation on real-world
problems demonstrates the advantages of the Markov Stackelberg game model for
spatial-temporal moving target defense.

induction motor are integrated into a relaxed power flow formulation resulting
in a Mixed-Integer Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem. This
formulation represents the transient operational limits that are imposed by
different protection devices both in the motor side and network side. The
functionality of the proposed optimization problem is evaluated in the case of
a large-scale test study and under different simulation scenarios. The
feasibility and accuracy of the optimization results are validated using I)
off-line time-domain simulations, and II) a Power Hardware-In-the-Loop

We propose a new perspective based on a large deviation estimate for the
probability of the empirical distribution dynamics. Assuming Boltzmann
molecular chaos hypothesis (Stosszahlansatz), we derive a large deviation rate
function, or action, that describes the stochastic process for the empirical
distribution. The quasipotential for this action is the negative of the
entropy, as should be expected. While the Boltzmann equation appears as the
most probable evolution, corresponding to a law of large numbers, the action
describes a genuine reversible stochastic process for the empirical
distribution, in agreement with the microscopic reversibility. As a
consequence, this large deviation perspective gives the expected meaning to the
Boltzmann equation and explains its irreversibility as the natural consequence
of limiting the physical description to the most probable evolution. More
interestingly, it also quantifies the probability of any dynamical evolution
departing from solutions of the Boltzmann equation. This picture is fully
compatible with the heuristic classical view of irreversibility, but makes it
much more precise in various ways. We also explain that this large deviation
action provides a natural gradient structure for the Boltzmann equation.

is whether one can still construct hypothesis tests and confidence sets with
proper coverage and high power in a so-called likelihood-free inference (LFI)
setting; that is, a setting where the likelihood is not explicitly known but
one can forward-simulate observable data according to a stochastic model. In
this paper, we present $\texttt{ACORE}$ (Approximate Computation via Odds Ratio
Estimation), a frequentist approach to LFI that first formulates the classical
likelihood ratio test (LRT) as a parametrized classification problem, and then
uses the equivalence of tests and confidence sets to build confidence regions
for parameters of interest. We also present a goodness-of-fit procedure for
checking whether the constructed tests and confidence regions are valid.
$\texttt{ACORE}$ is based on the key observation that the LRT statistic, the
rejection probability of the test, and the coverage of the confidence set are
conditional distribution functions which often vary smoothly as a function of
the parameters of interest. Hence, instead of relying solely on samples
simulated at fixed parameter settings (as is the convention in standard Monte
Carlo solutions), one can leverage machine learning tools and data simulated in
the neighborhood of a parameter to improve estimates of quantities of interest.
We demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{ACORE}$ with both theoretical and
empirical results. Our implementation is available on Github.

SGD is run for $T$ iterations. A recent line of breakthrough works on SGD

$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{T^2}\right)$ convergence rate when the function

waves in the context of Chern-Simons axion $F(R)$ gravity. In the case of

As we demonstrate, from all the gravitational waves modes of the Chern-Simons
axion $F(R)$ gravity, only the two tensor modes are affected, while the spin-0
and spin-1 modes are not affected at all. With regard to the two tensor modes,
we show that these modes propagate in a non-equivalent way, so the resulting

graviton modes, the structure of the dispersion relations becomes more
complicated in comparison with the Einstein gravity with the Chern-Simons
axion, but the resulting qualitative features of the propagating modes are not
changed. With regard to the spin-0 and spin-1 modes, the Chern-Simons axion
$F(R)$ gravity contains two spin-0 modes and no vector spin-1 mode at all. We
also find that for the very high energy mode, both the group velocity and the
phase velocity are proportional to the inverse of the square root of the wave
number, and therefore the velocities become smaller for larger wave numbers or
even vanish in the limit that the wave number goes to infinity.

bounds on the values their outputs can take. Previous methods have either used
off-the-shelf solvers, discarding the problem structure, or relaxed the problem
even further, making the bounds unnecessarily loose. We propose a novel
approach based on Lagrangian Decomposition. Our formulation admits an efficient
supergradient ascent algorithm, as well as an improved proximal algorithm. Both
the algorithms offer three advantages: (i) they yield bounds that are provably
at least as tight as previous dual algorithms relying on Lagrangian
relaxations; (ii) they are based on operations analogous to forward/backward
pass of neural networks layers and are therefore easily parallelizable,
amenable to GPU implementation and able to take advantage of the convolutional
structure of problems; and (iii) they allow for anytime stopping while still
providing valid bounds. Empirically, we show that we obtain bounds comparable
with off-the-shelf solvers in a fraction of their running time, and obtain
tighter bounds in the same time as previous dual algorithms. This results in an
overall speed-up when employing the bounds for formal verification. Code for
our algorithms is available at

Scalable K-MEANS++ for clustering algorithm and k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) for

non-existence attributes. We have presented a detailed theoretical analysis
which shows that the new AWPD based K-MEANS++, Scalable K-MEANS++ and kNN

have reported in depth experiments on numerous benchmark datasets for various
forms of Non-Existence showing that the projected clustering and classification
techniques usually show better results in comparison to some of the renowned
imputation methods that are generally used to process such insufficient data.
This technique is designed to trace invaluable data to: directly apply our
method on the datasets which have Non-Existence attributes and establish a
method for detecting unstructured Non-Existence attributes with the best

Testable assumptions ($A$) give strong and interpretable empirical content to

to find a set of relaxed assumptions ($\tilde{A}$) that cannot be rejected by
any distribution of observed outcome and the identified set of the parameter of
interest is not changed when the original assumption is not rejected. The main
contribution of this paper is to characterize the properties of such a relaxed
assumption $\tilde{A}$ using a generalized definition of refutability and
confirmability. I also propose a general method to construct such $\tilde{A}$.
A general estimation and inference procedure is proposed and can be applied to
most incomplete economic models. I apply my methodology to the instrument
monotonicity assumption in Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimation and
to the sector selection assumption in a binary outcome Roy model of employment
sector choice. In the LATE application, I use my general method to construct a
set of relaxed assumptions $\tilde{A}$ that can never be rejected, and the
identified set of LATE is the same as imposing $A$ when $A$ is not rejected.
LATE is point identified under my extension $\tilde{A}$ in the LATE
application. In the binary outcome Roy model, I use my method of incomplete
models to relax Roy's sector selection assumption and characterize the
identified set of the binary potential outcome as a polyhedron.

series that can be deduced from a visibility mapping. This visibility mapping
associates to each point $(t,x(t))$ of the time series to its horizontal
visibility basin, i.e. the number of points of the time series that can be seen
horizontally from each respective point. We apply this study to the class of
unimodal maps that give rise to equivalent bifurcation diagrams. We use the
classical logistic map to illustrate the main results of this paper: there are
visibility patterns in each cascade of the bifurcation diagram, converging at
the onset of chaos.
  The visibility pattern of a periodic time series is generated from elementary
blocks of visibility in a recursive way. This rule of recurrence applies to all
periodic-doubling cascades. Within a particular window, as the growth parameter
$r$ varies and each period doubles, these blocks are recurrently embedded
forming the visibility pattern for each period. In the limit, at the onset of
chaos, an infinite pattern of visibility appears containing all visibility
patterns of the periodic time series of the cascade.
  We have seen that these visibility patterns have specific properties: (i) the
size of the elementary blocks depends on the period of the time series, (ii)
certain time series sharing the same periodicity can have different elementary
blocks and, therefore, different visibility patterns, (iii) since the 2-period
and 3-period windows are unique, the respective elementary blocks, $ \{2\} $
and $ \{2 \, 3\}$, are also unique and thus, their visibility patterns. We
explore the visibility patterns of other low-periodic time series and also
enumerate all elementary blocks of each of their periodic windows. All of these
visibility patterns are reflected in the corresponding accumulation points at
the onset of chaos, where periodicity is lost.

introduces the concept of intentional nonlocality as a fundamental mechanism to
design passive elastic metasurfaces capable of an exceptionally broadband
operating range. The nonlocal behavior is achieved by exploiting nonlocal
forces, conceptually akin to long-range interactions in nonlocal material
microstructures, between subsets of resonant unit cells forming the
metasurface. These long-range forces are obtained via carefully crafted
flexible elements whose specific geometry and local dynamics are designed to
create remarkably complex transfer functions between multiple units. The
resulting nonlocal coupling forces enable achieving phase gradient profiles
that are function of the wavenumber of the incident wave.The identification of
relevant design parameters and the assessment of their impact on performance
are explored via a combination of semi-analytical and numerical models. The
nonlocal metasurface concept is tested, both numerically and experimentally, by
embedding a total-internal-reflection design in a thin plate waveguide. Results
confirm the feasibility of the intentionally nonlocal design concept and its

  We aim to produce robust models for the surface brightness emission as a
function of frequency for the A-team sources at ultra-low frequencies. These

recent years, a wide variety of approaches have been proposed based upon
regularization at the level of the image or on techniques from machine
learning. We propose an alternative approach, shifting the paradigm towards
regularization at the level of the probability distribution on the space of

convex analysis and probability theory, we show that the method is
computationally feasible and amenable to very large blurs. Moreover, when
images are imbedded with symbology (a known pattern), we show how our method
can be applied to approximate the unknown blur kernel with remarkable effects.
While our method is stable with respect to small amounts of noise, it does not
actively denoise. However, for moderate to large amounts of noise, it performs
well by preconditioned denoising with a state of the art method.

Concurrently, Chen et al. [CLM19] considered a variant of the problem where

achieve sublinear sample complexity. Along the way, we simplify the approach of

Neural Networks (DNNs) that have been successfully used to generate realistic
images, music, text, and other data. However, GAN training presents many
challenges, notably it can be very resource-intensive. A potential weakness in
GANs is that it requires a lot of data for successful training and data
collection can be an expensive process. Typically, the corrective feedback from
discriminator DNNs to generator DNNs (namely, the discriminator's assessment of
the generated example) is calculated using only one real-numbered value (loss).
By contrast, we propose a new class of GAN we refer to as xAI-GAN that
leverages recent advances in explainable AI (xAI) systems to provide a ""richer""
form of corrective feedback from discriminators to generators. Specifically, we
modify the gradient descent process using xAI systems that specify the reason
as to why the discriminator made the classification it did, thus providing the
""richer"" corrective feedback that helps the generator to better fool the
discriminator. Using our approach, we observe xAI-GANs provide an improvement
of up to 23.18% in the quality of generated images on both MNIST and FMNIST
datasets over standard GANs as measured by Frechet Inception Distance (FID). We
further compare xAI-GAN trained on 20% of the data with standard GAN trained on
100% of data on the CIFAR10 dataset and find that xAI-GAN still shows an
improvement in FID score. Further, we compare our work with Differentiable
Augmentation - which has been shown to make GANs data-efficient - and show that
xAI-GANs outperform GANs trained on Differentiable Augmentation. Moreover, both
techniques can be combined to produce even better results. Finally, we argue
that xAI-GAN enables users greater control over how models learn than standard
GANs.

predict block pixel values and reduce transmission bandwidth. In order to
reduce the magnitude of the transmitted Motion Vector (MV) and thus reduce
bandwidth, the encoder utilizes Predicted Motion Vector (PMV), which is derived
by taking the median vector of the corresponding MVs of the neighboring blocks.
In this research, we propose innovative methods, based on neural networks
prediction, for improving the accuracy of the calculated PMV. We begin by
showing a straightforward approach of calculating the best matching PMV and
signaling its neighbor block index value to the decoder while reducing the
number of bits required to represent the result without adding any computation
complexity. Then we use a classification Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)
to estimate from neighbors the PMV without requiring signaling and show the
advantage of the approach when employed for high motion movies. We demonstrate
the advantages using fast forward movies. However, the same improvements apply
to camera streams of autonomous vehicles, drone cameras, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ)
cameras, and similar applications whereas the MVs magnitudes are expected to be
large. We also introduce a regression FCNN to predict the PMV. We calculate
Huffman coded streams and demonstrate an order of ~34% reduction in number of
bits required to transmit the best matching calculated PMV without reducing the
quality, for fast forward movies with high motion.

Multiple methods for the linear decomposition of spectra exist but are subject
to various drawbacks, such as allowing negative photon fluxes or requiring
detailed Monte Carlo modeling. We propose using Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) as a data-driven approach to spectral decomposition. Using
aerial surveys that include flights over water, we demonstrate that the
mathematical approach of NMF finds physically relevant structure in aerial
gamma-ray background, namely that measured spectra can be expressed as the sum
of nearby terrestrial emission, distant terrestrial emission, and radon and
cosmic emission. These NMF background components are compared to the background
components obtained using Noise-Adjusted Singular Value Decomposition (NASVD),
which contain negative photon fluxes and thus do not represent emission spectra
in as straightforward a way. Finally, we comment on potential areas of research
that are enabled by NMF decompositions, such as new approaches to spectral
anomaly detection and data fusion.

chemotaxing cells like Dictyostelium. As environment uncertainty is increased,
there is a transition between cells preferring a single receptor type and a

qualitatively different from gradient sensing by a single type -- cells may
extract orders of magnitude more chemotactic information than expected by naive

a simple initialization scheme that can train deep residual networks without

proposed as a possible approach to enhance the land-area power density of wind
farms. In this work, we aim to study the benefits associated with such a
co-location using large-eddy simulation (LES) and analytical wake models. In
this regard, small-scale vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in triangular
clusters are deployed within a finite-size wind farm consisting of
horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). Wake flow within the wind farm and the
effect of VAWTs on the overall wind-farm efficiency are investigated and
quantified. The results show that the optimal deployment of small-scale VAWTs
has a negligible impact on the performance of HAWT arrays while increasing the
total power production. For the particular cases considered here, the power
output of the co-located wind farm increases up to 21% compared to the baseline
case in which only the HAWTs are present. Also, by comparing to the LES
results, it is shown that the analytical framework proposed here is able to
accurately predict the power production of wind farms including both HAWTs and
VAWTs. Next, as a real-world application, potential benefits of deploying
small-scale VAWTs inside the Horns Rev 1 wind farm are explored for various
wind directions using the calibrated wake model. The results show potential for
about an 18% increase in the wind-farm power production, averaged over all wind
directions, for a particular VAWT layout investigated in this study. The
levelized cost of energy (LCoE) for the co-located wind farm is also assessed.
The simulations finds that meanwhile the installation of VAWTs increases the
annual energy production of the wind farm, it also increases the LCoE, which is
caused by a) lack of operational data, and b) a low technology readiness level
for VAWTs and floating foundations.

lowered the resolution of two solar magnetograms during solar cycle maximum and

altered based on non-thermal velocities determined from a far ultraviolet (FUV)

three solar analogues were obtained using Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI).
Finally, the simulated wind properties were compared to Advanced Composition

parameters taken from solar observations can reproduce the observed solar wind
mass and angular momentum loss rates. The resolution of the magnetogram has a
small impact on the wind properties and only during cycle maximum. However,
variation in Alfv\'en wave energy influences the wind properties irrespective
of the solar cycle activity level. Furthermore, solar wind simulations carried
out using the low-resolution magnetogram of the three stars instead of the
solar magnetogram could lead to an order of a magnitude difference in the
simulated wind properties. The choice in Alfv\'en energy has a stronger
influence on the wind output compared to the magnetogram resolution. The
influence could be even stronger for stars whose input boundary conditions are
not as well constrained as those of the Sun. Unsurprisingly, replacing the

explains the discrepancies previously noted in the age indicators for this

with the physical models of ram pressure acceleration or with bulk cooling from

field polarities, polarimetry captures only a tiny fraction of the magnetic
flux and cannot assess the overall stellar surface magnetic field if it is
dominated by a small-scale component. Analysis of Zeeman broadening in
high-resolution intensity spectra can reveal these hidden complex magnetic
fields. Historically, there were very few attempts to obtain such measurements
for G dwarf stars due to the difficulty of disentangling Zeeman effect from
other broadening mechanisms affecting spectral lines. Here we developed a new
magnetic field diagnostic method based on relative Zeeman intensification of
optical atomic lines with different magnetic sensitivity. Using this technique
we obtained 78 field strength measurements for 15 Sun-like stars, including
some of the best-studied young solar twins. We find that the average magnetic
field strength $Bf$ drops from 1.3-2.0 kG in stars younger than about 120 Myr
to 0.2-0.8 kG in older stars. The mean field strength shows a clear correlation
with the Rossby number and with the coronal and chromospheric emission
indicators. Our results suggest that magnetic regions have roughly the same
local field strength $B\approx3.2$ kG in all stars, with the filling factor $f$
of these regions systematically increasing with stellar activity. Comparing our
results with the spectropolarimetric analyses of global magnetic fields in the

scattering amplitudes that automatically coincide exactly with gravity, modulo

imposing certain known selection rules on the amplitude is sufficient to
uniquely reproduce gravity. The resulting amplitudes exhibit a color-dressed

the entanglement entropy between the two gauge theory copies and learn that

extends immediately to effective field theories, where Born-Infeld photons and

$\sim0.03-0.5$ between 13 out of 14 adjacent sightlines separated by a few
arcseconds to a few arcminutes, suggesting the presence of neutral structures
on spatial scales from a few to thousands of AU (which we refer to as tiny

linewidth of TSAS absorption features contribute to the observed optical depth
variations, while changes in the central velocity do not appear to strongly
impact the observed variations. Both thermal and turbulent motions contribute
appreciably to the linewidths, but the turbulence does not appear strong enough
to confine overpressured TSAS. In a majority of cases, the TSAS column
densities are sufficiently high that these structures can radiatively cool fast
enough to maintain thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, even if they

gauge theories, yet these theories remain a challenge in $(2+1)$ dimensions. In
this article, we present a new (decorated) tensor network algorithm, in which
the tensors encode the lattice gauge amplitude expressed in the fusion basis.
  This has several advantages: Firstly, the fusion basis does diagonalize
operators measuring the magnetic fluxes and electric charges associated to a
hierarchical set of regions. The algorithm allows therefore a direct access to
these observables. Secondly the fusion basis is, as opposed to the previously
employed spin network basis, stable under coarse graining. Thirdly, due to the
hierarchical structure of the fusion basis, the algorithm does implement
predefined disentangles, that remove short-scale entanglement.
  We apply this new algorithm to lattice gauge theories defined for the quantum
group $\text{SU}(2)_{\rm k}$ and identify a weak and a strong coupling phase
for various levels $\rm k$. As we increase the level $\rm k$, the critical
coupling $g_c$ decreases linearly, suggesting the absence of a deconfining
phase for the continuous group $\text{SU}(2)$. Moreover, we illustrate the
scaling behaviour of the Wilson loops in the two phases.

on the IllustrisTNG simulation suite and a full Monte Carlo dust radiative
transfer post-processing. Specifically, we discuss the ${\rm H}_{\alpha}$ and
${\rm H}_{\beta}$ + $[\rm O \,III]$ luminosity functions up to $z=8$. The
predicted ${\rm H}_{\beta}$ + $[\rm O \,III]$ luminosity functions are
consistent with present observations at $z\lesssim 3$ with $\lesssim 0.1\,{\rm
dex}$ differences in luminosities. However, the predicted ${\rm H}_{\alpha}$
luminosity function is $\sim 0.3\,{\rm dex}$ dimmer than the observed one at
$z\simeq 2$. Furthermore, we explore continuum spectral indices, the Balmer
break at $4000$\AA (D4000) and the UV continuum slope $\beta$. The median D4000
versus sSFR relation predicted at $z=2$ is in agreement with the local
calibration despite a different distribution pattern of galaxies in this plane.
In addition, we reproduce the observed $A_{\rm UV}$ versus $\beta$ relation and
explore its dependence on galaxy stellar mass, providing an explanation for the
observed complexity of this relation. We also find a deficiency in heavily
attenuated, UV red galaxies in the simulations. Finally, we provide predictions
for the dust attenuation curves of galaxies at $z=2-6$ and investigate their
dependence on galaxy colors and stellar masses. The attenuation curves are
steeper in galaxies at higher redshifts, with bluer colors, or with lower
stellar masses. We attribute these predicted trends to dust geometry. Overall,
our results are consistent with present observations of high redshift galaxies.
Future JWST observations will further test these predictions.

thermalization with repulsive long-range dipolar interactions. Stiffness and
energy density measurements show that the system is dynamically stable
regardless of contact interaction strength. This enables us to cycle contact
interactions from weakly to strongly repulsive, then strongly attractive, and
finally weakly attractive. We show that this cycle is an energy-space
topological pump (due to a quantum holonomy). Iterating this cycle offers an
unexplored topological pumping method to create a hierarchy of quantum
many-body scar states.

highly vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. While a
wide variety of recent \emph{adversarial training} methods have been effective
at improving robustness to perturbed inputs (robust accuracy), often this
benefit is accompanied by a decrease in accuracy on benign inputs (standard
accuracy), leading to a tradeoff between often competing objectives.
Complicating matters further, recent empirical evidence suggest that a variety
of other factors (size and quality of training data, model size, etc.) affect
this tradeoff in somewhat surprising ways. In this paper we provide a precise
and comprehensive understanding of the role of adversarial training in the
context of linear regression with Gaussian features. In particular, we
characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the accuracies achievable by any
algorithm regardless of computational power or size of the training data.
Furthermore, we precisely characterize the standard/robust accuracy and the
corresponding tradeoff achieved by a contemporary mini-max adversarial training
approach in a high-dimensional regime where the number of data points and the
parameters of the model grow in proportion to each other. Our theory for
adversarial training algorithms also facilitates the rigorous study of how a
variety of factors (size and quality of training data, model
overparametrization etc.) affect the tradeoff between these two competing
accuracies.

periodically active fast radio burst (FRB) sources, where the system consists
of a neutron star (NS) with strong dipolar magnetic fields and a magnetic white
dwarf (WD). In our model, the WD fills its Roche lobe at periastron, and mass
transfer occurs from the WD to the NS around this point. The accreted material
may be fragmented into a number of parts, which arrive at the NS at different
times. The fragmented magnetized material may trigger magnetic reconnection
near the NS surface. The electrons can be accelerated to an ultra-relativistic
speed, and therefore the curvature radiation of the electrons can account for
the burst activity. In this scenario, the duty cycle of burst activity is
related to the orbital period of the binary. We show that such a model may work
for duty cycles roughly from ten minutes to two days. For the recently reported
16.35-day periodicity of FRB 180916.J0158+65, our model does not naturally
explain such a long duty cycle, since an extremely high eccentricity ($e>0.95$)

To estimate both potential exotic contributions and their backgrounds, one
usually employs the coalescence model in momentum space. Here we use instead a
newly developed coalescence model based on the Wigner function representations
of the produced nuclei states. This approach includes both the
process-dependent size of the formation region of antinuclei, and the momentum
correlations of coalescing antinucleons in a semi-classical picture. The model
contains a single universal parameter $\sigma$ that we tune to experimental
data on antideuteron production in electron-positron, proton-proton and
proton-nucleus collisions. The obtained value $\sigma\simeq 1$ fm agrees well
with its physical interpretation as the size of the formation region of
antinuclei in collisions of point-like particles. This model allows us
therefore to calculate in a consistent frame-work the antideuteron and
antihelium fluxes both from secondary production and from dark matter

million-degree halo gas in these galaxies. Using a semi-analytic approach, we
model the spatial density and temperature distribution of hot coronal gas to
predict strength, spectral shape, and cross section of CBLAs as a function of
galaxy-halo mass and line-of-sight impact parameter. For virial halo masses in
the range log (M/M_sun)=10.6-12.6, the characteristic logarithmic CBLA HI
column densities and Doppler parameters are log N(HI)=12.4-13.4 and
b(HI)=70-200 km/s, indicating that CBLAs represent weak, shallow spectral
features that are difficult to detect. Yet, the expected number density of
CBLAs per unit redshift in the above given mass range is dN/dz(CBLA)~3,
implying that CBLAs have a substantial absorption cross-section. We compare the
model predictions with a combined set of ultraviolet (UV) absorption-line
spectra from HST/COS and HST/STIS that trace the halos of four low-redshift
galaxies. We demonstrate that CBLAs already might have been detected in these
spectra, but the complex multi-component structure and the limited

estimating the channel covariance matrix. In particular, we perform a
systematic design-space exploration of NN configurations, quantization, and
pruning in order to improve feedforward NN architectures that are typically
used in the literature for the channel estimation task. We show that choosing
an appropriate NN architecture is crucial to reduce the complexity of
NN-assisted channel estimation methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that,
similarly to other applications and domains, careful quantization and pruning
can lead to significant complexity reduction with a negligible performance
degradation. Finally, we show that using a solution with multiple distinct NNs

overall computational complexity and storage requirements, while achieving a
better performance with respect to using a single NN trained for the entire SNR

field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this
hierarchy can often be unobservable or ""hidden"". Ecologists must therefore
often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related
to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation
processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used
to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can
facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise
be intractable. However, while HMMs are routinely applied in other disciplines,
they have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological
community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common
terminology, and review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological
research. We also provide a supplemental tutorial on some of the more technical
aspects of HMM implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how
practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their

applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of
these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental

substrings of it. Even though it is one of the key problems in Bioinformatics,
it is generally lacking major theoretical advances. Its hardness stems both
from practical issues (size and errors of real data), and from the fact that
problem formulations inherently admit multiple solutions. Given these, at their
core, most state-of-the-art assemblers are based on finding non-branching paths
(unitigs) in an assembly graph. If one defines a genome assembly solution as a
closed arc-covering walk of the graph, then unitigs appear in all solutions,
being thus safe partial solutions. All all such safe walks were recently
characterized as omnitigs, leading to the first safe and complete genome
assembly algorithm. Even if omnitig finding was improved to quadratic time, it
remained open whether the crucial linear-time feature of finding unitigs can be
attained with omnitigs.
  We describe a surprising $O(m)$-time algorithm to identify all maximal
omnitigs of a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs, notwithstanding the existence
of families of graphs with $\Theta(mn)$ total maximal omnitig size. This is
based on the discovery of a family of walks (macrotigs) with the property that
all the non-trivial omnitigs are univocal extensions of subwalks of a macrotig,
with two consequences: (1) A linear-time output-sensitive algorithm enumerating
all maximal omnitigs. (2) A compact $O(m)$ representation of all maximal
omnitigs, which allows, e.g., for $O(m)$-time computation of various statistics
on them.
  Our results close a long-standing theoretical question inspired by practical
genome assemblers, originating with the use of unitigs in 1995. We envision our
results to be at the core of a reverse transfer from theory to practical and
complete genome assembly programs, as has been the case for other key
Bioinformatics problems.

distributed independently and uniformly at random in the interval $[0,1)$. The
analysis holds even when a quadratic time algorithm is used to sort the keys in
each bucket. We show how to obtain linear time guarantees on the running time
of Bucket Sort that hold with very high probability. Specifically, we
investigate the asymptotic behavior of the exponent in the upper tail
probability of the running time of Bucket Sort. We consider large additive
deviations from the expectation, of the form $cn$ for large enough (constant)
$c$, where $n$ is the number of keys that are sorted.
  Our analysis shows a profound difference between variants of Bucket Sort that
use a quadratic time algorithm within each bucket and variants that use a
$\Theta(b\log b)$ time algorithm for sorting $b$ keys in a bucket. When a
quadratic time algorithm is used to sort the keys in a bucket, the probability
that Bucket Sort takes $cn$ more time than expected is exponential in
$\Theta(\sqrt{n}\log n)$. When a $\Theta(b\log b)$ algorithm is used to sort
the keys in a bucket, the exponent becomes $\Theta(n)$. We prove this latter
theorem by showing an upper bound on the tail of a random variable defined on
tries, a result which we believe is of independent interest. This result also
enables us to analyze the upper tail probability of a well-studied trie
parameter, the external path length, and show that the probability that it
deviates from its expected value by an additive factor of $cn$ is exponential
in $\Theta(n)$.

variance that can be used to characterize deviations from randomness which
eventually lead to disordered hyperuniformity. It is not yet fully clear how to
link density fluctuations with interactions in a disordered hyperuniform
system. Interactions between superconducting vortices are very sensitive to
vortex pinning, to the crystal structure of the superconductor and to the value
of the magnetic field. This creates lattices with different degrees of
disorder. Here we study disordered vortex lattices in several superconducting
compounds (Co-doped NbSe$_2$, LiFeAs and CaKFe$_4$As$_4$) and in two amorphous
W-based thin films, one with strong nanostructured pinning (W-film-1) and
another one with weak or nearly absent pinning (W-film-2). We calculate for
each case the structure factor and number variance and compare to calculations
on an interacting set of partially pinned particles. We find that random
density fluctuations appear when pinning overcomes interactions and show that
the suppression of density fluctuations is indeed correlated to the presence of
interactions. Furthermore, we find that we can describe all studied vortex
lattices within a single framework consisting of a continous deviation from
hyperuniformity towards random distributions when increasing the strength of

performs poorly when integrated with robust training techniques, including
adversarial training and verifiable robust training. To overcome this

proto-cluster. To reveal the galaxy formation in core regions, we search for
proto-cluster cores at $z\sim 2$ in $\sim 1.5\, \mathrm{deg}^{2}$ of the COSMOS
field. Using pairs of massive galaxies ($\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\geq11$) as
tracers of cores, we find 75 candidate cores, among which 54\% are estimated to
be real. A clustering analysis finds that these cores have an average DMH mass
of $2.6_{-0.8}^{+0.9}\times 10^{13}\, M_{\odot}$, or $4.0_{-1.5}^{+1.8}\,

with Fornax-like or Virgo-like clusters. Moreover, using the IllustrisTNG

massive enough to be regarded as proto-cluster cores. We then derive the
stellar mass function (SMF) and the quiescent fraction for member galaxies of
the 75 candidate cores. We find that the core galaxies have a more top-heavy
SMF than field galaxies at the same redshift, showing an excess at
$\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\gtrsim 10.5$. The quiescent fraction,
$0.17_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ in the mass range $9.0\leq \log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\leq

an experiment to generate maximally entangled states of $D$-dimensional quantum
systems, the so called qudits, by exploiting correlations of parametric
down-converted photons. Angular diffraction masks containing $N$-slits in the
arms of each twin photon define a qudit space of dimension $N^2$, spanned by
the alternative pathways of the photons. Due to phase-matching conditions, the
twin photons will pass only by symmetrically opposite angular slits, generating
maximally entangled states between these different paths, which can be detected
by high-order two-photon interference fringes via coincidence counts. Numerical
results for $N$ angular slits with $N = 2, 4, 5, 6, 10$ are reported,
corresponding to qudit Hilbert spaces of dimension $D=N^2=4,16,25, 36,100$,

implementation of the proposed scheme using Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs),
and twin-photons produced by Spontaneouos Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC).
The entanglement of the qudit state can be quantified in terms of the
Concurrence, which can be expressed in terms of the visibility of the
interference fringes, or by using Entanglement Witnesses. These results provide
an additional means for preparing entangled quantum states in high-dimensions,

Nonparametric bounds can provide a way to narrow the range of possible values

on settings with random sampling, and the bounds have often been derived with a

constraints as a penalty term when only sparse observations are available. As a
result, the PDE is only satisfied approximately by the solution. However, the
penalty term typically slows down the convergence of the optimizer for stiff

numerically satisfying the PDE constraints. We develop an algorithm that
enables differentiating both explicit and implicit numerical solvers in
reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This allows the gradients of the DNNs

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although state-of-the-art deep learning based
methods have been able to obtain fast, high-quality reconstruction of CS-MR
images, their main drawback is that they treat complex-valued MRI data as
real-valued entities. Most methods either extract the magnitude from the
complex-valued entities or concatenate them as two real-valued channels. In
both the cases, the phase content, which links the real and imaginary parts of
the complex-valued entities, is discarded. In order to address the fundamental
problem of real-valued deep networks, i.e. their inability to process
complex-valued data, we propose a novel framework based on a complex-valued
generative adversarial network (Co-VeGAN). Our model can process complex-valued
input, which enables it to perform high-quality reconstruction of the CS-MR
images. Further, considering that phase is a crucial component of
complex-valued entities, we propose a novel complex-valued activation function,
which is sensitive to the phase of the input. Extensive evaluation of the
proposed approach on different datasets using various sampling masks
demonstrates that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing
CS-MRI reconstruction techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio as well
as structural similarity index. Further, it uses significantly fewer trainable
parameters to do so, as compared to the real-valued deep learning based
methods.

an asymptotic analysis to derive the distribution of RandNLA sampling

asymptotic distribution of a general sampling estimator with arbitrary sampling
probabilities. The analysis is conducted in two complementary settings, i.e.,
when the objective of interest is to approximate the full sample estimator or
is to infer the underlying ground truth model parameters. For each setting, we
show that the sampling estimator is asymptotically normally distributed under
mild regularity conditions. Moreover, the sampling estimator is asymptotically
unbiased in both settings. Based on our asymptotic analysis, we use two
criteria, the Asymptotic Mean Squared Error (AMSE) and the Expected Asymptotic
Mean Squared Error (EAMSE), to identify optimal sampling probabilities. Several
of these optimal sampling probability distributions are new to the literature,

Recently, composite materials - namely heterogeneous biomaterials identified as

inks that can be processed by AM to obtain scaffolds with improved biomimetic
and bioactive properties. Significant efforts have been dedicated to
hydroxyapatite (HA)-reinforced composites, especially targeting bone tissue
engineering, thanks to the chemical similarities of HA with respect to mineral
components of native mineralized tissues. Here we review applications of AM
techniques to process HA-reinforced composites and biocomposites for the
production of scaffolds with biological matrices, including cellular tissues.
The primary outcomes of recent investigations in terms of morphological,
structural, and in vitro and in vivo biological properties of the materials are
discussed. We classify the approaches based on the nature of the matrices
employed to embed the HA reinforcements and produce the tissue substitutes and
report a critical discussion on the presented state of the art as well as the

more than 5% of the population worldwide. Passive prostheses to replace the
ossicular chain mainly rely on piston-like titanium and/or hydroxyapatite
devices, which in the long term suffer from extrusion. Although the basic shape
of such devices always consists of a base for contact with the eardrum and a
stem to have mechanical connection with the residual bony structures, a
plethora of topologies have been proposed, mainly to help surgical positioning.
In this work, we optimize the topology of a total ossicular replacement
prosthesis, by maximizing the global stiffness and under the smallest possible
volume constraint that ensures material continuity. This investigation
optimizes the prosthesis topology in response to static displacement loads with
amplitudes that normally occur during sound stimulation in a frequency range
between 100 Hz and 10 kHz. Following earlier studies, we discuss how the
presence and arrangement of holes on the surface of the prosthesis plate in
contact with the umbo affect the overall geometry. Finally, we validate the
designs through a finite-element model, in which we assess the prosthesis
performance upon dynamic sound pressure loads by considering four different
constitutive materials: titanium, cortical bone, silk, and
collagen/hydroxyapatite. The results show that the selected prostheses present,
almost independently of their constitutive material, a vibroacustic behavior
close to that of the native ossicular chain, with a slight almost constant
positive shift that reaches a maximum of 5 dB close to 1 kHz. This work
represents a reference for the development of a new generation of middle ear
prostheses with non-conventional topologies for fabrication via additive
manufacturing technologies or ultraprecision machining in order to create
patient-specific devices.

images. The output of any NRR of such a set of images is a dense correspondence
across the whole set. Given such a dense correspondence, it is possible to
build various generative statistical models of appearance variation across the
set. We show that evaluating the quality of the registration can be mapped to
the problem of evaluating the quality of the resultant statistical model. The
quality of the model entails a comparison between the model and the image data
that was used to construct it. It should be noted that this approach does not
depend on the specifics of the registration algorithm used (i.e., whether a
groupwise or pairwise algorithm was used to register the set of images), or on
the specifics of the modelling approach used.
  We derive an index of image model specificity that can be used to assess
image model quality, and hence the quality of registration. This approach is
validated by comparing our assessment of registration quality with that derived
from ground truth anatomical labeling. We demonstrate that our approach is
capable of assessing NRR reliably without ground truth. Finally, to demonstrate
the practicality of our method, different NRR algorithms -- both pairwise and
groupwise -- are compared in terms of their performance on 3D MR brain data.

Consequently, the proposed stochastic Polyak step-size (SPS) is an attractive
choice for setting the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We
provide theoretical convergence guarantees for SGD equipped with SPS in
different settings, including strongly convex, convex and non-convex functions.
Furthermore, our analysis results in novel convergence guarantees for SGD with
a constant step-size. We show that SPS is particularly effective when training
over-parameterized models capable of interpolating the training data. In this
setting, we prove that SPS enables SGD to converge to the true solution at a
fast rate without requiring the knowledge of any problem-dependent constants or
additional computational overhead. We experimentally validate our theoretical

observations suggest the S-stars are remnants of tidally disrupted binaries
from the clockwise disk. In particular, Koposov et al. 2020 discovered a
hypervelocity star that was ejected from the Galactic center 5 Myr ago, with a
velocity vector consistent with the disk. We perform a detailed study of this
binary disruption scenario. First, we quantify the plausible range of binary
semimajor axes in the disk. Dynamical evaporation of such binaries is dominated
by other disk stars rather than by the isotropic stellar population. For the
expected range of semimajor axes in the disk, binary tidal disruptions can
reproduce the observed S-star semimajor axis distribution. Reproducing the
observed thermal eccentricity distribution of the S-stars requires an
additional relaxation process. The flight time of the Koposov star suggests
that this process must be effective within 10 Myr. We consider three
possibilities: (i) scalar resonant relaxation from the observed isotropic star
cluster, (ii) torques from the clockwise disk, and (iii) an intermediate-mass
black hole. We conclude that the first and third mechanisms are fast enough to
reproduce the observed S-star eccentricity distribution. Finally, we show that
the primary star from an unequal-mass binary would be deposited at larger

we follow ideas developed in detail by B.~Bernu and G.~Misguich and use for the
interpolation the entropy exploiting sum rules [the ``entropy method'' (EM)].
We complement the EM results for the specific heat, the entropy, and the
susceptibility by corresponding results obtained by the finite-temperature
Lanczos method (FTLM) for a finite lattice of $N=32$ sites as well as by the
high-temperature expansion (HTE) data. We find that due to pronounced
finite-size effects the FTLM data for $N=32$ are not representative for the
infinite system below $T \approx 0.7$. A similar restriction to $T \gtrsim 0.7$
holds for the HTE designed for the infinite PHAF. By contrast, the EM provides
reliable data for the whole temperature region for the infinite PHAF. We find
evidence for a gapless spectrum leading to a power-law behavior of the specific
heat at low $T$ and for a single maximum in $c(T)$ at $T\approx 0.25$. For the
susceptibility $\chi(T)$ we find indications of a monotonous increase of $\chi$
upon decreasing of $T$ reaching $\chi_0 \approx 0.1$ at $T=0$. Moreover, the EM
allows to estimate the ground-state energy to $e_0\approx -0.52$.

Motivated by the concept of ""starting small"", we present a strategy to
progressively learn independent hierarchical representations from high- to
low-levels of abstractions. The model starts with learning the most abstract
representation, and then progressively grow the network architecture to
introduce new representations at different levels of abstraction. We
quantitatively demonstrate the ability of the presented model to improve
disentanglement in comparison to existing works on two benchmark data sets
using three disentanglement metrics, including a new metric we proposed to
complement the previously-presented metric of mutual information gap. We
further present both qualitative and quantitative evidence on how the
progression of learning improves disentangling of hierarchical representations.
By drawing on the respective advantage of hierarchical representation learning
and progressive learning, this is to our knowledge the first attempt to improve
disentanglement by progressively growing the capacity of VAE to learn
hierarchical representations.

at the origin. In such cases the resolvent operator can be represented on the
annulus by a convergent Laurent series and the spectral set has two

an unbounded component outside the outer boundary. In this paper we prove that
the complementary spectral separation projections on the domain space are

infinite-length generalized Jordan chains of vectors and that the domain space
is the direct sum of these two subspaces. We show that the images of the
generating subspaces under the mapping defined by the pencil provide a
corresponding direct sum decomposition for the range space and that this is
simply the decomposition defined by the complementary spectral separation
projections on the range space. If the domain space has a Schauder basis we

is challenging to keep the robot balanced while it interacts with the

maximising the robustness of loco-manipulation motions. Specifically,
body-ground contact is studied for enhancing robustness and manipulation
capabilities of quadrupedal robots. We propose to equip the robot with prongs:
small legs rigidly attached to the body which ensure body-ground contact occurs
in controllable point-contacts. The effect of these prongs on robustness is
quantified by computing the Smallest Unrejectable Force (SUF), a measure of
robustness related to Feasible Wrench Polytopes. We apply the SUF to assess the
robustness of the system, and propose an effective approximation of the SUF
that can be computed at near-real-time speed. We design a hierarchical
quadratic programming based whole-body controller that controls stable
interaction when the prongs are in contact with the ground. This novel concept
of using prongs and the resulting control framework are all implemented on
hardware to validate the effectiveness of the increased robustness and newly
enabled loco-manipulation tasks, such as obstacle clearance and manipulation of
a large object.

high resolution optical spectra and measure the equivalent width of the 607.8
nm LiI line for 40 members of the Psc-Eri stream, whose rotational periods have
been derived by arXiv:1905.10588. Results. We show that a tight correlation
exists between lithium content and rotation rate among the late-G to early
K-type stars of the Psc-Eri stream. Fast rotators are systematically Li-rich,
while slow rotators are Li-depleted. This trend mimics the one previously

lithium-rotation connection thus seems to be universal over a restricted

Montenegro et al. is responsible for driving the turbulence and angular
momentum transport in the central regions of barred galaxies. Here we test
these suggestions by running simple hydrodynamical simulations in a logarithmic
barred potential. Since the rotation curve of this potential is scale-free, the
shear minimum theory predicts that no ring should form. We find that in
contrast to this prediction, a ring does form in the simulation, with
morphology consistent with that of nuclear rings in real barred galaxies. This
proves that the presence of a shear-minimum is not a necessary condition for
the formation of a ring. We also find that perturbations that are predicted to
be acoustically unstable wind up and eventually propagate off to infinity, so
that the system is actually stable. We conclude that (i) the shear-minimum
theory is an unlikely mechanism for the formation of nuclear rings in barred
galaxies; (ii) the acoustic instability is a spurious result and may not be
able to drive turbulence in the interstellar medium, at least for the case
without self-gravity. The question of the role of turbulent viscosity remains
open.

design a sparse network to represent the function very accurately, or even
exactly. When such structural information is not available, and we may only use
a dense neural network, the optimization procedure to find the sparse network
embedded in the dense network is similar to finding the needle in a haystack,
using a given number of samples of the function. We demonstrate that the cost
(measured by sample complexity) of finding the needle is directly related to
the Barron norm of the function. While only a small number of samples is needed
to train a sparse network, the dense network trained with the same number of
samples exhibits large test loss and a large generalization gap. In order to
control the size of the generalization gap, we find that the use of explicit
regularization becomes increasingly more important as $d$ increases. The
numerically observed sample complexity with explicit regularization scales as
$\mathcal{O}(d^{2.5})$, which is in fact better than the theoretically
predicted sample complexity that scales as $\mathcal{O}(d^{4})$. Without
explicit regularization (also called implicit regularization), the numerically
observed sample complexity is significantly higher and is close to
$\mathcal{O}(d^{4.5})$.

semimajor axis. Different formation scenarios result in different observable
effects, such as orbital parameters (obliquity/eccentricity), or frequency of
planets at different stellar ages. In the context of the GAPS Young-Objects
project, we are carrying out a radial velocity survey with the aim to search
and characterize young hot-Jupiter planets. Our purpose is to put constraints
on evolutionary models and establish statistical properties, such as the
frequency of these planets from a homogeneous sample. Since young stars are in
general magnetically very active, we performed multi-band (visible and
near-infrared) spectroscopy with simultaneous GIANO-B + HARPS-N (GIARPS)
observing mode at TNG. This helps to deal with stellar activity and distinguish
the nature of radial velocity variations: stellar activity will introduce a
wavelength-dependent radial velocity amplitude, whereas a Keplerian signal is
achromatic. As a pilot study, we present here the cases of two already claimed
hot Jupiters orbiting young stars: HD285507 b and AD Leo b. Our analysis of
simultaneous high-precision GIARPS spectroscopic data confirms the Keplerian
nature of HD285507's radial velocities variation and refines the orbital
parameters of the hot Jupiter, obtaining an eccentricity consistent with a
circular orbit. On the other hand, our analysis does not confirm the signal
previously attributed to a planet orbiting AD Leo. This demonstrates the power

The objective is to minimize the travel time of the aerial vehicle ensuring
that the communication connectivity constraint required for the safe operation
of the aerial vehicle is satisfied. We consider two different criteria for the
connectivity constraint of the aerial vehicle which leads to two different
scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the maximum continuous time
duration that the aerial vehicle is out of the coverage of the ground base
stations (GBSs) is limited to a given threshold. In the second scenario,
however, we assume that the total time periods that the aerial vehicle is not
covered by the GBSs is restricted. Based on these two constraints, we formulate
two trajectory optimization problems. To solve these non-convex problems, we
use an approach based on the double Q-learning method which is a model-free
reinforcement learning technique and unlike the existing algorithms does not
need perfect knowledge of the environment. Moreover, in contrast to the
well-known Q-learning technique, our double Q-learning algorithm does not
suffer from the over-estimation issue. Simulation results show that although

the BS and the reflection coefficient of the IR are jointly optimized, via an
iterative approach, so as to maximize the sum of downlink rates towards
multiple users. Next, in the imperfect CSI scenario, a distributional
reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed to learn the optimal IR
reflection and maximize the expectation of downlink capacity. In order to model
the transmission rate's probability distribution, a learning algorithm, based
on quantile regression (QR), is developed, and the proposed QR-DRL method is
proved to converge to a stable distribution of downlink transmission rate.

approach yields over 30% and 2-fold increase in the downlink sum-rate, compared
with a fixed IR reflection scheme and direct transmission scheme, respectively.
Simulation results also show that by deploying more IR elements, the downlink
sum-rate can be significantly improved. However, as the number of IR components
increases, more time is required for channel estimation, and the slope of
increase in the IR-aided transmission rate will become smaller. Furthermore,
under limited knowledge of CSI, simulation results show that the proposed
QR-DRL method, which learns a full distribution of the downlink rate, yields a
better prediction accuracy and improves the downlink rate by 10% for online
deployments, compared with a Q-learning baseline.

frequencies of 20 and 40 MHz for the Ecuadorian jungle. It is expected that the
results obtained at the end of this research will be applied to produce a
complete coverage map for wireless communications technologies, which will
optimize the radio spectrum in operations carried out by the Armed Forces in
the Ecuadorian border jungle. The final expression found is an adjustment
function that relates the Receiving Power (PRX) to factors that determine the
geometry of the Fresnell Zone (Connectivity). The resulting model of the
research improves the discrepancy between the simulated power (PRX) in
commercial software and a sample of measured wireless transmissions in situ.
The analysis was based on the results and methodology presented by
Longley-Rice. It was determined the non-normality of the discrepancy between
the losses (LLR) calculated by Longley-Rice Model (LMR) and the data obtained
in the field, It was added correction coefficients on the expression of LMR.
Subsequently, the mathematical expression was linearized to implement
multivariate linear adjustment techniques. Alternative formulations to the
Linear Regression model were sought and their goodness of fit was compared; all
these techniques are introduced theoretically. To conclude, an analysis of the
error of the found model is made. Mathematical modeling software such as MATLAB
and SPSS were used for the formulation and numerical analysis, whose algorithms
are also introduced. Finally, we propose future lines of research that allow a
global understanding of the behavior of telecommunications technologies under
hostile environments.

promising framework to address open issues in data analysis. In this work, we
focus on one of these aspects, closely related to principal component analysis
for the case of large dimensional data sets with covariance having a nearly
continuous spectrum. In this case, the distinction between ""noise-like"" and
""non-noise"" modes becomes arbitrary and an open challenge for standard methods.
Observing that both renormalization group and principal component analysis
search for simplification for systems involving many degrees of freedom, we aim
to use the renormalization group argument to clarify the turning point between
noise and information modes. The analogy between coarse-graining
renormalization and principal component analysis has been investigated in
[Journal of Statistical Physics,167, Issue 3-4, pp 462-475, (2017)], from a
perturbative framework, and the implementation with real sets of data by the
same authors showed that the procedure may reflect more than a simple formal
analogy. In particular, the separation of sampling noise modes may be
controlled by a non-Gaussian fixed point, reminiscent of the behaviour of
critical systems. In our analysis, we go beyond the perturbative framework
using nonperturbative techniques to investigate non-Gaussian fixed points and
propose a deeper formalism allowing going beyond power-law assumptions for
explicit computations.

be associated with short gamma-ray bursts. We incorporate the radiation
constraint that gives a necessary condition for nonthermal neutrino production,
and account for the time evolution of the jet, which allows us to treat
neutrino oscillation in matter more accurately. For massive star progenitors,
neutrino injection inside the star can lead to nonadiabatic oscillation
patterns in the 1 TeV - 10 TeV and is also visible in the flavor ratio. For
neutron star merger ejecta, we find a similar behavior in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV
region and the oscillation may result in a $\nu_e$ excess around 1 TeV. These
features, which enable us to probe the progenitors of long and short GRBs,
could be seen by future neutrino detectors with precise flavor ratio

arguments and high-resolution simulations. We consider different scenarios for
the loss of angular momentum required for the available cold gas to be accreted
onto the central SMBHs, and we compare different combinations of triggering
mechanisms, including galaxy mergers and disc instabilities in star forming
discs. We compare our predictions with the luminosity function (LF) observed
for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and we confirm that a non-instantaneous
accretion timescale (either in the form of a low-angular momentum reservoir or
as an assumed light curve evolution) is needed in order to reproduce the
measured evolution of the AGN-LF and the so-called AGN-downsizing trend.
Moreover, we also study the impact of AGN feedback, in the form of AGN-driven
outflows, on the SF properties of model galaxies, using prescriptions derived
both from empirical studies or from numerical experiments. We show that
AGN-driven outflows are effective in suppressing the residual star formation
rate in massive galaxies ($> 10^{11} M_\odot$) without changing their overall
assembly history. These winds also affect the SFR of lower mass galaxies,
resulting in a too large fraction of passive galaxies at $< 10^{10} M_\odot$.
Finally, we study the Eddington ratio distribution as a function of SMBH mass,
showing that only objects more massive than $10^8 M_\odot$ are already in a
self-regulated state as inferred from observations.

software-defined architecture is introduced in which centralized resources can
be assigned, programmed, and controlled using the anchor nodes (ANs) of the
edge servers. Unlike the legacy networks, where a typical user is served from
only one access point (AP), in the proposed system model, a vehicle user is
served from multiple APs simultaneously. While this increases the reliability
and the spectral efficiency of the assisted users, it also necessitates an
accurate power allocation in all transmission time slots. As such, a joint user
association and power allocation problem is formulated to achieve enhanced
reliability and weighted user sum rate. However, the formulated problem is a
complex combinatorial problem, remarkably hard to solve. Therefore,
fine-grained machine learning algorithms are used to efficiently optimize joint
user associations and power allocations of the APs in a highly mobile vehicular
network. Furthermore, a distributed single-agent reinforcement learning
algorithm, namely SARL-MARL, is proposed which obtains nearly identical
genie-aided optimal solutions within a nominal number of training episodes than
the baseline solution. Simulation results validate that our solution
outperforms existing schemes and can attain genie-aided optimal performances.

Increasing the photonic chip integration density is highly desired as it

photonic chip integration density is limited by the waveguide crosstalk, which
is caused by the evanescent waves in the cladding. Here we show that the
waveguide crosstalk can be suppressed completely with the exceptional coupling
in extreme skin-depth (eskid) waveguides. The anisotropic dielectric
perturbations in the coupled eskid waveguides cause such an exceptional
coupling, resulting in infinitely long coupling length. We demonstrate the
extreme suppression of waveguide crosstalk via exceptional coupling on a

is possible via the use of spin-Hall detection of the in-plane magnetic state

gradient (NAG) improves the convergence rate of gradient descent (GD) for
convex optimization using a specially designed momentum; however, it
accumulates error when an inexact gradient is used (such as in SGD), slowing
convergence at best and diverging at worst. In this paper, we propose Scheduled
Restart SGD (SRSGD), a new NAG-style scheme for training DNNs. SRSGD replaces
the constant momentum in SGD by the increasing momentum in NAG but stabilizes
the iterations by resetting the momentum to zero according to a schedule. Using
a variety of models and benchmarks for image classification, we demonstrate
that, in training DNNs, SRSGD significantly improves convergence and
generalization; for instance in training ResNet200 for ImageNet classification,
SRSGD achieves an error rate of 20.93% vs. the benchmark of 22.13%. These
improvements become more significant as the network grows deeper. Furthermore,
on both CIFAR and ImageNet, SRSGD reaches similar or even better error rates
with significantly fewer training epochs compared to the SGD baseline.

displays the apsidal motion with a rate of $\dot{\omega}$ = 0.075$\pm$0.031 deg
year$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an apsidal period of U = 4800$\pm$2000 years.
The binary star model represents that the smaller, less massive primary

612$\pm$36 pc is in good agreement with the $Gaia$ distance of 644$\pm$26 pc.
We subtracted the binary effects from the observed {\it TESS} data and applied
a multifrequency analysis to these residuals. The result reveals that AI Hya is
multiperiodic in its pulsation. Of 14 signals detected, four ($f_1$, $f_2$,
$f_3$, $f_6$) may be considered independent pulsation frequencies. The period
ratios of $P_{\rm pul}/P_{\rm orb}$ = 0.012$-$0.021 and the pulsation constants

we give a criterion to determine whenever a rational homology 3-sphere has a

successful procedure, only 2/3 of patients who undergo the procedure report
their knees feeling ''normal'' post-operation, and complications can arise that
require revision. This necessitates a model to identify a population at higher

new technologies and growing in-formation acquisition and processing

mono-lithic view of information. Past research and practitioner heuristics
posit that adopting new technologies and incorpo-rating more information should
increase price efficiency and trading performance uniformity. However, along
with technological change, information dynamics have evolved significantly
resulting in immense growth in data volumes, and increased complexity of
information categories. The present research explores behavioral trading
performance under varying information category conditions and argues that
unfettered technological developments and information consumption will not
necessarily lead to consistent improvement in uniformity of trading
performance. In this study, we employ an artificial stock market based economic
experiment to examine the role of technol-ogy driven information categories in
influencing trading decisions in electronic markets. Financial electronic
markets are used as an information-rich mature markets representation to
analyze information category driven trading perfor-mance. The results show that
a variation of information categories can influence trading performance. The
findings provide a basis to better understand behavioral phenomena in
electronic markets and can be used to explain anomalies as well as to manage
trading performance in electronic markets.

the heliosphere that travel from the Sun into the interplanetary medium. The
internal magnetic field lines inside the MCs are twisted, forming a flux rope
(FR). This magnetic field structuring is determined by its initial solar
configuration, by the processes involved during its eruption from the Sun, and
by the dynamical evolution during its interaction with the ambient solar wind.
One of the most important properties of the magnetic structure inside MCs is
the twist of the field lines forming the FR (the number of turns per unit
length). The detailed internal distribution of twist is under debate mainly
because the magnetic field (B) in MCs is observed only along the spacecraft
trajectory, and thus it is necessary to complete observations with theoretical
assumptions. Estimating the twist from the study of a single event is difficult
because the field fluctuations significantly increase the noise of the observed
B time series and thus the bias of the deduced twist. The superposed epoch
applied to MCs has proven to be a powerful technique, permitting the extraction
of their common features, and removing the peculiarity of individual cases. We
apply a superposed epoch technique to analyse the magnetic components in the
local FR frame of a significant sample of moderately asymmetric MCs observed at
1 au. From the superposed profile of B components in the FR frame, we determine
the typical twist distribution in MCs. The twist is nearly uniform in the FR
core (central half part), and it increases moderately, up to a factor two,
towards the MC boundaries. This profile is close to the Lundquist field model
limited to the FR core where the axial field component is above about one-third
of its central value.

first time, a modified version of the Haldane model in a mechanical
metamaterial. Here, the complex-valued couplings are polarized in a way that
modes on opposite edges of a lattice propagate in the same direction, and are
balanced by counter-propagating diffusive bulk modes. The proposed method is
general and flexible, and could be used to realize arbitrary lattice

the thickness (7.5 to 60 nm), substrate choice (GGG and SGGG), and
crystallization process. We correlate morphological and structural properties

annealed at 600 {\deg}C show compressive strain favoring an in-plane magnetic

present a high degree of crystallinity and magnetization saturation close to
the bulk value. These results lead to successful fabrication of trilayers
TIG/Au/TIG, with coupling between the TIG layers depending on Au thickness.
These results will facilitate the use of TIG to create various in situ clean

development of complex devices. Moreover, the sputtering technique is

in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). It aims to find repetitive
scenes from historical data to reset localization. To tackle the loop closure
problem, existing methods often leverage on the matching of visual features,
which achieve good accuracy but require high computational resources. However,
feature point based methods ignore the patterns of image, i.e., the shape of
the objects as well as the distribution of objects in an image. It is believed
that this information is usually unique for a scene and can be utilized to
improve the performance of traditional loop closure detection methods. In this
paper we leverage and compress the information into a binary image to
accelerate an existing fast loop closure detection method via binary content.
The proposed method can greatly reduce the computational cost without
sacrificing recall rate. It consists of three parts: binary content
construction, fast image retrieval and precise loop closure detection. No
offline training is required. Our method is compared with the state-of-the-art
loop closure detection methods and the results show that it outperforms the
traditional methods at both recall rate and speed.

cancer types in six different SNV feature dimensions. In this study, we found
that the extracted features showed similar distribution in the cluster center

the cancer at the SNV level. We used k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to classify the

dominantly mafic volcanic rocks of the Warrawoona and Kelly Groups that dip
gently away from the North Pole Monzogranite exposed in the core of the dome
(Figure 1) (Van Kranendonk, 1999, 2000). Average dips vary from 30 to 60
degrees in the inner part of the dome to about 60 to 80 degrees in the outer
part of the dome (Van Kranendonk, 2000). The North Pole Monzogranite is
interpreted to represent a syn-volcanic laccolith to the Panorama Formation

below the surface, based on gravity surveys (Blewett et al., 2004). Felsic
volcanic formations are interbedded with the greenstones (Hickman, 1983), and

provide a precise definition of what could be (or should be) expected from an
entity that collects individuals' data when a request is made of it to delete

alternatives for what future versions of the law could explicitly require.

and is being increasingly utilized in the analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics.
Well-known techniques such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and its
linear variants provide approximations to the Koopman operator, and have been
applied extensively in many fluid dynamic problems. Despite being endowed with
a richer dictionary of nonlinear observables, nonlinear variants of the DMD,
such as extended/kernel dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD/KDMD) are seldom
applied to large-scale problems primarily due to the difficulty of discerning
the Koopman invariant subspace from thousands of resulting Koopman eigenmodes.
To address this issue, we propose a framework based on multi-task feature
learning to extract the most informative Koopman invariant subspace by removing
redundant and spurious Koopman triplets. In particular, we develop a pruning
procedure that penalizes departure from linear evolution. These algorithms can
be viewed as sparsity promoting extensions of EDMD/KDMD. Further, we extend
KDMD to a continuous-time setting and show a relationship between the present
algorithm, sparsity-promoting DMD, and an empirical criterion from the
viewpoint of non-convex optimization. The effectiveness of our algorithm is
demonstrated on examples ranging from simple dynamical systems to
two-dimensional cylinder wake flows at different Reynolds numbers and a
three-dimensional turbulent ship air-wake flow. The latter two problems are
designed such that very strong nonlinear transients are present, thus requiring
an accurate approximation of the Koopman operator. Underlying physical
mechanisms are analyzed, with an emphasis on characterizing transient dynamics.
The results are compared to existing theoretical expositions and numerical
approximations.

Optimization Problems (DCOPs) by exploiting a cycle-cut idea to implement
memory-bounded inference. However, each cluster root in the algorithm is
responsible for enumerating all the instantiations of its cycle-cut nodes,
which would cause redundant inferences when its branches do not have the same
cycle-cut nodes. Additionally, a large number of cycle-cut nodes and the
iterative nature of MB-DPOP further exacerbate the pathology. As a result,
MB-DPOP could suffer from huge coordination overheads and cannot scale up well.
Therefore, we present RMB-DPOP which incorporates several novel mechanisms to
reduce redundant inferences and improve the scalability of MB-DPOP. First,
using the independence among the cycle-cut nodes in different branches, we
distribute the enumeration of instantiations into different branches whereby
the number of nonconcurrent instantiations reduces significantly and each
branch can perform memory bounded inference asynchronously. Then, taking the
topology into the consideration, we propose an iterative allocation mechanism
to choose the cycle-cut nodes that cover a maximum of active nodes in a cluster
and break ties according to their relative positions in a pseudo-tree. Finally,
a caching mechanism is proposed to further reduce unnecessary inferences when
the historical results are compatible with the current instantiations. We
theoretically show that with the same number of cycle-cut nodes RMB-DPOP
requires as many messages as MB-DPOP in the worst case and the experimental
results show our superiorities over the state-of-the-art.

quermassintegral, so the convergence of the flow yields sharp
Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities in hyperbolic space. Some special cases
have been studied in [7]. In the first part of this paper, we show that
h-convexity of the hypersurface is preserved along the flow and then the smooth
convergence of the flow for h-convex hypersurfaces follows. We then apply this
result to establish some new sharp geometric inequalities comparing the
integral of $k$th Gauss-Bonnet curvature of a smooth h-convex hypersurface to
its $m$th quermassintegral (for $0\leq m\leq 2k+1\leq n$), and comparing the
weighted integral of $k$th mean curvature to its $m$th quermassintegral (for

conjecture proposed by Ge, Wang and Wu in 2015.

the structure and evolution of stars in diverse astrophysical contexts, but
complications have been noted in the context of young, magnetically active

Numerous puzzles are associated with pre-main sequence and active main-sequence
stars, relating to their radii, their colors, certain elemental abundances, and
the coevality of young clusters, among others. A promising explanation for
these puzzles is the distorting effects of magnetic activity and starspots on
the structure of active stars. To assist the community in evaluating this
hypothesis, we present the Stellar Parameters Of Tracks with Starspots (SPOTS)
models, a grid of solar-metallicity stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones
which include a treatment of the structural effects of starspots. The models
range from 0.1-1.3\msun and from spot-less to a surface covering fraction of
85\%, and are evolved from the pre-main sequence to the red giant branch (or
15~Gyr). We also produce two-temperature synthetic colors for our models using
empirically-calibrated color tables. We describe the physical ingredients
included in the SPOTS models and compare their predictions to other modern
evolution codes. Finally, we apply these models to several open questions in
the field of active stars, including the radii of young eclipsing binaries, the
color scale of pre-main sequence stars, and the existence of sub-subgiants,
demonstrating that our models can explain many peculiar features of active
stars.

than comparing image classifiers using fixed test images, we adaptively sample
a small test set from an arbitrarily large corpus of unlabeled images so as to
maximize the discrepancies between the classifiers, measured by the distance

when LR faces are captured in low or non-uniform illumination conditions. This
paper proposes a Copy and Paste Generative Adversarial Network (CPGAN) to
recover authentic high-resolution (HR) face images while compensating for low

CPGAN: internal and external Copy and Paste nets (CPnets). Specifically, our
internal CPnet exploits facial information residing in the input image to
enhance facial details; while our external CPnet leverages an external HR face
for illumination compensation. A new illumination compensation loss is thus
developed to capture illumination from the external guided face image
effectively. Furthermore, our method offsets illumination and upsamples facial
details alternately in a coarse-to-fine fashion, thus alleviating the
correspondence ambiguity between LR inputs and external HR inputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method manifests authentic HR face images in a
uniform illumination condition and outperforms state-of-the-art methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

facility and client recourse. We then turn to the dynamic algorithm model for
the problem, where the main goal is to design fast algorithms that maintain
good solutions at all time steps. We show that the result for online facility
location, combined with the randomized local search technique of Charikar and
Guha [10], leads to an $O(1+\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$ approximation dynamic algorithm
with amortized update time of $\tilde O(n)$ in the incremental setting. Notice
that the running time is almost optimal, since in general metric space it takes
$\Omega(n)$ time to specify a new client's position. The approximation factor
of our algorithm also matches the best offline analysis of the classic local
search algorithm. Finally, we study the fully dynamic model for facility
location, where clients can both arrive and depart. Our main result is an
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm in this model with $O(|F|)$ preprocessing time
and $O(\log^3 D)$ amortized update time for the HST metric spaces. Using the
seminal results of Bartal [4] and Fakcharoenphol, Rao and Talwar [17], which
show that any arbitrary $N$-point metric space can be embedded into a
distribution over HSTs such that the expected distortion is at most $O(\log
N)$, we obtain a $O(\log |F|)$ approximation with preprocessing time of
$O(|F|^2\log |F|)$ and $O(\log^3 D)$ amortized update time.

interaction with special relativity. Since quaternions are intrinsically
4-dimensional, and do such a good job of handling 3-dimensional rotations, the
hope has always been that the use of quaternions would simplify some of the
algebra of the Lorentz transformations. Herein we report a relatively nice
result for the relativistic combination of non-collinear 3-velocities. If we
work with the relativistic half-velocities $w$ defined by $v={2w\over1+w^2}$,
and promote them to quaternions using $\mathbf{w} = w \; \mathbf{\hat n}$,
where $\mathbf{\hat n}$ is a unit quaternion, then we shall show \[
\mathbf{w}_{1\oplus2} = \mathbf{w}_1 \oplus \mathbf{w}_2
=(1-\mathbf{w}_1\mathbf{w}_2)^{-1} (\mathbf{w}_1 +\mathbf{w}_2) = (\mathbf{w}_1

angular dependence for relativistic combination of non-collinear 3-velocities
is now encoded in the quaternion multiplication of $\mathbf{w}_1$ with
$\mathbf{w}_2$. This result can furthermore be extended to obtain an elegant
and compact formula for the associated Wigner angle: \[
\mathrm{e}^{\mathbf{\Omega}} = \mathrm{e}^{\Omega \; \mathbf{\hat\Omega} } =
(1-\mathbf{w}_1\mathbf{w}_2)^{-1} (1-\mathbf{w}_2\mathbf{w}_1), \] in terms of

{\mathbf{\hat{n}}}_{2\oplus1} = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathbf{\Omega}/2} \;\;
{\mathbf{w}_1+\mathbf{w}_2\over |\mathbf{w}_1+\mathbf{w}_2|}. \] Thus, we would
argue, many key results that are ultimately due to the non-commutativity of
non-collinear boosts can be easily rephrased in terms of the algebra of

do so by a proper scoring rule.
  Specifically, our expert aims to predict the probability that a biased coin
flipped tomorrow will land heads, and can flip the coin any number of times

a simple path $\pi$ of $n$ vertices, preprocess it so that the convex hull of
any query subpath of $\pi$ can be quickly obtained. Previously, Guibas,
Hershberger, and Snoeyink [SODA 90'] proposed a data structure of $O(n)$ space
and $O(\log n\log\log n)$ query time; reducing the query time to $O(\log n)$
increases the space to $O(n\log\log n)$. We present an improved result that
uses $O(n)$ space while achieving $O(\log n)$ query time. Like the previous
work, our query algorithm returns a compact interval tree representing the
convex hull so that standard binary-search-based queries on the hull can be
performed in $O(\log n)$ time each. Our new result leads to improvements for
several other problems.
  In particular, with the help of the above result, we present new algorithms
for the ray-shooting problem among segments. Given a set of $n$ (possibly
intersecting) line segments in the plane, preprocess it so that the first
segment hit by a query ray can be quickly found. We give a data structure of
$O(n\log n)$ space that can answer each query in $(\sqrt{n}\log n)$ time. If
the segments are nonintersecting or if the segments are lines, then the space
can be reduced to $O(n)$. All these are classical problems that have been
studied extensively. Previously data structures of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
query time (the notation $\widetilde{O}$ suppresses a polylogarithmic factor)
were known in early 1990s; nearly no progress has been made for over two
decades. For all problems, our results provide improvements by reducing the

solution to the SDP with perfect data recovers the solution to the original low
rank matrix recovery problem. It is more challenging to show that an
approximate solution to the SDP formulated with noisy problem data acceptably
solves the original problem; arguments are usually ad hoc for each problem
setting, and can be complex.
  In this note, we identify a set of conditions that we call simplicity that
limit the error due to noisy problem data or incomplete convergence. In this
sense, simple SDPs are robust: simple SDPs can be (approximately) solved
efficiently at scale; and the resulting approximate solutions, even with noisy
data, can be trusted. Moreover, we show that simplicity holds generically, and
also for many structured low rank matrix recovery problems, including the
stochastic block model, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, and matrix completion.
Formally, we call an SDP simple if it has a surjective constraint map, admits a
unique primal and dual solution pair, and satisfies strong duality and strict
complementarity.
  However, simplicity is not a panacea: we show the Burer-Monteiro formulation
of the SDP may have spurious second-order critical points, even for a simple

survey at Magellan designed to map the z=2.2-2.8 intergalactic medium (IGM) in
three dimensions by observing the Ly$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of galaxies
and QSOs. Within an area of 1.7 deg${}^2$, we will observe approximately half
of $\gtrsim L^*$ galaxies at z=2.2-3.2 for typically 12 hours, providing a
dense network of sightlines piercing the IGM with an average transverse
separation of 2.5 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc (1 physical Mpc). At these scales, the
opacity of the IGM is expected to be closely related to the dark matter
density, and LATIS will therefore map the density field in the $z \sim 2.5$
universe at $\sim$Mpc resolution over the largest volume to date. Ultimately
LATIS will produce approximately 3800 spectra of z=2.2-3.2 galaxies that probe
the IGM within a volume of $4 \times 10^6 h^{-3}$ Mpc${}^3$, large enough to
contain a representative sample of structures from protoclusters to large
voids. Observations are already complete over one-third of the survey area. In
this paper, we describe the survey design and execution. We present the largest
IGM tomographic maps at comparable resolution yet made. We show that the
recovered matter overdensities are broadly consistent with cosmological
expectations based on realistic mock surveys, that they correspond to galaxy
overdensities, and that we can recover structures identified using other
tracers. LATIS is conducted in Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey
fields, including COSMOS. Coupling the LATIS tomographic maps with the rich
data sets collected in these fields will enable novel studies of
environment-dependent galaxy evolution and the galaxy-IGM connection at cosmic
noon.

very low probability of detection and is an alternative to current covert
channels. We tunnel a TCP session through a UDP protocol and guarantee
delivery. Observation-based FTE ensures traffic cannot be detected by
traditional rule-based analysis or DPI. A deterministic HMM ensures the

assessment of datasets prior to publication on the LOD cloud. To this end, we
identify important quality deficiencies that need to be avoided and/or resolved

assessment and identification of undesirable quality characteristics of a

human that is immersed into the viewing perspective of a remote robot. The
challenge is to make the experience both effective (such as delivering a sense
of presence) and comfortable (such as avoiding adverse sickness symptoms,
including nausea). We refer to this challenging new area as human
perception-optimized planning and propose a general multiobjective optimization
framework that can be instantiated in many envisioned scenarios. We then
consider a specific VR telepresence task as a case of human
perception-optimized planning, in which we simulate a robot that sends 360
video to a remote user to be viewed through a head-mounted display. In this
particular task, we plan trajectories that minimize VR sickness (and thereby
maximize comfort). An A* type method is used to create a Pareto-optimal
collection of piecewise linear trajectories while taking into account criteria
that improve comfort. We conducted a study with human subjects touring a
virtual museum, in which paths computed by our algorithm are compared against a
reference RRT-based trajectory. Generally, users suffered less from VR sickness
and preferred the paths created by the presented algorithm.

a conditioning feature, and computes an array of encoded output objects. Model
building becomes a simple exercise of replication, rearrangement and stacking

that have dichotomous marginals, in which the added value of any item to a set
is either 0 or 1, and aim to design truthful allocation mechanisms (without
money) that maximize welfare and are fair. For the case that players have
submodular valuations with dichotomous marginals, we design such a
deterministic truthful allocation mechanism. The allocation output by our
mechanism is Lorenz dominating, and consequently satisfies many desired
fairness properties, such as being envy-free up to any item (EFX), and
maximizing the Nash Social Welfare (NSW). We then show that our mechanism with
random priorities is envy-free ex-ante, while having all the above properties
ex-post. Furthermore, we present several impossibility results precluding
similar results for the larger class of XOS valuations.
  To gauge the robustness of our positive results, we also study
$\epsilon$-dichotomous valuations, in which the added value of any item to a
set is either non-positive, or in the range $[1, 1 + \epsilon]$. We show
several impossibility results in this setting, and also a positive result: for
players that have additive $\epsilon$-dichotomous valuations with sufficiently
small $\epsilon$, we design a randomized truthful mechanism with strong ex-post
guarantees. For $\rho = \frac{1}{1 + \epsilon}$, the allocations that it
produces generate at least a $\rho$-fraction of the maximum welfare, and enjoy
$\rho$-approximations for various fairness properties, such as being envy-free
up to one item (EF1), and giving each player at least her maximin share.

maximum a posteriori (MAP) point of the posterior permeability distribution
from centimeter-level surface deformation measurements obtained from
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). The scalability of our method
to high parameter dimension is achieved through the use of adjoint-based

class sparse prior precision operator. Together, these guarantee that the MAP
point is found at a cost, measured in number of forward/adjoint poroelasticity
solves, that is independent of the parameter dimension. We apply our
methodology to a test case for a municipal well in Mesquite, Nevada, in which
InSAR and GPS surface deformation data are available. We solve problems with up

A consistent treatment of noise level is employed so that the aquifer
characterization result does not depend on the pixel spacing of surface

missing data does not take into account the presence of the class label in the
classification problem. Also, existing kNN imputation methods use variants of
Minkowski distance as a measure of distance, which does not work well with
heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative kNN imputation
technique based on class weighted grey distance between the missing datum and
all the training data. Grey distance works well in heterogeneous data with
missing instances. The distance is weighted by Mutual Information (MI) which is
a measure of feature relevance between the features and the class label. This
ensures that the imputation of the training data is directed towards improving
classification performance. This class weighted grey kNN imputation algorithm
demonstrates improved performance when compared to other kNN imputation

Existing approaches to ECPE generally adopt a two-stage method, i.e., (1)

to cause clauses, i.e., the links are directional. Emotion extraction and cause

boost the pair extraction. Experiments are conducted on an ECPE benchmarking

the robust error (over worst-case perturbations), but it often leads to an

explanations for this tradeoff rely on the assumption that no predictor in the
hypothesis class has low standard and robust error. In this work, we precisely
characterize the effect of augmentation on the standard error in linear
regression when the optimal linear predictor has zero standard and robust
error. In particular, we show that the standard error could increase even when
the augmented perturbations have noiseless observations from the optimal linear
predictor. We then prove that the recently proposed robust self-training (RST)
estimator improves robust error without sacrificing standard error for
noiseless linear regression. Empirically, for neural networks, we find that RST
with different adversarial training methods improves both standard and robust

mass-ejection signature in the field of the Small Magellanic Cloud. Maccarone
et al. (2019) concluded that ASASSN-16oh is the first dwarf nova with supersoft
X-ray that originated from an equatorial accretion belt on a white dwarf (WD).
Hillman et al. (2019) proposed a thermonuclear runaway model that both the
X-rays and $V$/$I$ photons are emitted from the hot WD. We calculated the same
parameter models as Hillman et al.'s and found that they manipulated on/off the
mass-accretion, and their best fit $V$ light curves are 6 mag fainter, and
decay about 10 times slower, than that of ASASSN-16oh. We propose a nova model
induced by a high rate of mass accretion during a dwarf nova outburst, i.e.,
the X-rays originate from the surface of the hydrogen-burning WD whereas the
$V/I$ photons are from the irradiated disk. Our model explains the main
observational properties of ASASSN-16oh. We also obtained thermonuclear runaway
models with no mass ejection for a wide range of parameters of the WD mass and
mass accretion rates including both natural and forced novae in low-metal
environments of $Z=0.001$ and $Z=0.0001$. They are a new type of periodic
supersoft X-ray sources with no mass ejection, and also a bright transient in
$V$/$I$ bands if they have a large disk. We suggest that such objects are
candidates of Type Ia supernova progenitors because its mass is increasing at a
very high efficiency $(\sim 100 \%)$.

random failures that occur according to known failure distributions. We seek a

ensuring their coordination. Each subproblem consists in optimizing the

mixed-integer problem. Therefore, we relax the dynamics and the cost functions

Relaxation parameters have an important influence on the optimization and must

adoption is driven by its simplified network architecture, air interface, and
medium access. The physical layer, known as LoRa, provides quasi-orthogonal
virtual channels through spreading factors (SFs) and time-power capture gains.
However, the adopted pure ALOHA access mechanism suffers, in terms of
scalability, under the same-channel same-SF transmissions from a large number
of devices. In this paper, our objective is to explore access mechanisms
beyond-ALOHA for LoRaWAN. Using recent results on time- and power-capture
effects of LoRa, we develop a unified model for the comparative study of other
choices, i.e., slotted ALOHA and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA). The
model includes the necessary design parameters of these access mechanisms, such
as guard time and synchronization accuracy for slotted ALOHA, carrier sensing
threshold for CSMA. It also accounts for the spatial interaction of devices in
annular-shaped regions, characteristic of LoRa, for CSMA. The performance
derived from the model in terms of coverage probability, channel throughput,
and energy efficiency are validated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Our analysis
shows that slotted ALOHA indeed has higher reliability than pure ALOHA but at
the cost of lower energy efficiency for low device densities. Whereas, CSMA
outperforms slotted ALOHA at smaller SFs in terms of reliability and energy
efficiency, with its performance degrading to pure ALOHA at higher SFs.

we introduce a certifiable defense against patch attacks that guarantees for a
given image and patch attack size, no patch adversarial examples exist. Our
method is related to the broad class of randomized smoothing robustness schemes
which provide high-confidence probabilistic robustness certificates. By
exploiting the fact that patch attacks are more constrained than general sparse
attacks, we derive meaningfully large robustness certificates against them.
Additionally, in contrast to smoothing-based defenses against L_p and sparse
attacks, our defense method against patch attacks is de-randomized, yielding
improved, deterministic certificates. Compared to the existing patch
certification method proposed by Chiang et al. (2020), which relies on interval
bound propagation, our method can be trained significantly faster, achieves
high clean and certified robust accuracy on CIFAR-10, and provides certificates
at ImageNet scale. For example, for a 5-by-5 patch attack on CIFAR-10, our
method achieves up to around 57.6% certified accuracy (with a classifier with
around 83.8% clean accuracy), compared to at most 30.3% certified accuracy for

report early-phase observations of seven photometrically normal SNe Ia (six
early detections and one deep non-detection limit) at the COSMOS field through
a half-year transient survey as a part of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program (HSC SSP). In particular, a blue light-curve excess was
discovered for HSC17bmhk, a normal SN Ia with rise time longer than 18.8 days,
during the first four days after the discovery. The blue early excess in
optical wavelength can be explained not only by interactions with a
non-degenerate companion or surrounding dense circumstellar matter but also
radiation powered by radioactive decays of $^{56}$Ni at the surface of the SN
ejecta. Given the growing evidence of the early-excess discoveries in normal
SNe Ia that have longer rise times than the average and a similarity in the
nature of the blue excess to a luminous SN Ia subclass, we infer that early
excess discovered in HSC17bmhk and other normal SNe Ia are most likely
attributed to radioactive $^{56}$Ni decay at the surface of the SN ejecta. In

of HSC17bmhk, early UV photometries or high-cadence blue-band surveys are
necessary.

policy by executing another policy that gathers samples of experience. While
the former policy (i.e. target policy) is rewarding but in-expressive (in most
cases, deterministic), doing well in the latter task, in contrast, requires an
expressive policy (i.e. behavior policy) that offers guided and effective
exploration. Contrary to most methods that make a trade-off between optimality
and expressiveness, disentangled frameworks explicitly decouple the two
objectives, which each is dealt with by a distinct separate policy. Although
being able to freely design and optimize the two policies with respect to their
own objectives, naively disentangling them can lead to inefficient learning or
stability issues. To mitigate this problem, our proposed method Analogous
Disentangled Actor-Critic (ADAC) designs analogous pairs of actors and critics.
Specifically, ADAC leverages a key property about Stein variational gradient
descent (SVGD) to constraint the expressive energy-based behavior policy with
respect to the target one for effective exploration. Additionally, an analogous
critic pair is introduced to incorporate intrinsic rewards in a principled
manner, with theoretical guarantees on the overall learning stability and
effectiveness. We empirically evaluate environment-reward-only ADAC on 14
continuous-control tasks and report the state-of-the-art on 10 of them. We
further demonstrate ADAC, when paired with intrinsic rewards, outperform
alternatives in exploration-challenging tasks.

significant improvement compared to the standard compression techniques,
especially applying super-resolution (up-sampling) to down-sampling based video
coding as post-processing. However, besides up-sampling degradation, the
various artifacts brought from compression make super-resolution problem more
difficult to solve. The straightforward solution is to integrate the artifact
removal techniques before super-resolution. However, some helpful features may
be removed together, degrading the super-resolution performance. To address
this problem, we proposed an end-to-end restoration-reconstruction deep neural
network (RR-DnCNN) using the degradation-aware technique, which entirely solves
degradation from compression and sub-sampling. Besides, we proved that the
compression degradation produced by Random Access configuration is rich enough
to cover other degradation types, such as Low Delay P and All Intra, for
training. Since the straightforward network RR-DnCNN with many layers as a
chain has poor learning capability suffering from the gradient vanishing
problem, we redesign the network architecture to let reconstruction leverages
the captured features from restoration using up-sampling skip connections. Our
novel architecture is called restoration-reconstruction u-shaped deep neural
network (RR-DnCNN v2.0). As a result, our RR-DnCNN v2.0 outperforms the
previous works and can attain 17.02% BD-rate reduction on UHD resolution for
all-intra anchored by the standard H.265/HEVC. The source code is available at

located at some nodes to all other nodes. This operation is often realized by
flooding, where the source nodes send a message containing the information to
all neighbors. Each node receiving the message for the first time forwards it
to all other neighbors. A stateless variant of flooding for synchronous systems
is called amnesiac flooding. In this case, every time a node receives a
message, it forwards it to those neighbors, from which it did not receive the
message in the current round. The algorithm is oblivious and therefore scales
very well. Stateless protocols are advantageous in high volume applications,
increasing performance by removing the load caused by retention of session
information and by providing crash tolerance. In this paper we analyze the
termination time of amnesiac flooding. We define the (k,c)-flooding problem,
which aims at finding a set $S$ of size $k$, such that amnesiac flooding when
started concurrently by all nodes of $S$ terminates in a minimal number of
rounds. We prove that this problem is NP-complete. We provide sharp upper and
lower bounds for the time complexity of amnesiac flooding and reveal a
discrepancy between bipartite and non-bipartite graphs. All results are based
on the insight, that for every non-bipartite graph there exists a bipartite
graph such that the execution of amnesiac flooding on both graphs is strongly
correlated. This construction considerably simplifies existing proofs for
amnesiac flooding and allows to analyze the (k,c)-flooding problem.

recognize instances of specific event types in text. Previous studies on the

label information, which conveys rich and useful linguistic knowledge for ED.
In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Edge-Enhanced Graph
Convolution Networks (EE-GCN), which simultaneously exploits syntactic
structure and typed dependency label information to perform ED. Specifically,
an edge-aware node update module is designed to generate expressive word
representations by aggregating syntactically-connected words through specific
dependency types. Furthermore, to fully explore clues hidden in dependency
edges, a node-aware edge update module is introduced, which refines the
relation representations with contextual information. These two modules are
complementary to each other and work in a mutual promotion way. We conduct
experiments on the widely used ACE2005 dataset and the results show significant
improvement over competitive baseline methods.

wireless systems. Our discussion is based on the decentralized parallel
stochastic gradient descent (D-PSGD), which is one of the state-of-the-art
algorithms for decentralized learning. The main contribution of this paper is
to raise a novel open question for decentralized learning on wireless systems:
there is a possibility that the density of a network topology significantly
influences the runtime performance of D-PSGD. In general, it is difficult to
guarantee delay-free communications without any communication deterioration in
real wireless network systems because of path loss and multi-path fading. These
factors significantly degrade the runtime performance of D-PSGD. To alleviate
such problems, we first analyze the runtime performance of D-PSGD by
considering real wireless systems. This analysis yields the key insights that
dense network topology (1) does not significantly gain the training accuracy of
D-PSGD compared to sparse one, and (2) strongly degrades the runtime
performance because this setting generally requires to utilize a low-rate
transmission. Based on these findings, we propose a novel communication
strategy, in which each node estimates optimal transmission rates such that
communication time during the D-PSGD optimization is minimized under the
constraint of network density, which is characterized by radio propagation
property. The proposed strategy enables to improve the runtime performance of
D-PSGD in wireless systems. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed
strategy is capable of enhancing the runtime performance of D-PSGD.

principled approaches which justify such methods? In this paper, we propose
such an approach using the Bayesian learning rule. The rule, when applied to
estimate a Bernoulli distribution over the binary weights, results in an
algorithm which justifies some of the algorithmic choices made by the previous

also enables uncertainty estimation for continual learning to avoid

  This paper introduces a new approach to abstractive snippet generation: We

paper we propose a genuinely multidimensional extension of the WENO procedure

schemes are obtained by a simple coupling of a high-order scheme and a monotone
scheme. The mixture is governed by a filter function $F$ and by a switching
parameter $\varepsilon^n=\varepsilon^n({\Delta t,\Delta x})>0$ which goes to 0
as $(\Delta t,\Delta x)$ is going to 0. The adaptivity is related to the
smoothness indicators and allows to tune automatically the switching parameter
$\varepsilon^n_j$ in time and space. Several numerical tests on critical
situations in 1D and 2D are presented and confirm the effectiveness of the

crystallography, can usually report only the most stable conformations, missing
minority states that could nonetheless be important for the recognition
mechanism. Computer simulations could be a valid complement to the experimental
approach. However, standard all-atom protein models in explicit solvent are
computationally too demanding to search thoroughly the conformational space of
multiple chains composed of several hundreds of amino acids. To reach this
goal, we resorted to a coarse-grained model in implicit solvent. The standard
problem with this kind of models is to find a realistic potential to describe
their interactions. We used coevolutionary information from cadherin
alignments, corrected by a statistical potential, to build an interaction
potential which is agnostic of the experimental conformations of the protein.
Using this model, we explored the conformational space of multi-chain systems

dimeric conformations that are sequence-specific and that can be useful to
rationalize the mechanism of recognition between cadherins.

asymptotic expansion, we investigate both structures that comprise a discrete
number of rods and the limit case of a sheet composed by infinitely many rods.
We apply our theoretical framework to investigate the stability of these

compute the critical buckling force for both the discrete and the continuous

studying the non-linear evolution of the bifurcation through finite elements

we propose layer-wise conditioning analysis, which explores the optimization
landscape with respect to each layer independently. Such an analysis is
theoretically supported under mild assumptions that approximately hold in
practice. Based on our analysis, we show that batch normalization (BN) can
stabilize the training, but sometimes result in the false impression of a local
minimum, which has detrimental effects on the learning. Besides, we
experimentally observe that BN can improve the layer-wise conditioning of the
optimization problem. Finally, we find that the last linear layer of a very
deep residual network displays ill-conditioned behavior. We solve this problem
by only adding one BN layer before the last linear layer, which achieves
improved performance over the original and pre-activation residual networks.

Boolean-valued function $f$ with finite domain, there is a distribution $\mu$
over the domain of $f$ such that computing $f$ to error $\epsilon$ against
inputs from $\mu$ is just as hard as computing $f$ to error $\epsilon$ on
worst-case inputs. Notably, however, the distribution $\mu$ depends on the
target error level $\epsilon$: the hard distribution which is tight for bounded
error might be trivial to solve to small bias, and the hard distribution which
is tight for a small bias level might be far from tight for bounded error
levels.
  In this work, we introduce a new type of minimax theorem which can provide a
hard distribution $\mu$ that works for all bias levels at once. We show that
this works for randomized query complexity, randomized communication
complexity, some randomized circuit models, quantum query and communication
complexities, approximate polynomial degree, and approximate logrank. We also
prove an improved version of Impagliazzo's hardcore lemma.
  Our proofs rely on two innovations over the classical approach of using Von
Neumann's minimax theorem or linear programming duality. First, we use Sion's
minimax theorem to prove a minimax theorem for ratios of bilinear functions
representing the cost and score of algorithms.
  Second, we introduce a new way to analyze low-bias randomized algorithms by
viewing them as ""forecasting algorithms"" evaluated by a proper scoring rule.
The expected score of the forecasting version of a randomized algorithm appears
to be a more fine-grained way of analyzing the bias of the algorithm. We show
that such expected scores have many elegant mathematical properties: for
example, they can be amplified linearly instead of quadratically. We anticipate
forecasting algorithms will find use in future work in which a fine-grained
analysis of small-bias algorithms is required.

unification to try to construct the missing subterms. Bull uses the syntax of
Berardi's Pure Type Systems to improve the compactness and the modularity of
the kernel. Abstract and concrete syntax are mostly aligned and similar to the
concrete syntax of Coq. Bull uses a higher-order unification algorithm for

the typing refinement. Binders are implemented using commonly-used de Bruijn

the calculation of two-point orientation correlation function using linear

crossover from quasi long-range order (QLRO) to short-range order (SRO). Such

Finite disorder slows the dynamics of +1/2 defect, and it leads to slower
growth dynamics. The two-point correlation functions for the density and

degree $d$ curves in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^2$ passing through $3d-1$ general
positioned points. Kontsevich proved it by considering curves that satisfy
extra conditions besides the given point conditions. These crucial extra
conditions are two line conditions and a condition called cross-ratio.
  This paper addresses the question whether there is a general Kontsevich's
formula which holds for more than one cross-ratio. Using tropical geometry, we
obtain such a recursive formula. For that we use a correspondence theorem
arXiv:1509.07453 that relates the algebro-geometric numbers in question to
tropical ones. It turns out that the general tropical Kontsevich's formula we
obtain is capable of not only computing the algebro-geometric numbers we are
looking for, but also of computing further tropical numbers for which there is
no correspondence theorem yet.
  We show that our recursive general Kontsevich's formula implies the original
Kontsevich's formula and that the initial values are the numbers Kontsevich's
fomula provides and purely combinatorial numbers, so-called cross-ratio
multiplicities.

services. To remain competitive, logistics and e-commerce companies are
exploring new modes as supplements to traditional home delivery, one of which
is the self-service parcel locker. This paper studies a parcel locker location
problem where a company plans to introduce the locker service by locating
locker facilities to attract customers. The objective is to maximize the
profit, accounting for the revenue and the cost of facilities. To estimate the
revenue, we use the threshold Luce model (TLM) to predict customers' likelihood
of using the locker service. We then propose a combinatorial optimization model
and develop exact solution methodologies that are practically implementable
according to our extensive computational experiments. In effect, our modeling
framework generalizes the traditional facility location problems based on the
binomial logit model (BNL) and the multinomial logit model (MNL), both of which
impose strong and strict assumptions on the customer's choice sets. That is,
they assume that the choice sets will either contain only one facility or all
facilities. In our numerical experiment, we demonstrate that using the BNL and
the MNL in the locker location problem could lead to, respectively, pessimistic
and optimistic revenue estimation. Consequently, the suggested location
decisions will be either conservative or aggressive. Our proposed model, by
contrast, can effectively relax these assumptions. Our results also reveal that
the aggressive decision due to the use of the MNL will incur an unnecessarily
high facility cost that cannot be compensated by the additional revenue,
leading to profit loss that can be significant in various scenarios. Finally,
we conduct sensitivity analysis on the input parameters and draw additional
implications.

sensitive to the phase content imposed in the underlying model. Considering
vanishing phase content leads to 30% lower estimates of the interfacial energy

an anisotropic lattice mismatch between the $\gamma$ matrix and the $\gamma''$

aims at finding the minimum time scale or the maximum dynamical speed for some
fixed targets. In a large number of studies in this field, the construction of
valid bounds for the evolution time is always the core mission, yet the physics
behind it and some fundamental questions like which states can really fulfill
the target, are ignored. Understanding the physics behind the bounds is at
least as important as constructing attainable bounds. Here we provide an
operational approach for the definition of the quantum speed limit, which
utilizes the set of states that can fulfill the target to define the speed
limit. Its performances in various scenarios have been investigated. For
time-independent Hamiltonians, it is inverse-proportional to the difference
between the highest and lowest energies. The fact that its attainability does
not require a zero ground-state energy suggests it can be used as an indicator
of quantum phase transitions. For time-dependent Hamiltonians, it is shown that
contrary to the results given by existing bounds, the true speed limit should
be independent of the time. Moreover, in the case of spontaneous emission, we
find a counterintuitive phenomenon that a lousy purity can benefit the
reduction of the quantum speed limit.

understanding of planet formation and evolution. We aim to determine the
spatial gradients of exoplanet occurrence in the Solar neighbourhood and in the
vicinity of open clusters. We combined Kepler and Gaia DR2 data for this
purpose, splitting the volume sampled by the Kepler mission into certain
spatial bins. We determined an uncorrected and bias-corrected exoplanet
frequency and metallicity for each bin. There is a clear drop in the
uncorrected exoplanet frequency with distance for F-type stars, a decline with
increasing distance along the Galactic longitude l=90 deg, and a drop with
height above the Galactic plane. We find that the metallicity behaviour cannot
be the reason for the drop of the exoplanet frequency around F stars with
increasing distance. We argue that the above-mentioned gradients of uncorrected
exoplanet frequency result from a single bias of undetected smaller planets
around fainter stars. When we correct for observational biases, most of these
gradients in exoplanet frequency become statistically insignificant. Only a
slight decline of the planet occurrence with distance for F stars remains
significant at the 3 sigma level. Apart from that, the spatial distribution of
exoplanets in the Kepler field of view is compatible with a homogeneous one. At
the same time, we do not find a significant change in the exoplanet frequency
with increasing distance from open clusters. As a byproduct, we identified six
exoplanet host star candidates that are members of open clusters. Four of them
are in the NGC 6811 (KIC 9655005, KIC 9533489, Kepler-66, Kepler-67) and two

that in the deep feature space, the head classes and the tail classes present
different distribution patterns. The head classes have a relatively large
spatial span, while the tail classes have significantly small spatial span, due
to the lack of intra-class diversity. This uneven distribution between head and

discriminative ability of the learned features. Intuitively, we seek to expand
the distribution of the tail classes by transferring from the head classes, so
as to alleviate the distortion of the feature space. To this end, we propose to
construct each feature into a ""feature cloud"". If a sample belongs to a tail
class, the corresponding feature cloud will have relatively large distribution
range, in compensation to its lack of diversity. It allows each tail sample to
push the samples from other classes far away, recovering the intra-class
diversity of tail classes. Extensive experimental evaluations on person

reconfigurability to the already powerful EM capabilities of metasurfaces opens
the door to novel cyber-physical systems with exciting applications in domains

however, comes with a non-trivial increase of the complexity of the
metasurfaces that will pose new reliability challenges stemming from the need
to integrate tuning, control, and communication resources to implement the
programmability. While metasurfaces will become prone to failures, little is
known about their tolerance to errors. To bridge this gap, this paper examines
the reliability problem in programmable metamaterials by proposing an error
model and a general methodology for error analysis. To derive the error model,
the causes and potential impact of faults are identified and discussed
qualitatively. The methodology is presented and exemplified for beam steering,
which constitutes a relevant case for programmable metasurfaces. Results show
that performance degradation depends on the type of error and its spatial
distribution and that, in beam steering, error rates over 20% can still be
considered acceptable.

as a probe for physics beyond the Standard Model and has been previously
measured at the Large Hadron Collider. However, to achieve sensitivity to small
deviations the couplings must be measured with precision beyond the capability
of a hadron collider. An electron-positron collider with center-of-mass
energies in the TeV range can precisely probe the QGC and test a variety of
models. The International Linear Collider is such a collider project with a
possible extension to $1\,$TeV.
  In this note the critical reconstruction aspects of a QGC analysis in the
vector boson scattering (VBS) channel of $e^+e^- \rightarrow \nu\bar{\nu}
q\bar{q} q\bar{q}$ at $\sqrt{s}=1\,$TeV are identified for the International
Large Detector. Generator level information from the event generator and
simulation is used to gain access to influence of separate reconstruction
effects. The separation of hadronic $WW$ and $ZZ$ decays by their invariant
mass is chosen to quantify the strength of the effects. In the current simple
reconstruction scheme the main obstacles are observed to be the removal of beam
backgrounds, the jet clustering, and semi-leptonic decays within jets. At high
center-of-mass energies of the VBS interaction jet clustering is found to no
longer be a limiting factor. Points of optimizations are laid out for these
aspects. In the case of semi-leptonic decays, proof-of-principal tests for
corrections are performed and found to be challenging.
  A full analysis which includes the extraction of limits on anomalous QGCs
remains open. Sensitivities similar to those achieved in generator level
studies with approximated detector effects are expected.

interpret cosmological data. The 'crisis' amounts to inconsistencies between
cosmological datasets arising when the FLRW curvature parameter $\Omega_{k0}$
is determined from the data rather than constrained to be zero a priori.
Moreover, the already substantial discrepancy between the Hubble parameter as
determined by Planck and local observations increases to the level of
$5\sigma$. While such inconsistencies might arise from systematic effects of
astrophysical origin affecting the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
power spectra at small angular scales, it is an option that the inconsistencies
are due to the failure of the FLRW assumption. In this paper we recall how the
FLRW curvature ansatz is expected to be violated for generic relativistic
spacetimes. We explain how the FLRW conservation equation for volume-averaged
spatial curvature is modified through structure formation, and we illustrate in
a simple framework how the curvature tension in a FLRW spacetime can be
resolved -- and is even expected to occur -- from the point of view of general
relativity. Requiring early-time convergence towards a Friedmannian model with
a spatial curvature parameter $\Omega_{k0}$ equal to that preferred from the

have missing values, which is ubiquitous in many real-world analyses. Missing
data greatly complicate causal inference procedures as they require an adapted
unconfoundedness hypothesis which can be difficult to justify in practice. We
circumvent this issue by considering latent confounders whose distribution is
learned through variational autoencoders adapted to missing values. They can be
used either as a pre-processing step prior to causal inference but we also
suggest to embed them in a multiple imputation strategy to take into account
the variability due to missing values. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methodology especially for non-linear models
compared to competitors.

The method is to filter the individual bands using a matched filter, based on
the point-spread function (PSF) and confusion noise, and then form the inverse
variance weighted sum of the individual bands, including weights determined by
a chosen spectral energy distribution. Peaks in this combined image are used to
estimate the source positions. The fluxes for each source are estimated from
the filtered single-band images, interpolated to the exact sub-pixel position.
We test the method by creating simulated maps in three bands with PSFs, pixel
sizes and Gaussian instrumental noise that match the 250, 350 and 500 micron
bands of Herschel-ATLAS. We use our method to detect sources and compare the
measured positions and fluxes to the input sources. The multi-band approach
allows reliable source detection a factor 1.2 to 3 lower in flux compared to
single-band source detection, depending on the source colours. The false
detection rate is reduced by a factor between 4 and 10, and the variance of the
source position errors is reduced by about a factor 1.5. We also consider the
effect of confusion noise and find that the appropriate matched filter gives a
further improvement in completeness and noise over the standard PSF filter
approach. Overall the two modifications give a factor of 1.5 to 3 improvement
in the depth of the recovered catalogues compared to a single-band PSF filter
approach.

graph $DG(V)$ of $V$ is the graph with vertex set $V$ in which two sites $v$

develop a compact routing scheme for $DG(V)$. The routing scheme preprocesses
$DG(V)$ by assigning a label $l(v)$ to every site $v$ in $V$. After that, for
any two sites $s$ and $t$, the scheme must be able to route a packet from $s$
to $t$ as follows: given the label of a current vertex $r$ (initially, $r=s$)
and the label of the target vertex $t$, the scheme determines a neighbor $r'$
of $r$. Then, the packet is forwarded to $r'$, and the process continues until
the packet reaches its desired target $t$. The resulting path between the
source $s$ and the target $t$ is called the routing path of $s$ and $t$. The
stretch of the routing scheme is the maximum ratio of the total Euclidean
length of the routing path and of the shortest path in $DG(V)$, between any two

training-sample orthogonality between the current training epoch and past
training epochs. Unlike the conventional SGD that updates the neural network
simply based upon current training samples, O-SGD discovers the correlation
between current training samples and historical training data, and then updates
the neural network with those uncorrelated components. The network updating
occurs only in those identified null subspaces. By such means, the neural
network can understand and memorize uncorrelated components between different
wireless channels, and thus is more robust to wireless channel variations. This
hypothesis is confirmed through our extensive computer simulations as well as
performance comparison with the conventional SGD approach.

phenotypic effects of mutations at different sites are represented by $L$
random vectors drawn from an isotropic Gaussian distribution. Recent work has
shown that the interplay between the genotypic and phenotypic levels gives rise
to a range of different landscape topographies that can be characterised by the
number of local fitness maxima. Extending our previous study of the mean number
of local maxima, here we focus on the distribution of the number of maxima when
the limit $L \to \infty$ is taken at finite $n$. We identify the typical scale
of the number of maxima for general $n$, and determine the full scaled

learning, aiming to maximize the within-class similarity $s_p$ and minimize the
between-class similarity $s_n$. We find a majority of loss functions, including
the triplet loss and the softmax plus cross-entropy loss, embed $s_n$ and $s_p$
into similarity pairs and seek to reduce $(s_n-s_p)$. Such an optimization
manner is inflexible, because the penalty strength on every single similarity
score is restricted to be equal. Our intuition is that if a similarity score
deviates far from the optimum, it should be emphasized. To this end, we simply
re-weight each similarity to highlight the less-optimized similarity scores. It
results in a Circle loss, which is named due to its circular decision boundary.
The Circle loss has a unified formula for two elemental deep feature learning
approaches, i.e. learning with class-level labels and pair-wise labels.
Analytically, we show that the Circle loss offers a more flexible optimization
approach towards a more definite convergence target, compared with the loss

popular clock synchronization protocol for packet-switched networks. Due to the
presence of random queuing delays in a packet-switched network, the joint
recovery of the clock skew and offset from the timestamps of the exchanged
synchronization packets can be treated as a statistical estimation problem. In
this paper, we address the problem of clock skew and offset estimation for IEEE
1588 in the presence of possible unknown asymmetries between the {\color{black}
deterministic path delays} of the forward master-to-slave path and reverse
slave-to-master path, which can result from incorrect modeling or
cyber-attacks. First, we develop lower bounds on the mean square estimation
error for a clock skew and offset estimation scheme for IEEE 1588 assuming the
availability of multiple master-slave communication paths and complete
knowledge of the probability density functions (pdf) describing the random
queuing delays. Approximating the pdf of the random queuing delays by a mixture
of Gaussian random variables, we then present a robust iterative clock skew and
offset estimation scheme that employs the space alternating generalized
expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm for learning all the unknown
parameters. Numerical results indicate that the developed robust scheme
exhibits a mean square estimation error close to the lower bounds.

which we call well-partitioned chordal graphs. Split graphs are graphs that
admit a partition of the vertex set into cliques that can be arranged in a star
structure, the leaves of which are of size one. Well-partitioned chordal graphs
are a generalization of this concept in the following two ways. First, the
cliques in the partition can be arranged in a tree structure, and second, each
clique is of arbitrary size. We provide a characterization of well-partitioned
chordal graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs, and give a polynomial-time
algorithm that given any graph, either finds an obstruction, or outputs a
partition of its vertex set that asserts that the graph is well-partitioned
chordal. We demonstrate the algorithmic use of this graph class by showing that
two variants of the problem of finding pairwise disjoint paths between k given
pairs of vertices is in FPT parameterized by k on well-partitioned chordal
graphs, while on chordal graphs, these problems are only known to be in XP.
From the other end, we observe that there are problems that are polynomial-time
solvable on split graphs, but become NP-complete on well-partitioned chordal
graphs.

generate saliency maps with incomplete object structures or unclear object
boundaries, due to the \emph{indirect} information propagation among distant
layers that makes such fusion structure less effective. In this work, we
propose a novel Cross-layer Feature Pyramid Network (CFPN), in which direct
cross-layer communication is enabled to improve the progressive fusion in
salient object detection. Specifically, the proposed network first aggregates
multi-scale features from different layers into feature maps that have access
to both the high- and low-level information. Then, it distributes the
aggregated features to all the involved layers to gain access to richer
context. In this way, the distributed features per layer own both semantics and
salient details from all other layers simultaneously, and suffer reduced loss
of important information. Extensive experimental results over six widely used
salient object detection benchmarks and with three popular backbones clearly
demonstrate that CFPN can accurately locate fairly complete salient regions and
effectively segment the object boundaries.

sequence by toroidal mirrors, giving two spatially separated interaction
regions. In the first region, the combination of a gas target with a

and offer polynomial-time algorithms for each. These include finding a minimal
separator from a restricted set of nodes, finding a minimal separator for two
given disjoint sets, and testing whether a given separator is minimal. To
address the problem of learning the structure of AMP CGs from data, we show
that the PC-like algorithm (Pena, 2012) is order-dependent, in the sense that
the output can depend on the order in which the variables are given. We propose
several modifications of the PC-like algorithm that remove part or all of this
order-dependence. We also extend the decomposition-based approach for learning
Bayesian networks (BNs) proposed by (Xie et al., 2006) to learn AMP CGs, which
include BNs as a special case, under the faithfulness assumption. We prove the
correctness of our extension using the minimal separator results. Using
standard benchmarks and synthetically generated models and data in our
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our decomposition-based
method, called LCD-AMP, in comparison with the (modified versions of) PC-like
algorithm. The LCD-AMP algorithm usually outperforms the PC-like algorithm, and
our modifications of the PC-like algorithm learn structures that are more
similar to the underlying ground truth graphs than the original PC-like
algorithm, especially in high-dimensional settings. In particular, we
empirically show that the results of both algorithms are more accurate and
stabler when the sample size is reasonably large and the underlying graph is

  This work presents 3D-MiniNet, a novel approach for LIDAR semantic
segmentation that combines 3D and 2D learning layers. It first learns a 2D
representation from the raw points through a novel projection which extracts
local and global information from the 3D data. This representation is fed to an
efficient 2D Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) that produces a 2D
semantic segmentation. These 2D semantic labels are re-projected back to the 3D

strategy relies on the projection learning module. Our detailed ablation study
shows how each component contributes to the final performance of 3D-MiniNet. We
validate our approach on well known public benchmarks (SemanticKITTI and

brightness. Such variations have been extensively studied for the Sun. Recent
planet-hunting space telescopes allowed measuring brightness variations in
hundred thousands of other stars. The new data posed the question of how
typical is the Sun as a variable star. Putting solar variability into the
stellar context suffers, however, from the bias of solar observations being
made from its near-equatorial plane, whereas stars are observed at all possible
inclinations. We model solar brightness variations at timescales from days to
years as they would be observed at different inclinations. In particular, we
consider the effect of the inclination on the power spectrum of solar
brightness variations. The variations are calculated in several passbands
routinely used for stellar measurements. We employ the Surface Flux Transport
Model (SFTM) to simulate the time-dependent spatial distribution of magnetic
features on both near- and far-sides of the Sun. This distribution is then used
to calculate solar brightness variations following the SATIRE (Spectral And
Total Irradiance REconstruction) approach. We have quantified the effect of the
inclination on solar brightness variability at timescales down to a day. Thus,
our results allow making solar brightness records directly comparable to those
obtained by the planet-hunting space telescopes. Furthermore, we decompose
solar brightness variations into the components originating from the solar
rotation and from the evolution of magnetic features.

Arrangement}. The model is defined by a bijection from agents with preferences
to vertices in a graph. The utility of an agent depends on the neighbors
assigned in the graph. More precisely, it is the sum over all neighbors of the
preferences that the agent has towards the agent assigned to the neighbor. We
first consider the price of stability and fairness for different classes of
preferences. In particular, we show that there is an instance such that the
price of fairness ({\sf PoF}) is unbounded in general. Moreover, we show an
upper bound $\tilde{d}(G)$ and an almost tight lower bound $\tilde{d}(G)-1/4$
of {\sf PoF}, where $\tilde{d}(G)$ is the average degree of an input graph.
Then we investigate the computational complexity of problems to find certain
``good'' seat arrangements, say \textsc{Maximum Welfare Arrangement},
\textsc{Maximin Utility Arrangement}, \textsc{Stable Arrangement}, and
\textsc{Envy-free Arrangement}. We give dichotomies of computational complexity
of four \textsc{Seat Arrangement} problems from the perspective of the maximum
order of connected components in an input graph. For the parameterized
complexity, \textsc{Maximum Welfare Arrangement} can be solved in time
$n^{O(\gamma)}$, while it cannot be solved in time $f(\gamma)^{o(\gamma)}$
under ETH, where $\gamma$ is the vertex cover number of an input graph.
Moreover, we show that \textsc{Maximin Utility Arrangement} and
\textsc{Envy-free Arrangement} are weakly NP-hard even on graphs of bounded
vertex cover number. Finally, we prove that determining whether a stable
arrangement can be obtained from a given arrangement by $k$ swaps is W[1]-hard
when parameterized by $k+\gamma$, whereas it can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$.

technique -- namely Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) employing random
starting points -- with state-of-the-art global solvers such as Baron and more
sophisticated local solvers such as Sequential Quadratic Programming and
Interior Point for the pooling problem. These problems can have many local
optima, and we present a small example that illustrates how this can occur.
  We demonstrate that SLP -- usually deemed obsolete since the arrival of fast
reliable QP solvers, Interior Point Methods and sophisticated global solvers --
is still the method of choice for an important class of pooling problem when
the criterion is the quality of the solution found within a given acceptable
time budget.
  In addition we introduce a new formulation, the qq-formulation, for the case
of fixed demands, that exclusively uses proportional variables. We compare the
performance of SLP and the global solver Baron on the qq-formulation and other
common formulations. While Baron with the qq-formulation generates weaker
bounds than with the other formulations tested, for both SLP and Baron the
qq-formulation finds the best solutions within a given time budget. The
qq-formulation can be strengthened by pq-like cuts in which case the same
bounds as for the pq-formulation are obtained. However the associated time
penalty due to the additional constraints results in poorer solution quality
within the time budget.

information in distributed systems. We consider a general concurrency language
model, where concurrent objects interact by asynchronous method calls and
futures. The aim is to prevent leakage of confidential information to low-level
viewers. The approach is based on the notion of a security wrapper, which
encloses an object or a component and controls its interactions with the
environment. A wrapper is a mechanism added by the run-time system to provide
protection of an insecure component according to some security policies. The
security policies of a wrapper are formalized based on a notion of security
levels. At run-time, future components will be wrapped upon need, while only
objects of unsafe classes will be wrapped, using static checking to limit the
number of unsafe classes and thereby reducing run-time overhead. We define an
operational semantics and prove that non-interference is satisfied. A service
provider may use wrappers to protect its services in an insecure environment,
and vice-versa: a system platform may use wrappers to protect itself from
insecure service providers.

heating, thereby strongly increasing the speed of a shock wave launched in the
laser-plasma interaction. In the caesium hydride target, collisions between the
two ion species heat the protons to ${\sim}100{-}1000{\rm\,eV}$ temperatures.
However, in contrast to previous work (A.E. Turrell etal., 2015 Nat. Commun. 6,

reflection. This difference is ascribed to distinct models used to treat
collisions in dense/cold plasmas. In the case of a copper target, ion
reflection can start as a self-amplifying process, bootstrapping itself.
Afterwards, collisions between the reflected and upstream ions heat these two
populations significantly. When increasing the pulse duration to $60{\rm\,fs}$,
the shock front more clearly decouples from the laser piston, and so can be
studied without direct interference from the laser. The shock wave formed at
early times exhibits properties typical of both hydrodynamic and electrostatic
shocks, including ion reflection. At late times, the shock is seen to evolve

generalize it to an unseen target domain. At present, the state-of-the-art
unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for subjective text classification

paper, we propose a novel method for domain adaptation of single-task text
classification problems based on a simple but effective idea of diversity-based
generalization that does not require unlabeled target data but still matches
the state-of-the-art in performance. Diversity plays the role of promoting the
model to better generalize and be indiscriminate towards domain shift by
forcing the model not to rely on same features for prediction. We apply this
concept on the most explainable component of neural networks, the attention
layer. To generate sufficient diversity, we create a multi-head attention model
and infuse a diversity constraint between the attention heads such that each
head will learn differently. We further expand upon our model by tri-training
and designing a procedure with an additional diversity constraint between the
attention heads of the tri-trained classifiers. Extensive evaluation using the
standard benchmark dataset of Amazon reviews and a newly constructed dataset of
Crisis events shows that our fully unsupervised method matches with the
competing baselines that uses unlabeled target data. Our results demonstrate
that machine learning architectures that ensure sufficient diversity can
generalize better; encouraging future research to design ubiquitously usable

fundamental inference tasks. As a result, there is a surge of interest in using
these models for making potentially important decisions in high-regret
applications. However, despite GNNs' impressive performance, it has been
observed that carefully crafted perturbations on graph structures (or nodes
attributes) lead them to make wrong predictions. Presence of these adversarial
examples raises serious security concerns. Most of the existing robust GNN
design/training methods are only applicable to white-box settings where model
parameters are known and gradient based methods can be used by performing
convex relaxation of the discrete graph domain. More importantly, these methods
are not efficient and scalable which make them infeasible in time sensitive
tasks and massive graph datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
general framework which leverages the greedy search algorithms and zeroth-order
methods to obtain robust GNNs in a generic and an efficient manner. On several

the late M dwarf system TRAPPIST-1 which has seven known transiting planets for
which Transit Timing Variation (TTV) measurements suggest that they are
terrestrial in nature, with a possible enrichment in volatiles. Among these
seven planets, TRAPPIST-1e seems to be the most promising candidate to have
habitable surface conditions, receiving ~66 % of the Earth's incident
radiation, and thus needing only modest greenhouse gas inventories to raise
surface temperatures to allow surface liquid water to exist. TRAPPIST-1e is
therefore one of the prime targets for JWST atmospheric characterization. In
this context, the modeling of its potential atmosphere is an essential step
prior to observation. Global Climate Models (GCMs) offer the most detailed way
to simulate planetary atmospheres. However, intrinsic differences exist between
GCMs which can lead to different climate prediction and thus observability of
gas and/or cloud features in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Such
differences should preferably be known prior to observations. In this paper we
present a protocol to inter-compare planetary GCMs. Four testing cases are
considered for TRAPPIST-1e but the methodology is applicable to other rocky
exoplanets in the Habitable Zone. The four test cases included two land planets
composed with a modern Earth and pure CO2 atmospheres, respectively, and two
aqua planets with the same atmospheric compositions. Currently, there are four
participating models (LMDG, ROCKE-3D, ExoCAM, UM), however this protocol is
intended to let other teams participate as well.

these models usually consist of hundreds of millions of parameters which brings
challenges for fine-tuning and online serving in real-life applications due to
latency and capacity constraints. In this work, we present a simple and
effective approach to compress large Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based
pre-trained models, termed as deep self-attention distillation. The small model
(student) is trained by deeply mimicking the self-attention module, which plays
a vital role in Transformer networks, of the large model (teacher).
Specifically, we propose distilling the self-attention module of the last
Transformer layer of the teacher, which is effective and flexible for the
student. Furthermore, we introduce the scaled dot-product between values in the
self-attention module as the new deep self-attention knowledge, in addition to
the attention distributions (i.e., the scaled dot-product of queries and keys)
that have been used in existing works. Moreover, we show that introducing a
teacher assistant (Mirzadeh et al., 2019) also helps the distillation of large
pre-trained Transformer models. Experimental results demonstrate that our
monolingual model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different parameter
size of student models. In particular, it retains more than 99% accuracy on
SQuAD 2.0 and several GLUE benchmark tasks using 50% of the Transformer

  methods and operating characteristics","4 figures, 1 table + additional material",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background. Designing trials to reduce treatment duration is important in
several therapeutic areas, including TB and antibiotics. We recently proposed a
new randomised trial design to overcome some of the limitations of standard
two-arm non-inferiority trials. This DURATIONS design involves randomising
patients to a number of duration arms, and modelling the so-called
duration-response curve. This article investigates the operating
characteristics (type-1 and type-2 errors) of different statistical methods of
drawing inference from the estimated curve. Methods. Our first estimation
target is the shortest duration non-inferior to the control (maximum) duration
within a specific risk difference margin. We compare different methods of
estimating this quantity, including using model confidence bands, the delta
method and bootstrap. We then explore the generalisability of results to
estimation targets which focus on absolute event rates, risk ratio and gradient
of the curve. Results. We show through simulations that, in most scenarios and
for most of the estimation targets, using the bootstrap to estimate variability
around the target duration leads to good results for DURATIONS
design-appropriate quantities analogous to power and type-1 error. Using model
confidence bands is not recommended, while the delta method leads to inflated
type-1 error in some scenarios, particularly when the optimal duration is very
close to one of the randomised durations. Conclusions. Using the bootstrap to
estimate the optimal duration in a DURATIONS design has good operating
characteristics in a wide range of scenarios, and can be used with confidence
by researchers wishing to design a DURATIONS trial to reduce treatment
duration. Uncertainty around several different targets can be estimated with
this bootstrap approach.

characteristic factor for minimal systems. For example, it is shown that for a
distal minimal system, its largest distal factor of order $d-1$ is its $d$-step
topological characteristic factor. In this paper, we generalize Glasner's work
to the product system of finitely many minimal systems and give its relative
version. To prove these results, we need to deal with $(X,T^m)$ for $m\in
{\mathbb {N}}$. We will study the structure theorem of $(X,T^m)$. We show that
though for a minimal system $(X,T)$ and $m\in {\mathbb {N}}$, $(X,T^m)$ may not
be minimal, but we still can have PI-tower for $(X,T^m)$ and in fact it looks
the same as the PI tower of $(X,T)$. We give some applications of the results
developed. For example, we show that if a minimal system has no nontrivial
independent pair along arithmetic progressions of order $d$, then up to a
canonically defined proximal extension, it is PI of order $d$; if a minimal
system $(X,T)$ has a nontrivial $d$-step topological characteristic factor,
then there exist ``many'' $\Delta$-transitive sets of order $d$.

sake of simplicity, a simple single-cell scenario is considered, where the
optimization of the BS and IRS phase shifts is solved by a low-complexity
trellis-based algorithm. Then, this algorithm is extended to a multi-cell
scenario, where the precoding operation in each BS is performed individually.
With the aid of stochastic optimization method, a low-overhead trellis-based
solution is proposed which has better performance than the first one. Finally,
we solve the optimization problem via the semi-definite relaxation (SDR)
scheme, to serve as a performance benchmark for the proposed algorithms.
Meanwhile, interference and complexity analysis is provided for the proposed

reduction of couplings, one can construct Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) which
are $N=1$ supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories that can be made all-order
finite. The prediction of the top quark mass well in advance of its
experimental discovery and the prediction of the light Higgs boson mass in the
range $\sim 121-126$ GeV much earlier than its experimental discovery are among
the celebrated successes of such models. Here, after a brief review of the
reduction of couplings method and the properties of the resulting finiteness in
supersymmetric theories, we analyse four phenomenologically favoured models: a
minimal version of the $N=1$ $SU(5)$, a finite $N=1$ $SU(5)$, a $N=1$ finite
$SU(3)\otimes SU(3)\otimes SU(3)$ model and a reduced version of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). A relevant update in the phenomenological
evaluation has been the improved light Higgs-boson mass prediction as provided
by the latest version of $\texttt{FeynHiggs}$. All four models predict
relatively heavy supersymmetric spectra that start just below or above the TeV
scale, consistent with the non-observation LHC results. Depending on the model,
the lighter regions of the spectra could be accessible at CLIC, while the
FCC-hh will be able to test large parts of predicted spectrum of each model.
The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is a neutralino, is
considered as a cold dark matter candidate and put to test using the latest

of parallel Yb3+ and Ru5+ moments lying in the ab-plane and adopting a A-type
AFM structure. Intriguingly, a small but remarkable change is observed in the
long-range ordering parameters at TN2 confirming the presence of a weak spin
reorientation (i.e. change in spin configuration) transition of Ru and Yb
moments, as well as a change in the magnetic moment evolution of the Yb3+ spins
at TN2. The temperature dependent behaviour of the Yb3+ and Ru5+ moments
suggests that the 4d-electrons of Ru5+ play a dominating role in stabilizing
the long range ordered magnetic ground state in the double perovskite Sr2YbRuO6
whereas only the Yb3+ moments show an arrest at TN2. The observed magnetic
structure and the presence of a ferromagnetic interaction between Ru- and Yb-
ions are explained with use of the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules.
Possible reasons for the presence of the second magnetic phase transition and
of a compensation point in the magnetization data are linked to competing
mechanisms of magnetic anisotropy.

an architecture based on 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN) in order to
model the geometric variations in manufacturing parameters and predict upcoming
events related to sub-optimal performance. We validate our framework on a
microelectronics use-case using the recently published PCB scans dataset where
we simulate changes on the shape and volume of glue deposited on an Liquid
Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrate before the attachment of integrated circuits

cost function during training and shows that the proposed method can be
efficiently used for defect prediction.

Greenspan-Howard spin-up process, the disruption of which modifies ring
formation and evolution. We show that, unless imprinted by boundary geometry,
convective rings can only form when the surface providing buoyancy forcing is a
free-slip surface, thereby explaining an apparent disagreement between

that the longest-lived rings occur for intermediate Prandtl numbers, with a
Rossby number dependence. Finally, we find that the constant evaporative

exactly similar kind of exercise for the derivation of the off-shell nilpotent

symmetry invariant restrictions on the superfields play very important and
decisive roles. To prove the sanctity of the above nilpotent symmetries, we
generalize our 4D ordinary theory (defined on the 4D flat Minkowskian spacetime
manifold) to its counterparts (4,1)-dimensional (anti-)chiral super
sub-manifolds of the (4,2)-dimensional supermanifold which is parameterized by
the superspace coordinates $Z^{M} = (x^{\mu},\theta, \bar{\theta} ) $ where

nature. One of the novel observations of our present endeavor is the derivation
of the Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions from the requirement of the
symmetry invariance of the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for
our theory within the framework of ACSA to BRST formalism. We also exploit the
standard techniques of ACSA to capture the off-shell nilpotency and absolute
anticommutativity of the conserved (anti-)BRST as well as the (anti-)co-BRST

Newton. It serves as a prototypical example of a chaotic system and has
numerous applications in astrophysics. Generically, the motion is
non-integrable and susceptible to disintegration, and for negative total energy
the decay outcome is a free body flying apart from a binary. Since Poincar\'e,
the problem is known to be chaotic and is believed to lack a general
deterministic solution. Instead, decades ago a statistical solution was marked
as a goal. Yet, despite considerable progress, all extant approaches display
two flaws. First, probability was equated with phase space volume, thereby
ignoring the fact that significant regions of phase space describe regular
motion, including post-decay motion. Secondly and relatedly, an adjustable
parameter, the strong interaction region, which is a sort of cutoff, was a
central ingredient of the theory.
  This paper introduces remedies and presents for the first time a statistical
prediction of decay rates, in addition to outcomes. Based on an analogy with a
particle moving within a leaky container, the statistical distribution is
presented in an exactly factorized form. One factor is the flux of phase-space
volume, rather than the volume itself, and it is given in a cutoff-independent
closed-form. The other factors are the chaotic absorptivity and the regularized
phase space volume. The situation is analogous to Kirchhoff's law of thermal
radiation, also known as greybody radiation. In addition, an equation system
for the time evolution of the statistical distribution is introduced; it
describes the decay rate statistics while accounting for sub-escape excursions.
Early numerical tests indicate a leap in accuracy.

Leximin solution---which is known to satisfy a strong form of approximate

does, however, satisfy a novel fairness notion that we call equitability up to

environmental science problems. To investigate mixing dynamics over time under
different scenarios, a high-fidelity, finite-element-based numerical model is
built to solve the fast, irreversible bimolecular reaction-diffusion equations
to simulate a range of reactive-mixing scenarios. A total of 2,315 simulations
are performed using different sets of model input parameters comprising various
spatial scales of vortex structures in the velocity field, time-scales
associated with velocity oscillations, the perturbation parameter for the
vortex-based velocity, anisotropic dispersion contrast, and molecular
diffusion. Outputs comprise concentration profiles of the reactants and
products. The inputs and outputs of these simulations are concatenated into
feature and label matrices, respectively, to train 20 different machine
learning (ML) emulators to approximate system behavior. The 20 ML emulators
based on linear methods, Bayesian methods, ensemble learning methods, and
multilayer perceptron (MLP), are compared to assess these models. The ML
emulators are specifically trained to classify the state of mixing and predict
three quantities of interest (QoIs) characterizing species production, decay,
and degree of mixing. Linear classifiers and regressors fail to reproduce the
QoIs; however, ensemble methods (classifiers and regressors) and the MLP
accurately classify the state of reactive mixing and the QoIs. Among ensemble
methods, random forest and decision-tree-based AdaBoost faithfully predict the
QoIs. At run time, trained ML emulators are $\approx10^5$ times faster than the
high-fidelity numerical simulations. Speed and accuracy of the ensemble and MLP
models facilitate uncertainty quantification, which usually requires 1,000s of
model run, to estimate the uncertainty bounds on the QoIs.

Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) spectral imaging to study the deterioration of a
Limoges enamel panel. Limoges enamels are formed of glass layers applied on a
metal substrate and are prone to glass disease. However, the level of
deterioration in Limoges enamels is generally difficult to assess visually. In
this study, SWIR was used to produce a hydration level map of the enamel, which
was coupled with virtual OCT cross-sections. The study shows a good correlation
between levels of hydration and structural damage over the enamel panel.
Hydration mapping allows visualisation of structural damage across the entire

  Computation 2020 (IEEE CEC)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) has gained a notable
momentum in the research community. MFO is known for its inherent capability to
efficiently address multiple optimization tasks at the same time, while
transferring information among such tasks to improve their convergence speed.
On the other hand, the quantum leap made by Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the
Machine Learning field has allowed facing Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems
of unprecedented complexity. Unfortunately, complex DQL models usually find it
difficult to converge to optimal policies due to the lack of exploration or
sparse rewards. In order to overcome these drawbacks, pre-trained models are
widely harnessed via Transfer Learning, extrapolating knowledge acquired in a
source task to the target task. Besides, meta-heuristic optimization has been
shown to reduce the lack of exploration of DQL models. This work proposes a MFO
framework capable of simultaneously evolving several DQL models towards solving
interrelated RL tasks. Specifically, our proposed framework blends together the
benefits of meta-heuristic optimization, Transfer Learning and DQL to automate
the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning of distributed RL agents.
A thorough experimentation is presented and discussed so as to assess the
performance of the framework, its comparison to the traditional methodology for
Transfer Learning in terms of convergence, speed and policy quality , and the
intertask relationships found and exploited over the search process.

first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is employed to represent time
series as low-rank block Hankel tensors (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors
are projected to compressed core tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At
the same time, the generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) is explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future
samples. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the
unique advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and
tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified
framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block Hankel
tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic correlations among
multiple TS, which thus can improve the forecasting results, especially for
multiple short time series. Experiments conducted on three public datasets and
two industrial datasets verify that the proposed BHT-ARIMA effectively improves
forecasting accuracy and reduces computational cost compared with the

  note: text overlap with arXiv:2002.11702",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The authors propose a seismic monitoring framework for instrumented buildings
that employs dissipated energy as a feature for damage detection and
localization. The proposed framework employs a nonlinear model-based state
observer, which combines a nonlinear finite element model of a building and
global acceleration measurements to estimate the time history of seismic
response at all degrees of freedom of the model. This includes displacements,
element forces, and plastic deformations in all structural members. The
estimated seismic response is then used to 1) estimate inter-story drifts and
determine the post-earthquake re-occupancy classification of the building based
on performance-based criteria, 2) compare the estimated demands with code-based
capacity and reconstruct element-by-element demand-to-capacity ratios and 3)
reconstruct element-level normalized energy dissipation and ductility. The
outcome of this process is employed for the performance-based monitoring,
damage detection, and localization in instrumented buildings. The proposed
framework is validated using data from the Van Nuys hotel testbed; a
seven-story reinforced concrete building instrumented by the California Strong
Motion Instrumentation Program (Station 24386). The nonlinear state observer of
the building is implemented using a distributed plasticity finite element model
and seismic response measurements during the 1992 Big Bear and 1994 Northridge
earthquakes. The performance and damage assessment results are compared with
the post-earthquake damage inspection reports and photographic records. The
results demonstrate the accuracy and capability of the proposed framework in
the context of a real instrumented building that experienced significant
localized structural damage.

defending against adversarial attacks. Notably, the state-of-the-art projected
gradient descent (PGD)-based training method has been shown to be universally
and reliably effective in defending against adversarial inputs. This robustness
approach uses PGD as a reliable and universal ""first-order adversary"". However,
the behaviour of such optimisation has not been studied in the light of a
fundamentally different class of attacks called backdoors. In this paper, we
study how to inject and defend against backdoor attacks for robust models
trained using PGD-based robust optimisation. We demonstrate that these models
are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Subsequently, we observe that backdoors
are reflected in the feature representation of such models. Then, this
observation is leveraged to detect such backdoor-infected models via a
detection technique called AEGIS. Specifically, given a robust Deep Neural
Network (DNN) that is trained using PGD-based first-order adversarial training
approach, AEGIS uses feature clustering to effectively detect whether such DNNs
are backdoor-infected or clean.
  In our evaluation of several visible and hidden backdoor triggers on major
classification tasks using CIFAR-10, MNIST and FMNIST datasets, AEGIS
effectively detects PGD-trained robust DNNs infected with backdoors. AEGIS
detects such backdoor-infected models with 91.6% accuracy (11 out of 12 tested
models), without any false positives. Furthermore, AEGIS detects the targeted
class in the backdoor-infected model with a reasonably low (11.1%) false
positive rate. Our investigation reveals that salient features of adversarially
robust DNNs could be promising to break the stealthy nature of backdoor
attacks.

However, deep models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in images that
are subtle but significantly change the model's prediction. In a white-box
attack, these perturbations are generally learned for deep models that operate
on RGB images and, hence, the perturbations are equally distributed in the RGB
color space. In this paper, we show that the adversarial perturbations prevail
in the Y-channel of the YCbCr space. Our finding is motivated from the fact
that the human vision and deep models are more responsive to shape and texture
rather than color. Based on our finding, we propose a defense against
adversarial images. Our defence, coined ResUpNet, removes perturbations only
from the Y-channel by exploiting ResNet features in an upsampling framework
without the need for a bottleneck. At the final stage, the untouched
CbCr-channels are combined with the refined Y-channel to restore the clean
image. Note that ResUpNet is model agnostic as it does not modify the DNN
structure. ResUpNet is trained end-to-end in Pytorch and the results are
compared to existing defence techniques in the input transformation category.
Our results show that our approach achieves the best balance between defence
against adversarial attacks such as FGSM, PGD and DDN and maintaining the
original accuracies of VGG-16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on clean images. We
perform another experiment to show that learning adversarial perturbations only

service building, this paper takes social media as an example to explore how to
use different engagement strategies that social media provides to engage more
users. This paper provides three major contributions to the library system. The
libraries can use the resultant engagement strategies to engage its users.
Additionally, the best-fit strategy can be inferred and designed based on the
preferences of users. Lastly, the preferences of users can be understood based
on data analysis of social media. Three such contributions put together to
fully address the proposed research question of how to use different engagement
strategies on social media to build participatory library services and better
engage more users visiting the library?

alignment systems. In this paper we present an approach that combines a neural
embedding model and logic-based modules to accurately divide an input ontology
matching task into smaller and more tractable matching (sub)tasks. We have
conducted a comprehensive evaluation using the datasets of the Ontology
Alignment Evaluation Initiative. The results are encouraging and suggest that
the proposed method is adequate in practice and can be integrated within the
workflow of systems unable to cope with very large ontologies.

scalar field is investigated in background of $(D+1)$-dimensional Milne
universe, assuming that the field obeys Robin boundary condition on the sphere.
The normalized mode functions are derived for the regions inside and outside
the sphere and different vacuum states are discussed. For the conformal vacuum,
the Hadamard function is decomposed into boundary-free and sphere-induced
contributions and an integral representation is obtained for the latter in both
the interior and exterior regions. As important local characteristics of the
vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and of
the energy-momentum tensor are investigated. It is shown that the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor has an off-diagonal component that corresponds to the
energy flux along the radial direction. Depending on the coefficient in Robin
boundary condition the sphere-induced contribution to the vacuum energy and the
energy flux can be either positive or negative. At late stages of the expansion
and for a massive field the decay of the sphere-induced VEVs, as functions of
time, is damping oscillatory. The geometry under consideration is conformally
related to that for a static spacetime with negative constant curvature space
and the sphere-induced contributions in the corresponding VEVs are compared.

launching is crucial for space applications. Hereby, we report a comparative
study of the advanced protection of silver mirror stacks for space telescopes
provided by SiO2 and Al2O3 coatings in conditions of accelerated aging by
sulfidation. The model silver stack samples were deposited by cathodic
magnetron sputtering on a reference silica substrate for optical applications
and a surface-pretreated SiC substrate. Accelerated aging was performed in dry
and more severe wet conditions. Optical micrographic observations, surface and
interface analysis by Time-of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
and reflectivity measurements were combined to comparatively study the effects
of degradation. The results show a lower kinetics of degradation by accelerated
aging of the stacks protected by the alumina coating in comparable test
conditions.
