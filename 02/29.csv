We then introduce a new formalism that allows us to self-consistently follow
the evolution of the dark-matter dress due to its gravitational interaction
with the binary. We show that the dephasing of the gravitational waveform

potentially detectable with the LISA space interferometer. The gravitational

threshold for reproduction, i.e., that does not directly associate genetic
differences between individuals with reproductive incompatibilities. In the
model individuals mate with the most similar partner in their pool of potential
mates, irrespective of how dissimilar it might be. We show that assortativity
alone can lead to the formation of clusters of genetically similar individuals.
The absence of a minimal genetic similarity for mating implies the constant
generation of hybrids and brings up the old problem of species definition.
Here, we define species based on clustering of genetically similar individuals

a pulsar offer a favourable configuration for repeating fast radio bursts
(FRB). The body in direct contact with the wind develops a trail formed of a
stationary Alfv\'en wave, called an \textit{Alfv\'en wing}. When an element of
wind crosses the Alfv\'en wing, it sees a rotation of the ambient magnetic
field that can cause radio-wave instabilities. In the observer's reference
frame, the waves are collimated in a very narrow range of directions, and they
have an extremely high intensity. A previous work, published in 2014, showed
that planets orbiting a pulsar can cause FRB when they pass in our line of
sight. We predicted periodic FRB. Since then random FRB repeaters have been
discovered. We present an upgrade of this theory where repeaters can be
explained by the interaction of smaller bodies with a pulsar wind. Considering
the properties of relativistic Alfv\'en wings attached to a body in the pulsar
wind, and taking thermal consideration into account we conduct a parametric
study. We find that FRBs, including the Lorimer burst (30 Jy), can be explained
by small size pulsar companions (1 to 10 km) between 0.03 and 1 AU from a
highly magnetized millisecond pulsar. Some sets of parameters are also
compatible with a magnetar. Our model is compatible with the high rotation
measure of FRB121102. The bunched timing of the FRBs is the consequence of a
moderate wind turbulence. As asteroid belt composed of less than 200 bodies
would suffice for the FRB occurrence rate measured with FRB121102. This model,
after the present upgrade, is compatible with the properties discovered since
its first publication in 2014, when repeating FRB were still unknown. It is
based on standard physics, and on common astrophysical objects that can be
found in any kind of galaxy. It requires $10^{10}$ times less power than
(common) isotropic-emission FRB models.

PE criterion. This criterion was introduced to support the identification of
the fireball type by empirically linking its orbital origin and composition
characteristics. Additionally, it is used as an indicator of the meteoroid
tensile strength and its ability to penetrate the atmosphere. However, the
level of classification accuracy of the PE criterion depends on the ability to
constrain the value of the input data, retrieved from the fireball observation,
required to derive the PE value. To overcome these uncertainties and achieve a
greater classification detail we propose a new formulation using scaling laws
and dimensionless variables that groups all the input variables into two
parameters that are directly obtained from the fireball observations. These two
parameters, ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}$, represent the drag and the mass loss
rates along the luminous part of the trajectory, respectively, and are linked
to the shape, strength, ablation efficiency, mineralogical nature of the
projectile, and duration of the fireball. Thus, the new formulation relies on a
physical basis. This work shows the mathematical equivalence between the PE
criterion and the logarithm of $2{\alpha}{\beta}$ under the same PE-criterion
assumptions. We demonstrate that $log(2{\alpha}{\beta})$ offers a more general
formulation which does not require any preliminary constraint on the meteor
flight scenario and discuss the suitability of the new formulation for
expanding the classification beyond fully disintegrating fireballs to larger
impactors including meteorite-dropping fireballs. The reliability of the new
formulation is validated using the Prairie Network meteor observations.

research investigating the interactions between electromagnetic fields and the

of the interaction is used, which allows for the system dynamics to be fully
described using a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the Wigner
function. This approach, however, is problematic in situations where the
Hamiltonian becomes time dependent as is the case for systems driven at
multiple frequencies simultaneously. This scenario is highly relevant as it
leads to dissipative preparation of mechanical states or backaction-evading
measurements of mechanical motion. The time-dependent dynamics can be solved
with Floquet techniques whose application is, nevertheless, not
straightforward. Here, we describe a general method for combining the Lyapunov
approach with Floquet techniques that enables us to transform the initial
time-dependent problem into a time-independent one, albeit in a larger Hilbert
space. We show how the lengthy process of applying the Floquet formalism to the
original equations of motion and deriving a Lyapunov equation from their
time-independent form can be simplified with the use of properly defined
Fourier components of the drift matrix of the original time-dependent system.
We then use our formalism to comprehensively analyse dissipative generation of
mechanical squeezing beyond the rotating wave approximation. Our method is
applicable to various problems with multitone driving schemes in cavity
optomechanics, electromechanics, and related disciplines.

fixed-point problems that we refer to as \emph{Anderson--Pulay acceleration}.
This family includes the DIIS technique and its variant sometimes called
commutator-DIIS, both introduced by Pulay in the 1980s to accelerate the
convergence of self-consistent field procedures in quantum chemistry, as well
as the related Anderson acceleration which dates back to the 1960s, and the
wealth of techniques they have inspired. Such methods aim at accelerating the
convergence of any fixed-point iteration method by combining several iterates
in order to generate the next one at each step. This extrapolation process is
characterised by its \emph{depth}, i.e. the number of previous iterates stored,
which is a crucial parameter for the efficiency of the method. It is generally
fixed to an empirical value. In the present work, we consider two
parameter-driven mechanisms to let the depth vary along the iterations. In the
first one, the depth grows until a certain nondegeneracy condition is no longer
satisfied; then the stored iterates (save for the last one) are discarded and
the method ""restarts"". In the second one, we adapt the depth continuously by
eliminating at each step some of the oldest, less relevant, iterates. In an
abstract and general setting, we prove under natural assumptions the local
convergence and acceleration of these two adaptive Anderson--Pulay methods, and
we show that one can theoretically achieve a superlinear convergence rate with
each of them. We then investigate their behaviour in quantum chemistry
calculations. These numerical experiments show that both adaptive variants
exhibit a faster convergence than a standard fixed-depth scheme, and require on

dielectric constant and exhibit three frequency independent transitions around
335, 250 and 185 K which are related to different structural transitions. All
these transitions occur at lower temperature as compared with pristine BTO,
however; remnant electric polarization (P) of BSTO is much higher than in BTO.
The value of P is around 5 microC/cm2 at room temperature and the maximum P
around 8 microC/cm2 is observed at tetragonal to orthorhombic and orthorhombic
to rhombohedral transitions. The electro-caloric effect shows the maximum

Our results demonstrate the enhancement in ferroelectric properties of BTO with

communication complexity with a simple direct-sum argument. Using this lower
bound on the communication complexity of $\mathsf{HPC}^2$, we retain the
streaming and query complexity lower bounds by (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna,

  Further, by giving reductions from $\mathsf{HPC}^2$, we prove new multi-pass
space lower bounds for graph problems in turnstile streams. In particular, we
show that any algorithm which computes the exact weight of the maximum weighted
matching in an $n$-vertex graph requires $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ space unless it
makes $\omega(\log n)$ passes over the turnstile stream, and that any algorithm
which computes the minimum $s\text{-}t$ distance in an $n$-vertex graph
requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ space unless it makes $n^{\Omega(1)}$ passes over the
turnstile stream. Our reductions can be modified to use $\mathsf{HPC}^4$ as
well.

of full phonon spectrum to calculate superconducting transition temperature,
T$_c$. However, there is no experimental technique which can measure phonon
spectrum in highly-compressed near-room-temperature (NRT) superconductors to
date. In this paper we propose to advance McMillan's approach (1968 Phys Rev
167 331) which utilizes the Debye temperature, T$_{\theta}$ (an integrated
parameter of full phonon spectrum), that we deduced by the fit of
experimentally measured temperature-dependent resistance data, R(T), to
Bloch-Gruneisen equation for highly-compressed black phosphorous, boron, GeAs,
SiH$_4$, H$_x$S, D$_y$S, LaH$_x$ and LaD$_y$. By utilizing relations between
T$_c$, Debye temperature and electron-phonon coupling strength constant,
$\lambda_{e-ph}$ it is possible to affirm/disprove the electron-phonon
mechanism in given superconductors. We show that computed $\lambda_{e-ph}$ for
highly-compressed black phosphorous, boron, GeAs, SiH$_4$ and for one sample of
LaH$_{10}$ are in a good agreement with $\lambda_{e-ph}$ values deduced from
experimental data. It is also found remarkable constancy of Debye temperature
in H$_3$S at different ageing stages. We also show that if phonon spectra of
two isotopic counterparts have similar shape then within electron-phonon
phenomenology these materials should obey the relation of
T$_{c,1}$/T$_{c,2}$=T$_{\theta,1}$/T$_{\theta,2}$ (where 1 and 2 designate
isotopes). We report that these ratios for H$_3$S-D$_3$S predicted by
electron-phonon phenomenology are largely different from ratios deduced from
experiment. This alludes that NRT superconductivity in H3S-D3S system is
originated from more than one mechanism, where the electron-phonon coupling
lifts T$_c$ in H$_3$S vs D$_3$S, but primary origin for NRT background of in
both H$_3$S and D$_3$S remains to be discovered.

calibrate classification models. However, there is relatively little work on
calibrating regression models. We present a method for calibrating regression
models based on a novel quantile regularizer defined as the cumulative KL
divergence between two CDFs. Unlike most of the existing approaches for
calibrating regression models, which are based on post-hoc processing of the
model's output and require an additional dataset, our method is trainable in an
end-to-end fashion without requiring an additional dataset. The proposed
regularizer can be used with any training objective for regression. We also
show that post-hoc calibration methods like Isotonic Calibration sometimes
compound miscalibration whereas our method provides consistently better
calibrations. We provide empirical results demonstrating that the proposed
quantile regularizer significantly improves calibration for regression models

translations and provide a meaningful training signal to each other, existing
approaches rely on either a separate machine translation system to warm up the
iterative procedure, or some form of pre-training to initialize the weights of
the model. In this paper, we analyze the role that such initialization plays in
iterative back-translation. Is the behavior of the final system heavily
dependent on it? Or does iterative back-translation converge to a similar
solution given any reasonable initialization? Through a series of empirical
experiments over a diverse set of warmup systems, we show that, although the
quality of the initial system does affect final performance, its effect is
relatively small, as iterative back-translation has a strong tendency to
convergence to a similar solution. As such, the margin of improvement left for
the initialization method is narrow, suggesting that future research should
focus more on improving the iterative mechanism itself.

compare the MIR color distribution in our sample to that in the general
population of local AGN, in the population of evolved FR\,II radio galaxies,
and also in the population of radio galaxies with recurrent jet activity. We
conclude that the triggering of radio jets in AGN does not differentiate
between elliptical hosts with substantially different fractions of young stars;
instead there is a relationship between the jet duty cycle and the ongoing star
formation. The distribution of the sub-sample of our sources with $z<0.4$ on
the low-resolution MIR vs. absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity plane is
consistent with the distribution of a sample of local AGN. Finally, we comment
on the star formation rates of the two $\gamma$-ray detected sources in our
sample, 1146+596 \& 1718--649.

nature, i.e. differ only slightly from related problems with known solutions.
Prominent among these is the eigenvalue perturbation problem, wherein one seeks
the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix with small off-diagonal elements.
Here we introduce a novel iterative algorithm to compute these eigenpairs based
on fixed-point iteration for an algebraic equation in complex projective space.
We show from explicit and numerical examples that our algorithm outperforms the
usual Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger expansion on three counts. First, since it is not
defined as a power series, its domain of convergence is not a priori confined
to a disk in the complex plane; we find that it indeed usually extends beyond
the standard perturbative radius of convergence. Second, it converges at a
faster rate than the Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger expansion, i.e. fewer iterations
are required to reach a given precision. Third, the (time- and space-)
algorithmic complexity of each iteration does not increase with the order of
the approximation, allowing for higher precision computations. Because this
complexity is merely that of matrix multiplication, our dynamical scheme also
scales better with the size of the matrix than general-purpose eigenvalue
routines such as the shifted QR or divide-and-conquer algorithms. Whether they
are dense, sparse, symmetric or unsymmetric, we confirm that dynamical
diagonalization quickly outpaces LAPACK drivers as the size of matrices grows;
for the computation of just the dominant eigenvector, our method converges
order of magnitudes faster than the Arnoldi algorithm implemented in ARPACK.

that the biological system under study remains intact and functional until

protein are maintained. However, endogenous tagging of genes with AID can
result in chronic, auxin-independent proteasome-mediated degradation. The
additional expression of the ARF-PB1 domain in the re-engineered ARF-AID system

specific illuminant mappings. While high accuracy can be achieved on camera
specific data, these models depend on camera spectral sensitivity and typically
exhibit poor generalisation to new devices. Additionally, regression methods
produce point estimates that do not explicitly account for potential
ambiguities among plausible illuminant solutions, due to the ill-posed nature
of the problem. We propose a Bayesian framework that naturally handles color
constancy ambiguity via a multi-hypothesis strategy. Firstly, we select a set
of candidate scene illuminants in a data-driven fashion and apply them to a
target image to generate of set of corrected images. Secondly, we estimate, for
each corrected image, the likelihood of the light source being achromatic using
a camera-agnostic CNN. Finally, our method explicitly learns a final
illumination estimate from the generated posterior probability distribution.
Our likelihood estimator learns to answer a camera-agnostic question and thus
enables effective multi-camera training by disentangling illuminant estimation
from the supervised learning task. We extensively evaluate our proposed
approach and additionally set a benchmark for novel sensor generalisation
without re-training. Our method provides state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple
public datasets (up to 11% median angular error improvement) while maintaining
real-time execution.

What are the fundamental limits to these approaches? This question is well
understood from an optimization viewpoint when the underlying objective is
convex. Work in this area characterizes the gap to global optimality as a
function of the number of iterations. However, these results have only indirect
implications in terms of the gap to statistical optimality.
  Here we consider two families of high-dimensional estimation problems:
high-dimensional regression and low-rank matrix estimation, and introduce a

underlying parameters. This class of algorithms is broad enough to include
classical first order optimization (for convex and non-convex objectives), but
also other types of algorithms. Under a random design assumption, we derive
lower bounds on the estimation error that hold in the high-dimensional
asymptotics in which both the number of observations and the number of

investigate this question, we construct a quasiparticle vertex from the
diverging irreducible vertex functions. This vertex describes the scattering
between quasiparticles and quasiholes in a Fermi liquid. We show that the
quasparticle vertex \textit{does not} diverge in the charge channel, wherein
the irreducible vertex \textit{does} diverge; and we show that the

the Fermi liquid theory breaks down. Both Hubbard and Anderson lattices are
investigated. In general, our results support that the divergences of the

of inverting a matrix (the local charge susceptibility) which accumulates
increasingly negative diagonal elements as the Hubbard interaction suppresses
charge fluctuations. Indeed, we find that the first symmetric divergences of

Interestingly, this scenario may also be able to accommodate two other

an automatic framework to enable perturbation analysis on any neural network

on general computational graphs. The flexibility, differentiability and ease of
use of our framework allow us to obtain state-of-the-art results on LiRPA based
certified defense on fairly complicated networks like DenseNet, ResNeXt and
Transformer that are not supported by prior works. Our framework also enables
loss fusion, a technique that significantly reduces the computational
complexity of LiRPA for certified defense. For the first time, we demonstrate
LiRPA based certified defense on Tiny ImageNet and Downscaled ImageNet where
previous approaches cannot scale to due to the relatively large number of
classes. Our work also yields an open-source library for the community to apply
LiRPA to areas beyond certified defense without much LiRPA expertise, e.g., we
create a neural network with a probably flat optimization landscape by applying
LiRPA to network parameters. Our opensource library is available at

very rare systems, in particular at low and intermediate redshifts. Their
origin as well as their number density across cosmic time are still under
scrutiny, especially because of the paucity of spectroscopically confirmed
samples. We have started a systematic census of UCMG candidates within the ESO
Kilo Degree Survey, together with a large spectroscopic follow-up campaign to
build the largest possible sample of confirmed UCMGs. This is the third paper
of the series and the second based on the spectroscopic follow-up program.
Here, we present photometrical and structural parameters of 33 new candidates
at redshifts $0.15 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$ and confirm 19 of them as UCMGs,
based on their nominal spectroscopically inferred $M_{*}$ and $R_{e}$. This
corresponds to a success rate of $\sim 58\%$, nicely consistent with our
previous findings. The addition of these 19 newly confirmed objects, allows us
to fully assess the systematics on the system selection, and finally reduce the
number density uncertainties. Moreover, putting together the results from our
current and past observational campaigns and some literature data, we build the
largest sample of UCMGs ever collected, comprising 92 spectroscopically
confirmed objects at $0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$. This number raises to 116,
allowing for a $3\sigma$ tolerance on the $M_{*}$ and $R_{e}$ thresholds for
the UCMG definition. For all these galaxies we have estimated the velocity
dispersion values at the effective radii which have been used to derive a
preliminary mass-velocity dispersion correlation.

we propose a scheme of supervised quantum machine learning which predicts the
excited-state properties of molecules only from their ground state wavefunction
resulting in reducing the computational cost for calculating the excited
states. Our model is comprised of a quantum reservoir and a classical machine
learning unit which processes the measurement results of single-qubit Pauli
operators with the output state from the reservoir. The quantum reservoir
effectively transforms the single-qubit operators into complicated multi-qubit
ones which contain essential information of the system, so that the classical
machine learning unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for
quantum computers is saved by training only the classical machine learning
unit, and the whole model requires modest resources of quantum hardware that
may be implemented in current experiments. We illustrate the predictive ability
of our model by numerical simulations for small molecules with and without
noise inevitable in near-term quantum computers. The results show that our
scheme well reproduces the first and second excitation energies as well as the
transition dipole moment between the ground states and excited states only from
the ground state as an input. We expect our contribution will enhance the

unperturbed total matter density. We show that CIPs contribute to the galaxy
overdensity at linear order, and if they are close to scale-invariant, their
effects are nearly perfectly degenerate with the local PNG parameter $f_{\rm
nl}$ if they correlate with the adiabatic perturbations. This degeneracy can
however be broken by analyzing multiple galaxy samples with different bias
parameters, or by taking CMB priors on $f_{\rm nl}$ into account. Parametrizing
the amplitude of the CIP power spectrum as $P_{\sigma\sigma} =
A^2P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}$ (where $P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}$ is the
adiabatic power spectrum) we find, for a number of fiducial galaxy samples in a
simplified forecast setup, that constraints on $A$, relative to those on
$f_{\rm nl}$, of order $\sigma_{A}/\sigma_{f_{\rm nl}} \approx 1-2$ are
achievable for CIPs correlated with adiabatic perturbations, and
$\sigma_{A}/\sigma_{f_{\rm nl}} \approx 5$ for the uncorrelated case. These
values are independent of survey volume, and suggest that current galaxy data
are already able to improve significantly on the tightest existing constraints

procedure for which success has been defined, but the specific actions needed
to achieve it have not. We apply the so-called ""black box"" method of RL to what
has been referred as the ""black art"" of simulated annealing (SA), demonstrating
that an RL agent based on proximal policy optimization can, through experience
alone, arrive at a temperature schedule that surpasses the performance of
standard heuristic temperature schedules for two classes of Hamiltonians. When
the system is initialized at a cool temperature, the RL agent learns to heat
the system to ""melt"" it, and then slowly cool it in an effort to anneal to the
ground state; if the system is initialized at a high temperature, the algorithm
immediately cools the system. We investigate the performance of our RL-driven
SA agent in generalizing to all Hamiltonians of a specific class; when trained
on random Hamiltonians of nearest-neighbour spin glasses, the RL agent is able
to control the SA process for other Hamiltonians, reaching the ground state
with a higher probability than a simple linear annealing schedule. Furthermore,
the scaling performance (with respect to system size) of the RL approach is far
more favourable, achieving a performance improvement of one order of magnitude

Way. They are the product of dynamical instabilities occurring in stellar bars,
which cause the latter to buckle and thicken vertically. Recent studies have
found nearby galaxies that harbour two such features arising at different
radial scales, in a nested configuration. In this paper we explore the
formation of such double peanuts, using a collisionless N-body simulation of a
pure disc evolving in isolation within a live dark matter halo, which we
analyse in a completely analogous way to observations of real galaxies. In the
simulation we find a stable double configuration consisting of two X/peanut
structures associated to the same galactic bar - rotating with the same pattern
speed - but with different morphology, formation time, and evolution. The
inner, conventional peanut-shaped structure forms early via the buckling of the
bar, and experiences little evolution once it stabilises. This feature is
consistent in terms of size, strength and morphology, with peanut structures
observed in nearby galaxies. The outer structure, however, displays a strong X,
or ""bow-tie"", morphology. It forms just after the inner peanut, and gradually
extends in time (within 1 to 1.5 Gyr) to almost the end of the bar, a radial
scale where ansae occur. We conclude that, although both structures form, and
are dynamically coupled to, the same bar, they are supported by inherently
different mechanisms.

The polarization maps are generated with the radiative transfer code POLARIS,
including self-consistently calculated efficiencies for radiative torque
alignment. The MCs are formed in two sets of 3D MHD simulations: in (i)
colliding flows (CF), and (ii) the SILCC-Zoom simulations. In 3D, for the CF
simulations with an initial field strength below $\sim$5 $\mu$G, $\bf{B}$ is
oriented parallel or randomly with respect to the $n$-structures. For CF runs
with stronger initial fields and all SILCC-Zoom simulations, which have an
initial field strength of 3 $\mu$G, a flip from parallel to perpendicular
orientation occurs at high densities of $n_\text{trans}$ $\simeq$ 10$^2$ -
10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$. We suggest that this flip happens if the MC's mass-to-flux
ratio, $\mu$, is close to or below the critical value of 1. This corresponds to
a field strength around 3 - 5 $\mu$G. In 2D, we use the Projected Rayleigh
Statistics (PRS) to study the orientation of $\bf{B}$. If present, the flip in
orientation occurs at $N_\text{trans}$ $\simeq$ 10$^{21 - 21.5}$ cm$^{-2}$,
similar to the observed transition value from sub- to supercritical magnetic
fields in the ISM. However, projection effects can reduce the power of the PRS
method: Depending on the MC or LOS, the projected maps of the SILCC-Zoom
simulations do not always show the flip, although expected from the 3D
morphology. Such projection effects can explain the variety of recently
observed field configurations, in particular within a single MC. Finally, we do
not find a correlation between the observed orientation of $\bf{B}$ and the
$N$-PDF.

dynamics of material plunging through the event horizon represents a unique
test of general relativity in the strong field regime. X-ray reverberation off
of the accretion disc and material in the plunging region is modelled using
general relativistic ray tracing simulations. X-ray reverberation from the
plunging region has a minimal effect on the time-averaged X-ray spectrum and
the overall lag-energy spectrum, but is manifested in the lag in the highest
frequency Fourier components, above 0.01 c^3 (GM)^-1 (scaled for the mass of
the black hole) in the 2-4keV energy band for a non-spinning black hole or the
1-2keV energy band for a maximally spinning black hole. The plunging region is
distinguished from disc emission not just by the energy shifts characteristic
of plunging orbits, but by the rapid increase in ionisation of material through
the plunging region. Detection requires measurement of time lags to an accuracy
of 20 per cent at these frequencies. Improving accuracy to 12 per cent will
enable constraints to be placed on the dynamics of material in the plunging

prospects for exterior extant rocky asteroids, boulders, cobbles and pebbles to
radiatively drift inward past the planet due to the relatively high luminosity
(0.1 L_Sun) of this particularly young (13 Myr) white dwarf. Pebbles and
cobbles drift too slowly from Poynting-Robertson drag to bypass the planet, but
boulders and asteroids are subject to the much stronger Yarkovsky effect. In
this paper, I (i) place lower limits on the timescales for these objects to
reach the planet's orbit, (ii) establish 3 m as the approximate limiting radius
above which a boulder drifts too slowly to avoid colliding with the planet, and
(iii) compute bounds on the fraction of boulders which succeed in traversing
mean motion resonances and the planet's Hill sphere to eventually pollute the
star. Overall, I find that the planet acts as a barrier against rather than a
facilitator for radiatively-driven rocky pollution, suggesting that future
rocky pollutants would most likely originate from distant scattering events.

these boundaries produce in the flow. We find that the fixed-flux boundary
produces more extreme temperature events than the fixed-temperature boundary.
However, these near-boundary asymmetries do not measurably break the symmetry
in the convective interior. We briefly explore rotating RBC to demonstrate that
our findings with respect to thermal relaxation carry over to this more complex
case, and to show the power of TT-to-FT initial conditions.

and oxygen, or oxygen and neon (with a few percent carbon) at higher initial
stellar masses. These stellar cores are enveloped by a shell of helium which in
turn is usually surrounded by a layer of hydrogen, generally prohibiting direct
observation of the interior composition. However, carbon is observed at the
surface of a sizeable fraction of white dwarfs, sometimes with traces of
oxygen, and it is thought to be dredged-up from the core by a deep helium
convection zone. In these objects only traces of hydrogen are found as large
masses of hydrogen are predicted to inhibit hydrogen/helium convective mixing
within the envelope. We report the identification of WDJ055134.612+413531.09,
an ultra-massive (1.14 $M_\odot$) white dwarf with a unique hydrogen/carbon
mixed atmosphere (C/H=0.15 in number ratio). Our analysis of the envelope and
interior indicates that the total hydrogen and helium mass fractions must be
several orders of magnitude lower than predictions of single star evolution:
less than $10^{-9.5}$ and $10^{-7.0}$, respectively. Due to the fast kinematics
($129\pm5$ km/s relative to the local standard of rest), large mass, and
peculiar envelope composition, we argue that WDJ0551+4135 is consistent with
formation from the merger of two white dwarfs in a tight binary system.

However, in-depth analysis of the compliance data collected via ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) were not analyzed. Compliance to the treatment
regimens may represent a confounder as varenicline and cNRT are more intense
treatments and would likely have larger treatment effects if all subjects
complied. In order to estimate the causal compliance effect, we view the
counterfactual, the outcome that would have been observed if the subject was
allocated to the treatment counter to the fact, as a missing data problem and
proceed to impute the counterfactual. Our contribution to the methodological

application to the WSHS2 data suggest that the treatment effect of nicotine

the level of vacancies conditional on unemployment. Using a standard model, we
show that three factors can shift the Beveridge curve: reduced-form matching
efficiency, changes in the job separation rate, and out-of-steady-state
dynamics. We find that the shift in the Beveridge curve during and after the
Great Recession was due to all three factors, and each factor taken separately
had a large effect. Comparing the pre-2010 period to the post-2010 period, a
fall in matching efficiency and out-of-steady-state dynamics both pushed the
curve upward, while the changes in the separation rate pushed the curve
downward. The net effect was the observed upward shift in vacancies given
unemployment. In previous recessions changes in matching efficiency were
relatively unimportant, while dynamics and the separation rate had more impact.
Thus, the unusual feature of the Great Recession was the deterioration in
matching efficiency, while separations and dynamics have played significant,
partially offsetting roles in most downturns. The importance of these latter
two margins contrasts with much of the literature, which abstracts from one or
both of them. We show that these factors affect the slope of the empirical
Beveridge curve, an important quantity in recent welfare analyses estimating

virtual ultrasonically sculpted gradient-index (GRIN) optical waveguides can be

externally focused beam of light through the medium beyond the focal distance
of an external physical lens to extend the penetration depth without
compromising the spot size. Moreover, the spot size can be tuned by
reconfiguring the virtual waveguide. We show that these virtual GRIN waveguides
can be formed in transparent as well as turbid media to enhance the confinement
and contrast ratio of the focused beam of light at the target location. This
method can be extended to realize complex optical systems of external physical
lenses and in situ virtual waveguides to extend the reach and flexibility of
optical methods.

applicability in domains such as healthcare, travel and finance. Given the
recent trend to outsource databases and query evaluation, and due to the
proprietary and sometimes highly sensitivity nature of the data (e.g., in
healthcare), it is essential to evaluate skylines on encrypted datasets.
Several research efforts acknowledged the importance of secure skyline
computation, but existing solutions suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: (i) they only provide ad-hoc security; (ii) they are
prohibitively expensive; or (iii) they rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as
the presence of multiple non-colluding parties in the protocol.
  Inspired from solutions for secure nearest-neighbors (NN) computation, we
conjecture that the most secure and efficient way to compute skylines is
through result materialization. However, this approach is significantly more
challenging for skylines than for NN queries. We exhaustively study and provide
algorithms for pre-computation of skyline results, and we perform an in-depth
theoretical analysis of this process. We show that pre-computing results while
minimizing storage overhead is NP-hard, and we provide dynamic programming and
greedy heuristics that solve the problem more efficiently, while maintaining
storage at reasonable levels. Our algorithms are novel and applicable to
plain-text skyline computation, but we focus on the encrypted setting where
materialization reduces the cost of skyline computation from hours to seconds.
Extensive experiments show that we clearly outperform existing work in terms of
performance, and our security analysis proves that we obtain a smaller (and

human mesh from a single monocular image. Unlike previous approaches that use a
parametric human model like skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL), and
attempt to regress the model parameters, nonparametric approaches relax the
heavy reliance on the parametric space. However, existing nonparametric methods
require ground truth meshes as their regression target for each vertex, and
obtaining ground truth mesh labels is very expensive. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach to learn human mesh reconstruction without any ground truth
meshes. This is made possible by introducing two new terms into the loss
function of a graph convolutional neural network (Graph CNN). The first term is
the Laplacian prior that acts as a regularizer on the reconstructed mesh. The
second term is the part segmentation loss that forces the projected region of
the reconstructed mesh to match the part segmentation. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that without using 3D ground truth meshes, the
proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches that

concerned with the importance of nodes in relation to community structure.
Measures are a function of a network's structure and a given partition.
Previous approaches extend classical centrality measures to account for
community structure with little connection to community detection theory. In
contrast, we propose cluster-quality vitality measures, i.e., modularity
vitality, a community-aware measure which is well-grounded in both centrality
and community detection theory. Modularity vitality quantifies positive and
negative contributions to community structure, which indicate a node's role as
a community bridge or hub. We derive a computationally efficient method of
calculating modularity vitality for all nodes in O(M + NC) time, where C is the
number of communities. We systematically fragment networks by removing central
nodes, and find that modularity vitality consistently outperforms existing
community-aware centrality measures. Modularity vitality is over 8 times more
effective than the next-best method on a million-node infrastructure network.
This result does not generalize to social media communication networks, which
exhibit extreme robustness to all community-aware centrality attacks. This
robustness suggests that user-based interventions to mitigate misinformation
diffusion will be ineffective. Finally, we demonstrate that modularity vitality
provides a new approach to community-deception.

profile of the large-scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard
convection. Temperature measurements are broken down into Fourier moments as a
function of $\theta-\theta_0$, where $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle in a
horizontal plane at mid-height, and $\theta_0$ is the LSC orientation. The
oscillation structure is dominated by a 3rd order sine moment and 3rd order
cosine moment in a cubic cell. In contrast, these moments are not found to
oscillate in a cylindrical cell. This geometry-dependent behavior can be
explained by a model that assumes that the heat transported by the LSC is
conducted from the thermal boundary layers, and is proportional to pathlength
of the LSC along boundary layers at the top and bottom plates. In a
non-circular cross-section cell, oscillations of the LSC orientation $\theta_0$
result in an oscillation in the container shape in the reference frame of the
LSC, resulting in an oscillation in the pathlength of the LSC at a given
$\theta-\theta_0$. In a square-cross-section cell, this model predicts the
dominant 3rd order sine moment and 3rd order cosine moment with magnitudes
within 50\% of measured values, when using the amplitude of the oscillation of
$\theta_0$ as input. A cylindrical cell is special in that the pathlength is
independent of $\theta_0$, and so these oscillating moments are not induced. In
a cylindrical cell, the model reproduces the sinusoidal mean temperature

model with a view of analyzing the stability properties of both the
compressible flow and plate solution components. In our earlier work, we gave
an answer in the affirmative to question of uniform stability for finite energy
solutions of said compressible flow-structure system, by means of a ``frequency
domain'' approach. However, the frequency domain method of proof in that work
is not ``robust'' (insofar as we can see), when one wishes to study longtime
behavior of solutions of compressible flow-structure PDE models which track the
appearance of the ambient state onto the boundary interface (i.e., $\kappa =1$
in flow PDE component (2)). Nor is a frequency domain approach in this earlier
work availing when one wishes to consider the dynamics, in long time, of
solutions to physically relevant nonlinear versions of the compressible
flow-structure PDE system under present consideration (e.g., the Navier-Stokes
nonlinearity in the PDE flow component, or a nonlinearity of Berger/Von Karman
type in the plate equation). Accordingly, in the present work, we operate in
the time domain by way of obtaining the necessary energy estimates which
culminate in an alternative proof for the uniform stability of finite energy
compressible flow-structure solutions. This novel time domain proof will be
used in our forthcoming paper which addresses the existence of compact global
attractors for the corresponding nonlinear coupled system in which the material
derivative -- which incorporates the aforesaid ambient state -- of the
interaction surface will be taken into account.

developed an inexpensive, easy-to-don sleeve that can record robust and

Embedded grommets are used to consistently align the sleeve with natural skin

sleeve provides a signal-to-noise ratio of 14, a don-time under 11 seconds, and
sub-centimeter precision for electrode placement. Furthermore, in a case study
with one intact participant, we use the sleeve to demonstrate that neural
networks can provide simultaneous and proportional control of six degrees of

consistent recordings, accumulated over time to establish a large dataset,
significantly improve dexterity. These results suggest that deep learning with

pruning of deep neural networks. Our learned-threshold pruning (LTP) method
learns per-layer thresholds via gradient descent, unlike conventional methods
where they are set as input. Making thresholds trainable also makes LTP
computationally efficient, hence scalable to deeper networks. For example, it
takes $30$ epochs for LTP to prune ResNet50 on ImageNet by a factor of $9.1$.
This is in contrast to other methods that search for per-layer thresholds via a
computationally intensive iterative pruning and fine-tuning process.
Additionally, with a novel differentiable $L_0$ regularization, LTP is able to
operate effectively on architectures with batch-normalization. This is
important since $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties lose their regularizing effect in
networks with batch-normalization. Finally, LTP generates a trail of
progressively sparser networks from which the desired pruned network can be
picked based on sparsity and performance requirements. These features allow LTP
to achieve competitive compression rates on ImageNet networks such as AlexNet
($26.4\times$ compression with $79.1\%$ Top-5 accuracy) and ResNet50
($9.1\times$ compression with $92.0\%$ Top-5 accuracy). We also show that LTP

powerful tracers of the properties of their progenitor galaxies, enabling their
use in determining the merger histories of galaxies. However, while useful in
separating GCs into individual accretion events, the orbits of GC groups
themselves have received less attention as probes of their progenitor galaxy
properties. In this work, we use simulations of galaxies and their GC systems
from the E-MOSAICS project to explore how the present-day orbital properties of
GCs are related to the properties of their progenitor galaxies. We find that
the orbits of GCs deposited by accretion events are sensitive to the mass and
merger redshift of the satellite galaxy. Earlier mergers and larger galaxy
masses deposit GCs at smaller median apocentres and lower total orbital energy.
The orbital properties of accreted groups of GCs can therefore be used to infer
the properties of their progenitor galaxy, though there exists a degeneracy
between galaxy mass and accretion time. Combining GC orbits with other tracers
(GC ages, metallicities) will help to break the galaxy mass/accretion time
degeneracy, enabling stronger constraints on the properties of their progenitor
galaxy. In situ GCs generally orbit at lower energies (small apocentres) than
accreted GCs, however they exhibit a large tail to high energies and even
retrograde orbits (relative to the present-day disc), showing significant
overlap with accreted GCs. Applying the results to Milky Way GCs groups
suggests a merger redshift $z \sim 1.5$ for the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus and
$z>2$ for the `low-energy'/Kraken group, adding further evidence that the Milky
Way had two significant mergers in its past.

Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations are combined with stellar
properties and spectral energy distributions to assemble a detailed picture of
the inner disk. An inner dust disk is detected in 18 of 38 disks in our sample.
Of the 14 resolved disks, 9 are significantly misaligned with the outer disk.
The near-infrared excess is uncorrelated with the mm dust mass of the inner

recovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift. The inner
disks are depleted in dust relative to the outer disk and their dust mass is
uncorrelated with the accretion rates. This is interpreted as the result of
radial drift and trapping by planets in a low $\alpha$ ($\sim 10^{-3}$) disk,
or a failure of the $\alpha$-disk model to describe angular momentum transport
and accretion. The only disk in our sample with confirmed planets in the gap,
PDS 70, has an inner disk with a significantly larger radius and lower inferred
gas-to-dust ratio than other disks in the sample. We hypothesize that these

address this problem by altering the representation of the imaging data,
whereas containing the significant information, enabling the reproduction of
similar research results elsewhere with the sharable data. Accordingly, a
framework representing the generation of a cGANe is described, and the approach
is validated for the generation of synthetic 3D brain metastatic region data

detection sensitivity, our previously reported detection algorithm produced on
average 9.12 false-positive BM detections per patient after training with the
original data, whereas producing 9.53 false-positives after training with the
cGANe generated synthetic data. Although the applicability of the introduced
approach needs further validation studies with a range of medical imaging data

energies bigger than 1 GeV and also a redistribution of 2p2h events as function
of energy and momentum transfer. This may have a big impact on neutrino energy

semiconductor-to-metal transition (SMT). In the absence of an SMT, a modest
(20%) MR is achieved. Here, we show that upon cooling below the magnetic
transition, a spatial modulation appears giving rise to new Bragg peaks due to
charge and defect ordering in a checkerboard pattern, with two kinds of
modulation vectors, $q_1$=($\frac23$, 0, 1) and $q_2$=($\frac23, \frac13,
\frac12$). This constitutes a superlattice transition ($T_s$) that lowers the
symmetry from the high temperature centrosymmetric P4/nmm to the
non-centrosymmetric P$\overline4$m2. In crystals with a large MR, a close to
room temperature $T_s$ is observed with $q_1$ appearing first, followed by
$q_2$. In crystals with low MR however, $T_s$ is much lower and only $q_1$ is
observed. The charge modulation and spin fluctuations may both contribute to
the enhancement of MR.

stable against perturbations on the scalar degree of freedom of the theory. We
start by verifying which are the most general conditions on the function
$f(R,\mathcal R)$ that allow for the general relativistic Kerr solution to also
be a solution of this theory. We perform a scalar perturbation in the trace of
the metric tensor, which in turn imposes a perturbation in both the Ricci and
Palatini scalar curvatures. To first order in the perturbation, the equations
of motion, namely the field equations and the equation that relates the Ricci
and the Palatini curvature scalars, can be rewritten in terms of a fourth-order
wave equation for the perturbation $\delta R$ which can be factorized into two
second-order massive wave equations for the same variable. The usual ansatz and
separation methods are applied and stability bounds on the effective mass of
the Ricci scalar perturbation are obtained. These stability regimes are studied
case by case and specific forms of the function $f(R,\mathcal R)$ that allow
for a stable Kerr solution to exist within the perturbation regime studied are
obtained.

the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV. Results are
presented in regions of the phase space of the decay. These are the most

on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle $\gamma/\phi_3$ is expected to be

three smaller than that achievable with previous measurements. Furthermore,
these results provide valuable input for charm-mixing studies, other
measurements of $CP$ violation, and the measurement of strong-phase parameters
for other $D$-decay modes.

ensuring the quality of service and reliability. Throughout this thesis, we use
the CONGEST model which is a typical message passing model used to design and
analyze algorithms in distributed networks. We survey various algorithmic
techniques in the CONGEST model and give an overview of the recent results to
find cuts. We also describe elegant graph theoretic ideas like cut spaces and
cycle spaces that provide useful intuition upon which our work is built.
  Our contribution is a novel fast algorith to find small cuts. Our algorithm
relies on a new characterization of trees and cuts introduced in this thesis.
Our algorithm is built upon several new algorithmic ideas that, when coupled
with our characterization of trees and cuts, help us to find the required
min-cuts. Our novel techniques include a tree restricted semigroup function
(TRSF), a novel sketching technique, and a layered algorithm. TRSF is defined
with respect to a spanning tree and is based on a commutative semigroup. This
simple yet powerful technique helps us to deterministically find min-cuts of
size one (bridges) and min-cuts of size two optimally. Our sketching technique
samples a small but relevant vertex set which is enough to find small min-cuts
in certain cases. Our layered algorithm finds min-cuts in smaller sub-graphs
pivoted by nodes at different levels in a spanning tree and uses them to make
the decision about the min-cuts in the complete graph. This is interesting
because it enables us to show that even for a global property like finding
min-cuts, local information can be exploited in a coordinated manner.

determine the boundary universality class that an ADBMF induces. In particular,
we show that the induced boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) depends on the
point on the Bloch sphere where the boundary magnetic field directs. We show
that the classification of the directions boils down to the simple fact that
the boundary field breaks the bulk symmetry or does not. We present a procedure
to estimate the universal BE, based on the finite-size corrections of the
entanglement entropy, that apply to the ADBMF. To calculate the universal BE in
the XXZ chain, we use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). The
transverse field XY chain with ADBMF after Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation is
not a quadratic free fermion Hamiltonian. We map this model to a quadratic free
fermion chain by introducing two extra ancillary spins coupled to the main
chain at the boundaries, which makes the problem {\it{integrable}}. The

on the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of the electron, and on the baryon
asymmetry of the Universe. We study the consequences of allowing these
additional terms for each flavor separately and for combinations of two
flavors. We find that a complex $\tau$ Yukawa coupling can account for the
observed baryon asymmetry $Y_B^{\rm obs}$ within current LHC and EDM bounds. A
complex $b$ ($t$) Yukawa coupling can account for $4\%$ ($2\%$) of $Y_B^{\rm

either $t$ or $b$ enlarges the viable parameter space owing to cancellations in
the EDM and in either Higgs production times decay or the total Higgs width,
respectively. Interestingly, in such a scenario there exists a region in
parameter space where the SMEFT contributions to the electron EDM cancel and
collider signal strengths are precisely SM-like, while producing sufficient
baryon asymmetry. Measuring $CP$ violation in Higgs decays to $\tau$ leptons is
the smoking gun for this scenario.

three types of stationary profiles that can develop near abrupt spatial
variations in the environmental conditions vital for population growth:
sustained oscillations, decaying oscillations and exponential relaxation
towards a flat profile. We relate the wavelength and decay length of the
wrinkles to the shape of the interaction kernel. Since these spatial structures
encode details about the interaction among individuals, we discuss how
heterogeneities reveal information that would be hidden in a flat landscape.

Furthermore, with the advancements of storage technology the design space of KV

amplification during data reorganization by taking advantage of device
characteristics. However, until today most analysis of KV-store designs is
experimental and limited to specific design points. This makes it difficult to
compare tradeoffs across different designs, find optimal configurations and
guide future KV-store design. In this paper, we introduce the Variable
Amplification- Throughput analysis (VAT) to calculate insert-path amplification
and its impact on multi-level KV-store performance.We use VAT to express the
behavior of several existing design points and to explore tradeoffs that are
not possible or easy to measure experimentally. VAT indicates that by inserting
randomness in the insert-path, KV stores can reduce amplification by more than
10x for fast storage devices. Techniques, such as key-value separation and
tiering compaction, reduce amplification by 10x and 5x, respectively.
Additionally, VAT predicts that the advancements in device technology towards
NVM, reduces the benefits from both using key-value separation and tiering.

Therefore, there is significant interest in learning representations from

learn such a representation, the model should identify anatomical structures

designed to correct the order of a reshuffled video clip and at the same time
predict the geometric transformation applied to the video clip. Experiments on

One of
its new signatures is a large negative thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm
xy}$, which appears for dopings $p$ below the pseudogap critical doping $p^*$,
but whose origin is as yet unknown. Because this large $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ is
observed even in the undoped Mott insulator La$_2$CuO$_4$, it cannot come from
charge carriers, these being localized at $p = 0$. Here we show that the
thermal Hall conductivity of La$_2$CuO$_4$ is roughly isotropic, being nearly
the same for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO$_2$ planes, i.e.
$\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) \approx \kappa_{\rm xy} (T)$. This shows that the Hall
response must come from phonons, these being the only heat carriers able to
move as easily normal and parallel to the planes . At $p > p^*$, in both
La$_{\rm 1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and La$_{\rm 1.8-x}$Eu$_{\rm
0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.24$, we observe no c-axis Hall signal, i.e.
$\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) = 0$, showing that phonons have zero Hall response outside
the pseudogap phase. The phonon Hall response appears immediately below $p^* =
0.23$, as confirmed by the large $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T)$ signal we find in
La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.21$. The microscopic
mechanism by which phonons become chiral in cuprates remains to be identified.
This mechanism must be intrinsic - from a coupling of phonons to their
electronic environment - rather than extrinsic, from structural defects or
impurities, as these are the same on both sides of $p^*$. This intrinsic phonon
Hall effect provides a new window on quantum materials and it may explain the
thermal Hall signal observed in other topologically nontrivial insulators.

leaving the patient and finally their residual energy is measured at the very

(eg. disease progression or death). To assess the connection between features
of a patient and this outcome, it is common to assume a proportional hazards
model, and fit a proportional hazards regression (or Cox regression). To fit
this model, a log-concave objective function known as the ``partial
likelihood'' is maximized. For moderate-sized datasets, an efficient
Newton-Raphson algorithm that leverages the structure of the objective can be
employed. However, in large datasets this approach has two issues: 1) The
computational tricks that leverage structure can also lead to computational
instability; 2) The objective does not naturally decouple: Thus, if the dataset
does not fit in memory, the model can be very computationally expensive to fit.
This additionally means that the objective is not directly amenable to
stochastic gradient-based optimization methods. To overcome these issues, we
propose a simple, new framing of proportional hazards regression: This results
in an objective function that is amenable to stochastic gradient descent. We
show that this simple modification allows us to efficiently fit survival models
with very large datasets. This also facilitates training complex, eg.
neural-network-based, models with survival data.

  Bounds",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reducing communication - either between levels of a memory hierarchy or
between processors over a network - is a key component of performance
optimization (in both time and energy) for many problems, including dense
linear algebra, particle interactions, and machine learning. For these
problems, which can be represented as nested-loop computations, previous tiling
based approaches have been used to find both lower bounds on the communication
required to execute them and optimal rearrangements, or blockings, to attain
such lower bounds. However, such general approaches have typically assumed the
problem sizes are large, an assumption that is often not met in practice. For
instance, the classical $(\text{# arithmetic operations})/(\text{cache
size})^{1/2}$ lower bound for matrix multiplication is not tight for
matrix-vector multiplications, which must read in at least $O(\text{#
arithmetic operations})$ words of memory; similar issues occur for almost all
convolutions in machine learning applications, which use extremely small filter
sizes (and therefore, loop bounds).
  In this paper, we provide an efficient way to both find and obtain, via an
appropriate, efficiently constructible blocking, communication lower bounds and
matching tilings which attain these lower bounds for nested loop programs with
arbitrary loop bounds that operate on multidimensional arrays in the projective
case, where the array indices are subsets of the loop indices. Our approach
works on all such problems, regardless of dimensionality, size, memory access
patterns, or number of arrays, and directly applies to (among other examples)
matrix multiplication and similar dense linear algebra operations, tensor
contractions, n-body pairwise interactions, pointwise convolutions, and fully
connected layers.

rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that
day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend
our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and
undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is
characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related

distributions as a surrogate of human anatomy. In the proposed systems, the
locations of the signal source, receiver, and signal shapes are assumed to be

signal to travel from the signal source to the signal receiver. The
finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method is used for the modeling of signal
propagation within the phantom, which is used for both simulation and image
reconstruction. Image reconstruction is achieved using linear regression on the
training pairs, which includes randomly generated images and its corresponding
arrival times generated using the FDTD approach. The linear weights of the
training images are generated to minimize the difference between the arrival
time of the reconstruction image and the measured arrival time. A simulation
study using UWB signal with the central frequency of 300 MHz and the
Shepp-Logan phantom was carried out. Ten-picosecond timing resolution is used
for the simulation and image reconstruction. The quantitative difference
between the arrival times of the phantom and the reconstructed image reduced
with an increased iteration number. The quantitative error of the reconstructed
image reached below 10% after 900 iterations, and 8.4% after 1200 iterations.
With additional post-smoothing to suppress the introduced noise pattern through
reconstruction, 6.5% error was achieved. In this paper, an approach that
utilizes the ToA principle to achieve transmission imaging with radio waves is
proposed and validated using a simulation study.

and effective solutions for various practical scenarios. Adversarial
autoencoders are shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust,
locality-preserving hash function that generates balanced and high-quality hash
codes. However, the existing adversarial hashing methods are inefficient to be
employed for large-scale image retrieval applications. Specifically, they
require an exponential number of samples to be able to generate optimal hash
codes and a significantly high computational cost to train. In this paper, we
show that the high sample-complexity requirement often results in sub-optimal
retrieval performance of the adversarial hashing methods. To address this
challenge, we propose a new adversarial-autoencoder hashing approach that has a
much lower sample requirement and computational cost. Specifically, by
exploiting the desired properties of the hash function in the low-dimensional,
discrete space, our method efficiently estimates a better variant of
Wasserstein distance by averaging a set of easy-to-compute one-dimensional
Wasserstein distances. The resulting hashing approach has an order-of-magnitude
better sample complexity, thus better generalization property, compared to the
other adversarial hashing methods. In addition, the computational cost is
significantly reduced using our approach. We conduct experiments on several
real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing
hashing methods, achieving up to 10% improvement over the current
state-of-the-art image hashing methods. The code accompanying this paper is

inference, has become a growing trend, making inference less dependent on
network connections and keeping private data locally. The prior studies on
optimizing DNNs for mobile inference typically focus on the metric of average
inference latency, thus implicitly assuming that mobile inference exhibits
little latency variability. In this note, we conduct a preliminary measurement
study on the latency variability of DNNs for mobile inference. We show that the
inference latency variability can become quite significant in the presence of
CPU resource contention. More interestingly, unlike the common belief that the
relative performance superiority of DNNs on one device can carry over to
another device and/or another level of resource contention, we highlight that a
DNN model with a better latency performance than another model can become
outperformed by the other model when resource contention be more severe or
running on another device. Thus, when optimizing DNN models for mobile
inference, only measuring the average latency may not be adequate; instead,
latency variability under various conditions should be accounted for, including
but not limited to different devices and different levels of CPU resource
contention considered in this note.

They randomize ordered inputs, leveraging increased Shannon entropy to transfer
energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir while respecting both
Liouvillian state-space dynamics and the Second Law. However, to date,
correctly determining such functional thermodynamic operating regimes was
restricted to a very few engines for which correlations among their
information-bearing degrees of freedom could be calculated exactly and in
closed form---a highly restricted set. Additionally, a key second dimension of
ratchet behavior was largely ignored---ratchets do not merely change the
randomness of environmental inputs, their operation constructs and deconstructs
patterns. To address both dimensions, we adapt recent results from
dynamical-systems and ergodic theories that efficiently and accurately
calculate the entropy rates and the rate of statistical complexity divergence
of general hidden Markov processes. In concert with the Information Processing
Second Law, these methods accurately determine thermodynamic operating regimes
for finite-state Maxwellian demons with arbitrary numbers of states and
transitions. In addition, they facilitate analyzing structure versus randomness
trade-offs that a given engine makes. The result is a greatly enhanced
perspective on the information processing capabilities of information engines.

uses reverse automatic differentiation with the acrylic-coloring method to

The syntax comparisons shows that NLOptControl models OCPs more concisely than

are benchmarked over a range of collocation points using performance profiles;
overall, NLOptControl's single, two, and four interval pseudospectral methods

Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (iSEIR) model, an extension of the SEIR
model, for summarizing rumor-spreading behaviors of interacting groups in the
population. With this iSEIR model, the interacting groups may be regarded as
nodes in a multiplex network. Then various properties of the dynamic behaviors
of the interacting groups in rumor spreading can be drawn from samples of the
multiplex network. The samples are simulated based on the iSEIR model with
different settings in terms of population scale, population distribution and
transfer rate. Results from the simulation study show that effective control of
rumor spreading in the multiplex network entails an efficient management on
information flow, which may be achieved by setting appropriate immunization and
spreading thresholds in individual behavior dynamics. Under the proposed iSEIR
model we also have derived a steady-state result, named the ""supersaturation
phenomenon"", when the rumor spreading process becomes equilibrium, which may
help us to make the optimal or better control of information flow in the
practice.

efficiency is becoming a first-order constraint. Deep quantization, which
reduces the bitwidth of the operations (below 8 bits), offers a unique
opportunity as it can reduce both the storage and compute requirements of the
network super-linearly. However, if not employed with diligence, this can lead
to significant accuracy loss. Due to the strong inter-dependence between layers
and exhibiting different characteristics across the same network, choosing an
optimal bitwidth per layer granularity is not a straight forward. As such, deep
quantization opens a large hyper-parameter space, the exploration of which is a
major challenge. We propose a novel sinusoidal regularization, called SINAREQ,
for deep quantized training. Leveraging the sinusoidal properties, we seek to
learn multiple quantization parameterization in conjunction during
gradient-based training process. Specifically, we learn (i) a per-layer
quantization bitwidth along with (ii) a scale factor through learning the
period of the sinusoidal function. At the same time, we exploit the
periodicity, differentiability, and the local convexity profile in sinusoidal
functions to automatically propel (iii) network weights towards values
quantized at levels that are jointly determined. We show how SINAREQ balance
compute efficiency and accuracy, and provide a heterogeneous bitwidth
assignment for quantization of a large variety of deep networks (AlexNet,
CIFAR-10, MobileNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN, and VGG-11) that virtually
preserves the accuracy. Furthermore, we carry out experimentation using fixed
homogenous bitwidths with 3- to 5-bit assignment and show the versatility of
SINAREQ in enhancing quantized training algorithms (DoReFa and WRPN) with about
4.8% accuracy improvements on average, and then outperforming multiple

to double the spectral efficiency. In the context of 5G technology, FD systems

analog-only beamforming techniques have been developed to mitigate the SI.
Because of the huge power consumption, systems operating at mmWave frequencies
beamform the power by only tunning the phase shifters while maintaining
constant amplitudes. Such a hardware constraint, known as the constant
amplitude (CA) constraint, severely limits the system performance. In this
work, we propose a digital and analog hybrid beamforming design that completely

Localisation Landscape Theory (LLT), to examine two-dimensional systems with
point-like random scatterers. We begin by showing that exact eigenstates cannot
be efficiently used to extract the localisation length. We then provide a
comprehensive review of known LLT, and confirm that the Hamiltonian with the
effective potential of LLT has very similar low energy eigenstates to that with
the physical potential. Next, we use LLT to compute the localisation length for
very low-energy, maximally localised eigenstates and test our method against
exact diagonalisation. Furthermore, we propose a transmission experiment that
optimally detects Anderson localisation, and demonstrate how one may extract a
length scale which is correlated with (and in general smaller than) the
localisation length. In addition, we study the dimensional crossover from one
to two dimensions, providing a new explanation to the established trends. The
prediction of a mobility edge coming from LLT is tested by direct Schr\""odinger
time evolution and is found to be unphysical. Moreover, we investigate
expanding wavepackets, to find that these can be useful in detecting and
quantifying Anderson localisation in a transmission experiment, with the only
disadvantage being the inability to resolve the energy dependence of the
localisation length. Then, we utilise LLT to uncover a connection between the
Anderson model for discrete disordered lattices and continuous two-dimensional
disordered systems, which provides powerful new insights. From here, we
demonstrate that localisation can be distinguished from other effects by a
comparison to dynamics in an ordered potential with all other properties
unchanged. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the effect of acceleration and
repulsive interparticle interactions, as relevant for current experiments.

Bellman error, a condition normally employed to show convergence of approximate
value iteration. First we relate this condition to other common frameworks and
show that it is strictly more general than the low rank (or linear) MDP
assumption of prior work. Second we provide an algorithm with a high
probability regret bound $\widetilde O(\sum_{t=1}^H d_t \sqrt{K} + \sum_{t=1}^H
\sqrt{d_t} \IBE K)$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes,
$\IBE$ is the value if the inherent Bellman error and $d_t$ is the feature
dimension at timestep $t$. In addition, we show that the result is unimprovable
beyond constants and logs by showing a matching lower bound. This has two
important consequences: 1) it shows that exploration is possible using only
\emph{batch assumptions} with an algorithm that achieves the optimal
statistical rate for the setting we consider, which is more general than prior
work on low-rank MDPs 2) the lack of closedness (measured by the inherent
Bellman error) is only amplified by $\sqrt{d_t}$ despite working in the online
setting. Finally, the algorithm reduces to the celebrated \textsc{LinUCB} when
$H=1$ but with a different choice of the exploration parameter that allows
handling misspecified contextual linear bandits. While computational
tractability questions remain open for the MDP setting, this enriches the class
of MDPs with a linear representation for the action-value function where
statistically efficient reinforcement learning is possible.

collaborative software development. However, developers still heavily rely on
the textual merge tools to handle the complicated merge tasks. The latent

quality. Regression testing is able to prevent regression faults and has been
widely used in real-world software development. However, the merged software
may fail to be well examined by rerunning the existing whole test suite.
Intuitively, if the test suite fails to cover the changes of different branches
at the same time, the merge conflicts would fail to be detected. Recently, it
has been proposed to conduct verification on 3-way merges, but this approach
does not support even some common cases such as different changes made to
different parts of the program. In this paper, we propose an approach of
regression unit test generation specifically for checking program merges
according to our proposed test oracles. And our general test oracles support us
to examine not only 3-way merges, but also 2-way and octopus merges.
Considering the conflicts may arise in other locations besides changed methods
of the project, we design an algorithm to select UUTs based on the dependency
analysis of the whole project. On this basis, we implement a tool called TOM to
generate unit tests for Java program merges. We also design the benchmark
MCon4J consisting of 389 conflict 3-way merges and 389 conflict octopus merges
to facilitate further studies on this topic. The experimental results show that
TOM finds 45 conflict 3- way merges and 87 conflicts octopus merges, while the

annotation, i.e., placing a dot at the center of an object. While being simpler
than the bounding-box or pixel-level annotation, obtaining this annotation is
still labor-intensive and time-consuming especially for images with highly
crowded scenes. On the other hand, weaker annotations that only know the total
count of objects can be almost effortless in many practical scenarios. Thus, it
is desirable to develop a learning method that can effectively train models
from count-level annotations. To this end, this paper studies the problem of
weakly-supervised crowd counting which learns a model from only a small amount
of location-level annotations (fully-supervised) but a large amount of
count-level annotations (weakly-supervised). To perform effective training in
this scenario, we observe that the direct solution of regressing the integral
of density map to the object count is not sufficient and it is beneficial to
introduce stronger regularizations on the predicted density map of
weakly-annotated images. We devise a simple-yet-effective training strategy,
namely Multiple Auxiliary Tasks Training (MATT), to construct regularizes for
restricting the freedom of the generated density maps. Through extensive
experiments on existing datasets and a newly proposed dataset, we validate the
effectiveness of the proposed weakly-supervised method and demonstrate its
superior performance over existing solutions.

theory, we obtain an effective quantum gravity theory with an emergent extra

Here, the dynamics of both the dual order-parameter field and the metric tensor
field originate from density-density and energy-momentum tensor-tensor
effective interactions, respectively, in the recursive renormalization group
transformation, performed approximately in the Gaussian level. This linear
approximation in the recursive renormalization group transformation for the
gravity sector gives rise to a linearized quantum Einstein-scalar theory along
the $z-$directional emergent space. In the large $N$ limit, where $N$ is the
flavor number of the original scalar fields, quantum fluctuations of both
dynamical metric and dual scalar fields are suppressed, leading to a classical
field theory of the Einstein-scalar type in $(D+1)$-spacetime dimensions. We
show that this emergent background gravity describes the renormalization group
flows of coupling functions in the UV quantum field theory through the extra
dimension. More precisely, the IR boundary conditions of the gravity equations
correspond to the renormalization group $\beta$-functions of the quantum field
theory, where the infinitesimal distance in the extra-dimensional space is
identified with an energy scale for the renormalization group transformation.
Finally, we also show that this dual holographic formulation describes quantum
entanglement in a geometrical way, encoding the transfer of quantum
entanglement from quantum matter to classical gravity in the large $N$ limit.
We claim that this entanglement transfer serves as a microscopic foundation for
the emergent holographic duality description.

sentence, certain words are usually more ambiguous than others, and thus more
computation steps need to be taken for these difficult words and vice versa.
However, the S-LSTM takes fixed computation steps for all words, irrespective
of their hardness. The secondary one comes from the lack of sequential

language. In this paper, we try to address these issues and propose a
depth-adaptive mechanism for the S-LSTM, which allows the model to learn how
many computational steps to conduct for different words as required. In
addition, we integrate an extra RNN layer to inject sequential information,
which also serves as an input feature for the decision of adaptive depths.
Results on the classic text classification task (24 datasets in various sizes

application to 2-D vortices and then to tip vortices shed by a 3-D wing. The
3-D inviscid simulations were post-processed using the wake-integral technique
to determine lift-induced drag force. Dependence of the VC parameter on the
flight Mach number and the angle of attack was evaluated. Grid convergence
studies were conducted for 2-D vortices and for induced drag generated by 3-D

their effect on the VC method. Finally, the VC approach was combined with the
Reynolds stress equation turbulence model, and the results were compared to
experimental data of tip vortex evolution.

In this modified and extended version of the model, we consider that only

dimensional rectangular lattice with probabilities taking into account
diffusive and scattering aspects. We show that for a sufficiently low level of
randomness ($\alpha \geq 10$), the system can relax to a mobile self-organized

The immobile,(ii) Mobile organized by lanes, and (iii) Mobile without lane

  Identifier",,,,,"cs.CR cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Use-After-Free vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to access unintended
memory via dangling pointers, are more threatening. However, most detection
schemes can only detect dangling pointers and invalid them, but not provide a
tolerance mechanism to repair the errors at runtime. Also, these techniques
obtain and manage the metadata inefficiently with complex structures and too
much scan (sweep). The goal of this paper is to use compiler instrumentation to
eliminate dangling pointers automatically and efficiently. In this paper, we
observe that most techniques lack accurate efficient pointer graph metadata
maintaining methods, so they need to scan the log to reduce the redundancy and
sweep the whole address space to find dangling pointers. Also, they lack a
direct, efficiently obtaining metadata approach. The key insight of this paper
is that a unique identifier can be used as a key to a hash or direct-map
algorithm. Thus, this paper maintains the same implicit identifier with each
memory object and its corresponding referent. Associating the unique ID with
metadata for memory objects, obtaining and managing the pointer graph metadata
can be efficiently. Therefore, with the delayed free technique adopted into
C/C++, we present the DangKiller as a novel and lightweight dangling pointer
elimination solution. We first demonstrate the MinFat Pointer, which can
calculate unique implicit ID for each object and pointer quickly, and use hash
algorithm to obtain metadata. Secondly, we propose the Log Cache and Log
Compression mechanism based on the ID to decrease the redundancy of dangling
pointer candidates. Coupled with the Address Tagging architecture on an ARM64
system, our experiments show that the DangKiller can eliminate use-after-free
vulnerabilities at only 11% and 3% runtime overheads for the SPEC CPU2006 and
2017 benchmarks respectively, except for unique cases.

In this work, we investigate a hybrid waveguide consisting of metallic photonic
crystals and dielectric films in 0.1-1.0 THz. Photonic crystal waveguides based
on metal pillar arrays (MPAs) support two resonance modes including the
fundamental and high-order transverse magnetic (TM) modes and then form one
apparent bandgap in 0.45-0.55 THz. The high-order TM-mode shows higher
confinement than the fundamental mode and are thus sensitive to the dielectric
film on the MPAs. The propagation loss and field confinement can be optimized
by changing the dielectric film thickness and refractive index. The
investigation shows that the lowest loss occurs at 0.68 THz because the
high-order TM-mode THz waves are tightly confined inside the hybrid waveguide.
This work proves that such hybrid waveguides based on metallic photonic

The equivalence of this general master equation and not the Lindblad equation
alone to the Feynman-Vernon theory should be expected because the sum over
histories approach of the FV theory clearly includes non-Markov processes,
which Lindblad equation ignores. This should close the seeming gap between
these two approaches to quantum open systems.

penetrate inside it. Nevertheless, a part of its energy gets transferred to the
electrons through a variety of mechanisms (e.g. vacuum and $\vec{J}\times
\vec{B}) heating [1, 2]). The dynamics of these energetic electrons inside the
plasma is a field of great interest. It is demonstrated here using 2-D PIC
(Particle-In-Cell) simulation that when a high intensity laser pulse is
incident on an overdense target, energetic electrons get generated which
spontaneously organize themselves to form coherent structures. These coherent
structures are observed to have similar dynamical traits as displayed by the
solutions of the EMHD (Electron Magnetohydrodynamic) model [3]. This is
noteworthy that EMHD is an approximate model and is applicable for the dynamics
of non-relativistic electrons. However, in these simulations, the electron
energy is in the relativistic regime as the laser intensity is significantly
high. Thus, it shows that the relativistic dynamics also permits the existence
of robust coherent structures. Interesting kinetic behaviour at particle level
is observed in the simulation which shows that the coherent structures take
background electrons in its fold and subsequently emit them at a higher energy.

computer vision tasks like tracking, person re-identification (ReID) has become
popular and been widely investigated. However, conventional person
re-identification can only handle RGB color images, which will fail at dark
conditions. Thus RGB-infrared ReID (also known as Infrared-Visible ReID or
Visible-Thermal ReID) is proposed. Apart from appearance discrepancy in
traditional ReID caused by illumination, pose variations and viewpoint changes,
modality discrepancy produced by cameras of the different spectrum also exists,
which makes RGB-infrared ReID more difficult. To address this problem, we focus
on extracting the shared cross-spectrum features of different modalities. In
this paper, a novel multi-spectrum image generation method is proposed and the
generated samples are utilized to help the network to find discriminative
information for re-identifying the same person across modalities. Another
challenge of RGB-infrared ReID is that the intra-person (images from the same
person) discrepancy is often larger than the inter-person (images from
different persons) discrepancy, so a dual-subspace pairing strategy is proposed
to alleviate this problem. Combining those two parts together, we also design a
one-stream neural network combining the aforementioned methods to extract
compact representations of person images, called Cross-spectrum Dual-subspace
Pairing (CDP) model. Furthermore, during the training process, we also propose
a Dynamic Hard Spectrum Mining method to automatically mine more hard samples

performance. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets, SYSU-MM01

Landau levels manipulate the quantization of Weyl orbits, especially under a
tilted magnetic field, and the resulting edge states lead to distinctive Hall
transport phenomena. A tilted magnetic field contributes an intrinsic initial
value to $\sigma_{xz}^H$ and such initial value is determined by the tilting

The three approaches are evaluated on three different rigid body mechanisms

requirements, DT has a better solve rate and is faster than state-of-the-art

information theory, it is still possible for a curious server to infer private
information from the shared models uploaded by MTs. To address this problem, we
first make use of the concept of local differential privacy (LDP), and propose
a user-level differential privacy (UDP) algorithm by adding artificial noise to
the shared models before uploading them to servers. According to our analysis,
the UDP framework can realize $(\epsilon_{i}, \delta_{i})$-LDP for the $i$-th
MT with adjustable privacy protection levels by varying the variances of the
artificial noise processes. We then derive a theoretical convergence
upper-bound for the UDP algorithm. It reveals that there exists an optimal
number of communication rounds to achieve the best learning performance. More
importantly, we propose a communication rounds discounting (CRD) method.
Compared with the heuristic search method, the proposed CRD method can achieve
a much better trade-off between the computational complexity of searching and
the convergence performance. Extensive experiments indicate that our UDP
algorithm using the proposed CRD method can effectively improve both the
training efficiency and model quality for the given privacy protection levels.

proteomic and metabolomic traits were integrated. Obtained results suggest that
by a multi-omic approach it is possible to indicate proteomic and metabolomic
traits important for reaction of barley plants to reduced water availability.
Analysis of regression of drought effect (DE) for grain weight per plant on DE
of proteomic and metabolomic traits allowed us to suggest ideotype of barley
plants tolerant to water shortage. It was shown that grain weight under drought
was determined significantly by six proteins in leaves and five in roots, the
function of which were connected with defence mechanisms, ion/electron
transport, carbon (in leaves) and nitrogen (in roots) metabolism, and in leaves
additionally by two proteins of unknown function. Out of numerous metabolites
detected in roots only Aspartic and Glutamic acids and one metabolite of
unknown function, were found to have significant influence on grain weight per
plant. The role of these traits as biomarkers, and especially as suggested
targets of ideotype breeding, has to be further studied. One of the direction
to be followed is genetic co-localization of proteomic, metabolomic and
phenotypic traits in the genetic and physical maps of barley genome that can
describe putative functional associations between traits; this is the next step

transmission. We consider the two most widespread methods for degrading the
eavesdropper's channel, the nullspace artificial noise (NS-AN) and random
artificial noise (R-AN). Then, we present a lower bound on the secrecy rate and
asymptotic performance, considering zero-forcing beamforming (ZF-BF) and
maximum-ratio transmission beamforming (MRT-BF). Our results reveal that even
when the eavesdropper is close enough to the intercepted user, a positive
secrecy rate --which tends to saturation with increasing the number of BS
antennas $N$---is possible, as long as the transmit power of eavesdropper is
less than that of the legitimate user during channel training. We show that
ZF-BF with NS-AN provides the best performance. It is found that MRT-BF and
ZF-BF are equivalent in the asymptotic limit of $N$ and hence the artificial
noise technique is the performance indicator. Moreover, we study the impact of
\emph{power-scaling law} on the secrecy rate. When the transmit power of BS is
reduced proportional to $1/N$, the performance is independent of artificial
noise asymptotically and hence the beamforming technique is the performance
indicator. In addition, when the BS's power is reduced proportional to
$1/\sqrt{N}$, all combinations of beamforming and artificial noise schemes are
equally likely asymptotically, independent of quantization noise. We present

within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, which explains the impact of
interparticle in-channel interactions. Different from mean field approaches,
the model explicitly conserves spatial correlations by considering stochastic
transitions between the channel's occupation states. The interparticle
interactions determine the Brownian ratchet like rectifying forces, which these
species exert mutually on each other. Perfect coupling of transport emerges by
an attractive empty channel and strong repulsive forces between particles of
the same species. Stochastic transitions are then confined to a subspace with
circular topology, which makes channel flows of both species become equivalent.
For opposing concentration gradients, this makes the species with the stronger
gradient the driving, positive entropy producing one, the other is driven and
produces negative entropy. A differential interaction with less repulsive
forces within particles of one species, but maintenance of this interaction for
the other species, adds a bypass path to this circular subspace. On this path a
leak flow of the species with less repulsive interparticle interaction emerges,
which is directed parallel to its concentration gradient, and, hence, produces
positive entropy. Now, appropriate strong opposing concentration gradients may
simultaneously parallelize flow of their respective species, which makes each
species produce positive entropy. The rectifying potential of the species with
the bypass option is diminished, which implies the existence of a gradient of
the other species, above which its flow and gradient are always parallel.
Conversely flow of the less coupled species may always be turned anti-parallel
to its gradient by a sufficient strong opposing gradient of the other one.

contract programs. However, current work on testing smart contract only focus
on static problems of smart contract programs. A data flow oriented test case
generation approach for dynamic testing of smart contract programs is still
missing. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel test case
generation approach, called ADF-GA (All-uses Data Flow criterion based test
case generation using Genetic Algorithm), for Solidity based Ethereum smart
contract programs. ADF-GA aims to efficiently generate a valid set of test
cases via three stages. First, the corresponding program control flow graph is
constructed from the source codes. Second, the generated control flow graph is
analyzed to obtain the variable information in the Solidity programs, locate
the require statements, and also get the definition-use pairs to be tested.
Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to generate test cases, in which an
improved fitness function is proposed to calculate the definition-use pairs
coverage of each test case with program instrumentation. Experimental studies
are performed on several representative Solidity programs. The results show
that ADF-GA can effectively generate test cases, achieve better coverage, and
reduce the number of iterations in genetic algorithm.

(CT) wide-sense cyclostationary (WSCS) processes. As modern processing is
digital, it operates on sampled versions of the CT signals. When sampling is
applied to a CT WSCS process, the statistics of the resulting discrete-time
(DT) process depends on the relationship between the sampling interval and the
period of the statistics of the CT process: When these two parameters have a
common integer factor, then the DT process is WSCS. This situation is referred
to as synchronous sampling. When this is not the case, which is referred to as
asynchronous sampling, the resulting DT process is wide-sense almost
cyclostationary (WSACS). In this work, we study the fundamental tradeoff of
sources codes applied to sampled CT WSCS processes, namely, their
rate-distortion function (RDF). We note that RDF characterization for the case
of synchronous sampling directly follows from classic information-theoretic
tools utilizing ergodicity and the law of large numbers; however, when sampling
is asynchronous, the resulting process is not information stable. In such
cases, commonly used information-theoretic tools are inapplicable to RDF
analysis, which poses a major challenge. Using the information spectrum
framework, we show that the RDF for asynchronous sampling in the low distortion
regime can be expressed as the limit superior of a sequence of RDFs in which
each element corresponds to the RDF of a synchronously sampled WSCS process
(but their limit is not guaranteed to exist). The resulting characterization
allows us to introduce novel insights on the relationship between sampling
synchronization and RDF. For example, we demonstrate that, differently from
stationary processes, small differences in the sampling rate and the sampling
time offset can notably affect the RDF of sampled CT WSCS processes.

length scale in the Solid phase (MaxSolid). MinSolid and MinVoid mean that the
size of solid parts and cavities must be greater than the size of a prescribed
circle or sphere. This is ensured through the robust design approach based on
eroded, intermediate and dilated designs. MaxSolid seeks to restrict the
formation of solid parts larger than a prescribed size, which is imposed
through local volume restrictions. In the first part of this article, we show
that by proportionally restricting the maximum size of the eroded, intermediate
and dilated designs, it is possible to obtain optimized designs satisfying,
simultaneously, MinSolid, MinVoid and MaxSolid. However, in spite of obtaining
designs with crisp boundaries, some results can be difficult to manufacture due
to the presence of multiple rounded cavities, which are introduced by the
maximum size restriction with the sole purpose of avoiding thick solid members
in the structure. To address this issue, in the second part of this article we
propose a new geometric constraint that seeks to control the minimum separation
distance between two solid members, also called the Minimum Gap (MinGap).
Differently from MinVoid, MinGap introduces large void areas that do not
necessarily have to be round. 2D and 3D test cases show that simultaneous
control of MinSolid, MinVoid, MaxSolid and MinGap can be useful to improve the

digital phantom simulation and epoxy phantom studies.
  Methods: We developed lung tumour tracking for radiotherapy using a
convolutional neural network trained for each phantom's lesion by using
multiple digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from each
phantom's treatment planning 4D-CT. We trained tumour-bone differentiation
using large numbers of training DRRs generated with various projection

training and X-ray images for tracking by using the training DRRs with random
contrast transformation and random noise addition.
  Results: We defined adequate tracking accuracy as the % frames satisfying < 1
mm tracking error of the isocentre. In the simulation study, we achieved 100%
tracking accuracy in 3-cm spherical and 1.5 x 2.25 x 3-cm ovoid masses. In the

reheat-treatment in air results in a reversible change of the band gap energy,
from 1.9 eV to 2.5 eV. The finding is consistent with the reversible changes in
the oxidation state and related $f$-orbital occupancy of Pr. However, no
pertinent changes in the phase composition or crystal structure is observed
upon the vacuum heat treatment. Further annealing of this HEO under H$_2$
atmosphere, followed by reheat-treatment in air, results in even larger but
still reversible change of the band gap energy from 1.9 eV to 3.2 eV. This is
accompanied by a disorder-order type crystal structure transition and changes
in the O 2$p$-RE 5$d$ hybridization evidenced from X-ray absorption near edge

Current translation frameworks will abandon the discriminator once the training
process is completed. This paper contends a novel role of the discriminator by
reusing it for encoding the images of the target domain. The proposed
architecture, termed as NICE-GAN, exhibits two advantageous patterns over
previous approaches: First, it is more compact since no independent encoding
component is required; Second, this plug-in encoder is directly trained by the
adversary loss, making it more informative and trained more effectively if a
multi-scale discriminator is applied. The main issue in NICE-GAN is the
coupling of translation with discrimination along the encoder, which could
incur training inconsistency when we play the min-max game via GAN. To tackle
this issue, we develop a decoupled training strategy by which the encoder is
only trained when maximizing the adversary loss while keeping frozen otherwise.
Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of NICE-GAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of FID, KID, and
also human preference. Comprehensive ablation studies are also carried out to
isolate the validity of each proposed component. Our codes are available at

ionization and subsequent recombination of an atomic electron driven by a
strong laser field - is widely understood using a quasiclassical trajectory
formalism, derived from a saddle-point approximation, where each saddle
corresponds to a complex-valued trajectory whose recombination contributes to
the harmonic emission. However, the classification of these saddle-points into
individual quantum orbits remains a high-friction part of the formalism. Here
we present a scheme to classify these trajectories, based on a natural
identification of the (complex) time that corresponds to the harmonic cutoff.
This identification also provides a natural complex value for the cutoff
energy, whose imaginary part controls the strength of quantum-path interference
between the quantum orbits that meet at the cutoff. Our construction gives an
efficient method to evaluate the location and brightness of the cutoff for a
wide class of driver waveforms by solving a single saddle-point equation. It
also allows us to explore the intricate topologies of the Riemann surfaces
formed by the quantum orbits induced by nontrivial waveforms.

Additive Model (GAM), with component step functions, that maximizes divergence
subject to the PILE (Palatability, Interpretability, Legal, Explain-ability)
constraints. The PILE constraints are also called shape constraints, and
satisfying them is called score engineering. Before 2003, FICO used an

Divergence is a ratio of quadratic functions of the score weights. I show that
the max divergence problem can be transformed into a quadratic program. The
quadratic programming formulation allows one to handle the PILE constraints
very easily. FICO currently uses aspects of this technology to develop the

the order-parameter field appear in the resulting effective action explicitly
through the extra dimensional space. Second, we consider an effective dual
holographic description derived recently, where the classical gravity theory of
the large $N$ limit takes into account quantum corrections in the all-loop

renormalization structure between both RG flow equations of coupling functions
and order-parameter fields in the emergent extra-dimensional space, where the
IR boundary condition of the order-parameter field gives rise to a mean-field
equation with fully renormalized interaction coefficients. Third, comparing the

description, we obtain term-by-term matching conditions in the level of an
effective action. As a result, we express all RG coefficients of fields and
interaction vertices in terms of the metric tensor of the dual holographic
theory. Through this metric reformulation for the RG analysis, we propose a
prescription on how to find RG $\beta-$functions of interaction coefficients in
a non-perturbative way beyond the perturbative RG analysis. In particular, we
claim that the present prescription of the RG flow generalizes the holographic
RG flow of the holographic duality conjecture towards the absence of conformal

with a point-to-point IRS-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) system in which the
IRS consists of multiple subsurfaces, each having the same number of passive
reflecting elements, whereas both the transmitter and receiver are equipped
with massive antenna arrays. Under the scenario of having very large numbers of

is derived. Furthermore, with the objective of maximizing the achievable rate,
the paper presents optimal solutions of power allocation, precoding/combining,
and IRS's phase shifts. Then it is shown that when the number of reflecting
elements at each subsurface is very large, the number of favorable and
controllable propagation paths provided by the IRS is simply equal to the
number of subsurfaces while the received signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to
each of the favorable paths increases quadratically with the number of

subject to the rate constraint is analyzed for the scenario without direct

investigate the underlying physics behind the spin-orbit interactions as well
as to develop the optical spin-based applications, it is crucial to uncover the
spin texture in a confined field, yet it faces challenge due to their chiral
and near-field vectorial features. Here, we propose a scanning imaging
technique which can map the near-field distributions of the optical spin
angular momenta with an achiral dielectric nanosphere. The spin angular
momentum component normal to the interface can be uncovered experimentally by
employing the proposed scanning imaging technique and the three-dimensional
spin vector can be reconstructed theoretically with the experimental results.
The experiment is demonstrated on the example of surface plasmon polaritons
excited by various vector vortex beams under a tight-focusing configuration,
where the spin-orbit interaction emerges clearly. The proposed method, which
can be utilized to reconstruct the photonic Skyrmion and other photonic
topological structures, is straightforward and of high precision, and hence it
is expected to be valuable for the study of near-field spin optics and
topological photonics.

for its use of non-local weight transport $-$ the biologically dubious
requirement that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of
another. Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid
weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios
where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep
convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning
rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it
is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that
does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the
underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a
more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter
tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local
rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then
investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for
instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible ""weight
estimation"" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art
performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy
updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery
of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry:
further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across

After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral

Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD
signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter
banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support

absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a
single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic

transformations to be unitary, that is, metric preserving, or, in the case of
variable-metric methods, fix the centers of nonorthogonal localized orbitals.
Here, we developed a different approach to orbital localization, in which these
constraints are replaced with a single restriction that specifies the maximum
allowed deviation from the orthogonality for the final set of localized
orbitals. This reformulation, which can be viewed as a generalization of
existing localization methods, enables one to choose the desired balance
between the orthogonality and locality of the orbitals. Furthermore, the
approach is conceptually and practically simple as it obviates the necessity in
unitary transformations and allows to determine optimal positions of the
centers of nonorthogonal orbitals in a unconstrained and straightforward

responses have been reported in the literature in terms of the changes in
period and subsurface structure. The focus in this study is on the bias within
the MT responses arising from variations in the vertical and horizontal
distances of the source current. The MT responses at 20 and 200 s were
calculated at various distances from the source current. A slight change in
source distance causes a shift in the MT responses, and the bias is large,
especially over the altitudes explored in the MT data analysis (i.e., 100-150
km), where the E layer exists. The vertical distance of the source field varies
because the distribution of conductivity with altitude in the ionosphere and
the region controlling the ionospheric electrical process change temporally.

have been proposed, such as spin operators of the Foldy-Wouthuysen and Pryce

constants of motion. Here we consider the dynamics of a relativistic electron
spin in an external electromagnetic field. We use two different Hamiltonians to
derive the corresponding spin dynamics. These two are: (a) the Dirac
Hamiltonian in presence of an external field, (b) the semirelativistic

additionally accounts for the relativistic particle-antiparticle coupling. We
conclude that the Pryce spin operator provides a suitable description of the

the cost of becoming deeper and larger. Although quantization (both fixed-point
and floating-point) has proven effective for reducing storage and memory
access, two challenges -- 1) accuracy loss caused by quantization without
calibration, fine-tuning or re-training for deep CNNs and 2) hardware
inefficiency caused by floating-point quantization -- prevent processors from
completely leveraging the benefits.
  In this paper, we propose a low-precision floating-point quantization
oriented processor, named Phoenix, to address the above challenges. We
primarily have three key observations: 1) 8-bit floating-point quantization
incurs less error than 8-bit fixed-point quantization; 2) without using any
calibration, fine-tuning or re-training techniques, normalization before
quantization further reduces accuracy degradation; 3) 8-bit floating-point
multiplier achieves higher hardware efficiency than 8-bit fixed-point
multiplier if the full-precision product is applied. Based on these key
observations, we propose a normalization-oriented 8-bit floating-point
quantization method to reduce storage and memory access with negligible
accuracy loss (within 0.5%/0.3% for top-1/top-5 accuracy, respectively). We
further design a hardware processor to address the hardware inefficiency caused
by floating-point multiplier. Compared with a state-of-the-art accelerator,
Phoenix is 3.32x and 7.45x better in performance with the same core area for
AlexNet and VGG16, respectively.

memory access for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Yet, existing methods
have two major limitations: (1) requiring re-training to maintain accuracy for
deep CNNs, and (2) needing 16-bit floating-point or 8-bit fixed-point for a
good accuracy.
  In this paper, we propose a low precision (8-bit) floating-point (LPFP)
quantization method for FPGA-based acceleration to overcome the above
limitations. Without any re-training, LPFP finds an optimal 8-bit data
representation with negligible top-1/top-5 accuracy loss (within 0.5%/0.3% in
our experiments, respectively, and significantly better than existing methods
for deep CNNs). Furthermore, we implement one 8-bit LPFP multiplication by one
4-bit multiply-adder (MAC) and one 3-bit adder, and therefore implement four
8-bit LPFP multiplications using one DSP slice of Xilinx Kintex 7 family (KC705
in this paper) while one DSP can implement only two 8-bit fixed-point
multiplications. Experiments on six typical CNNs for inference show that on
average, we improve throughput by 64.5x over Intel i9 CPU and by 1.5x over
existing FPGA accelerators. Particularly for VGG16 and YOLO, compared to six
recent FPGA accelerators, we improve average throughput by 3.5x and 27.5x and
improve average throughput per DSP by 4.1x and 5x, respectively. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study to simplify one multiplication
for CNN inference to one 4-bit MAC and implement four multiplications within
one DSP while maintaining comparable accuracy without any re-training.

single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) medical imaging and
especially crucial for homeland security applications, which is our main
interest. In the latter case, one deals with passively detecting the presence
of low emission nuclear sources with significant background noise (with Signal
To Noise Ratio ($SNR$) $1\%$ or less). In passive emission problems, direction
sensitive detectors are needed, to match the dimensionalities of the image and
the data. Collimation, used for that purpose in standard Anger
$\gamma$-cameras, is not an option. Instead, Compton $\gamma$-cameras (and
their analogs for other types of radiation) can be utilized. Backprojection
methods suggested before by two of the authors and their collaborators enable
detection in the presence of a random uniform background. In most practical
applications, however, cargo packing in shipping containers and trucks creates
regions of strong absorption and scattering, while leaving some streaming gaps
open. In such cases backprojection methods prove ineffective and lose their
detection ability. Nonetheless, visual perception of the backprojection
pictures suggested that some indications of presence of a source might still be
in the data. To learn such features (if they do exist), a deep neural network
approach is implemented in 2D, which indeed exhibits higher sensitivity and
specificity than the backprojection techniques in a low scattering case and
works well when presence of complex cargo makes backprojection fail completely.

keep up-to-date with constantly changing data. This retraining exacerbates a
large challenge facing ML systems today: model training is unstable, i.e.,
small changes in training data can cause significant changes in the model's
predictions. In this paper, we work on developing a deeper understanding of
this instability, with a focus on how a core building block of modern natural
language processing (NLP) pipelines---pre-trained word embeddings---affects the
instability of downstream NLP models. We first empirically reveal a tradeoff
between stability and memory: increasing the embedding memory 2x can reduce the
disagreement in predictions due to small changes in training data by 5% to 37%
(relative). To theoretically explain this tradeoff, we introduce a new measure
of embedding instability---the eigenspace instability measure---which we prove
bounds the disagreement in downstream predictions introduced by the change in
word embeddings. Practically, we show that the eigenspace instability measure
can be a cost-effective way to choose embedding parameters to minimize
instability without training downstream models, outperforming other embedding
distance measures and performing competitively with a nearest neighbor-based
measure. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed stability-memory tradeoffs
extend to other types of embeddings as well, including knowledge graph and
contextual word embeddings.

behavior of the humpback whale. However, WOA suffers from poor performance in
the exploitation phase and stagnates in the local best solution. Grey Wolf
Optimization (GWO) is a very competitive algorithm comparing to other common
metaheuristic algorithms as it has a super performance in the exploitation
phase while it is tested on unimodal benchmark functions. Therefore, the aim of
this paper is to hybridize GWO with WOA to overcome the problems. GWO can
perform well in exploiting optimal solutions. In this paper, a hybridized WOA
with GWO which is called WOAGWO is presented. The proposed hybridized model
consists of two steps. Firstly, the hunting mechanism of GWO is embedded into
the WOA exploitation phase with a new condition which is related to GWO.
Secondly, a new technique is added to the exploration phase to improve the
solution after each iteration. Experimentations are tested on three different
standard test functions which are called benchmark functions: 23 common
functions, 25 CEC2005 functions and 10 CEC2019 functions. The proposed WOAGWO
is also evaluated against original WOA, GWO and three other commonly used
algorithms. Results show that WOAGWO outperforms other algorithms depending on
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, WOAGWO is likewise applied to solve an
engineering problem such as pressure vessel design. Then the results prove that
WOAGWO achieves optimum solution which is better than WOA and Fitness Dependent
Optimizer (FDO).

  Platform for Ultra-Low-Energy On-Chip Communication","Submitted and Accepted at GLSVLSI 2020",,,,"physics.app-ph cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform based on-chip photonic
interconnects have limited energy-bandwidth scalability due to the optical
non-linearity induced power constraints of the constituent photonic devices. In
this paper, we propose to break this scalability barrier using a new
silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) based photonic device platform. Our physical-layer
characterization results show that SOS-based photonic devices have negligible
optical non-linearity effects in the mid-infrared region near 4{\mu}m, which
drastically alleviates their power constraints. Our link-level analysis shows
that SOS-based photonic devices can be used to realize photonic links with
aggregated data rate of more than 1 Tb/s, which recently has been deemed
unattainable for the SOI-based photonic on-chip links. We also show that such
high-throughput SOS-based photonic links can significantly improve the
energy-efficiency of on-chip photonic communication architectures. Our
system-level analysis results position SOS-based photonic interconnects to pave
the way for realizing ultra-low-energy (< 1 pJ/bit) on-chip data transfers.

  System",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The NASA dual-frequency, dual-polarization, Doppler radar (D3R) is an
important ground validation tool for the global precipitation measurement (GPM)
mission dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR). The D3R has undergone
extensive field trials starting in 2011 and continues to provide observations
that enhance our scientific knowledge. To further enhance its capabilities, the
Intermediate frequency (IF) electronics, digital receiver and waveform
generation subsystems have been upgraded. Due to the new, more flexible
architecture, this upgrade enables more research frontiers to be explored with
better performance. One of the primary motivations for this upgrade is to
enable enhanced radar sensitivity and increase range resolution to 30 meters.
In this work, the D3R system upgrade will be discussed with a focus on the key
upgrade design features to obtain better sensitivity and a flexible waveform
capability.

inverses, the weighted DMP and MPD inverses, and the CMP inverse to matrices
over the quaternion skew field H that have some features in comparison to these
inverses over the complex field. We give the direct methods of their computing,
namely, their determinantal representations by using noncommutative column and
row determinants previously introduced by the author. As the special cases, by
using the usual determinant, we give their determinantal representations for
matrices with complex entries as well. A numerical example to illustrate the
main result is given.
