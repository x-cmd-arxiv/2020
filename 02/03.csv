Replacing components individually within the system makes their initial age to

consequently the optimal inspection time, which is for the whole system not

competing failure processes of degradation and a shock process are considered

the shock arrival process is affected by the system degradation process. A

the real part of the Borel integral of a singular Borel transform. The main
novel aspect is to evaluate the latter object using a dispersion relation
technique, which was possible only in the large-$\beta_0$ approximation. Here,

reward function contains two major terms: the penalty of straying away from the
path planner and the penalty of having a collision. The latter has precedence

that the non-linear magnetic susceptibility of the yttrium iron garnet (YIG)

make it an ideal material for the creation of entangled photons. These can be
measured using a homodyne interferometer, as the much larger number of
thermally generated photons associated with ambient temperature emission can be
screened out. The proposed architecture may enable YIG quantum technology-based
sensors to be developed, mimicking in the millimeter-wave band the large number
of quantum optical experiments in the near-infrared and visible regions which
had been made possible by use of the nonlinear beta barium borate
ferroelectric, an analogue of YIG. It is illustrated here how the YIG
parametric amplifier can reproduce quantum optical Type I and Type II wave
interactions, which can be used to create entangled photons in the
millimeter-wave band. It is estimated that when half a cubic centimeter of YIG
crystal is placed in a magnetic field of a few Tesla and pumped with 5 Watts of
millimeter-wave radiation, approximately 0.5x10^12 entangled millimeter-wave
photon pairs per second are generated by the spin-wave interaction. This means
an integration time of only a few tens of seconds is needed for a successful
Bell Test. A successful demonstration of this will lead to novel architectures
of entanglement-based quantum technology room temperature sensors,
re-envisioning YIG as a modern quantum material.

atrial scar in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has recently emerged as a
promising technique to stratify patients, to guide ablation therapy and to
predict treatment success. This requires a segmentation of the high intensity
scar tissue and also a segmentation of the left atrium (LA) anatomy, the latter
usually being derived from a separate bright-blood acquisition. Performing both
segmentations automatically from a single 3D LGE CMR acquisition would
eliminate the need for an additional acquisition and avoid subsequent
registration issues. In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation method
based on multiview two-task (MVTT) recursive attention model working directly
on 3D LGE CMR images to segment the LA (and proximal pulmonary veins) and to
delineate the scar on the same dataset. Using our MVTT recursive attention
model, both the LA anatomy and scar can be segmented accurately (mean Dice
score of 93% for the LA anatomy and 87% for the scar segmentations) and
efficiently (~0.27 seconds to simultaneously segment the LA anatomy and scars
directly from the 3D LGE CMR dataset with 60-68 2D slices). Compared to
conventional unsupervised learning and other state-of-the-art deep learning
based methods, the proposed MVTT model achieved excellent results, leading to
an automatic generation of a patient-specific anatomical model combined with
scar segmentation for patients in AF.

quantum optics. The effect occurs when two identical single-photon waves enter
a 1:1 beam splitter, one in each input port. When the photons are identical,
they will extinguish each other. One of the main elements of the HOM
interferometer is the beam splitter, which has its own coefficients of
reflection $R = 1/2$ and transmission $ T = 1/2 $. In this work, the general
mechanism of the interaction of two photons in a beam splitter is considered
using an analytical solution, which shows that in the HOM theory of the effect
it is necessary to know (including when planning the experiment) not only $ R =
1/2 $ and $ T = 1/2 $, but also their root-mean-square fluctuations $ \Delta R
^ 2, \Delta T ^ 2 $, which arise due to the dependence of $R = R(\omega_1,
\omega_2) $ and $ T = T (\omega_1, \omega_2) $ on the frequencies where
$\omega_1, \omega_2$ are the frequencies of the first and second photons,
respectively. Under certain conditions, specifically when the dependence of the
fluctuations $ \Delta R^2 $ and $ \Delta T^2 $ can be neglected and $ R=T=1/2 $
is chosen, the developed theory coincides with previously known results.

the intermittent nature of these renewable resources, the problem of the

availability of data (Demand Side Management ""DSM""), hardware infrastructure
(appliance controlling DSM) and safety (voltage reduction). However, these
solutions are not fair in terms of electricity distribution. In many cases,
although the available supply may not match the demand in peak hours, however,

the demand-supply gap, which can cause substantial economic losses. To solve
the demand-supply gap problem, we propose a solution called Soft Load Shedding

measure the fairness of SLS by defining a function for household satisfaction

the problem of SLS as a social welfare problem. We also consider revenue
generated from the fair allocation as a performance measure. To evaluate our

alternating sequences occur at the early reaction stages; this leads to the
formation of microgels with pronounced core-shell structure. The distribution
of dangling ends for small values of r becomes bimodal with two
well-distinguished peaks, which correspond to the core (short dangling ends)
and corona (long dangling ends) regions. The density profiles confirm the
existence of two distinct regions for small r: a densely cross-linked core and
a loose corona entirely consisting of dangling ends with no cross-linker. The
consumption of the cross-linker in the course in the microgel formation was
found to be in a perfect agreement with the predictions of Monte Carlo (MC)

clear that this is the optimal means of training embeddings that generalize
well. This work proposes two approaches to learning embeddings, based on the
notion of dropping classes during training. We demonstrate that both approaches
can yield performance gains in speaker verification tasks. The first proposed
method, DropClass, works via periodically dropping a random subset of classes
from the training data and the output layer throughout training, resulting in a
feature extractor trained on many different classification tasks. Combined with
an additive angular margin loss, this method can yield a 7.9% relative
improvement in equal error rate (EER) over a strong baseline on VoxCeleb. The
second proposed method, DropAdapt, is a means of adapting a trained model to a
set of enrolment speakers in an unsupervised manner. This is performed by
fine-tuning a model on only those classes which produce high probability
predictions when the enrolment speakers are used as input, again also dropping
the relevant rows from the output layer. This method yields a large 13.2%
relative improvement in EER on VoxCeleb. The code for this paper has been made

Recently, research on myoelectric control based on pattern recognition (PR)
shows promising results with the aid of machine learning classifiers. Using the
approach termed as, EMG-PR, EMG signals are divided into analysis windows, and
features are extracted for each window. These features are then fed to the
machine learning classifiers as input. By offering multiple class movements and
intuitive control, this method has the potential to power an amputated subject

effective data preprocessing and optimum feature selection helps to improve the

wrist gesture dataset of $40$ intact subjects for experimentation. Results
computed using different classification algorithms show that the proposed
preprocessing and features selection outperforms the baseline and achieve up to

tasks, such as learning to rank, text classification, recommendation, etc.
However, existing learning methods for contextual bandit problems have one of
two drawbacks: they either do not explore the space of all possible document
rankings (i.e., actions) and, thus, may miss the optimal ranking, or they
present suboptimal rankings to a user and, thus, may harm the user experience.
We introduce a new learning method for contextual bandit problems, Safe
Exploration Algorithm (SEA), which overcomes the above drawbacks. SEA starts by
using a baseline (or production) ranking system (i.e., policy), which does not
harm the user experience and, thus, is safe to execute, but has suboptimal
performance and, thus, needs to be improved. Then SEA uses counterfactual
learning to learn a new policy based on the behavior of the baseline policy.
SEA also uses high-confidence off-policy evaluation to estimate the performance
of the newly learned policy. Once the performance of the newly learned policy
is at least as good as the performance of the baseline policy, SEA starts using
the new policy to execute new actions, allowing it to actively explore
favorable regions of the action space. This way, SEA never performs worse than
the baseline policy and, thus, does not harm the user experience, while still
exploring the action space and, thus, being able to find an optimal policy. Our
experiments using text classification and document retrieval confirm the above
by comparing SEA (and a boundless variant called BSEA) to online and offline
learning methods for contextual bandit problems.

over the past decade for higher capacity, though commercial adoption of these
architectures have been minimal so far. One major challenge commonly facing
these architectures is the difficulty of handling bursty traffic with optical
circuit switches (OCS) with high switching latency. Prior works generally rely
on fast-switching OCS prototypes to better react to traffic changes via
frequent reconfigurations. This approach, unfortunately, adds further
complexity to the control plane. We propose METTEOR, an easily deployable
solution for optical circuit switched data centers, that is designed for the
current capabilities of commercial OCSs. Using multiple predicted traffic
matrices, METTEOR designs data center topologies that are less sensitive to
traffic changes, thus eliminating the need of frequently reconfiguring OCSs
upon traffic changes. Results based on extensive evaluations using production
traces show that METTEOR increases the percentage of direct-hop traffic by
about 80% over a fat tree at comparable cost, and by about 30% over a uniform
mesh, at comparable maximum link utilizations. Compared to ideal solutions that
reconfigure OCSs on every traffic matrix, METTEOR achieves close-to-optimal
bandwidth utilization even with biweekly reconfiguration. This drastically
lowers the controller and management complexity needed to perform METTEOR in
commercial settings.

Specifically, it computes the instantaneous decay rates along saddle-bound

stable and unstable manifold associated with the normally hyperbolic invariant

It provides an instantaneous flux that can be assigned to every point on the

periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic--- that is bound on the NHIM. The time
average of these fluxes in the driven system corresponds to the average rate
through a given local section containing the corresponding point on the NHIM.

particularly important for biological reactions, where the reaction rates are
often determined by the diffusive transport of the molecules on two-dimensional
surfaces, such as the cell membrane. The peculiarities of diffusion on
two-dimensional surfaces may lead to nontrivial reaction kinetics, such as
concentration dependent rate of association between two molecules. However,
traditionally, the kinetics of biomolecular association reactions has been
modeled using the law of mass action, which assumes that the rate of reaction
is a concentration independent constant. In this paper, using multiscale
molecular simulation, we investigate the concentration dependence of
diffusion-limited association reactions on 2D surfaces. In particular, we
quantify the influence of short-ranged pair interactions on the concentration
dependence of the reaction rates and codify it in an empirical law. Using this
law in a chemical kinetic model, we find that the the steady state behaviors of
simple chemical systems are drastically modified by the presence of
concentration dependent rates. In particular, we find that it leads to
suppression of intrinsic noise in dimerization reaction and destabilizes robust
oscillation in Lotka-Volterra predator-prey systems. In fact, we see a
transition from robust to fine-tuned behavior in the latter. In addition, we
show that concentration dependent reaction rates arise naturally in stochastic
predator-prey systems due to intrinsic noise. We comment on the consequences of
these results and discuss their implications in the modeling of complex
chemical and biological systems. In particular, we comment on the range of
validity of the law of mass action, which is a staple in all theoretical
modeling of these systems.

trap electromagnetic energy, at the basis of many applications from microwaves
to optics. Resonators with a large intrinsic quality factor (Q) are highly
desirable since they can store a large amount of energy, leading to sharp
filtering and low loss. Exciting high-Q cavities with monochromatic signals,
however, suffers from poor excitation efficiency, i.e., most of the impinging
energy is lost in the form of reflection, since high-Q resonators are weakly
coupled to external radiation. Although critical coupling eliminates
reflections in steady-state by matching the intrinsic and coupling decay rates,
this approach requires the introduction of loss in the resonator, causing
dissipation and lowering the overall Q-factor. Here, we extend the notion of
critical coupling to high-Q lossless resonators based on tailoring the temporal
profile of the excitation wave. Utilizing coupled-mode theory, we demonstrate
an effect analogous to critical coupling by mimicking loss with
non-monochromatic excitations at complex frequencies. Remarkably, we show that
this approach enables unitary excitation efficiency in open systems, even in
the limit of extreme quality factors in the regime of quasi-bound states in the
continuum.

Three-dimensional tracking was conducted to understand the effect of turbulence
and wall friction on sphere motions. Spheres subjected to sufficient mean shear
initially lifted off of the wall before descending back towards it. These
lifting spheres translated with the fluid above the wall, undergoing saltation
or resuspension, with minimal rotation about any axis. By contrast, spheres
that did not lift off upon release mainly slid along the wall. These denser
spheres lagged the fluid more significantly due to greater wall friction. As
they slid downstream, they began to roll forward after which small repeated
lift-off events occurred. These spheres also rotated about both the streamwise
and wall-normal axes. In all cases, the sphere trajectories were limited to the
buffer and logarithmic regions, and all wall collisions were completely
inelastic. Sphere streamwise velocities fluctuated up to 20% from the mean
value even after the sphere had attained an approximate terminal velocity. In
the plane parallel to the wall, the spheres migrated in the spanwise direction
about 12% of the streamwise distance traveled suggesting that spanwise forces
are important. The variations in sphere kinematics were likely induced by high
and low momentum zones in the boundary layer, vortex shedding in the sphere
wakes, and wall friction. The repeated lift-offs of the forward rolling denser
sphere were attributed to a Magnus lift.

exclude some ladder as a minor? We show that this is the case if and only if
all graphs $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$ admit a proper vertex coloring with a bounded
number of colors such that for every $2$-connected subgraph $H$ of $G$, there
is a color that appears exactly once in $H$. This type of vertex coloring is a
relaxation of the notion of centered coloring, where for every connected
subgraph $H$ of $G$, there must be a color that appears exactly once in $H$.
The minimum number of colors in a centered coloring of $G$ is the treedepth of
$G$, and it is known that classes of graphs with bounded treedepth are exactly
those that exclude a fixed path as a subgraph, or equivalently, as a minor. In
this sense, the structure of graphs excluding a fixed ladder as a minor
resembles the structure of graphs without long paths. Another similarity is as
follows: It is an easy observation that every connected graph with two
vertex-disjoint paths of length $k$ has a path of length $k+1$. We show that
every $3$-connected graph which contains as a minor a union of sufficiently
many vertex-disjoint copies of a $2 \times k$ grid has a $2 \times (k+1)$ grid
minor.
  Our structural results have applications to poset dimension. We show that
posets whose cover graphs exclude a fixed ladder as a minor have bounded

are unavoidable as minors in cover graphs of posets with large dimension.

an OAM. A particular superposition of probe fields coupled to the matter is
shown to form specific optical vortices with shifted axes. Such off-axis
vortices can propagate inside the medium with sub- or superluminal group
velocity depending on the value of the two-photon detuning. The superluminal
optical vortices are associated with the amplification as the energy of pump
fields is transferred to the probe fields. The position of the peripheral
vortices can be manipulated by the OAM and intensity of the pump fields. We
show that the exchange of optical vortices is possible between individual probe
beams and the pump fields when the amplitude of the second probe field is zero
at the beginning of the atomic cloud. The model is extended to a more complex
double Raman doublet interacting with four pump fields. In contrast to the

accurate numerical results. In this paper, an analysis of the plane-wave
convergence of the eigenvalues of periodic linear Hamiltonians with Coulomb
potentials using the variational projector-augmented wave (VPAW) method is
presented. In the VPAW method, an invertible transformation is applied to the
original eigenvalue problem, acting locally in balls centered at the

These eigenfunctions have however a higher-order derivative discontinuity at
the spheres centered at the nuclei. By balancing both sources of error, we show
that the VPAW method can drastically improve the plane-wave convergence of the
eigenvalues with a minor additional computational cost. Numerical tests are
provided confirming the efficiency of the method to treat Coulomb

by identifying a set of critical features in an input sample, such as pixels
that contribute most strongly to a prediction made by an image classifier.
Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that many saliency methods poorly
perform, especially in situations where gradients are saturated, inputs contain
adversarial perturbations, or predictions rely upon inter-feature dependence.
To address these issues, we propose a framework that improves the robustness of
saliency methods by following a two-step procedure. First, we introduce a
perturbation mechanism that subtly varies the input sample without changing its
intermediate representations. Using this approach, we can gather a corpus of
perturbed data samples while ensuring that the perturbed and original input
samples follow the same distribution. Second, we compute saliency maps for the
perturbed samples and propose a new method to aggregate saliency maps. With
this design, we offset the gradient saturation influence upon interpretation.
From a theoretical perspective, we show the aggregated saliency map could not
only capture inter-feature dependence but, more importantly, robustify
interpretation against previously described adversarial perturbation methods.
Following our theoretical analysis, we present experimental results suggesting
that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, our saliency method outperforms

mutualistic communities. Despite a widespread interest on this pattern, no
general consensus exists on how to measure it. Instead, several metrics aiming
at quantifying nestedness, based on different but not necessarily independent
properties of the networks, coexist in the literature blurring the comparison
between ecosystems. In this work, we present a detailed critical study of the
behavior of six popular nestedness metrics and the variants of two of them. In
order to evaluate their performance, we compare the obtained values of the
nestedness of a large set of real networks among them and against a maximum
entropy and maximum likelihood null model. Our results point out, first, that
the metrics do not rank the degree of nestedness of networks universally.
Furthermore, several metrics show significant undesired dependencies on the
network properties considered. The study of these dependencies allows us to
understand some of the systematic shifts between the real values of nestedness
and the average over the null model. This paper intends to provide readers with
a critical guide on how to measure nestedness patterns, by explaining the
functioning of six standard metrics and two of its variants, and then
disclosing its qualities and flaws. By doing so, we also aim to extend the
application of the recently proposed null models based on maximum entropy to
the still largely unexplored area of ecological networks. Finally, to
complement the guide, we provide a fully-documented repository named nullnest
which gathers the codes to produce the null model and calculate the nestedness
index -- both the real value and the null expectation -- using the studied
metrics. The repository contains, moreover, the main results of the null model
applied to a large dataset of more than 200 bipartite networks.

NEAT with Binary search encoding (Bi-NEAT) and NEAT with Golden-Section search

optimizing predicates with disjunctions. For conjunctions, there there exists a
""rule-of-thumb"" of evaluating predicates in increasing selectivity to minimize
unnecessary predicate evaluations. However, for disjunctions, no such
rule-of-thumb exists. Furthermore, what little past work there is, has mostly
focused on optimizations for traditional row-oriented databases. A key
difference in predicate evaluation for row stores and column stores is that
while row stores apply predicates to a single record at a time, column stores
apply predicates to sets of records. Not only must the execution engine decide
the order in which to apply the predicates, but it must also decide how to
combine these sets to minimize the total number of records these predicates are
applied to. Our goal for this work is to provide a good ""rule-of-thumb""
algorithm for queries with both conjunctions and disjunctions in a column store
setting. We present EvalPred, the first polynomial-time (i.e., O(n log n))
predicate evaluation algorithm with provably optimal guarantees for all
predicate expressions of nested depth 2 or less. EvalPred's optimality is
guaranteed under a wide range of cost models, representing different real-world
scenarios, as long as the cost model follows a ""triangle-inequality""-like
property. Yet, despite its powerful guarantees, EvalPred is almost trivially
simple and should be easy to implement, even in existing systems. Even for
predicate expressions of depth 3 or greater, we show via experimentation that
EvalPred comes quite close to optimal with 92% of queries within 5% of optimal.
Furthermore, compared to other algorithms, EvalPred achieves average speedups
of 2.6x over no disjunction optimization, 1.4x over a greedy algorithm, and 28x

TTN maintains DNN's expressive power yet involves a much smaller amount of

a two-qubit CZ gate. Consequently, our method reduces the effects of control
errors below the errors introduced by hyperfine field misalignment and the
unavoidable decoherence that is intrinsic to the processors. Having developed
this optimal control, we simulated the performance of a diamond quantum
processor by computing quantum Fourier transforms. We find that the simulated
diamond quantum processor is able to achieve fast operations with low error
probability.

the choice of arms is controlled by self-interested agents, and the algorithm

and the information asymmetry can incentivize the agents to explore. Prior work
achieves optimal regret rates up to multiplicative factors that become
arbitrarily large depending on the Bayesian priors, and scale exponentially in
the number of arms. A more basic problem of sampling each arm once runs into
similar factors.
  We focus on the price of incentives: the loss in performance, broadly
construed, incurred for the sake of incentive-compatibility. We prove that
Thompson Sampling, a standard bandit algorithm, is incentive-compatible if
initialized with sufficiently many data points. The performance loss due to
incentives is therefore limited to the initial rounds when these data points
are collected. The problem is largely reduced to that of sample complexity: how
many rounds are needed? We address this question, providing matching upper and
lower bounds and instantiating them in various corollaries. Typically, the
optimal sample complexity is polynomial in the number of arms and exponential

framework of relativistic mean-field (RMF) model with different
density-dependent behaviors of symmetry energy. To study the effects of
symmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars, an $\omega$ meson and
$\rho$ meson coupling term is included in a popular RMF Lagrangian, i.e. the
TM1 parameter set, which is used for the widely used supernova equation of
state (EoS) table. The coupling constants relevant to the vector-isovector
meson, $\rho$, are refitted by a fixed symmetry energy at subsaturation density
and its slope at saturation density, while other coupling constants remain the
same as the original ones in TM1 so as to update the supernova EoS table. The
radius and mass of maximum neutron stars are not so sensitive to the symmetry
energy in these family TM1 parameterizations. However, the radii at
intermediate mass region are strongly correlated with the slope of symmetry
energy. Furthermore, the dimensionless tidal deformabilities of neutron stars
are also calculated within the associated Love number. We find that its value
at $1.4 M_\odot$ has a linear correlation to the slope of symmetry energy being
different from the previous studied. With the latest constraints of tidal
deformabilities from GW170817 event, the slope of symmetry energy at nuclear
saturation density should be smaller than $60$ MeV in the family TM1
parameterizations. This fact supports the usage of lower symmetry energy slope
for the update supernova EoS, which is applicable to simulations of neutron
star merger. Furthermore, the analogous analysis are also done within the
family IUFSU parameter sets. It is found that the correlations between the
symmetry energy slope with the radius and tidal deformability at $1.4 M_\odot$
have very similar linear relations in these RMF models.

improvement of regional transportation infrastructure among other factors had
an important effect on economic growth. Utilizing a large-scale dataset which
includes 3.5 billion entry and exit records of vehicles along highways
generated from toll collection systems, we attempt to establish the relevance
of mid-distance land transport patterns to regional economic status through
transportation network analyses. We apply standard measurements of complex
networks to analyze the highway transportation networks. A set of traffic flow
features are computed and correlated to the regional economic development
indicator. The multi-linear regression models explain about 89% to 96% of the
variation of cities' GDP across three provinces in China. We then fit gravity
models using annual traffic volumes of cars, buses, and freight trucks between
pairs of cities for each province separately as well as for the whole dataset.
We find the temporal changes of distance-decay effects on spatial interactions
between cities in transportation networks, which link to the economic
development patterns of each province. We conclude that transportation big data
reveal the status of regional economic development and contain valuable
information of human mobility, production linkages, and logistics for regional
management and planning. Our research offers insights into the investigation of
regional economic development status using highway transportation big data.

Although there have been a lot of unanimity with the ambient crystallographic

predict high-quality depth on diverse scenes up to an affine transformation,

metric depth often work well only for a specific scene. In contrast, learning
relative depth (information of being closer or further) can enjoy better
generalization, with the price of failing to recover the accurate geometric
shape of the scene. In this work, we propose a dataset and methods to tackle
this dilemma, aiming to predict accurate depth up to an affine transformation
with good generalization to diverse scenes. First we construct a large-scale

has a broad range of scenes and foreground contents. Compared with previous
learning objectives, i.e., learning metric depth or relative depth, we propose
to learn the affine-invariant depth using our diverse dataset to ensure both

multi-curriculum learning method. Experiments show that our method outperforms
previous methods on 8 datasets by a large margin with the zero-shot test

classification performance of different PSD algorithms and digitizers' sampling
properties (including sampling rate and the effective number of bits) has been
researched based on $\mathrm{LaBr_3}$:Ce scintillation detectors. A
self-developed integrated digitizer configured with five different ADCs and a
WavePro 404HD oscilloscope were deployed to digitize the waveforms from
$\mathrm{LaBr_3}$:Ce scintillators. Moreover, three PSD methods, charge
comparison method (CCM), least square for classification method (LS) and
Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), based on linear model were applied
to discriminate the alpha signals from the intrinsic isotope $^{227}$Ac. With
the LS method and a 125 MSPS 14-Bit ADC, the FoM value was 1.424$\pm$0.042,
which is similar to the result from LDA but 31\% better than the result of CCM.
The discrimination results showed that the performances of LS and LDA are less
affected by the sampling rate with respect to the CCM method, which reflects in
a better PSD capability. The results of this paper can help the developers of
detector systems to make a trade-off among sampling properties, desirable
discrimination results and the cost of systems.

improve meta-learning. For example, we obtain a better understanding of
generalization properties, and we can readily transfer well-understood
techniques, such as model ensemble, pre-training, joint training, data

object detection through forward-backward cyclic (FBC) training. Recent
adversarial training based domain adaptation methods have shown their
effectiveness on minimizing domain discrepancy via marginal feature
distributions alignment. However, aligning the marginal feature distributions
does not guarantee the alignment of class conditional distributions. This
limitation is more evident when adapting object detectors as the domain
discrepancy is larger compared to the image classification task, e.g. various
number of objects exist in one image and the majority of content in an image is
the background. This motivates us to learn domain invariance for category level
semantics via gradient alignment. Intuitively, if the gradients of two domains
point in similar directions, then the learning of one domain can improve that
of another domain. To achieve gradient alignment, we propose Forward-Backward
Cyclic Adaptation, which iteratively computes adaptation from source to target
via backward hopping and from target to source via forward passing. In
addition, we align low-level features for adapting holistic color/texture via
adversarial training. However, the detector performs well on both domains is
not ideal for target domain. As such, in each cycle, domain diversity is
enforced by maximum entropy regularization on the source domain to penalize
confident source-specific learning and minimum entropy regularization on target
domain to intrigue target-specific learning. Theoretical analysis of the
training process is provided, and extensive experiments on challenging
cross-domain object detection datasets have shown the superiority of our
approach over the state-of-the-art.

an IVWSN framework via extensive in-vehicle measurements for communications at
2.4 GHz, ultra wideband (UWB) and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies together
with radio frequency (RF), thermal and vibration energy harvesting. Our
analyses show that mmWave performs best for short line-of-sight (LoS) links in

of lower bandwidth; mmWave inherently experiences very low interference due to
its propagation characteristics. On the other hand, RF energy harvesting
provides up to 1 mW of power in all compartments. Vibration and thermal energy
harvesters can supply all nodes consuming <10 mW in the engine compartment and

toolkit aiming to support fast development and fair evaluation of text
generation. In model development, CoTK helps handle the cumbersome issues, such
as data processing, metric implementation, and reproduction. It standardizes
the development steps and reduces human errors which may lead to inconsistent
experimental settings. In model evaluation, CoTK provides implementation for
many commonly used metrics and benchmark models across different experimental
settings. As a unique feature, CoTK can signify when and which metric cannot be
fairly compared. We demonstrate that it is convenient to use CoTK for model
development and evaluation, particularly across different experimental
settings.

  Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (IEEE ANTS
  2019)",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  LoRaWAN has emerged as one of the promising low-power wide-area network
technologies to enable long-range sensing and monitoring applications in
Internet of Things. The LoRa physical layer used in LoRaWAN suffers from low
data rates and thus increases packet duration. In a dense LoRaWAN network
scenario with simple media access protocol like ALOHA, the packet collision
probability increases with increase in packet duration. This degrades over-all
network throughput because of increased re-transmissions of collided packets.
Any increase in data rate directly reduces the packet duration. Thus, in this
paper, we have proposed a novel approach to enhance the data rate in LoRa
communication system by using adaptive symbol periods in physical layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using adaptive symbol
periods to enhance data rate of the LoRa system. The trade-off of the proposed
approach in terms of required symbol overhead and degradation in bit error rate
performance due to symbol period reduction has also been analysed. We have
shown that for reduction factor \(\beta\), the data rate directly increases
\(1/\beta\) times.

optimal solution by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. For the scheduling, we
introduce a penalty function allowing reformulation as a sum penalty
minimization problem. Upon derivation of the optimality conditions based on the
characteristics of the penalty function, we propose two polynomial-time
heuristic algorithms and a reduced-complexity exact algorithm employing smart
pruning techniques. Via extensive simulations, we illustrate that the proposed
heuristic schemes outperform the previously proposed schemes for predetermined
transmission order of users and achieve close-to-optimal solutions.

connected the orbitals p and d, due to the C6 point group symmetry of the
hexagonal PCs. Removing the four-fold degeneracies between the bands at the
Dirac point can be achieved by introducing three small dielectric rods near the
bigger ones to realize the perturbed PCs with the C3 point group symmetry with
different topological features. By proposing the unique structure involving two
PCs with different topological effects, one may study the one-way light
distribution along the local boundary in spite of the defects, cavities, and
disorders. Moreover, we investigate the variation of the transmitted intensity
values under different defect conditions and realize that the size, location
and material type affect the transmitted light. In the other words, tunable
intensity of the edge states can be achieved through adjusting the defects such
that by increasing the radius of rods, the intensity of the edge states can be
enhanced or by increasing their distance from the unit cell center, the
intensity will be decreased. For example, by increasing the radius of one of
the rods, the intensity of the edge states is increased up to the 130%.
Additionally, by moving the position of the mentioned rod along the direction,
x, the intensity of the edge states will be decreased to 82.08%. Finally,
topological rhombic resonator enables unidirectional filtering of guided mode.
The fact that different light manipulation scenarios can be realized provides a
unique aspect for topological photonic insulators.

IRAM PdBI to search for COMs at high angular resolution in a sample of 26
solar-type protostars, including 22 Class 0 and four Class I objects. Methanol
is detected in 12 sources and tentatively in one source, which represents half
of the sample. Eight sources (30%) have detections of at least three COMs. We
find a strong chemical differentiation in multiple systems with five systems
having one component with at least three COMs detected but the other component
devoid of COM emission. The internal luminosity is found to be the source
parameter impacting the most the COM chemical composition of the sources, while
there is no obvious correlation between the detection of COM emission and that
of a disk-like structure. A canonical hot-corino origin may explain the COM
emission in four sources, an accretion-shock origin in two or possibly three
sources, and an outflow origin in three sources. The CALYPSO sources with COM
detections can be classified into three groups on the basis of the abundances
of oxygen-bearing molecules, cyanides, and CHO-bearing molecules. These
chemical groups correlate neither with the COM origin scenarii, nor with the
evolutionary status of the sources if we take the ratio of envelope mass to
internal luminosity as an evolutionary tracer. We find strong correlations
between molecules that are a priori not related chemically (for instance
methanol and methyl cyanide), implying that the existence of a correlation does
not imply a chemical link. [abridged]

experimental technique to study the electronic structure of materials. As many
electron materials show unusual many-body correlations, the technique to detect
directly these many-body correlations will play important roles in the study of
their many-body physics. In this article, we propose a technique to detect
directly the two-particle correlations, a coincidence ARPES (cARPES) where two
incident photons excite two respective photoelectrons which are detected in
coincidence. While the one-photon-absorption and one-photoelectron-emission
ARPES provides the single-particle spectrum function, the proposed cARPES with
two-photon absorption and two-photoelectron emission is relevant to a
two-particle Bethe-Salpeter wave function. Examples of the coincidence
detection probability of the cARPES for a free Fermi gas and a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting state are studied in detail. We
also propose another two experimental techniques, a coincidence angle-resolved
photoemission and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (cARP/IPES) and a
coincidence angle-resolved inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (cARIPES). As all
of these proposed coincidence techniques can provide the two-particle frequency
Bethe-Salpeter wave functions, they can show the momentum and energy dependent
two-particle dynamical physics of the material electrons in the
particle-particle or particle-hole channel. Thus, they can be introduced to
study the Cooper-pair physics in the superconductor, the itinerant magnetism in
the metallic ferromagnet/antiferromagnet, and the particle-hole pair physics in
the metallic nematic state. Moreover, as the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter wave
functions also involve the inner-pair dynamical physics, these proposed
coincidence techniques can be used to study the inner-pair time-retarded
physics.

IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. For the purpose of this work we select 112
galaxies with the largest stellar masses at present and follow their properties
in time. Using their orbital history we divide the sample into unevolved
(infalling), weakly evolved (with one pericenter passage) and strongly evolved
(with multiple pericenters). The samples are clearly separated by the value of
the integrated tidal force from the cluster the galaxies experienced during
their entire evolution and their properties depend strongly on this quantity.
As a result of tidal stripping, the galaxies of the weakly evolved sample lost
between 10 and 80% of their dark mass and less than 10% of stars, while those
in the strongly evolved one more than 70% of dark and between 10 and 55% of
stellar mass, and are significantly less or even not dark matter dominated.
While 33% of the infalling galaxies do not contain any gas, this fraction
increases to 67% for the weakly evolved and to 100% for the strongly evolved
sample. The strongly evolved galaxies lose their gas earlier and faster (within
2-6 Gyr) but the process can take up to 4 Gyr from the first pericenter
passage. These galaxies are redder and more metal rich, and at redshift z=0.5
the population of galaxies in the cluster becomes predominantly red. As a
result of tidal stirring, the morphology of the galaxies evolves from oblate to
prolate and their rotation is diminished thus the morphology-density relation
is reproduced in the simulated cluster. The strongly evolved sample contains at
least six convincing examples of tidally induced bars and six more galaxies
that had their bars enhanced by their interaction with the cluster.

achieve impressive performance across a wide range of tasks in Computer Vision.
However, a plethora of works have demonstrated the susceptibility of these
models to adversarial samples. Adversarial training procedure has been proposed
to defend against such adversarial attacks. Adversarial training methods
augment mini-batches with adversarial samples, and typically single-step
(non-iterative) methods are used for generating these adversarial samples.
However, models trained using single-step adversarial training converge to
degenerative minima where the model merely appears to be robust. The pseudo
robustness of these models is due to the gradient masking effect. Although
multi-step adversarial training helps to learn robust models, they are hard to
scale due to the use of iterative methods for generating adversarial samples.
To address these issues, we propose three different types of regularizers that
help to learn robust models using single-step adversarial training methods. The
proposed regularizers mitigate the effect of gradient masking by harnessing on
properties that differentiate a robust model from that of a pseudo robust
model. Performance of models trained using the proposed regularizers is on par
with models trained using computationally expensive multi-step adversarial
training methods.

interpolation leads to parametric reduced-order models that can be optimized

division at the microscale leads to a global expansion which then plays a role
analogous to shear flow in soft driven glasses. We conclude that growing dense
active matter and sheared dense suspensions can generically be described by the

Euler-Arnold flow in the sense of de Rham currents. We formulate a
current-valued solution of the Euler-Arnold equation with a regular-singular
decomposition. For the solution, we first prove that, if the singular part of
the vorticity is given by a linear combination of delta functions centered at
$q_n(t)$ for $n=1,\ldots,N$, $q_n(t)$ is a solution of the point vortex
equation. Conversely, we next prove that, if $q_n(t)$ is a solution of the
point vortex equation for $n=1,\ldots,N$, there exists a current-valued
solution of the Euler-Arnold equation with a regular-singular decomposition
such that the singular part of the vorticity is given by a linear combination
of delta functions centered at $q_n(t)$. As a corollary, we generalize the
Bernoulli law to the case where the flow field is a curved surface and where
the presence of point vortices is taken into account. From the viewpoint of the
application, the mathematical justification is of a significance since the
point vortex dynamics in the rotational vector field on the unit sphere is
adapted as a mathematical model of geophysical flow in order to take effect of
the Coriolis force on inviscid flows into consideration.

  string matching, unless SETH fails",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the following string matching problem on a node-labeled graph
$G=(V,E)$: given a pattern string $P$, decide whether there exists a path in
$G$ whose concatenation of node labels equals $P$. This is a basic primitive in
various problems in bioinformatics, graph databases, or networks. The hardness
results of Backurs and Indyk (FOCS 2016) imply that this problem cannot be
solved in better than $O(|E||P|)$ time, under the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis
(OVH), and this holds even under various restrictions on the graph (Equi et
al., ICALP 2019).
  In this paper we consider its offline version, namely the one in which we are
allowed to index the graph in order to support time-efficient string matching
queries. Indeed, it was tantalizing in the string matching community to believe
that sub-quadratic time queries can be achieved, e.g. at the cost of a
high-degree polynomial-time indexing.
  We disprove this belief, showing that, under OVH, no polynomial-time index
can support querying $P$ in time $O(|E|^\delta|P|^\beta)$, with either $\delta
< 1$ or $\beta < 1$. We prove this tight bound employing a known
self-reducibility technique, e.g. from the field of dynamic algorithms, which
translates conditional lower bounds for an online problem to its offline
version.
  As a side-contribution, we formalize this technique with the notion of linear
independent-components reduction, allowing for a simple proof of our result. As
another illustration of our technique, we also translate the quadratic
conditional lower bound of Backurs and Indyk (STOC 2015) for the problem of
matching a query string inside a text, under edit distance. We obtain an
analogous tight quadratic lower bound for its offline version, improving the
recent result of Cohen-Addad, Feuilloley and Starikovskaya (SODA 2019), but

learn from data they acquire in the environment. With that in mind, maintaining
a population of agents is an attractive method, as it allows data be collected
with a diverse set of behaviors. This behavioral diversity is often boosted via
multi-objective loss functions. However, those approaches typically leverage
mean field updates based on pairwise distances, which makes them susceptible to
cycling behaviors and increased redundancy. In addition, explicitly boosting
diversity often has a detrimental impact on optimizing already fruitful
behaviors for rewards. As such, the reward-diversity trade off typically relies
on heuristics. Finally, such methods require behavioral representations, often
handcrafted and domain specific. In this paper, we introduce an approach to
optimize all members of a population simultaneously. Rather than using pairwise
distance, we measure the volume of the entire population in a behavioral
manifold, defined by task-agnostic behavioral embeddings. In addition, our
algorithm Diversity via Determinants (DvD), adapts the degree of diversity
during training using online learning techniques. We introduce both
evolutionary and gradient-based instantiations of DvD and show they effectively
improve exploration without reducing performance when better exploration is not
required.

method for differentiable probabilistic programming. However, the performance
of the variational approach depends on the choice of an appropriate variational
family. Here, we introduce automatic structured variational inference (ASVI), a
fully automated method for constructing structured variational families,
inspired by the closed-form update in conjugate Bayesian models. These
convex-update families incorporate the forward pass of the input probabilistic
program and can therefore capture complex statistical dependencies.
Convex-update families have the same space and time complexity as the input
probabilistic program and are therefore tractable for a very large family of
models including both continuous and discrete variables. We validate our
automatic variational method on a wide range of low- and high-dimensional
inference problems. We find that ASVI provides a clear improvement in
performance when compared with other popular approaches such as the mean-field
approach and inverse autoregressive flows. We provide an open source
implementation of ASVI in TensorFlow Probability.

Interpretive disparity among pathologists more is one of the main challenges in

direction preferred by the influencer. We focus on a finite time-horizon and an
influencing strategy is characterized by when it exerts influence in this
time-horizon given its budget constraints. Prior work on this opinion dynamics
model assumes that individuals take into account the opinion of all individuals
in the network. We generalize this and consider the setting where the opinion
evolution of an individual depends on a limited collection of opinions from the
network. We characterize the nature of optimal influencing strategies as a
function of the way in which this collection of opinions is formed.

temperatures of a few keV. The physical mechanisms that heat this intracluster
medium (ICM) to such temperatures include the accretion shock at the periphery
of a galaxy cluster, the shocks driven by merger events, as well as a somewhat
overlooked mechanism -- the dissipation of intracluster turbulent motions. We
study the relative role of these heating mechanisms using galaxy clusters in
Lagrangian tracer particle re-simulations of the Omega500 cosmological
simulation. We adopt a novel analysis method of decomposing the temperature
increase at each time step into the contribution from dissipative heating and
that from adiabatic heating. In the high-resolution spatial-temporal map of
these heating rates, merger tracks are clearly visible, demonstrating the
dominant role of merger events in heating the ICM. The dissipative heating
contributed by each merger event is extended in time and also occurs in the
rarefaction regions, suggesting the importance of heating by the dissipation of
merger-induced turbulence. Quantitative analysis shows that turbulence heating,
rather than direct heating at merger shocks, dominates the temperature increase
of the ICM, especially at inner radii $r < r_{\rm 500c}$. In addition, we find
that many merger shocks can propagate with almost constant velocity to very
large radii $r \gg r_{\rm 500c}$, some even reach and join with the accretion
shock and becoming the outer boundary of the ICM. Altogether, these results
suggest that the ICM is heated more in an `inside-out' fashion rather than
`outside-in' as depicted in the classical smooth accretion picture.

are determined by main ion temperature, density and toroidal rotation profiles.
Thus, in order to understand and prevent experimental behaviour of W
accumulation, flux-driven integrated modelling of main ion heat and particle
transport over multiple confinement times is a vital prerequisite. For the
first time, the quasilinear gyrokinetic code QuaLiKiz has been applied for
successful predictions of core kinetic profiles in an ASDEX Upgrade H-mode
discharge in the turbulence dominated region within the integrated modelling
suite JETTO. Neoclassical contributions are calculated by NCLASS; auxiliary
heat and particle deposition profiles due to NBI and ECRH prescribed from
previous analysis with TRANSP. Turbulent and neoclassical contributions are
insufficient in explaining main ion heat and particle transport inside the
$q=1$ surface, necessitating the prescription of further transport coefficients
to mimic the impact of MHD activity on central transport. The ion to electron
temperature ratio at the simulation boundary at $\rho_\mathrm{tor} = 0.85$
stabilizes ion scale modes while destabilizing ETG modes when significantly
exceeding unity. Careful analysis of experimental measurements using Gaussian
process regression techniques is carried out to explore reasonable
uncertainties. In following trace W impurity transport simulations performed
with additionally NEO, neoclassical transport under consideration of poloidal
asymmetries alone is found to be insufficient to establish hollow central W
density profiles. Reproduction of these conditions measured experimentally is
found possible only when assuming the direct impact of a saturated
$(m,n)=(1,1)$ MHD mode on heavy impurity transport.

chains possessing a many-body localization transition is examined. It is
expected that eigenstates in the metallic or ergodic phase, behave as random
states and hence the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, commonly
referred to as the entanglement spectrum, are expected to follow the eigenvalue
statistics of a trace normalized Wishart ensemble. In particular, the density
of eigenvalues is supposed to follow the universal Marchenko-Pastur
distribution. We find deviations in the tails both for the disordered XXZ with
total $S_z$ conserved in the half-filled sector as well as in a model that
breaks this conservation. A sensitive measure of deviations is provided by the
largest eigenvalue, which in the case of the Wishart ensemble after appropriate
shift and scaling follows the universal Tracy-Widom distribution. We show that
for the models considered, in the metallic phase, the largest eigenvalue of the
reduced density matrix of eigenvector, instead follows the generalized
extreme-value statistics bordering on the Fisher-Tipett-Gumbel distribution
indicating that the correlations between eigenvalues are much weaker compared
to the Wishart ensemble. We show by means of distributions conditional on the
high entropy and normalized participation ratio of eigenstates that the
conditional entanglement spectrum still follows generalized extreme value
distribution. In the deeply localized phase we find heavy tailed distributions
and L\'evy stable laws in an appropriately scaled function of the largest and
second largest eigenvalues. The scaling is motivated by a recently developed
perturbation theory of weakly coupled chaotic systems.

  photomultipliers",,,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The avalanche breakdown and Geiger mode of the silicon p-n junction is
considered. A precise physically motivated method is proposed for determining
the avalanche breakdown voltage of silicon photomultipliers (Si PM). The method
is based on measuring the dependence of the relative photon detection
efficiency (PDErel ) on the bias voltage when one type of carriers (electron or
hole) is injected into the avalanche multiplication zone of the p-n junction.
The injection of electrons or holes from the base region of the Si PM
semiconductor structure is performed using short-wave or long-wave light. At a
low overvoltage (1-2 V) the detection efficiency is linearly dependent on the
bias voltage; therefore, extrapolation to zero PDErel value determines the Si
PM avalanche breakdown voltage with an accuracy within a few millivolts.

leading to a `droplet splitting' effect and eventual expulsion of the oil
droplet from the water drop. We then show that the interfacial tension between
the different phases and the viscosity of oil droplet dictate the splitting
dynamics. More viscous oils display higher resistance to the extreme
deformations of the droplet induced by the instability of the quadruple contact

the edge of the microwell. At some point, the three-phase contact line detaches

dissolution process is in the constant contact angle mode. By varying the gas
undersaturation level, we quantify how a high gas undersaturation enhances the

rotation, dynamo, wind and magnetism. Multi-wavelength surveys of solar-like
stars have revealed the likely existence of relationships between their
rotation, X-ray luminosity, mass-losses and magnetism. Those impose strong
constraints on the corona and wind of cool stars.
  Aims. We aim to provide power-law prescriptions of the mass-loss of stars, of
their magnetic field, and of their base coronal density and temperature that
are compatible with their observationally-constrained spin-down.
  Methods. We link the magnetic field and the mass-loss rate from a wind torque
formulation in agreement with the distribution of stellar rotation periods in
open clusters and the Skumanich law. Given a wind model and an expression of
the X-ray luminosity from radiative losses, we constrain the coronal properties
by assuming different physical scenarii linking closed loops to coronal holes.
  Results. We find that the magnetic field and the mass loss are involved in a
one-to-one correspondence constrained from spin-down considerations. We show
that a magnetic field depending on both the Rossby number and the stellar mass
is required to keep a consistent spin-down model. The estimates of the magnetic
field and the mass-loss rate obtained from our formalism are consistent with
statistical studies as well as individual observations and give new leads to
constrain the magnetic field-rotation relation. The set of scaling-laws we
derived can be broadly applied to cool stars from the PMS to the end of the MS,
and allow for a stellar wind modelling consistent with all the observational
constraints available to date.

and many algorithms have been proposed to date. A prominent example is basin
hopping Monte Carlo, which performs a modified Metropolis Monte Carlo search to
explore the potential energy surface of the system of interest. These
simulations can be very demanding due to the high-dimensional configurational
search space. The effective search space can be reduced by utilizing grids for
the atomic positions, but at the cost of possibly biasing the results if fixed
grids are employed. In this paper, we present a flexible grid algorithm for
global optimization that allows to exploit the efficiency of grids without
biasing the simulation outcome. The method is general and applicable to very
heterogeneous systems, such as interfaces between two materials of different
crystal structure or large clusters supported at surfaces. As a benchmark case,
we demonstrate its performance for the well-known global optimization problem
of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 100 particles. In spite of the
simplicity of this model potential, Lennard-Jones clusters represent a
challenging test case, since the global minima for some ""magic"" numbers of
particles exhibit geometries that are very different from those of clusters
with only a slightly different size.

The ESM strategy suggests that random filters and neurons of the error-feedback

strategy is introduced to enable ESM-CNN to extract the different size of
temporal features, providing helpful information at each iterative process for
the prediction. The performance of ESM-CNN is justified on its prediction
accuracy of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks respectively.
Comprehensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show
that the proposed ESM-CNN not only outperforms the state-of-art random neural
networks, but also exhibits stronger predictive power and less computing

equivalence) between finitely generated groups, which extends the classical

will be on amenable groups, for which we prove both rigidity and flexibility
results.
  On the rigidity side, we prove a general monotonicity property satisfied by
the isoperimetric profile, which implies in particular its invariance under
$\mathrm L^1$ measure equivalence. This yields explicit ""lower bounds"" on how
integrable a measure coupling between two amenable groups can be. This result
also has an unexpected application to geometric group theory: the isoperimetric
profile turns out to be monotonous under coarse embedding between amenable
groups. This has various applications, among which the existence of an
uncountable family of $3$-solvable groups which pairwise do not coarsely embed
into one another.
  On the flexibility side, we construct explicit orbit equivalences between
amenable groups with prescribed integrability conditions. Our main tool is a
new notion of F{\o}lner tiling sequences. We show in a number of instances that
the bounds derived from the isoperimetric profile are sharp up to a logarithmic
factor. We also deduce from this study that two important quasi-isometry
invariants are not preserved under $\mathrm L^1$ orbit equivalence: the
asymptotic dimension and finite presentability.

thermal tides by reducing the diurnal oscillation of the meridional and zonal
winds. The GW drag reaches magnitudes of the order of 1 m/s/sol above 10$^{-2}$
Pa in the northern hemisphere winter solstice and produces major changes in the
zonal wind field (from tens to hundreds of m/s), while the impact on the
temperature field is relatively moderate (10-20K). It suggests that GW induced
alteration of the meridional flow is the main responsible for the simulated
temperature variation. The results also show that with the GW scheme included,
the maximum day-night temperature difference due to the diurnal tide is around
10K, and the peak of the tide is shifted toward lower altitudes, in better

learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named
interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a

capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each

provide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has
a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses
pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is
also proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is
guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our
pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show
that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and
sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a
transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the
computational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several
benchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML

problem of using incomplete EFP2 settings in many applications in interaction
energy and molecular dynamics simulations due to relatively high computational
cost of evaluating the charge transfer (CT) effects as compared to other
effects. The alternative OEP-based CT energy model is proposed in the context
of the intermolecular perturbation theory with Hartree-Fock non-interacting
gas-phase reference wavefunctions, compatible with the EFP2 formulation. It is
found that the computational cost can be reduced up to 20 times as compared to
the CT energy method within the EFP2 scheme without compromising the accuracy
for a wide range of weakly interacting neutral molecular complexes. Therefore,
it is believed that the proposed model can be used within the EFP2 framework,

observed is well represented by a horizontally homogenised atmosphere. However
this approximation will likely fail for planets with a large temperature
contrast in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era, potentially leading to
erroneous interpretations of spectra. We first develop an analytic formulation
to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio and wavelength coverage necessary to
disentangle temperature inhomogeneities from a hemispherically averaged
spectrum. We find that for a given signal-to-noise ratio, observations at
shorter wavelengths are better at detecting the presence of inhomogeneities. We
then determine why the presence of an inhomogeneous thermal structure can lead
to spurious molecular detections when assuming a fully homogenised planet in
the retrieval process. Finally, we quantify more precisely the potential biases
by modelling a suite of hot Jupiter spectra, varying the spatial contributions
of a hot and a cold region, as would be observed by the different instruments
of JWST/NIRSpec. We then retrieve the abundances and temperature profiles from
the synthetic observations. We find that in most cases, assuming a homogeneous
thermal structure when retrieving the atmospheric chemistry leads to biased
results, and spurious molecular detection. Explicitly modelling the data using
two profiles avoids these biases, and is statistically supported provided the
wavelength coverage is wide enough, and crucially also spanning shorter
wavelengths. For the high contrast used here, a single profile with a dilution
factor performs as well as the two-profile case, with only one additional
parameter compared to the 1-D approach.

streams. Unlike existing visual captioning, storytelling aims to contain not
only factual descriptions, but also human-like narration and semantics.
However, the VIST dataset consists only of a small, fixed number of photos per
story. Therefore, the main challenge of visual storytelling is to fill in the
visual gap between photos with narrative and imaginative story. In this paper,
we propose to explicitly learn to imagine a storyline that bridges the visual
gap. During training, one or more photos is randomly omitted from the input
stack, and we train the network to produce a full plausible story even with
missing photo(s). Furthermore, we propose for visual storytelling a
hide-and-tell model, which is designed to learn non-local relations across the
photo streams and to refine and improve conventional RNN-based models. In
experiments, we show that our scheme of hide-and-tell, and the network design
are indeed effective at storytelling, and that our model outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in automatic metrics. Finally, we qualitatively show
the learned ability to interpolate storyline over visual gaps.

theory determines whether a network can be partitioned into two perfectly
opposing subsets, and is therefore useful for modelling phenomena such as the
existence of polarized communities in social networks. While determining
whether a graph is balanced is easy, finding a large balanced subgraph is hard.
The few heuristics available in the literature for this purpose are either
ineffective or non-scalable. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm
for finding large balanced subgraphs in signed networks. The algorithm relies
on signed spectral theory and a novel bound for perturbations of the graph

on the aspect ratio of the rod is not understood. Moreover, many flows of
practical interest are anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Here we study the
alignment of rods with the Lagrangian stretching direction in a channel flow,
which is approximately homogeneous and isotropic near the center but
inhomogeneous and anisotropic near the walls. Our main question is how the
distribution of relative angles between a rod and the Lagrangian stretching
direction depends on the aspect ratio of the rod and upon the distance of the
rod from the channel wall. We find that the distribution exhibits two regimes:
a plateau at small angles that corresponds to random uncorrelated motion, and
power-law tails that describe large excursions. The variance of the relative
angle is described by the width of the plateau. We find that slender rods near
the channel center align better with the Lagrangian stretching direction,
compared to those near the channel wall. These observations are explained in
terms of simple statistical models based on Jeffery's equation, qualitatively
near the channel center and quantitatively near the channel wall. Lastly we
discuss the consequences of our results for the distribution of relative angles

clever application of the matrix method of linear stability, that they may be
nearly unstable, in the sense of possessing {\sl weakly} damped modes of
oscillation. He also demonstrated the presence of such a mode in an $N$-body

Weinberg's estimate of the period (strictly, $2\pi$ divided by the real part of

adaption of the geometric complexity theory (GCT) approach by Mulmuley and
Sohoni (Siam J Comput 2001, 2008) to prove lower bounds on the border rank of
the matrix multiplication tensor. A key ingredient was information about
certain Kronecker coefficients. While tensors are an interesting test bed for
GCT ideas, the far-away goal is the separation of algebraic complexity classes.
The role of the Kronecker coefficients in that setting is taken by the
so-called plethysm coefficients: These are the multiplicities in the coordinate
rings of spaces of polynomials. Even though several hardness results for
Kronecker coefficients are known, there are almost no results about the
complexity of computing the plethysm coefficients or even deciding their
positivity.
  In this paper we show that deciding positivity of plethysm coefficients is
NP-hard, and that computing plethysm coefficients is #P-hard. In fact, both
problems remain hard even if the inner parameter of the plethysm coefficient is
fixed. In this way we obtain an inner versus outer contrast: If the outer
parameter of the plethysm coefficient is fixed, then the plethysm coefficient
can be computed in polynomial time.
  Moreover, we derive new lower and upper bounds and in special cases even
combinatorial descriptions for plethysm coefficients, which we consider to be
of independent interest. Our technique uses discrete tomography in a more
refined way than the recent work on Kronecker coefficients by Ikenmeyer,
Mulmuley, and Walter (Comput Compl 2017). This makes our work the first to
apply techniques from discrete tomography to the study of plethysm
coefficients. Quite surprisingly, that interpretation also leads to new
equalities between certain plethysm coefficients and Kronecker coefficients.

Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Negative conditional Log-Likelihood

generative learning, and NCLL is the cost for discriminative learning. A
Stochastic Newton-Raphson optimization scheme is presented. The gradients and
the Hessians are approximated using direct samples of BM obtained through
Quantum annealing (QA). Quantum annealers are hardware representing the physics
of the Ising model that operates on low but finite temperature. This
temperature affects the probability distribution of the BM; however, its value
is unknown. Previous efforts have focused on estimating this unknown
temperature through regression of theoretical Boltzmann energies of sampled

assumes that the control parameter change does not affect the system
temperature, however, this is not usually the case. Instead, an approach that
works on the probability distribution of samples, instead of the energies, is
proposed to estimate the optimal parameter set. This ensures that the optimal

allows for precise comparisons between the Mondrian forest, the Mondrian kernel

increasingly important to individuals' lives, but have caused a range of
privacy concerns addressed by, e.g., the European GDPR. Using cryptographic
techniques, it is possible to perform inference tasks remotely on sensitive
client data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the
input data and the model predictions, while the client learns nothing about the
ML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain
traces of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are
relatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can degrade
the predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network's topology.
Furthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible to ML experts, as
prototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and
require extensive cryptographic knowledge.
  In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacy-preserving
inference of sum-product networks (SPNs). SPNs are a tractable probabilistic
graphical model that allows a range of exact inference queries in linear time.
Specifically, we show how to efficiently perform SPN inference via secure
multi-party computation (SMPC) without accuracy degradation while hiding
sensitive client and training information with provable security guarantees.
Next to foundations, CryptoSPN encompasses tools to easily transform existing
SPNs into privacy-preserving executables. Our empirical results demonstrate
that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference in the order of
seconds for medium-sized SPNs.

(DTSP) that is a variant of the optimization routing problem to determine a
curvature-constrained shortest path to visit a set of locations such that the
path is feasible for Dubins vehicle, which moves only forward and has a limited
turning radius. The DTSP combines the NP-hard combinatorial optimization to
determine the optimal sequence of visits to the locations, as in the regular
TSP, with the continuous optimization of the heading angles at the locations,
where the optimal heading values depend on the sequence of visits and vice
versa. We address the computationally challenging DTSP by fast evaluation of
the sequence of visits by the proposed Windowing Surrogate Model (WiSM) which
estimates the length of the optimal Dubins path connecting a sequence of
locations in a Dubins tour. The estimation is sped up by a regression model
trained using close to optimum solutions of small Dubins tours that are
generalized for large-scale instances of the addressed DTSP utilizing the
sliding window technique and a cache for already computed results. The reported
results support that the proposed WiSM enables a fast convergence of a
relatively simple evolutionary algorithm to high-quality solutions of the DTSP.
We show that with an increasing number of locations, our algorithm scales
significantly better than other state-of-the-art DTSP solvers.

typicality is understood as the most extreme manifestation of a trait or
feature. In linear feature space, archetypes approximate the data convex hull
allowing all data points to be expressed as convex mixtures of archetypes.
However, it might not always be possible to identify meaningful archetypes in a
given feature space. Learning an appropriate feature space and identifying
suitable archetypes simultaneously addresses this problem. This paper
introduces a generative formulation of the linear archetype model,
parameterized by neural networks. By introducing the distance-dependent
archetype loss, the linear archetype model can be integrated into the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and an optimal representation with respect
to the unknown archetypes can be learned end-to-end. The reformulation of
linear Archetypal Analysis as deep variational information bottleneck, allows
the incorporation of arbitrarily complex side information during training.
Furthermore, an alternative prior, based on a modified Dirichlet distribution,
is proposed. The real-world applicability of the proposed method is
demonstrated by exploring archetypes of female facial expressions while using
multi-rater based emotion scores of these expressions as side information. A
second application illustrates the exploration of the chemical space of small
organic molecules. In this experiment, it is demonstrated that exchanging the
side information but keeping the same set of molecules, e. g. using as side
information the heat capacity of each molecule instead of the band gap energy,
will result in the identification of different archetypes. As an application,
these learned representations of chemical space might reveal distinct starting
points for de novo molecular design.

al. SOSP 2017) provide a fertile middle ground between the well-known local and
central models. Similarly to the local model, the shuffle model assumes an
untrusted data collector who receives privatized messages from users, but in
this case a secure shuffler is used to transmit messages from users to the
collector in a way that hides which messages came from which user. An
interesting feature of the shuffle model is that increasing the amount of
messages sent by each user can lead to protocols with accuracies comparable to
the ones achievable in the central model. In particular, for the problem of
privately computing the sum of $n$ bounded real values held by $n$ different
users, Cheu et al. showed that $O(\sqrt{n})$ messages per user suffice to
achieve $O(1)$ error (the optimal rate in the central model), while Balle et
al. (CRYPTO 2019) recently showed that a single message per user leads to
$\Theta(n^{1/3})$ MSE (mean squared error), a rate strictly in-between what is
achievable in the local and central models.

with improved accuracy and communication trade-offs. Our first contribution is
a recursive construction based on the protocol from Balle et al. mentioned

long lifetimes that inducing dissociation with external in-plane electric

metal dichalcogenide (TMD) vdWHs using a numerical procedure based on exterior

MoS$_2$/WS$_2$, MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$, WS$_2$/MoSe$_2$, and
WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ in various dielectric environments. For weak electric fields, we
find that WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ supports the fastest dissociation rates among the six

technique for beyond fifth generation (B5G) cellular wireless networks, where
several users can be served on a single time-frequency resource block, using
the concepts of superposition coding at the transmitter and selfinterference
cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. For terrestrial networks, the achievable
performance gains of NOMA over traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) are
well-known. However, the achievable performance of NOMA in aerial networks,
compared to terrestrial networks, is not well-understood. In this paper, we
provide a unified analytic framework to characterize the outage probabilities
of users considering various network settings, such as i) uplink and downlink
NOMA and OMA in aerial networks, and ii) uplink and downlink NOMA and OMA in
terrestrial networks. In particular, we derive closed-form rate outage
probability expressions for two users, considering line-of-sight (LOS) Rician
fading channels. Numerical results validate the derived analytical expressions
and demonstrate the difference of outage probabilities of users with OMA and
NOMA transmissions. Numerical results unveil that the optimal UAV height
increases with the increase in Rice-K factor, which implies strong

to simulate wave breaking over two distinct bathymetric profiles (a plane beach
and fringing reef) and compared to experimental flume measurements of waves,
flows, and mean water levels. Despite the simulations spanning very different
wave breaking conditions (including an extreme case with violently plunging
waves on an effectively dry reef slope), the model was able to reproduce a wide
range of relevant surf zone hydrodynamic processes using a fixed set of
numerical parameters. This included accurate predictions of the nonlinear
evolution of wave shapes (e.g., asymmetry and skewness properties), rates of
wave dissipation within the surf zone, and wave setup distributions. By using
this mesh-free approach, the model was able to resolve the critical crest
region within the breaking waves, which provided robust predictions of the
wave-induced mass fluxes within the surf zone responsible for the undertow.
Within this breaking crest region, the model results capture how the potential
energy of the organized wave motion is initially converted to kinetic energy
and then dissipated, which reproduces the distribution of wave forces
responsible for wave setup generation across the surf zone. Overall, the
results reveal how the mesh-free SPH approach can accurately reproduce the
detailed wave breaking processes with comparable skill to state-of-the-art
mesh-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models, and thus can be applied
to provide valuable new physical insight into surf zone dynamics.

semiclassical gravitational systems, at least in certain regimes, including
gravitational waves. In this paper we investigate such imprints on
gravitational waves within a specific framework: space is assumed to be
discrete (in the form of a regular cubic lattice), and this discrete geometry
is quantised following Dirac's canonical quantisation scheme. The semiclassical
behavior is then extracted by promoting the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian operator on a semiclassical state to an effective Hamiltonian.
Considering a family of semiclassical states representing small tensor
perturbations to Minkowski background, we derive a quantum-corrected effective
wave equation. The deviations from the classical gravitational wave equation
are found to be encoded in a modified dispersion relation and controlled by the
discreteness parameter of the underlying lattice. For finite discretisations,
several interesting effects appear: we investigate the thermodynamical
properties of these modified gravitons and, under certain assumptions, derive
the tensor power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. The latter is
found to deviate from the classical prediction, in that an amplification of UV
modes takes place. We discuss under what circumstances such effect can be in
agreement with observations.

  techniques from a business perspective",,,,,"econ.EM cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Choosing the technique that is the best at forecasting your data, is a
problem that arises in any forecasting application. Decades of research have
resulted into an enormous amount of forecasting methods that stem from
statistics, econometrics and machine learning (ML), which leads to a very
difficult and elaborate choice to make in any forecasting exercise. This paper
aims to facilitate this process for high-level tactical sales forecasts by
comparing a large array of techniques for 35 times series that consist of both
industry data from the Coca-Cola Company and publicly available datasets.
However, instead of solely focusing on the accuracy of the resulting forecasts,
this paper introduces a novel and completely automated profit-driven approach
that takes into account the expected profit that a technique can create during
both the model building and evaluation process. The expected profit function
that is used for this purpose, is easy to understand and adaptable to any
situation by combining forecasting accuracy with business expertise.
Furthermore, we examine the added value of ML techniques, the inclusion of
external factors and the use of seasonal models in order to ascertain which
type of model works best in tactical sales forecasting. Our findings show that
simple seasonal time series models consistently outperform other methodologies
and that the profit-driven approach can lead to selecting a different
forecasting model.

translation in processor architectures, like x86-64, that implement paged
virtual memory using a radix tree which are walked in hardware. Translation
Lookaside Buffers are critical to system performance, particularly as
applications demand larger memory footprints and with the adoption of
virtualization; however the cost of a TLB miss potentially results in multiple
memory accesses to retrieve the translation. Architectural support for
superpages has been introduced to increase TLB hits but are limited by the
operating systems ability to find contiguous memory. Numerous prior studies
have proposed TLB designs to lower miss rates and reduce page walk overhead;
however, these studies have modeled the behavior analytically. Further, to
eschew the paging overhead for big-memory workloads and virtualization, Direct
Segment maps part of a process linear virtual address space with segment
registers albeit requiring a few application and operating system
modifications. The recently evolved die-stacked DRAM technology promises a high
bandwidth and large last-level cache, in the order of Gigabytes, closer to the
processors. With such large caches the amount of data that can be accessed
without causing a TLB fault - the reach of a TLB, is inadequate. TLBs are on
the critical path for data accesses and incurring an expensive page walk can
hinder system performance, especially when the data being accessed is a cache
hit in the LLC. Hence, we are interested in exploring novel address translation
mechanisms, commensurate to the size and latency of stacked DRAM. By accurately
simulating the multitude of multi-level address translation structures using
the QEMU based MARSSx86 full system simulator, we perform detailed study of
TLBs in conjunction with the large LLCs using multi-programmed and

parameterized by the number of rows of $A$ and $\|A\|_{\max}$. This class of
problems is known under the name of ILP problems in the standard form, adding
the word ""bounded"" if $x \leq u$, for some integer vector $u$. Recently, many
new sparsity, proximity, and complexity results were obtained for bounded and
unbounded ILP problems in the standard form.
  In this paper, we consider ILP problems in the canonical form $$\max\{c^\top

are integer vectors. We assume that the integer matrix $A$ has the rank $n$,
$(n + m)$ rows, $n$ columns, and parameterize the problem by $m$ and
$\Delta(A)$, where $\Delta(A)$ is the maximum of $n \times n$ sub-determinants
of $A$, taken in the absolute value. We show that any ILP problem in the
standard form can be polynomially reduced to some ILP problem in the canonical
form, preserving $m$ and $\Delta(A)$, but the reverse reduction is not always
possible. More precisely, we define the class of generalized ILP problems in
the standard form, which includes an additional group constraint, and prove the
equivalence to ILP problems in the canonical form.
  We generalize known sparsity, proximity, and complexity bounds for ILP
problems in the canonical form. Additionally, sometimes, we strengthen
previously known results for ILP problems in the canonical form, and,
sometimes, we give shorter proofs. Finally, we consider the special cases of $m

measurements of which comprise a column of a given multivariate dataset. We
undertake inference with Metropolis with a 2-block update scheme. The SRGG is

of which is location-dependent. Given the multivariate dataset, likelihood of
the inter-column correlation matrix is attained following achievement of a
closed-form marginalisation over all inter-row correlation matrices. Distance
between a pair of graphical models learnt given the respective datasets, offers
the absolute correlation between the given datasets; such inter-graph distance
computation is our ultimate objective, and is achieved using a newly introduced
metric that resembles an uncertainty-normalised Hellinger distance between
posterior probabilities of the two learnt SRGGs, given the respective datasets.
Two sets of empirical illustrations on real data are undertaken, and

they have a jump when the parameters change from the trivial phase to the
topological phase. Besides, the correlation phase of Majorana stars will rise

encountered in the domain of high-energy physics, using a well-studied dataset:
the 2014 Higgs ML Kaggle dataset. The advantages are evaluated in terms of both
performance metrics and the time required to train and apply the resulting

rate and momentum scheduling, (advanced) ensembling in both model-space and
weight-space, and alternative architectures and connection methods. Following
the investigation, we arrive at a model which achieves equal performance to the
winning solution of the original Kaggle challenge, whilst being significantly
quicker to train and apply, and being suitable for use with both GPU and CPU
hardware setups. These reductions in timing and hardware requirements
potentially allow the use of more powerful algorithms in HEP analyses, where
models must be retrained frequently, sometimes at short notice, by small groups
of researchers with limited hardware resources. Additionally, a new wrapper

introduces a graviton mass m into the theory, a result that will be derived

Kottler-Schwarzschild mass with Lambda. The value of m is precisely the Spin-2
gauge line appearing on the Lambda versus m2 phase diagram for Spin-2, the
partially massless gauge lines introduced by Deser & Waldron and described as
the Higuchi bound. Note that this graviton is unitary with only four
polarization degrees of freedom (helicities plus & minus 2 and 1, but not 0
because a scalar gauge symmetry removes it). The conclusion is drawn that
Einstein gravity (with Lambda) is a partially massless gravitation theory which
has lost its helicity 0 due to a scalar gauge symmetry. That poses a challenge
for gravitational wave antennas as to whether they can measure the loss of this
gauge symmetry. Also, given the recent results measuring the Hubble constant Ho
from LIGO-Virgo data, it is then shown that Lambda can be determined from the
LIGO results for the graviton mass m and Ho. This is yet another
multi-messenger source for determining the three parameters Lambda, m, and Ho
