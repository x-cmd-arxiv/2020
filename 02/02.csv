obtaining high spectral resolution in grating spectrometers operating over a
broad spectral range from infrared to soft-x-ray domains. The greatest
challenge is of course to achieve large dispersion rates in the
short-wavelength x-ray domain. Here we show that crystals in non-coplanar
asymmetric x-ray Bragg diffraction can function as high-reflectance soft-x-ray
diffraction gratings with dispersion rates that are at least two orders of
magnitude larger than those that are possible with state-of-the-art man-made
gratings. This opens new opportunities to design and implement soft x-ray
resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) spectrometers with spectral resolutions
that are up to two orders of magnitude higher than what is currently possible,
to further advance a very dynamic field of RIXS spectroscopy, and to make it
competitive with inelastic neutron scattering. We present examples of
large-dispersion-rate crystal diffraction gratings operating near the 930-eV
L$_3$ absorption edge in Cu and of the 2.838-keV L$_3$ edge in Ru.

smooth boundary and examine its ""rigidity properties"", by which we mean
properties preserved under diffeomorphisms of the regions preserving the medial
axis. There are several possible versions of rigidity depending on what
features of the Blum medial axis we wish to retain. We use a form of the cross
ratio from projective geometry to show that in the case of four smooth sheets
of the medial axis meeting along a branching submanifold, the cross ratio
defines a function on the branching sheet which must be preserved under any
diffeomorphism of the medial axis with another. Second, we show in the generic
case, along a Y-branching submanifold that there are three cross ratios
involving the three limiting tangent planes of the three smooth sheets and each
of the hyperplanes defined by one of the radial lines and the tangent space to
the Y-branching submanifold at the point, which again must be preserved.
Moreover, the triple of cross ratios then locally uniquely determines the
angles between the smooth sheets. Third, we observe that for a diffeomorphism
of the region preserving the Blum medial axis and the infinitesimal directions
of the radial lines, the second derivative of the diffeomorphism at points of
the medial axis must satisfy a condition relating the radial shape operators
and hence the differential geometry of the boundaries at corresponding boundary
points.

during an outbreak or epidemic represents an important statistical scenario in
which observations arrive sequentially in time and one is interested in
performing inference in an 'online' fashion. Widely-used Bayesian phylogenetic
inference packages are not set up for this purpose, generally requiring one to
recompute trees and evolutionary model parameters de novo when new data arrive.
To accommodate increasing data flow in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, we
introduce a methodology to efficiently update the posterior distribution with
newly available genetic data. Our procedure is implemented in the BEAST 1.10
software package, and relies on a distance-based measure to insert new taxa
into the current estimate of the phylogeny and imputes plausible values for new
model parameters to accommodate growing dimensionality. This augmentation
creates informed starting values and re-uses optimally tuned transition kernels
for posterior exploration of growing data sets, reducing the time necessary to
converge to target posterior distributions. We apply our framework to data from
the recent West African Ebola virus epidemic and demonstrate a considerable
reduction in time required to obtain posterior estimates at different time
points of the outbreak. Beyond epidemic monitoring, this framework easily finds
other applications within the phylogenetics community, where changes in the
data -- in terms of alignment changes, sequence addition or removal -- present
common scenarios that can benefit from online inference.

Earlier works either did not obtain high decoupling probability, or used
provably inefficient unitaries, or required catalytic entanglement for
decoupling. In contrast, our approximate unitary designs always guarantee
decoupling with exponentially high probability and, under certain conditions,
lead to computationally efficient unitaries. As a result we conclude that,
under suitable conditions, efficiently implementable approximate unitary
designs achieve relative thermalisation in quantum thermodynamics with
exponentially high probability. We also provide, as an application, of a

Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks from a multi-modal perspective. This thesis
focuses on the information provided by the visual layer of music videos and how
it can be harnessed to augment and improve tasks of the MIR research domain.
The main hypothesis of this work is based on the observation that certain
expressive categories such as genre or theme can be recognized on the basis of
the visual content alone, without the sound being heard. This leads to the
hypothesis that there exists a visual language that is used to express mood or
genre. In a further consequence it can be concluded that this visual
information is music related and thus should be beneficial for the
corresponding MIR tasks such as music genre classification or mood recognition.
A series of comprehensive experiments and evaluations are conducted which are
focused on the extraction of visual information and its application in
different MIR tasks. A custom dataset is created, suitable to develop and test
visual features which are able to represent music related information.
Evaluations range from low-level visual features to high-level concepts
retrieved by means of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Additionally, new
visual features are introduced capturing rhythmic visual patterns. In all of
these experiments the audio-based results serve as benchmark for the visual and
audio-visual approaches. The experiments are conducted for three MIR tasks
Artist Identification, Music Genre Classification and Cross-Genre
Classification. Experiments show that an audio-visual approach harnessing
high-level semantic information gained from visual concept detection,
outperforms audio-only genre-classification accuracy by 16.43%.

and uses the resulting shape features to characterize velocity gradient
($A_{ij}$) dynamics. The local streamline geometric shape parameters and
scale-factor (size) are extracted from $A_{ij}$ by extending the linearized
critical point analysis. In the present analysis, $A_{ij}$ is factorized into
its magnitude ($A \equiv \sqrt{A_{ij}A_{ij}}$) and normalized tensor $b_{ij}
\equiv A_{ij}/A$. The geometric shape is shown to be determined exclusively by
four $b_{ij}$ parameters -- second invariant, $q$; third invariant, $r$;
intermediate strain-rate eigenvalue, $a_2$; and, angle between vorticity and
intermediate strain-rate eigenvector, $\omega_2$. Velocity gradient magnitude
$A$ plays a role only in determining the scale of the local streamline
structure. Direct numerical simulation data of forced isotropic turbulence
($Re_\lambda \sim 200 - 600$) is used to establish streamline shape and scale
distribution and, then to characterize velocity-gradient dynamics. Conditional
mean trajectories (CMTs) in $q$-$r$ space reveal important non-local features
of pressure and viscous dynamics which are not evident from the
$A_{ij}$-invariants. Two distinct types of $q$-$r$ CMTs demarcated by a
separatrix are identified. The inner trajectories are dominated by
inertia-pressure interactions and the viscous effects play a significant role
only in the outer trajectories. Dynamical system characterization of inertial,
pressure and viscous effects in the $q$-$r$ phase space is developed.
Additionally, it is shown that the residence time of $q$-$r$ CMTs through
different topologies correlate well with the corresponding population
fractions. These findings not only lead to improved understanding of non-local
dynamics, but also provide an important foundation for developing Lagrangian
velocity-gradient models.

applications. However, the lack of high-precision flow measurement tools in He
II has impeded the progress in understanding and utilizing its hydrodynamics.
In recent years, there have been extensive efforts in developing quantitative
flow visualization techniques applicable to He II. In particular, a powerful
molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) technique, based on tracking thin lines of
He$^*_2$ excimer molecules created via femtosecond laser-field ionization in
helium, has been developed in our lab. This technique allows unambiguous
measurement of the normal-fluid velocity field in the two-fluid system.
Nevertheless, there are two limitations of this technique: 1) only the velocity
component perpendicular to the tracer line can be measured; and 2) there is an
inherent error in determining the perpendicular velocity. In this paper, we
discuss how these issues can be resolved by advancing the MTV technique. We
also discuss two novel schemes for tagging and producing He$^*_2$ tracers. The
first method allows the creation of a tagged He$^*_2$ tracer line without the
use of an expensive femtosecond laser. The second method enables full-space
velocity field measurement through tracking small clouds of He$^*_2$ molecules
created via neutron-$^3$He absorption reactions in He II.

relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with

readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian
network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to
gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of
intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic
semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which

conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach
for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for
constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian
statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the

Ultimately, the proposed approach amounts to solving a series of linear

Under mild conditions, we show that the proposed linear approximation
converges. We provide sensitivity analysis and discuss in detail the current

stationary or repeated games. In this paper we aim at initiating the truly
dynamic theory with strategies chosen by players in real time. Since direct
continuous observations are known to destroy quantum evolutions (so-called
quantum Zeno paradox) the necessary new ingredient for quantum dynamic games
must be the theory of non-direct observations and the corresponding quantum
filtering. Apart from the technical problems in organising feedback quantum
control in real time, the difficulty in applying this theory for obtaining
mathematically amenable control systems is due partially to the fact that it
leads usually to rather nontrivial jump-type Markov processes and/or degenerate
diffusions on manifolds, for which the corresponding control is very difficult
to handle. The starting point for the present research is the remarkable
discovery (quite unexpected, at least to the author) that there exists a very
natural class of homodyne detections such that the diffusion processes on
projective spaces resulting by filtering under such arrangements coincide
exactly with the standard Brownian motions (BM) on these spaces. In some cases
one can even reduce the process to the plain BM on Euclidean spaces or tori.
The theory of such motions is well studied making it possible to develop a
tractable theory of related control and games, which can be at the same time
practically implemented on quantum optical devices.

scales. Given the coarse-grained modeling in theories of fluids, considerable
uncertainties may exist between the flow-field solutions and the real physics.
To study the emergence, propagation and evolution of uncertainties from
molecular to hydrodynamic level poses great opportunities and challenges to
develop both sound theories and reliable multi-scale numerical algorithms. In
this paper, a new stochastic kinetic scheme will be developed that includes
uncertainties via a hybridization of stochastic Galerkin and collocation
methods. Based on the Boltzmann-BGK model equation, a scale-dependent evolving
solution is employed in the scheme to construct governing equations in the
discretized temporal-spatial domain. Therefore typical flow physics can be
recovered with respect to different physical characteristic scales and
numerical resolutions in a self-adaptive manner. We prove that the scheme is
formally asymptotic-preserving in different flow regimes with the inclusion of
random variables, so that it can be used for the study of multi-scale
non-equilibrium gas dynamics under the effect of uncertainties.
  Several numerical experiments are shown to validate the scheme. We make new
physical observations, such as the wave-propagation patterns of uncertainties
from continuum to rarefied regimes. These phenomena will be presented and
analyzed quantitatively. The current method provides a novel tool to quantify
the uncertainties within multi-scale flow evolutions.

numerical schemes for the Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations, which are
unconditionally stable, yet take the form of an explicit scheme. This paper
extends such schemes, so that they are more effective at capturing sharp
gradients, especially on nonuniform meshes. In particular, we modify the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methodology in the previously
developed schemes by incorporating an exponential basis and adapting the
previously developed nonlinear filters used to control oscillations. The main
advantages of the proposed schemes are their effectiveness and simplicity,
since they can be easily implemented on higher-dimensional nonuniform meshes.
We perform numerical experiments on a collection of examples, including H-J
equations with linear, nonlinear, convex and non-convex Hamiltonians. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed schemes, we also include test
problems defined on non-trivial geometry.

in spectral graph theory with applications in problems such as graph
bi-partitioning and envelope reduction. Algorithms designed to estimate this
quantity usually rely on a priori knowledge of the entire graph, and employ
techniques such as graph sparsification and power iterations, which have
obvious shortcomings in cases where the graph is unknown, or changing
dynamically. In this paper, we develop a framework in which we construct a
stochastic process based on a set of interacting random walks on a graph and
show that a suitably scaled version of our stochastic process converges to the
Fiedler vector for a sufficiently large number of walks. Like other techniques
based on exploratory random walks and on-the-fly computations, such as Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), our algorithm overcomes challenges typically faced by
power iteration based approaches. But, unlike any existing random walk based
method such as MCMCs where the focus is on the leading eigenvector, our
framework with interacting random walks converges to the Fiedler vector (second

findings on different graphs, and show that our algorithm performs well over a
wide range of parameters and the number of random walks. Simulations results

general relativity was discovered. As is well known, in order to extend the
program of geometrization of physics started by Einstein to include the
electromagnetic field, H. Weyl developed a new geometry which constitutes a
kind of generalization of Riemannian geometry. However, despite its
mathematical elegance and beauty, a serious objection was made by Einstein, who
considered Weyl's theory not suitable as a physical theory since it seemed to
lead to the prediction of a not yet observed effect, the so-called ""second
clock effect"" . In this paper, our aim is to discuss Weyl's proposal anew and
examine its consistency and completeness as a physical theory. Finally, we
propose new directions and possible conceptual changes in the original work. As
an application, we solve the field equations assuming a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe and a perfect fluid as its source. Although
we have entirely abandoned Weyl's atempt to identify the vector field with the
4-dimensional electromagnetic potentials, which here must be simply viewed as

be led to a rich and interesting new modified gravity theory.

the performance of cellular-connected UAV-UEs is studied under 3D practical

Results reveal that the UAV-UE coverage probability under a practical antenna

appealing because they obtain dense and accurate depth maps. However, due to
issues that range from power constraints to multi-sensor interference, these
sensors cannot always be continuously used. To overcome this limitation, we
propose an algorithm that estimates depth maps using concurrently collected
images and a previously measured depth map for dynamic scenes, where both the
camera and objects in the scene may be independently moving. To estimate depth
in these scenarios, our algorithm models the dynamic scene motion using
independent and rigid motions. It then uses the previous depth map to
efficiently estimate these rigid motions and obtain a new depth map. Our goal
is to balance the acquisition of depth between the active depth sensor and
computation, without incurring a large computational cost. Thus, we leverage
the prior depth information to avoid computationally expensive operations like
dense optical flow estimation or segmentation used in similar approaches. Our
approach can obtain dense depth maps at up to real-time (30 FPS) on a standard
laptop computer, which is orders of magnitude faster than similar approaches.
When evaluated using RGB-D datasets of various dynamic scenes, our approach
estimates depth maps with a mean relative error of 2.5% while reducing the
active depth sensor usage by over 90%.

Firstly, we reformulate and conceptually clarify such adjunctions in terms of
the $2$-categorical data involved in the construction of categories of
institution-like structures. More precisely, we remark that the process used
for passing from rooms to institutions (\cite{Diac2}) can be extended, due to
its $2$-functoriality, to more general room-like and institution-like
structures in such a way that the aforementioned adjunctions are all seen to
arise from simpler adjunctions at the room-like level. Secondly, and mostly
independently, we provide some applications of such adjunctions to abstract
logics, mainly to the setting of propositional logics and filter pairs

produces a radioactively-powered transient known as a kilonova, first observed
accompanying the gravitational wave event GW170817. While kilonovae are
frequently modeled in spherical symmetry, the dynamical ejecta and disk
outflows can be considerably asymmetric. We use Monte Carlo radiative transfer
calculations to study the light curves of kilonovae with globally axisymmetric
geometries (e.g. an ellipsoid and a torus). We find that the variation in
luminosity in these models is most pronounced at early times, and decreases
until the light curves become isotropic in the late optically thin phase. The
light curve shape and peak time are not significantly modified by the global
asymmetry. We show that the projected surface area along the line of sight
captures the primary geometric effects, and use this fact to provide a simple
analytic estimate of the direction-dependent light curves of the aspherical
ejecta. For the kilonova accompanying GW170817, accounting for asymmetry with
an oblate (prolate) ellipsoid of axial ratio $2$ ($1/2$) leads to a $\sim 40
\%$ decrease (increase) in the inferred ejecta mass compared to the spherical
case. The pole-to-equator orientation effects are expected to be significantly
larger (a factor of $\sim 5 - 10$) for the more extreme asymmetries expected
for some NS-BH mergers.

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab72f7",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The origin of GeV emission from the early epoch of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is
a widely discussed issue. The long gamma-ray burst GRB 170405A, observed by the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope showed high-energy emission delayed by $\sim$20
s with respect to the X-ray emission, followed by temporally fading gamma-ray
emission lasting for $\sim$1,000 s, as commonly observed in high-energy GRBs.
In addition, a high-energy spectral cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV was detected in the
prompt emission phase. If this feature is caused by pair-production opacity,
the bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB ejecta can be estimated to be $\Gamma_{\rm
bulk}$ = 170-420. Simultaneously with Fermi, GRB 170405A was observed by
Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and X-ray telescope (XRT), and a clear
optical onset was detected $\sim$200 s after the burst by Swift/UltraViolet
Optical Telescope (UVOT). By coupling the deceleration time to the derived bulk
Lorentz factor, the deceleration time was found to correspond to the delayed
onset in the optical band. While the delayed onset in the optical band is
evidence that this emission had an external shock origin, the temporally
extended emission in the GeV band before the optical onset is hard to reconcile
with the standard synchrotron emission from the same external shock. This may
imply that the common feature of GeV emission with a power-law decay does not
necessarily have the same origin of the optical afterglow in all Fermi/LAT
GRBs, particularly in their early epoch. Another emission mechanism to explain
the GeV emission in GRB 170405A can be required such as an internal-shock or
inverse Compton emission.

must be fed by large datasets that adequately represent the data space.
However, in many scenarios, the available datasets may be limited and
distributed across multiple agents, each of which is seeking to learn the
distribution of the data on its own. In such scenarios, the local datasets are
inherently private and agents often do not wish to share them. In this paper,
to address this multi-agent GAN problem, a novel brainstorming GAN (BGAN)
architecture is proposed using which multiple agents can generate real-like
data samples while operating in a fully distributed manner and preserving their
data privacy. BGAN allows the agents to gain information from other agents
without sharing their real datasets but by ""brainstorming"" via the sharing of
their generated data samples. In contrast to existing distributed GAN
solutions, the proposed BGAN architecture is designed to be fully distributed,
and it does not need any centralized controller. Moreover, BGANs are shown to
be scalable and not dependent on the hyperparameters of the agents' deep neural
networks (DNNs) thus enabling the agents to have different DNN architectures.
Theoretically, the interactions between BGAN agents are analyzed as a game
whose unique Nash equilibrium is derived. Experimental results show that BGAN
can generate real-like data samples with higher quality and lower
Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and Fr\'echet Inception distance (FID) compared
to other distributed GAN architectures.

characterized by the vorticity $Q_{\text{v}}$ and helicity $\eta$. It is found
that the bimeron energy increases with $Q_{\text{v}}$, and the energy of an
isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ depends on $\eta$. We also report
the dynamics of frustrated bimerons driven by the spin-orbit torques, which
depend on the strength of the dampinglike and fieldlike torques. We find that
the isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm 1$ can be driven into linear or
elliptical motion when the spin polarization is perpendicular to the easy axis.
We numerically reveal the damping dependence of the bimeron Hall angle driven
by the dampinglike torque. Besides, the isolated bimeron with $Q_{\text{v}}=\pm
1$ can be driven into rotation by the dampinglike torque when the spin
polarization is parallel to the easy axis. The rotation frequency is
proportional to the driving current density. In addition, we numerically
demonstrate the possibility of creating a bimeron state with a higher or lower
topological charge by the current-driven collision and merging of bimeron
states with different $Q_{\text{v}}$. Our results could be useful for

of such amorphous solids may be defined with respect to a particular
deformation orientation or mode (i.e. shear, extrusion, consolidation). We
consider this problem via the consolidation of strong colloidal gels, and find
that the critical transitions during the consolidation of a strong colloidal
gel (as indicated by maxima and minima in the relative normal stress
difference) correspond directly to directed, frictional and non-frictional
rigidity percolation. These results indicate a hierarchy of directed, jammed
states during consolidation of such amorphous solids, and a direct link between
particle-scale interactions and macroscopic collective behaviour of these
systems driven far from equilibrium

feedback, that is, adaptive regret bounds that depend on the loss of the best
arm or related quantities, instead of the total number of rounds. We derive the
first small-loss bound for general strongly observable graphs, resolving an
open problem of Lykouris et al. (2018). Specifically, we develop an algorithm
with regret $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa L_*})$ where $\kappa$ is the
clique partition number and $L_*$ is the loss of the best arm, and for the
special case of self-aware graphs where every arm has a self-loop, we improve
the regret to $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\min\{\sqrt{\alpha T}, \sqrt{\kappa L_*}\})$
where $\alpha \leq \kappa$ is the independence number. Our results
significantly improve and extend those by Lykouris et al. (2018) who only
consider self-aware undirected graphs.
  Furthermore, we also take the first attempt at deriving small-loss bounds for
weakly observable graphs. We first prove that no typical small-loss bounds are
achievable in this case, and then propose algorithms with alternative
small-loss bounds in terms of the loss of some specific subset of arms. A
surprising side result is that $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is
achievable even for weakly observable graphs as long as the best arm has a
self-loop.
  Our algorithms are based on the Online Mirror Descent framework but require a
suite of novel techniques that might be of independent interest. Moreover, all
our algorithms can be made parameter-free without the knowledge of the

certain class of graphs embedded on surfaces. Our problems have a powerful
relatively recent tool in common, the so-called topological recursion (TR)
introduced by Chekhov, Eynard and Orantin.
  We call a map fully simple if it has non self-intersecting disjoint
boundaries, and ordinary if such a restriction is not imposed. We study the
combinatorial relation between fully simple and ordinary maps with the topology
of a disk or a cylinder, which reproduces relations between moments and free
cumulants established in the context of free probability. We propose a
combinatorial interpretation of the exchange symplectic transformation of TR.
We provide a matrix model interpretation for fully simple maps via the formal
hermitian matrix model with external field and deduce a universal relation
between generating series of fully simple and ordinary maps, which involves
double monotone Hurwitz numbers. In particular, we obtain an ELSV-like formula
for double $2$-orbifold strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers.
  We consider ordinary maps endowed with an $O(\mathsf{n})$ loop model, which
is a classical model in statistical physics, and determine which shapes are
more likely to occur by looking at the nesting properties of the loops
decorating the maps. We want to study the limiting objects when the number of
vertices becomes arbitrarily large, which can be done by studying the
generating series at dominant singularities. We analyze the nesting statistics
in the $O(\mathsf{n})$ loop model on random maps of arbitrary topologies in the
presence of large and small boundaries, relying on previous results for disks

assign the two distinct surface states of MnBi4Te7 (n = 1) to the
quintuple-layer (QL) Bi2Te3 termination and the septuple-layer (SL) MnBi2Te4

theoretical calculations reveals the diverging topological behaviors,
especially the hybridization effect between magnetic and nonmagnetic layers, on
the two terminations: a gap on the QL termination originating from the
topological surface states of the QL hybridizing with the bands of the beneath
SL, and a gapless Dirac-cone band structure on the SL termination with
time-reversal symmetry. The quasi-particle interference patterns further
confirm the topological nature of the surface states for both terminations,
continuing far above the Fermi energy. The QL termination carries a
spin-helical Dirac state with hexagonal warping, while at the SL termination, a
strongly canted helical state from the surface lies between a pair of
Rashba-split states from its neighboring layer. Our work elucidates an

result established that separation of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log k})$ is necessary and
sufficient for identifiability of the parameters with polynomial sample

required $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ separation (Yan, et al., 2017). Unlike prior work,

multiple single-antenna source terminal (ST)-DT pairs in two-hop networks is
investigated. Different from the previous studies on IRS that merely focused on
tuning the reflection coefficient of all the reflection elements at IRS, in
this paper, we consider the true reflection resource management. Specifically,
the true reflection resource management can be realized via trigger module
selection based on our proposed IRS architecture that all the reflection
elements are partially controlled by multiple parallel switches of controller.
As the number of reflection elements increases, the true reflection resource
management will become urgently needed in this context, which is due to the
non-ignorable energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed modular architecture
of IRS is designed to make the reflection elements part independent and
controllable. As such, our goal is to maximize the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at DTs via a joint trigger
module subset selection, transmit power allocation of STs, and the
corresponding passive beamforming of the trigger modules, subject to per ST
power budgets and module size constraint. Whereas this problem is NP-hard due
to the module size constraint, to deal with it, we transform the hard module
size constraint into the group sparse constraint by introducing the mixed row
block norm, which yields a suitable semidefinite relaxation. Additionally, the
parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (PADMM) is proposed to
identify the trigger module subset, and then subsequently the transmit power
allocation and passive beamforming can be obtained by solving the original
minimum SINR maximization problem without the group sparse constraint via
partial linearization for generalized fractional programs.

The manifolds are total spaces of principal $S^1$ bundles over

Ricci positive metrics on the bases. Along the way we classify 5-manifolds with

FRBs reside in an environment consistent with that of binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers. The bursting rate for repeaters could be very high and the emission
site is likely from a magnetosphere. We discuss a hypothesis of producing
abundant repeating FRBs in BNS systems. Decades to centuries before a BNS
system coalesces, the magnetospheres of the two neutron stars start to interact
relentlessly. Abrupt magnetic reconnection accelerates particles, which emit
coherent radio waves in bunches via curvature radiation. FRBs are detected as
these bright radiation beams point towards Earth. This model predicts
quasi-periodicity of the bursts at the rotation periods of the two merging
neutron stars (tens of milliseconds and seconds, respectively) as well as the
period of orbital motion (of the order of 100 s). The bursting activities are
expected to elevate with time as the two neutron stars get closer. The
repeating FRB sources should be gravitational wave (GW) sources for space-borne
detectors such as LISA if the sources are close enough, and will be eventually
detected by ground-based detectors when the two neutron stars coalesce.

Mass-market automotive-grade receiver chipsets are available at low Cost, Size,

lane-level accurate localization with 99.99999% integrity guarantees at over

help. Specifically, incorporating high-integrity GNSS lane determination into

a complex process especially when the weights are severely quantized. Model
averaging is a promising approach for achieving the good generalization
capability of DNNs, especially when the loss surface for training contains many
sharp minima. We present a new quantized neural network optimization approach,
stochastic quantized weight averaging (SQWA), to design low-precision DNNs with
good generalization capability using model averaging. The proposed approach
includes (1) floating-point model training, (2) direct quantization of weights,
(3) capturing multiple low-precision models during retraining with cyclical
learning rates, (4) averaging the captured models, and (5) re-quantizing the
averaged model and fine-tuning it with low-learning rates. Additionally, we
present a loss-visualization technique on the quantized weight domain to
clearly elucidate the behavior of the proposed method. Visualization results
indicate that a quantized DNN (QDNN) optimized with the proposed approach is
located near the center of the flat minimum in the loss surface. With SQWA
training, we achieved state-of-the-art results for 2-bit QDNNs on CIFAR-100 and

19th century. We state a related question, i.e. to characterize $f$-vectors of
three dimensional polytopes respecting a symmetry, given by a finite group of

0.06) and ferromagnetic (x = 0.1) samples in La0.7Ca0.3-xSrxMnO3 series using a
radio-frequency impedance analyzer and also microwave power absorption using a
network analyzer. In both measurements, samples were enclosed tightly inside a
copper stripcoil and impedance or reflection coefficient of this copper
stripcoil was measured as a function of the applied magnetic field for
different frequencies of current (f = 0.1 to 2.5 GHz). The direction of the
applied magnetic field was perpendicular to the alternating magnetic field
produced by the coil. In the ferromagnetic sample (x = 0.1), magnetoresistance
shows a peak around zero field for lower frequencies but a peak appears at H
away from the origin at higher frequencies. The position of the peak shifts
towards higher fields with increasing frequency. A similar trend is also found
for the paramagnetic sample (x = 0.06) but the peak occurs at a higher field
compared to the ferromagnetic sample for the same frequency. Microwave power
absorption also shows features similar to magnetoresistance. Line shape
analysis of the data was performed by fitting the data to a Lorentzian
function. It is concluded that the observed features are imprints of
ferromagnetic resonance in x = 0.1 and paramagnetic resonance in x = 0.06

local unitary encoder for the toric code can be found by enforcing locality in
the $O(\log L)$-depth non-local renormalisation encoder. We relate these

the fundamental relevance of features such as phenotypic bias is mounting as
well, while the synthesis of conceptual and experimental progress leads to
questioning current assumptions on the nature of evolutionary dynamics-cancer
progression models or synthetic biology approaches being notable examples. This
work delves into a critical and constructive attitude in our current knowledge
of how genotypes map onto molecular phenotypes and organismal functions, and
discusses theoretical and empirical avenues to broaden and improve this

to develop a novel distributed observer strategy with less conservatism,
thereby definitely improving the applicability of the existing results. To be
more specific, the improved distributed observer can precisely handle consensus
problems for some nonlinear leader systems which are invalid for the
traditional strategies with the certain assumption, such as Elastic Shaft
Single Linkage Manipulator (ESSLM) systems and most of first-order nonlinear
systems. We prove the sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of
our distributed observer's error dynamic by proposing two pioneered lemmas to
show the relationship between the maximum eigenvalues of two matrices appearing
in Lyapunov type matrices. Then, a partial feedback linearization method with
zero dynamic proposed in differential geometry is employed to design a purely
decentralized control law for the affine nonlinear multi-agent system. With
this advancement, the existing results can be regarded as a specific case owing
to that the followers can be chosen as an arbitrary minimum phase affine smooth
nonlinear system. At last, the novel distributed observer and the improved
purely decentralized control law are applied in the distributed control
framework to construct a closed-loop system. We also prove the stability of
closed-loop system to achieve leader-following consensus, i.e., the distributed
control framework is proved to satisfy certainty equivalence principle. Our
method is illustrated by ESSLM system and Van der Pol system as leader.

their thermodynamics based on the R\'enyi statistics. This led to
thermodynamically stable black hole configurations for some certain range of
black hole radii; namely within this range the corresponding black holes have
positive heat capacity. Moreover, for a certain background temperature there
can exist at most three configurations of black hole; one among which is
thermodynamically stable. These configurations were investigated in terms of
their free energies, resulting in the moderate-sized stable black hole
configuration being the most preferred configuration. Furthermore, a specific
condition on the R\'enyi non-extensive parameter is required if a given hot
spacetime were to evolve thermally into the moderate-sized stable black hole.

supports the propagation of MHD waves along various kind of jets including also
the solar wind. It is well-known as well that under some conditions, namely
high enough jet speeds, the propagating MHD modes can become unstable against

explore how the propagation and instability characteristics of running along a
slow solar wind MHD modes are affected when they are investigated in the
framework of the ideal Hall-magnetohydrodynamics. Hall-MHD is applicable if the
jet width is shorter than or comparable to the so called Hall parameter
$l_\mathrm{Hall} = c/\omega_\mathrm{pi}$ (where $c$ is the speed of light and
$\omega_\mathrm{pi}$ is the ion plasma frequency). We model the solar wind as a
moving with velocity $\vec{v}_0$ cylindrical flux tube of radius $a$,
containing incompressible plasma with density $\rho_\mathrm{i}$ permeated by a
constant magnetic field $\vec{B}_\mathrm{i}$. The surrounding plasma is
characterized with its density $\rho_\mathrm{e}$ and magnetic field
$\vec{B}_\mathrm{e}$. The dispersion relation of MHD waves is derived in the
framework of both standard and Hall-MHD and is numerically solved with input
parameters: the density contrast $\eta = \rho_\mathrm{e}/\rho_\mathrm{i}$, the
magnetic fields ratio $b = {B}_\mathrm{e}/{B}_\mathrm{i}$, and the Hall scale
parameter $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$. It is found that the Hall current, at moderate
values of $l_\mathrm{Hall}/a$, stimulates the emerging of KHI of the kink ($m =
1)$ and high-mode ($m \geqslant 2$) MHD waves, while for the sausage wave ($m =
0$) the trend is just the opposite---the KHI is suppressed.

can undergo a glass transition. All these transitions are independent of its

in which secondary tasks were re-defined by grouping similar tasks was
performed to investigate the extent to which ORs are affected by the specific
task definitions in SHRP2. A novel visual representation of multitasking was
developed to show which secondary tasks co-occur frequently and which ones do
not. MAD occurs in 11% of control driving segments, 22% of crashes and
near-crashes (CNC), 26% of Level 1-3 crashes and 39% of rear-end striking
crashes, and 9%, 16%, 17% and 28% respectively for the same event types if MAD
is defined in terms of general task groups. The most common co-occurrences of
secondary tasks vary substantially among event types; for example, 'Passenger
in adjacent seat - interaction' and 'Other non-specific internal eye glance'
tend to co-occur in CNC but tend not to co-occur in control driving segments.
The odds ratios of MAD compared to driving without any secondary task and the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals are 2.38 (2.17-2.61) for CNC, 3.72
(3.11-4.45) for Level 1-3 crashes and 8.48 (5.11-14.07) for rear-end striking

confirm that independently of whether secondary tasks are defined according to
SHRP2 or general task groups, the reduction of driving performance from MAD
observed in simulator studies is manifested in real-world crashes as well.

critical problem in numerous applications, such as self-driving cars and
socially aware robots. Challenges concentrate on capturing pedestrians' motion
patterns and social interactions, as well as handling the future uncertainties.
Recent studies focus on modeling pedestrians' motion patterns with recurrent
neural networks, capturing social interactions with pooling-based or
graph-based methods, and handling future uncertainties by using random Gaussian
noise as the latent variable. However, they do not integrate specific obstacle
avoidance experience (OAE) that may improve prediction performance. For
example, pedestrians' future trajectories are always influenced by others in
front. Here we propose GTPPO (Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo
Oracle), an encoder-decoder-based method conditioned on pedestrians' future
behaviors. Pedestrians' motion patterns are encoded with a long short-term
memory unit, which introduces the temporal attention to highlight specific time
steps. Their interactions are captured by a graph-based attention mechanism,
which draws OAE into the data-driven learning process of graph attention.
Future uncertainties are handled by generating multi-modal outputs with an
informative latent variable. Such a variable is generated by a novel pseudo
oracle predictor, which minimizes the knowledge gap between historical and
ground-truth trajectories. Finally, the GTPPO is evaluated on ETH, UCY and
Stanford Drone datasets, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Besides, the qualitative evaluations show successful cases of
handling sudden motion changes in the future. Such findings indicate that GTPPO
can peek into the future.

both low and intermediate transverse momenta ($p_T$). In AA collisions, the

$\Lambda_c/D^0$ data indicates a further enhancement at intermediate $p_T$.
Here, we report on our recent developments for a comprehensive description of
the charm hadrochemistry and transport in $pp$ and $AA$ collisions. For $pp$
collisions we find that the discrepancy between the $\Lambda_c/D^0$ data and
model predictions is much reduced by using a statistical hadronization model
augmented by a large set of ""missing"" states in the charm-baryon spectrum,
contributing to the $\Lambda_c$ via decay feeddown. For $AA$ collisions, we
develop a 4-momentum conserving resonance recombination model for charm-baryon
formation implemented via event-by-event simulations that account for
space-momentum correlations (SMCs) in transported charm- and thermal
light-quark distributions. The SMCs, together with the augmented charm-baryon
states, are found to play an important role in describing the baryon-to-meson
enhancement at intermediate momenta. We emphasize the importance of satisfying
the correct (relative) chemical equilibrium limit when computing the charm
hadrochemistry and its momentum dependence with coalescence models.

possibility that measurements of them can provide strict tests of CPT
invariance in gravitational waves. When CPT violation exists, if any,
gravitational waves with different circular polarizations could gain a slight
difference in propagating speeds. Hence, the birefringence of gravitational
waves is induced and there should be a rotation of plus and cross modes. For
CPT-violating dispersion relation ${\omega^{2}=k^{2}}$ ${\pm 2\zeta k^{3}}$,
where a sign ${\pm}$ denotes different circular polarizations, we find no
substantial deviations from CPT invariance in gravitational waves by analyzing
a compilation of ten signals of binary black holes in the LIGO-Virgo catalog
GWTC-1. We obtain a strict constraint on the CPT-violating parameter, i.e.,
$\zeta=0.14^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times10^{-15}\text{m}$, which is around two orders
of magnitude better than the existing one. Therefore, this study stands for the

re-projected on the original 3D shape and postprocessed using contextual

as matching pursuit (MP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), has been known
as a popular computationally-efficient alternative to the conventional
L1-minimization based methods. Under deterministic bounded noise corruption, in
this paper we derive coherence-based sufficient conditions guaranteeing correct
neighbor identification using MP/OMP. Our analyses exploit the maximum/minimum
inner product between two noisy data points subject to a known upper bound on
the noise level. The obtained sufficient condition clearly reveals the impact
of noise on greedy-based neighbor recovery. Specifically, it asserts that, as
long as noise is sufficiently small so that the resultant perturbed residual
vectors stay close to the desired subspace, both MP and OMP succeed in
returning a correct neighbor subset. A striking finding is that, when the
ground truth subspaces are well-separated from each other and noise is not
large, MP-based iterations, while enjoying lower algorithmic complexity, yield
smaller perturbation of residuals, thereby better able to identify correct
neighbors and, in turn, achieving higher global data clustering accuracy.
Extensive numerical experiments are used to corroborate our theoretical study.

distribution (or more generally a nonnegative vector) and its variants have
been widely used in areas such as machine learning and information retrieval.
To sample a random element $i$ (or a Gumbel-Max variable $i$) in proportion to
its positive weight $v_i$, the Gumbel-Max Trick first computes a Gumbel random
variable $g_i$ for each positive weight element $i$, and then samples the
element $i$ with the largest value of $g_i+\ln v_i$. Recently, applications
including similarity estimation and graph embedding require to generate $k$
independent Gumbel-Max variables from high dimensional vectors. However, it is
computationally expensive for a large $k$ (e.g., hundreds or even thousands)
when using the traditional Gumbel-Max Trick. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel algorithm, \emph{FastGM}, that reduces the time complexity from
$O(kn^+)$ to $O(k \ln k + n^+)$, where $n^+$ is the number of positive elements
in the vector of interest. Instead of computing $k$ independent Gumbel random
variables directly, we find that there exists a technique to generate these
variables in descending order. Using this technique, our method FastGM computes
variables $g_i+\ln v_i$ for all positive elements $i$ in descending order. As a
result, FastGM significantly reduces the computation time because we can stop
the procedure of Gumbel random variables computing for many elements especially
for those with small weights. Experiments on a variety of real-world datasets
show that FastGM is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods
without sacrificing accuracy and incurring additional expenses.

text input. Such frameworks typically consist of a feature prediction network
that maps character sequences to frequency-domain acoustic features, followed
by a waveform reconstruction algorithm or a neural vocoder that generates the
time-domain waveform from acoustic features. As the loss function is usually
calculated only for frequency-domain acoustic features, that doesn't directly
control the quality of the generated time-domain waveform. To address this
problem, we propose a new training scheme for Tacotron-based TTS, referred to
as WaveTTS, that has 2 loss functions: 1) time-domain loss, denoted as the
waveform loss, that measures the distortion between the natural and generated
waveform; and 2) frequency-domain loss, that measures the Mel-scale acoustic
feature loss between the natural and generated acoustic features. WaveTTS
ensures both the quality of the acoustic features and the resulting speech
waveform. To our best knowledge, this is the first implementation of Tacotron
with joint time-frequency domain loss. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework outperforms the baselines and achieves high-quality
synthesized speech.

represented as a linear transformation of a lower-dimensional latent factor

represented non-parametrically in terms of latent empirical orthogonal

and is learned entirely from data collected irregularly over space but
regularly over time. We propose innovative estimation and prediction methods
based on the latent low-rank structures. Asymptotic properties of the
estimators and predictors are established. Extensive experiments on synthetic

the spatial, temporal and variable-wise covariance structures are largely
preserved. The efficacy of our method is further confirmed by the prediction
performances on both synthetic and real data sets.

NRCan has been investigating the inclusion of UAV-borne radiation survey
spectrometers into its aerial survey response procedures. The Advanced
Radiation Detector for UAV Operations (ARDUO) was developed to exploit the
flight and lift capabilities available in the under 25kg class of UAVs. The
detector features eight 2.8cm x 2.8cm x 5.6cm CsI(Tl) crystals in a
self-shielding configuration, read out with silicon photomultipliers and
digitized using miniaturized custom electronics. The ARDUO is flown on a main-
and tail-rotor UAV called Responder which has a 6kg lift capacity and up to
40min. endurance. The performance of the ARDUO-Responder UAV system was
characterized in both lab and outdoor trials. Outdoor trials consisted of
aerial surveys over sealed point sources and over a distributed source. Results
show how the directional response of the ARDUO can provide an indication in
real time of source location for in-flight guidance. As well, the results show
how use of the directional information in post-acquisition processing can
result in improved spatial resolution of radiation features for both point and
distributed sources.

q-parameters in nonextensive statistics, and so they are generally not the same

simulations together with quantitative wavefunction analysis reveal an
unforeseen difference between the exciton formed upon excitation of
[Ru(bpy)2(bpy-C17)]2+ embedded in a lipid bilayer and in water, despite the
media does not influence the charge-transfer character and the excitation
energy of the absorption spectra. In water the exciton is mainly delocalized
over two ligands and the presence of non-polar substituents induces
directionality of the electronic transition. Instead, when the photosensitizer
is embedded into a lipid membrane, the exciton size diminishes and is more
localized at one bypyridyl site due to electrostatic interactions with the
positively charged surface of the bilayer. These differences show that the
electronic structure of metal complexes can be controlled through the binding
to external species, underscoring the crucial role of the environment in
directing the electronic flow upon excitation and thus helping rational tuning
of optogenetic agents.
