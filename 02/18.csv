that $A = PDP^{-1}$ with $D$ being a diagonal matrix needs two steps: first
find the eigenvalues and then find the corresponding eigenvectors. We show that
we do not need the second step when diagonalizing matrices with a spectrum,
$\left|\sigma(A)\right|\leq 2$ since those vectors already appear as nonzero
columns of the $\textit{eigenmatrices}$, a term defined in this work. We
further generalize this for matrices with $\left|\sigma(A)\right|> 2$ and show
that eigenvectors lie in the column spaces of eigenmatrices of the
complementary eigenvalues, an approach without using the classical Gauss-Jordan
elimination of rows of a matrix.
  We introduce two major results, namely, the $\textit{2-Spectrum Lemma}$ and
the $\textit{Eigenmatrix Theorem}$. As a conjecture, we further generalize the
Jordan canonical forms for a new class of generalized eigenvectors that are
produced by repeated multiples of certain eigenmatrices. We also provide
several shortcut formulas to find eigenvectors that does not use echelon forms.
The method discussed in this work may be summarized with the mnemonic ""Find
your puppy at your neighbors'!"" argument, where puppy is the eigenvector and
the neighbors are the complementary eigenmatrices.

for representation learning, by training an encoder to retain all information

other, excess information in the representation. The original formulation,
however, requires labeled data to identify the superfluous information. In this
work, we extend this ability to the multi-view unsupervised setting, where two
views of the same underlying entity are provided but the label is unknown. This
enables us to identify superfluous information as that not shared by both
views. A theoretical analysis leads to the definition of a new multi-view model
that produces state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy dataset and label-limited
versions of the MIR-Flickr dataset. We also extend our theory to the
single-view setting by taking advantage of standard data augmentation
techniques, empirically showing better generalization capabilities when
compared to common unsupervised approaches for representation learning.

allocation time. Generally speaking, the state of the art provides limited
partial solutions that address the first constraint by imposing a stack
discipline and by leaving the second constraint to programmers' assertions. We
propose a novel approach based on the idea of fractional types. As a simple
intuitive example, allocation of a new boolean value initialized to

of as a garbage collection (GC) process specialized to reclaim, and only
reclaim, storage containing the value $\texttt{false}$. This GC process is a

galaxies with the latter usually easier to detect. Several theories have been
proposed in the literature to explain their formation and prevalence, including
tidal interactions with external galaxies. Observational correlations also
suggest the importance of tides for warp formation. Here, we use the TNG100 run
from the magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite IllustrisTNG to
investigate the connection between interactions and the formation of gas warps.
We find that in the sample of well-resolved gas-rich spiral galaxies
($10^{10}\lesssim\mathrm{M_{*}/M_{\odot}}\lesssim10^{11}$ at $z=0$) from the
simulation TNG100-1, about $16\%$ possess the characteristic S-shaped warp.
Around one third of these objects have their vertical morphology induced by
interactions with other galaxies. Half of these interactions end with the
perturber absorbed by the host. Warps formed in interactions are more
asymmetrical than the remaining sample, however after the interaction the
asymmetry decreases with time. We find that warps induced by interactions
survive on average for $<1$ Gyr. The angle between the orbital angular momentum
of the perturber and the angular momentum of the host's disk that most likely
leads to warp formation is around 45 degrees. While our main goal is to
investigate tidally induced warps, we find that during interactions in addition
to tides, new gas that is accreted from infalling satellites also can
contribute to warp formation.

with active cyber deception. Active deception in a network employs decoy
systems and other defenses to conduct defensive planning against the intrusion
of malicious attackers who have been confirmed by sensing systems. In this
setting, the defender's objective is to ensure the satisfaction of security
properties specified in temporal logic formulas. We formulate the problem of
deceptive planning with decoy systems and other defenses as a two-player games
with asymmetrical information and Boolean payoffs in temporal logic. We use
level-2 hypergame with temporal logic objectives to capture the
incomplete/incorrect knowledge of the attacker about the network system as a
payoff misperception. The true payoff function is private information of the
defender. Then, we extend the solution concepts of $omega$-regular games to
analyze the attacker's rational strategy given her incomplete information. By
generalizing the solution of level-2 hypergame in the normal form to extensive
form, we extend the solutions of games with safe temporal logic objectives to
decide whether the defender can ensure security properties to be satisfied with
probability one, given any possible strategy that is perceived to be rational
by the attacker. Further, we use the solution of games with co-safe
(reachability) temporal logic objectives to determine whether the defender can
engage the attacker, by directing the attacker to a high-fidelity honeypot. The
effectiveness of the proposed synthesis methods is illustrated with synthetic
network systems with honeypots.

we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding

between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current

this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we
propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and
independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers
with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to
train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better

reachability objectives, known as reachability games, where the objective of
Player 1 (P1) is to reach a set of goal states, and that of Player 2 (P2) is to
prevent this. In particular, we consider the case where the players have
asymmetric information about each other's action capabilities: P2 starts with
an incomplete information (misperception) about P1's action set, and updates
the misperception when P1 uses an action previously unknown to P2. When P1 is
made aware of P2's misperception, the key question is whether P1 can control
P2's perception so as to deceive P2 into selecting actions to P1's advantage?
We show that there might exist a deceptive winning strategy for P1 that ensures
P1's objective is achieved with probability one from a state otherwise losing
for P1, had the information being symmetric and complete. We present three key
results: First, we introduce a dynamic hypergame model to capture the
reachability game with evolving misperception of P2. Second, we present a
fixed-point algorithm to compute the Deceptive Almost-Sure Winning (DASW)
region and DASW strategy. Finally, we show that DASW strategy is at least as
powerful as Almost-Sure Winning (ASW) strategy in the game in which P1 does not
account for P2's misperception. We illustrate our algorithm using a robot
motion planning in an adversarial environment.

small-scale examples and can use these to construct new configurations at a
larger size that serve as a precursor to observations at scales that are

enhance the system security performance, the advanced intelligent reflecting

station (BS), legitimate information receiver (IR) and eavesdropper (Eve) are
equipped with multiple antennas. With the aim for maximizing the secrecy rate
(SR), the transmit precoding (TPC) matrix at the BS, covariance matrix of AN
and phase shifts at the IRS are jointly optimized subject to constrains of
transmit power limit and unit modulus of IRS phase shifts. Then, the secrecy
rate maximization (SRM) problem is formulated, which is a non-convex problem
with multiple coupled variables. To tackle it, we propose to utilize the block
coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to alternately update the TPC matrix, AN
covariance matrix, and phase shifts while keeping SR non-decreasing.
Specifically, the optimal TPC matrix and AN covariance matrix are derived by
Lagrangian multiplier method, and the optimal phase shifts are obtained by
Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm. Since all variables can be calculated
in closed form, the proposed algorithm is very efficient. We also extend the
SRM problem to the more general multiple-IRs scenario and propose a BCD

minimizing the duality gap. In the online setting, we control a single player
playing against an arbitrary opponent and aim to minimize the regret. For both

$T$ the total number of timesteps. Our results do not require additional

a general-sum matrix game with these bounds as the payoff matrices. As finding
the Nash Equilibrium of a general-sum game is computationally hard, our

3) supporting attacks in not only white-box, but also black-box hard-label

we propose GRAPHITE, an efficient and general framework for generating attacks
that satisfy the above three key requirements. GRAPHITE takes advantage of
transform-robustness, a metric based on expectation over transforms (EoT), to
automatically generate small masks and optimize with gradient-free
optimization. GRAPHITE is also flexible as it can easily trade-off
transform-robustness, perturbation size, and query count in black-box settings.

difficulty of being stored on one single machine. Even when the data can be
stored in one machine, the computational cost would still be intimidating. We
propose a divide and conquer solution to density estimation using Bayesian
mixture modeling including the infinite mixture case. The methodology can be
generalized to other application problems where a Bayesian mixture model is
adopted. The proposed prior on each machine or subsample modifies the original
prior on both mixing probabilities as well as on the rest of parameters in the
distributions being mixed. The ultimate estimator is obtained by taking the
average of the posterior samples corresponding to the proposed prior on each
subset. Despite the tremendous reduction in time thanks to data splitting, the
posterior contraction rate of the proposed estimator stays the same (up to a
log factor) as that of the original prior when the data is analyzed as a whole.
Simulation studies also justify the competency of the proposed method compared
to the established WASP estimator in the finite dimension case. In addition,
one of our simulations is performed in a shape constrained deconvolution
context and reveals promising results. The application to a GWAS data set
reveals the advantage over a naive method that uses the original prior.

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network in finite blocklength (short

users. The overall reliability consists of the transmission error probability
and the queuing delay violation probability. The performance of the two-users
NOMA network in finite blocklength is verified for achieving latency and
reliability, using the effective capacity (EC) framework. Specifically, we
derive closed-form expressions for the EC of the two-users NOMA network in
finite blocklength regime, considering transmissions over Rayleigh fading
channels. We also study a multiuser NOMA network and derive the total EC of
two-users NOMA subsets, and show that the NOMA set with users having distinct
channel conditions achieve maximum total EC. Focusing on a two-users NOMA
network, we study the impact of the transmit signal-to-noise ratio, delay
exponent, and transmission error probability, on the achievable EC of each
user. The analysis shows that when the delay exponent is high, the delay
violation probability does not improve below a certain value due to the
dominant factor of the transmission error probability. The accuracy of the
proposed closed-form expressions for the individual EC of a two-users NOMA is
verified using the Monte-Carlo simulations.

following non-resonant photoexcitation of free electron-hole pairs have been
challenging to directly probe because of their inherently fast timescales. Here
we use extremely short optical pulses to non-resonantly excite an electron-hole
plasma and show the formation of two-dimensional excitons in single-layer MoS2
on the timescale of 30 fs via the induced changes to photo-absorption. These
formation dynamics are significantly faster than in conventional 2D quantum

TMDs. A theoretical model of a coherent polarization that dephases and relaxes
to an incoherent exciton population reproduces the experimental dynamics on the
sub-100-fs timescale and sheds light into the underlying mechanism of how the
lowest-energy excitons, which are the most important for optoelectronic
applications, form from higher-energy excitations. Importantly, a
phonon-mediated exciton cascade from higher energy states to the ground
excitonic state is found to be the rate-limiting process. These results set an

forces to be evaluated at random and optimal time-steps, leading to strong
savings in direct space. The accuracy and computational performances of a first
BOUNCE implementation dedicated to classical (non-polarizable) force fields is
tested in the cases of pure direct-space droplet-like simulations and of
periodic boundary conditions (PBC) simulations using Smooth Particule Mesh
Ewald. An analysis of the capability of BOUNCE to reproduce several condensed
phase properties is provided. Since electrostatics and van der Waals 2-body
contributions are evaluated much less often than with standard integrators

Applying the reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA(1)) to
reciprocal space (many-body) interactions allows BOUNCE-RESPA(1) to maintain
large speedups in PBC while maintaining precision. Overall, we show that

forgetting, but they are typically adversary agnostic, i.e., they do not
consider the possibility of a malicious attack. In this effort, we explore the
vulnerability of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a popular continual
learning algorithm for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We show that an
intelligent adversary can bypass the EWC's defenses, and instead cause gradual

control of the model via injection of ""backdoor"" attack samples on both
permuted and split benchmark variants of the MNIST dataset. Importantly, once
the model has learned the adversarial misinformation, the adversary can then
control the amount of forgetting of any task. Equivalently, the malicious actor
can create a ""false memory"" about any task by inserting carefully-designed
backdoor samples to any fraction of the test instances of that task. Perhaps
most damaging, we show this vulnerability to be very acute; neural network
memory can be easily compromised with the addition of backdoor samples into as

methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the
provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for
helping public health planning and policymaking.

annotation process is exhaustive and time consuming, specially for large

that exploit very large raw sensor data readings. In such systems, sensor
readings are collected from activity-monitoring sensors in a 24/7 manner. The
size of the generated dataset is so huge that it is almost impossible for a
human annotator to give a certain label to every single instance in the
dataset. This results in annotation gaps in the input data to the adopting
supervised learning system. The performance of the recognition system is
negatively affected by these gaps. In this work, we propose and investigate
three different paradigms to handle these gaps. In the first paradigm, the gaps
are taken out by dropping all unlabeled readings. A single ""Unknown"" or
""Do-Nothing"" label is given to the unlabeled readings within the operation of
the second paradigm. The last paradigm handles these gaps by giving every one
of them a unique label identifying the encapsulating deterministic labels.
Also, we propose a semantic preprocessing method of annotation gaps by
constructing a hybrid combination of some of these paradigms for further
performance improvement. The performance of the proposed three paradigms and
their hybrid combination is evaluated using an ADL benchmark dataset containing
more than $2.5\times 10^6$ sensor readings that had been collected over more
than nine months. The evaluation results emphasize the performance contrast
under the operation of each paradigm and support a specific gap handling
approach for better performance.

correction (QEC) for qubits. We develop a leakage-detection scheme via Hidden
Markov models (HMMs) for transmon-based implementations of the surface code. By
performing realistic density-matrix simulations of the distance-3 surface code

increase in the surface-code defect probability of neighboring stabilizers.
Together with the analog readout of the ancilla qubits, this increase enables
the accurate detection of the time and location of leakage. We restore the
logical error rate below the memory break-even point by post-selecting out
leakage, discarding about 47% of the data. Leakage detection via HMMs opens the
prospect for near-term QEC demonstrations, targeted leakage reduction and
leakage-aware decoding and is applicable to other experimental platforms.

between the optimal $Q$-value of the best actions and that of the second-best

two implications:
  1) In conjunction with the lower bound in [Du et al., ICLR 2020], our upper
bound suggests that the condition $\delta =

sufficient for algorithms with polynomial sample complexity.

that the solubility of nitrogen in methane increases linearly with pressure
while the solubility of nitrogen in ethane increases exponentially with
pressure at temperature 90 K. Solubility of nitrogen in both methane and ethane
exhibits an exponential decrease with temperature at a pressure of 3 atm. The
solubility of nitrogen in methane is much larger compared to that in ethane in
the range of pressure and temperature studied here. Our results are in
quantitative agreement with the available experimental measurements of the
solubility of nitrogen in methane and ethane. Furthermore, we find that the
surface adsorption of nitrogen increases with increasing pressure at
temperature 90 K, while the adsorption free energy increases with increasing
pressure. Moreover, we find that the surface tension decreases linearly with
pressure for both nitrogen-methane and nitrogen-ethane systems. The rate of
decrease of surface tension with pressure for nitrogen-ethane system is much
larger as compared to the nitrogen-methane system. Finally, we find that the
absorption of a nitrogen molecule into the liquid-phase from the interface is
diffusive and does not involve any appreciable energy barrier. Our results
suggest that homogeneous nucleation of bubbles is unlikely on Titan and the
bubble formation in the lakes on Titan must arise from heterogeneous nucleation

system primarily as a toy model for astrophysical (4-dimensional) black holes
formed from gravitational collapse. We investigate the effect of angular
momentum on the geometry inside the event horizon, and see qualitative changes
in the interior structure as a function of the spin parameter. For low spins,
we find that a central spacelike curvature singularity forms, connecting to a
singular, null Cauchy horizon. For spins above a threshold consistent with the
linear analysis of Dias, Reall and Santos, curvature on the Cauchy horizon
remains bounded, signaling a violation of the strong cosmic censorship
conjecture. Further increasing the spin leads to a decrease in the relative
size of the spacelike branch of the singularity, which vanishes completely
above a second threshold. In these high-spin cases, the interior evolution is
bounded by a regular Cauchy horizon, which extends all the way inward to a
regular, timelike origin. We further explore the geodesic focusing
(""gravitational shock-wave"") effect predicted to occur along the outgoing
branch of the inner horizon, first described by Marolf and Ori. Remarkably, we
observe the effect at late times in all of the black holes we form, even those

the Higgs to electroweakino decays in the allowed MSSM parameter space after

phenomenological constraints such as flavour physics, Higgs measurements and
dark matter constraints. We explore some novel aspects of these Higgs decays.
The final states resulting from Higgs to electroweakino decays will have
backgrounds arising from the Standard Model as well as direct electroweakino
production at the LHC. We demonstrate explicit kinematical differences between
Higgs to electroweakino decays and associated backgrounds. Furthermore, we
demonstrate for a few specific example points, optimised analysis search
strategies at the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run. Finally, we comment on
possible search strategies for heavy Higgs decays to exotic final states, where
the lightest chargino is long lived and leads to a disappearing track at the

  Approximation","28 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-rank matrix approximation is extremely useful in the analysis of data
that arises in scientific computing, engineering applications, and data
science. However, as data sizes grow, traditional low-rank matrix approximation
methods, such as SVD and CPQR, are either prohibitively expensive or cannot
provide sufficiently accurate results. A solution is to use randomized low-rank
matrix approximation methods such as randomized SVD , and randomized LU
decomposition on extremely large data sets. In this paper, we focus on the
randomized LU decomposition method. First, we employ a reorthogonalization
procedure to perform the power iteration of the existing randomized LU
algorithm to compensate for the rounding errors caused by the power method.
Then we propose a novel randomized LU algorithm, called PowerLU, for the fixed
low-rank approximation problem. PowerLU allows for an arbitrary number of
passes of the input matrix, $v \geq 2$. Recall that the existing randomized LU
decomposition only allows an even number of passes. We prove the theoretical
relationship between PowerLU and the existing randomized LU. Numerical
experiments show that our proposed PowerLU is generally faster than the
existing randomized LU decomposition, while remaining accurate. We also propose
a version of PowerLU, called PowerLU_FP, for the fixed precision low-rank
matrix approximation problem. PowerLU_FP is based on an efficient blocked
adaptive rank determination Algorithm 4.1 proposed in this paper. We present
numerical experiments that show that PowerLU_FP can achieve almost the same
accuracy and is faster than the randomized blocked QB algorithm by Martinsson
and Voronin. We finally propose a single-pass algorithm based on LU
factorization. Tests show that the accuracy of our single-pass algorithm is
comparable with the existing single-pass algorithms.

of the fundamental, few-cycle, near-infrared (NIR) driving laser within the
30-cm-long HHG Xe medium plays in the generation of the intense HHG pulses.
Using an incident NIR intensity that is higher than what is required for
phase-matched HHG, signatures of reshaping are found by measuring the NIR
blueshift and the fluorescence from the HHG medium along the propagation axis.
These results are well reproduced by numerical calculations that show temporal
compression of the NIR pulses in the HHG medium. The simulations predict that
after refocusing an XUV beam waist radius of 320 nm and a clean attosecond
pulse train can be obtained in the focal plane, with an estimated XUV peak
intensity of 9x10^15 W/cm^2. Our results show that XUV intensities that were
previously only available at large-scale facilities can now be obtained using
moderately powerful table-top light sources.

over or even massless photons and gluons are exchanged in the t-channel. The
amplitudes for those higher-order processes, however, are divergent in the
collinear direction of the in- and out-going bath particles if the mediator is

This allows us to derive an expression for $0\nu\beta\beta$ rates for various

nuclear matrix elements, the neutrino masses, and the Wilson coefficients of
higher-dimensional operators. The needed hadronic low-energy constants and

interpolation formulae grounded in QCD and chiral perturbation theory that
improve existing formulae that are only valid in a small regime of neutrino

reduction techniques and implement a non-parametric agglomerate hierarchical
clustering method. We see that groups defined using abundances are spatially
separated, as a function of age. Furthermore, the abundance groups represent
different distributions in the [Fe/H]-age plane. Ordering our clusters by age
reveals patterns suggestive of the sequence of chemical enrichment in the disk
over time. Our results indicate that a promising avenue to trace the details of
the disk's assembly is via a full interpretation of the empirical connections

well-established low-energy probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).
In particular, with the axial-vector coupling of the nucleon $g_A$ determined
from lattice QCD, the comparison between experiment and SM prediction is
commonly used to derive constraints on right-handed currents. Further, in
addition to the CKM element $V_{us}$ from kaon decays, $V_{ud}$ from $\beta$
decays is a critical input for the test of CKM unitarity. Here, we point out
that the available information on $\beta$ decays can be re-interpreted as a
stringent test of lepton flavor universality (LFU). In fact, we find that the
ratio of $V_{us}$ from kaon decays over $V_{us}$ from $\beta$ decays (assuming
CKM unitarity) is extremely sensitive to LFU violation (LFUV) in
$W$-$\mu$-$\nu$ couplings thanks to a CKM enhancement by $(V_{ud}/V_{us})^2\sim
20$. From this perspective, recent hints for the violation of CKM unitarity can
be viewed as further evidence for LFUV, fitting into the existing picture
exhibited by semi-leptonic $B$ decays and the anomalous magnetic moments of
muon and electron. Finally, we comment on the future sensitivity that can be
reached with this LFU violating observable and discuss complementary probes of
LFU that may reach a similar level of precision, such as
$\Gamma(\pi\to\mu\nu)/\Gamma(\pi\to e\nu)$ at the PEN and PiENu experiments or

formation of planetesimals. Yet, the role of this instability in the driving of
turbulence in protoplanetary disks, given its fundamental nature as a linear
hydrodynamical instability, has so far not been investigated in detail. We
study the turbulence that is induced by the streaming instability as well as
its interaction with the vertical shear instability. For this purpose, we
employ the FLASH Code to conduct two-dimensional axisymmetric global disk
simulations spanning radii from $1$ au to $100$ au, including the mutual drag
between gas and dust as well as the radial and vertical stellar gravity. If the
streaming instability and the vertical shear instability start their growth at
the same time, we find the turbulence in the dust mid-plane layer to be
primarily driven by the streaming instability. It gives rise to vertical gas
motions with a Mach number of up to ${\sim}10^{-2}$. The dust scale height is
set in a self-regulatory manner to about $1\%$ of the gas scale height. In
contrast, if the vertical shear instability is allowed to saturate before the
dust is introduced into our simulations, then it continues to be the main
source of the turbulence in the dust layer. The vertical shear instability
induces turbulence with a Mach number of ${\sim}10^{-1}$ and thus impedes dust
sedimentation. Nonetheless, we find the vertical shear instability and the
streaming instability in combination to lead to radial dust concentration in
long-lived accumulations which are significantly denser than those formed by
the streaming instability alone. Thus, the vertical shear instability may
promote planetesimal formation by creating weak overdensities that act as seeds
for the streaming instability.

flows onto black holes (BHs) at the nuclei of protogalaxies, and study the
impact of mechanical and radiative feedback on rapid growth of BHs. The
outflows deposit mass, momentum and energy into the surrounding medium and
prevent mass accretion onto the BH, resulting in the reduction of radiative
output. We find that when the BH is embedded in a dense gas core, ionizing
radiation attenuated by inefficient BH feeding owing to mechanical feedback
hardly affects the gas dynamics at the BH gravitational sphere of influence,
from which intense inflows of neutral gas occur at rates substantially
exceeding the Eddington limit without impeded by photoionization and heating.
Since mechanical power of outflows driven by the rapidly accreting BH is
sufficiently strong, bipolar outflows completely evacuate the surrounding gas
in the polar region but mass inflows through the equatorial region maintain the
BH accretion rate as high as $\sim 300-10^3~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, which is
reduced by one order of magnitude from those with radiative feedback alone.
Furthermore, we find that the critical gas density required for rapid accretion
is lower by a factor of $\sim 3$ nearly independently of BH mass, when
mechanical feedback is considered. By studying the dependence on outflow model
parameters (e.g., opening angle, mass-loading degree into outflows, velocity),
we conclude that contrary to naive expectation, the existence of stronger
outflow leads to the transition to rapid accretion phases more efficiently.
Rapidly growing BHs inject mechanical power with $\sim 0.1-1\%$ of the
radiative luminosity into their host galaxy scales, which is used for
cosmological simulations.

streaming instability with external turbulence modelled by gas viscosity and
particle diffusion. We find the streaming instability is sensitive to
turbulence, with growth rates becoming negligible for alpha-viscosity

reducing the effect of diffusion. We then apply linear theory to global models

fully accounts for statistical and systematic uncertainties on stellar mass.
From $z$=0.4 to 1.5 the massive end of the SMF shows minimal evolution in its
shape: the characteristic mass ($M^\ast$) evolves by less than 0.1 dex
($\pm$0.05 dex); the number density of galaxies with $\log (M_\ast/M_\odot)
>11$ stays roughly constant at $\log (n/\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$ $\simeq$ $-$3.4

assumptions in the star formation history and details of stellar population
synthesis models for stellar mass estimations. For quiescent galaxies, the data
are consistent with no (or slight) evolution ($\lesssim0.1$ dex) in the
characteristic mass nor number density from $z\sim 1.5$ to the present. This
implies that any mass growth (presumably through ""dry"" mergers) of the
quiescent massive galaxy population must balance the rate of mass losses from
late-stage stellar evolution and the formation of quenching galaxies from the
star-forming population. We provide a limit on this mass growth from $z=1.0$ to
0.4 of $\Delta M_\ast/M_\ast\leq$ 45% (i.e., $\simeq0.16$ dex) for quiescent

systems were also discovered (central galaxies of A4059, A2052 and AS555). For
nine further galaxies, we detect a singly-imaged but closely-projected source
within 6 arcsec (including one candidate with sources at three different

Galactic Center (GC) X-ray Visionary Program obtained approximately 3 Ms (one
month) of Chandra HETG data, offering the only opportunity to examine the
quiescent X-ray emission of Sgr A* with high resolution spectroscopy. Utilizing
custom background regions and filters for removing overlapping point sources,
this work provides the first ever look at stacked HETG spectra of Sgr A*. We
model the background datasets with a cubic spline and fit the unbinned Sgr A*
spectra with a simple parametric model of a power law plus Gaussian lines under
the effects of interstellar extinction. We detect a strong 6.7 keV iron
emission line in the HEG spectra and a 3.1 keV emission line in the MEG
spectra. In all cases, the line centroids and equivalent widths are consistent
with those measured from low-resolution CCD spectra. An examination of the
unbinned, stacked HEG+/-1 spectrum reveals fine structure in the iron line
complex. In addition to resolving the resonant and forbidden lines from He-like
iron, there are apparent emission features arising with higher statistical
significance at lower energy, potentially associated with FeXX-XXIV ions in a
~1 keV plasma arising near the Bondi radius of Sgr A*. With this work, we
release the cleaned and stacked Sgr A* and background HETG spectra to the
public as a special legacy dataset.

beam^{-1}}$. We detect 35 sources at high significance (Fidelity $\geq0.5$), 32
of these have well characterized near-infrared HST counterparts.
  We estimate the 1.2 mm number counts to flux levels of $<30\thinspace{\rm\mu
Jy}$ in two different ways: we first use the detected sources to constrain the
number counts and find a significant flattening of the counts below $S_\nu \sim
0.1$ mJy. In a second approach, we constrain the number counts by using a
probability of deflection statistics (P(D)) analysis. For this latter approach,
we describe new methods to accurately measure the noise in interferometric
imaging (employing jack-knifing in the cube and in the visibility plane). This
independent measurement confirms the flattening of the number counts. Our
analysis of the differential number counts shows that we are detecting
$\sim$93% ($\sim$100% if we include the lower fidelity detections) of the total
continuum dust emission associated to galaxies in the HUDF.
  The ancillary data allows us to study the dependence of the 1.2 mm number
counts on redshift ($z=0-4$), galaxy dust mass (${\rm M}_{\rm
dust}=10^{7}-10^{9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$), stellar mass (${\rm

galaxy evolution models and the understanding of star-forming galaxies at high

combines Multilinear Compressive Sensing and Machine Learning into an

idea behind MCL is the assumption of the existence of a tensor subspace which
can capture the essential features from the signal for the downstream learning
task. Thus, the ability to find such a discriminative tensor subspace and
optimize the system to project the signals onto that data manifold plays an
important role in Multilinear Compressive Learning. In this paper, we propose a
novel solution to address both of the aforementioned requirements, i.e., How to
find those tensor subspaces in which the signals of interest are highly
separable? and How to optimize the sensing and feature synthesis components to
transform the original signals to the data manifold found in the first
question? In our proposal, the discovery of a high-quality data manifold is
conducted by training a nonlinear compressive learning system on the inference
task. Its knowledge of the data manifold of interest is then progressively
transferred to the MCL components via multi-stage supervised training with the
supervisory information encoding how the compressed measurements, the
synthesized features, and the predictions should be like. The proposed
knowledge transfer algorithm also comes with a semi-supervised adaption that
enables compressive learning models to utilize unlabeled data effectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed knowledge transfer method

the empirical upper luminosity limit of red supergiants, the Humphrey-Davidson
(HD) limit at high and low metallicity. In this study, we provide a better
understanding of what drives massive star evolution to blue and red supergiant
phases, with the ultimate aim of reproducing the HD limit at varied
metallicities (Z). For solar, LMC, and SMC Z, we develop eight grids of MESA
models for the mass range 20-60M to probe the effect of semiconvection and
overshooting. We compare rotating and non-rotating models with efficient
(alpha_semi = 100) and inefficient semi-convection (alpha_semi = 0.1), with
high and low core overshooting (alpha_ov of 0.1 or 0.5). The red and blue
supergiant evolutionary phases are investigated by comparing the fraction of
core He-burning lifetimes spent in each phase. We find that the extension of
the convective core by overshooting alpha_ov = 0.5 has an effect on the post-MS
evolution which can disable semiconvection leading to more RSGs, but a lack of
BSGs. We therefore implement alpha_ov = 0.1 which switches on semiconvective
mixing, though for standard alpha_semi = 1, would result in an HD limit which
is higher than observed at low Z. Therefore, we need to implement very
efficient semiconvection of alpha_semi = 100 which reproduces the HD limit at
log L ~ 5.5 for the Magellanic Clouds while simultaneously reproducing the
Galactic HD limit of log L ~ 5.8 naturally. The effect of semiconvection is not
active at high Z due to the depletion of the envelope structure by strong mass
loss such that semiconvective regions could not form. Z-dependent mass loss
plays an indirect, yet decisive role in setting the HD limit as a function of
Z. For a combination of efficient semiconvection and low overshooting with
standard Z-dependent mass loss, we find a natural HD limit at all
metallicities.

length $O(\log n\cdot \log(nw)+\log n\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon))$ and error
$\varepsilon$. It remains a central question to reduce the seed length to
$O(\log (nw/\varepsilon))$, which would prove that $\mathbf{BPL}=\mathbf{L}$.
However, there has been no improvement on Nisan's construction for the case
$n=w$, which is most relevant to space-bounded derandomization.
  Recently, in a beautiful work, Braverman, Cohen and Garg (STOC'18) introduced
the notion of a pseudorandom pseudo-distribution (PRPD) and gave an explicit
construction of a PRPD with seed length $\tilde{O}(\log n\cdot
\log(nw)+\log(1/\varepsilon))$. A PRPD is a relaxation of a pseudorandom
generator, which suffices for derandomizing $\mathbf{BPL}$ and also implies a
hitting set. Unfortunately, their construction is quite involved and
complicated. Hoza and Zuckerman (FOCS'18) later constructed a much simpler
hitting set generator with seed length $O(\log n\cdot
\log(nw)+\log(1/\varepsilon))$, but their techniques are restricted to hitting
sets.
  In this work, we construct a PRPD with seed length $$O(\log n\cdot \log
(nw)\cdot \log\log(nw)+\log(1/\varepsilon)).$$ This improves upon the
construction in [BCG18] by a $O(\log\log(1/\varepsilon))$ factor, and is
optimal in the small error regime. In addition, we believe our construction and
analysis to be simpler than the work of Braverman, Cohen and Garg.

(AEVB), practitioners often let the variational distribution serve as a
surrogate for the posterior distribution. This approach yields biased estimates
of the expected risk, and therefore leads to poor decisions for two reasons.
First, the model fit with AEVB may not equal the underlying data distribution.
Second, the variational distribution may not equal the posterior distribution
under the fitted model. We explore how fitting the variational distribution
based on several objective functions other than the ELBO, while continuing to
fit the generative model based on the ELBO, affects the quality of downstream
decisions. For the probabilistic principal component analysis model, we
investigate how importance sampling error, as well as the bias of the model
parameter estimates, varies across several approximate posteriors when used as
proposal distributions. Our theoretical results suggest that a posterior
approximation distinct from the variational distribution should be used for
making decisions. Motivated by these theoretical results, we propose learning
several approximate proposals for the best model and combining them using
multiple importance sampling for decision-making. In addition to toy examples,
we present a full-fledged case study of single-cell RNA sequencing. In this
challenging instance of multiple hypothesis testing, our proposed approach
surpasses the current state of the art.

that when a material composed of stiff inclusions embedded in a fibrous network

base station (BS) and K single-antenna receivers. We consider RS in its most
general form, and joint decoding to fully exploit the potential of RS. First,
we investigate the achievable rates under joint decoding and formulate the
precoder design problems to maximize a general utility function, or to minimize
the transmit power under pre-defined rate targets. Building upon the
concave-convex procedure (CCCP), we propose precoder design algorithms for an
arbitrary number of users. Our proposed algorithms approximate the intractable
non-convex problems with a number of successively refined convex problems, and
provably converge to stationary points of the original problems. Then, to
reduce the decoding complexity, we consider the optimization of the precoder
and the decoding order under successive decoding. Further, we propose a stream
selection algorithm to reduce the number of precoded signals. With a reduced
number of streams and successive decoding at the receivers, our proposed
algorithm can even be implemented when the number of users is relatively large,
whereas the complexity was previously considered as prohibitively high in the
same setting. Finally, we propose a simple adaptation of our algorithms to
account for the imperfection of the channel state information at the
transmitter. Numerical results demonstrate that the general RS scheme provides
a substantial performance gain as compared to state-of-the-art linear precoding
schemes, especially with a moderately large number of users.

to the simulated galaxies based on their average molecular surface density and
metallicity, yielding substantial variations in $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ and
significant differences between models. Using this, predicted $z=0$ COLFs agree
better with data than predicted H2MFs. Out to $z\sim 2$, EAGLE's and Simba's

their trends with $M_*$ are broadly reproduced in all models, but EAGLE yields
too little HI in green valley galaxies, TNG and Simba overproduce cold gas in
massive galaxies, and Simba overproduces molecular gas in small systems. Using
Simba variants that exclude individual AGN feedback modules, we find that
Simba's AGN jet feedback is primarily responsible by lowering cold gas contents

galaxies, while X-ray feedback suppresses the formation of high-$\mu_*$

illumination discrepancy. In this paper, we present a novel Dual-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) for photo-realistic face frontalization
by capturing both contextual dependencies and local consistency during GAN
training. Specifically, a self-attention-based generator is introduced to
integrate local features with their long-range dependencies yielding better
feature representations, and hence generate faces that preserve identities
better, especially for larger pose angles. Moreover, a novel
face-attention-based discriminator is applied to emphasize local features of
face regions, and hence reinforce the realism of synthetic frontal faces.
Guided by semantic segmentation, four independent discriminators are used to
distinguish between different aspects of a face (\ie skin, keypoints, hairline,
and frontalized face). By introducing these two complementary attention
mechanisms in generator and discriminator separately, we can learn a richer
feature representation and generate identity preserving inference of frontal
views with much finer details (i.e., more accurate facial appearance and
textures) comparing to the state-of-the-art. Quantitative and qualitative
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DA-GAN

fraction of hydrogen-rich, Type II SN progenitors which have their evolution
affected by mass exchange with their companion, finding this to be between 1/3
and 1/2 for most assumptions. Here we study in more depth the impact of this
binary history of Type II SN progenitors on their final pre-SN core mass
distribution, using population synthesis simulations. We find that binary star
progenitors of Type II SNe typically end their life with a larger core mass
than they would have had if they had lived in isolation, because they gained
mass or merged with a companion before explosion. The combination of the
diverse binary evolutionary paths typically lead to a marginally shallower
final core mass distribution. Discussing our results in the context of the red
supergiant problem, i.e., the reported lack of detected high luminosity
progenitors, we conclude that binary evolution does not seem to significantly
affect the issue. This conclusion is quite robust against our variations in the
assumptions of binary physics. We also predict that inferring the initial
masses of Type II SN progenitors from ""age-dating"" its surrounding environment
systematically yields lower masses compared to methods that probe the pre-SN
core mass or luminosity. A robust discrepancy between the inferred initial
masses of a SN progenitor from those different techniques could indicate an
evolutionary history of binary mass accretion or merging.

which require to be simultaneously served not just with low latency and
sufficient reliability, but also with high spectral efficiency, future networks
(i.e., 6G) should be capable of meeting this demand by introducing new
effective transmission designs. Motivated by this, a novel modulation technique
termed as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with subcarrier power
modulation (OFDM-SPM) is proposed for providing highly spectral-efficient data
transmission with low-latency and less-complexity for future 6G wireless
communication systems. OFDM-SPM utilizes the power of subcarriers in OFDM
blocks as a third dimension to convey extra information bits while reducing
both complexity and latency compared to conventional schemes. In this paper,
the concept of OFDM-SPM is introduced and its validity as a future adopted
modulation technique is investigated over a wireless multipath Rayleigh fading
channel. The proposed system structure is explained, an analytical expression
of the bit error rate (BER) is derived, and numerical simulations of BER and
throughput performances of OFDM-SPM are carried out. OFDM-SPM is found to
greatly enhance the spectral efficiency where it is capable of doubling it.
Additionally, OFDM-SPM introduces negligible complexity to the system, does not
exhibit error propagation, reduces the transmission delay, and decreases the
transmission power by half.

text-to-speech, can be posed as estimating the density of the output y given
the input x: p(y|x). Given this interpretation, it is natural to evaluate
sequence-to-sequence models using conditional log-likelihood on a test set.
However, the goal of sequence-to-sequence generation (or structured prediction)
is to find the best output y^ given an input x, and each task has its own
downstream metric R that scores a model output by comparing against a set of
references y*: R(y^, y* | x). While we hope that a model that excels in density
estimation also performs well on the downstream metric, the exact correlation
has not been studied for sequence generation tasks. In this paper, by comparing
several density estimators on five machine translation tasks, we find that the
correlation between rankings of models based on log-likelihood and BLEU varies
significantly depending on the range of the model families being compared.
First, log-likelihood is highly correlated with BLEU when we consider models
within the same family (e.g. autoregressive models, or latent variable models
with the same parameterization of the prior). However, we observe no
correlation between rankings of models across different families: (1) among
non-autoregressive latent variable models, a flexible prior distribution is
better at density estimation but gives worse generation quality than a simple
prior, and (2) autoregressive models offer the best translation performance
overall, while latent variable models with a normalizing flow prior give the
highest held-out log-likelihood across all datasets. Therefore, we recommend
using a simple prior for the latent variable non-autoregressive model when fast
generation speed is desired.

effect of small noise on the classical deterministically stable fast traveling
pulse. Our method is based on adapting the velocity of the traveling wave by
solving a scalar stochastic ordinary differential equation (SODE) and tracking
perturbations to the wave meeting a system of a scalar stochastic partial
differential equation (SPDE) coupled to a scalar ordinary differential equation
(ODE). This approach has been recently employed by Kr\""uger and Stannat for
scalar stochastic bistable reaction-diffusion equations such as the Nagumo
equation. A main difference in our situation of an SPDE coupled to an ODE is
that the linearization has essential spectrum parallel to the imaginary axis
and thus only generates a strongly continuous semigroup. Furthermore, the
linearization around the traveling wave is not self-adjoint anymore, so that
fluctuations around the wave cannot be expected to be orthogonal in a
corresponding inner product. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome
by making use of Riesz instead of orthogonal spectral projections as recently
employed in a series of papers by Hamster and Hupkes in case of analytic
semigroups. We expect that our approach can also be applied to traveling waves
and other patterns in more general situations such as systems of SPDEs with
linearizations only generating a strongly continuous semigroup. This provides a
relevant generalization as these systems are prevalent in many applications.

distinguishing between natural pairs of related distributions from samples that

  In our first result, we show that any algorithm that distinguishes between
uniform distribution on $\{0,1\}^n$ and uniform distribution on an
$n/2$-dimensional linear subspace of $\{0,1\}^n$ with non-negligible advantage
needs $2^{\Omega(n)}$ samples or $\Omega(n^2)$ memory.
  Our second result applies to distinguishing outputs of Goldreich's local
pseudorandom generator from the uniform distribution on the output domain.
Specifically, Goldreich's pseudorandom generator $G$ fixes a predicate
$P:\{0,1\}^k \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ and a collection of subsets $S_1, S_2,
\ldots, S_m \subseteq [n]$ of size $k$. For any seed $x \in \{0,1\}^n$, it
outputs $P(x_{S_1}), P(x_{S_2}), \ldots, P(x_{S_m})$ where $x_{S_i}$ is the
projection of $x$ to the coordinates in $S_i$. We prove that whenever $P$ is
$t$-resilient (all non-zero Fourier coefficients of $(-1)^P$ are of degree $t$
or higher), then no algorithm, with $<n^\epsilon$ memory, can distinguish the
output of $G$ from the uniform distribution on $\{0,1\}^m$ with a large inverse
polynomial advantage, for stretch $m \le
\left(\frac{n}{t}\right)^{\frac{(1-\epsilon)}{36}\cdot t}$ (barring some
restrictions on $k$). The lower bound holds in the streaming model where at
each time step $i$, $S_i\subseteq [n]$ is a randomly chosen (ordered) subset of

the environmental alteration. These collected data are used to learn the
environmental patterns using a predictive model approach. The agitation labels,

both to accelerate energetic particles and to produce fast observed
variability. These dual requirements may be satisfied by collisionless
relativistic magnetic reconnection. On the one hand, relativistic reconnection
can energize gamma-ray emitting electrons. On the other, as previous kinetic
simulations have shown, the reconnection acceleration mechanism preferentially
focuses high-energy particles -- and their emitted photons -- into beams, which
may create rapid blips in flux as they cross a telescope's line of sight. Using
a series of 2D pair-plasma particle-in-cell simulations, we explicitly
demonstrate the critical role played by radiative cooling in mediating the
observable signatures of this `kinetic beaming' effect. Only in our efficiently
cooled simulations do we measure kinetic beaming beyond one light crossing time
of the reconnection layer. We find a correlation between the cooling strength
and the photon energy range across which persistent kinetic beaming occurs:
stronger cooling coincides with a wider range of beamed photon energies. We
also apply our results to rapid gamma-ray flares in flat-spectrum radio
quasars, suggesting that a paradigm of radiatively efficient kinetic beaming
constrains relevant emission models. In particular, beaming-produced
variability may be more easily realized in two-zone (e.g. spine-sheath)
set-ups, with Compton seed photons originating in the jet itself, rather than
in one-zone external Compton scenarios.

H$\alpha$ luminosity show the highest attenuation, but the observed H$\alpha$
luminosity of a region is not a good predictor of attenuation in our data.
Consistent with much previous work, the IR-to-H$\alpha$ color does a good job
of predicting A(H$\alpha$). We calculate the best-fit empirical coefficients

for modeling large-scale power systems. Researchers have developed many HIL
test systems for power systems in recent years. Those test systems can model
both microsecond-level dynamic responses of power electronic systems and
millisecond-level transients of transmission and distribution grids. By
integrating individual HIL test systems into a network of HIL test systems, we
can create large-scale power grid digital twins with flexible structures at
required modeling resolution that fits for a wide range of system operating
conditions. This will not only significantly reduce the need for field tests
when developing new technologies but also greatly shorten the model development
cycle. In this paper, we present a networked OPAL-RT based HIL test system for
developing transmission-distribution coordinative Volt-VAR regulation
technologies as an example to illustrate system setups, communication
requirements among different HIL simulation systems, and system connection
mechanisms. Impacts of communication delays, information exchange cycles, and
computing delays are illustrated. Simulation results show that the performance
of a networked HIL test system is satisfactory.

the distributions of metal-rich and metal-poor RGB stars are shifted in
different directions with respect to the geometrical center of $\omega$ Cen. We
constructed stellar density profiles for the blue and red main-sequence stars;

program is to extract a recurrence that describes its cost in terms of the size
of its input, and then to compute a closed-form upper bound on that recurrence.
We give a formal account of that method for functional programs in a
higher-order language with let-polymorphism. The method consists of two phases.
In the first phase, a monadic translation is performed to extract a
cost-annotated version of the original program. In the second phase, the
extracted program is interpreted in a model. The key feature of this second
phase is that different models describe different notions of size. This plays
out in several ways. For example, when analyzing functions that take arguments
of inductive types, different notions of size may be appropriate depending on
the analysis. When analyzing polymorphic functions, our approach shows that one
can formally describe the notion of size of an argument in terms of the data
that is common to the notions of size for each type instance of the domain
type. We give several examples of different models that formally justify
various informal cost analyses to show the applicability of our approach.

As deep-learning method, we employ SchNet extended for multiple electronic

automata where both conjunctive and disjunctive choices can be resolved in an
online manner, without knowledge of the suffix of the input word still to be
read. We show that they can be exponentially more succinct than both their
nondeterministic and universal counterparts. Furthermore, we lift many results
from nondeterministic parity GFG automata to alternating ones: a single
exponential determinisation procedure, an Exptime upper bound to the GFGness
problem, a PTime algorithm for the GFGness problem of weak automata, and a
reduction from a positive solution to the $G_2$ conjecture to a PTime algorithm
for the GFGness problem of parity automata with a fixed index. The $G_2$
conjecture states that a nondeterministic parity automaton A is GFG if and only
if a token game, known as the $G_2$ game, played on A is won by the first
player. So far, it had only been proved for B\""uchi automata; we provide
further evidence for it by proving it for coB\""uchi automata. We also study the
complexity of deciding ""half-GFGness"", a property specific to alternating
automata that only requires nondeterministic choices to be resolved in an
online manner. We show that this problem is strictly more difficult than
GFGness check, already for alternating automata on finite words.

the discovery of two accreting planets in the gap of its circumstellar disk.
Nevertheless, the mass accretion rate onto the star is still not well known.
Here we determined the stellar mass accretion rate and its variability based on
TESS and HARPS observations. The stellar light curve shows a strong signal with
a $3.03\pm0.06$ days period, which we attribute to stellar rotation. Our
analysis of the HARPS spectra shows a rotational velocity of
$v\sin\,i=16.0\pm0.5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating that the inclination of the
rotation axis is $50\pm8$ degrees. This implies that the rotation axes of the
star and its circumstellar disk are parallel within the measurement error. We
apply magnetospheric accretion models to fit the profiles of the H$\alpha$ line
and derive mass accretion rates onto the star in the range of
$0.6-2.2\times10^{-10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, varying over the rotation
phase. The measured accretion rates are in agreement with those estimated from
NUV fluxes using accretion shock models. The derived accretion rates are higher
than expected from the disk mass and planets properties for the low values of
the viscous parameter $\alpha$ suggested by recent studies, potentially
pointing to an additional mass reservoir in the inner disk to feed the
accretion, such as a dead zone. We find that the He I $\lambda$10830 line shows
a blueshifted absorption feature, indicative of a wind. The mass-loss rate
estimated from the line depth is consistent with an accretion-driven inner disk
MHD wind.

method applies to a general class of non-linear dynamic treatment models known
as Structural Nested Mean Models and allows the use of machine learning methods
to control for potentially high dimensional state variables, subject to a mean
square error guarantee, while still allowing parametric estimation and
construction of confidence intervals for the structural parameters of interest.
These structural parameters can be used for off-policy evaluation of any target
dynamic policy at parametric rates, subject to semi-parametric restrictions on
the data generating process. Our work is based on a recursive peeling process,
typical in $g$-estimation, and formulates a strongly convex objective at each
stage, which allows us to extend the $g$-estimation framework in multiple

effect heterogeneity with respect to fixed unit characteristics, within
arbitrary function spaces, enabling a dynamic analogue of the RLearner
algorithm for heterogeneous effects, iii) to allow for high-dimensional sparse
parameterizations of the target structural functions, enabling automated model

study of networks of independent computing agents with dynamic communication
structure. Each agent has a finite number of states, and communication
opportunities occur nondeterministically, allowing the agents involved to
change their states based on each other's states. Population protocols are
often studied in terms of reaching a consensus on whether the input
configuration satisfied some predicate.
  In the present paper we propose an alternative point of view. Instead of
studying the properties of inputs that a protocol can recognise, we study the
properties of outputs that a protocol eventually ensures. We define
constructive expressive power. We show that for general population protocols
and immediate observation population protocols the constructive expressive
power coincides with the normal expressive power.
  Immediate observation protocols also preserve their relatively low

described. The technique is based on the use of wide-field cameras operating in
a drift scanning mode, whereby persistent objects produce trails on the sensor
and short duration transients occupy localised groups of pixels. A benefit of
the technique is that sensitivity to short duration signals is not accompanied
by massive data rates, because the exposure time >> transient duration. The
technique is demonstrated using a pre-prototype system composed of readily
available and inexpensive commercial components, coupled with common coding
environments, commercially available software, and free web-based services. The
performance of the technique and the pre-prototype system is explored,
including aspects of photometric and astrometric calibration, detection
sensitivity, characterisation of candidate transients, and the differentiation
of astronomical signals from non-astronomical signals (primarily glints from
satellites in Earth orbit and cosmic ray hits on sensor pixels). Test
observations were made using the pre-prototype system, achieving sensitivity to
transients with 21 ms duration, resulting in the detection of five candidate
transients. An investigation of these candidates concludes they are most likely
due to cosmic ray hits on the sensor and/or satellites. The sensitivity
obtained with the pre-prototype system is such that, under some models for the
optical emission from FRBs, the detection of a typical FRB, such as FRB181228,
to a distance of approximately 100 Mpc is plausible. Several options for

areas of astronomy. Here we investigate the stability of such filaments by
performing an eigenmode analysis of adiabatic and polytropic fluid cylinders,
which are the cylindrical analog of spherical polytropes. We show that these
cylinders are gravitationally unstable to perturbations along the axis of the
cylinder below a critical wavenumber $k_{\rm crit} \simeq few$, where $k_{\rm
crit}$ is measured relative to the radius of the cylinder. Below this critical
wavenumber perturbations grow as $\propto e^{\sigma_{\rm u}\tau}$, where $\tau$
is time relative to the sound crossing time across the diameter of the
cylinder, and we derive the growth rate $\sigma_{\rm u}$ as a function of
wavenumber. We find that there is a maximum growth rate $\sigma_{\rm max} \sim
1$ that occurs at a specific wavenumber $k_{\rm max} \sim 1$, and we derive the
growth rate $\sigma_{\rm max}$ and the wavenumbers $k_{\rm max}$ and $k_{\rm
crit}$ for a range of adiabatic indices. To the extent that filamentary
structures can be approximated as adiabatic and fluid-like, our results imply
that these filaments are unstable without the need to appeal to magnetic fields

such filaments are separated by a preferred length scale, form over a preferred

interesting as a contrast to the Kreweras paths and Gessel paths as the latter

considering the Weyl chambers associated with their step sets.For Reverse
Kreweras paths the Weyl chamber walls coincide with the quarter plane boundary
and hence the problem is readily solvable by Bethe Ansatz or by using the
Gessel-Zeilberger Theorem. For Kreweras paths the quarter plane corresponds to
the union of two adjacent Weyl Chambers and hence neither the Bethe Ansatz nor
the Gessel-Zeilberger Theorem are directly applicable making the problem
considerably more difficult to solve. Similarly, the quarter plane for Gessel
paths is the union of three Weyl chambers. For Mishna-Rechnitzer paths the step
set has non-zero barycenter leading to an affine dihedral reflection group. The
affine structure corresponds to the drift in the random walk. The quarter plane
is the union of an infinite number of Weyl alcoves.

interpretable machine learning framework is proposed to explore factors
affecting pedestrians' wait time before crossing mid-block crosswalks in the
presence of automated vehicles. To collect rich behavioural data, we developed
a dynamic and immersive virtual reality experiment, with 180 participants from
a heterogeneous population in 4 different locations in the Greater Toronto Area
(GTA). Pedestrian wait time behaviour is then analyzed using a data-driven Cox
Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, in which the linear combination of the
covariates is replaced by a flexible non-linear deep neural network. The
proposed model achieved a 5% improvement in goodness of fit, but more
importantly, enabled us to incorporate a richer set of covariates. A game
theoretic based interpretability method is used to understand the contribution
of different covariates to the time pedestrians wait before crossing. Results
show that the presence of automated vehicles on roads, wider lane widths, high
density on roads, limited sight distance, and lack of walking habits are the
main contributing factors to longer wait times. Our study suggested that, to
move towards pedestrian-friendly urban areas, national level educational
programs for children, enhanced safety measures for seniors, promotion of
active modes of transportation, and revised traffic rules and regulations

SMGs at large scales ($r\geq5$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc), but in LAEs at small scales
($r<5$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc). We find that they live in various IGM environments --
HAEs trace the IGM in a similar manner to the continuum-selected galaxies, but
LAEs and O3Es tend to reside in higher-density regions. Additionally, LAEs' CCF
is flat up to $r\sim3$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, indicating that they tend to avoid the
highest-density regions. For AGNs and SMGs, the CCF peak at $r=5-6$ $h^{-1}$
Mpc implies that they tend to be in locally lower-density regions. We suspect
that it is due to the photoionization of IGM HI by AGNs, i.e., the proximity
effect.

process spreading on a graph based on the arrival times of the diffusion at a
few queried nodes. In a graph $G=(V,E)$, an unknown source node $v^* \in V$ is
drawn uniformly at random, and unknown edge weights $w(e)$ for $e\in E$,
representing the propagation delays along the edges, are drawn independently
from a Gaussian distribution of mean $1$ and variance $\sigma^2$. An algorithm
then attempts to identify $v^*$ by querying nodes $q \in V$ and being told the
length of the shortest path between $q$ and $v^*$ in graph $G$ weighted by $w$.
We consider two settings: non-adaptive, in which all query nodes must be
decided in advance, and adaptive, in which each query can depend on the results
of the previous ones. Both settings are motivated by an application of the
problem to epidemic processes (where the source is called patient zero), which
we discuss in detail.
  We characterize the query complexity when $G$ is an $n$-node path. In the
non-adaptive setting, $\Theta(n\sigma^2)$ queries are needed for $\sigma^2 \leq
1$, and $\Theta(n)$ for $\sigma^2 \geq 1$. In the adaptive setting, somewhat
surprisingly, only $\Theta(\log\log_{1/\sigma}n)$ are needed when $\sigma^2
\leq 1/2$, and $\Theta(\log \log n)+O_\sigma(1)$ when $\sigma^2 \geq 1/2$. This
is the first mathematical study of source identification with time queries in a
non-deterministic diffusion process.

Compared with the other types of vehicular communications, vehicle-to-vehicle

communications (URLLCs). However, the frame size is significantly shortened in
V2V URLLCs because of the rigorous latency requirements, and thus the overhead
is no longer negligible compared with the payload information from the

resource allocation for an urban V2V URLLC system in which the uplink cellular

  Randomization","To appear in Proceedings of INFOCOM'20",,,,"cs.CR cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Orthogonal blinding based schemes for wireless physical layer security aim to
achieve secure communication by injecting noise into channels orthogonal to the
main channel and corrupting the eavesdropper's signal reception. These methods,
albeit practical, have been proven vulnerable against multi-antenna
eavesdroppers who can filter the message from the noise. The vulnerability is
rooted in the fact that the main channel state remains static in spite of the
noise injection, which allows an eavesdropper to estimate it promptly via known
symbols and filter out the noise. Our proposed scheme leverages a
reconfigurable antenna for Alice to rapidly change the channel state during
transmission and a compressive sensing based algorithm for her to predict and
cancel the changing effects for Bob. As a result, the communication between
Alice and Bob remains clear, whereas randomized channel state prevents Eve from
launching the known-plaintext attack. We formally analyze the security of the
scheme against both single and multi-antenna eavesdroppers and identify its
unique anti-eavesdropping properties due to the artificially created
fast-changing channel. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world
experiments to evaluate its performance. Empirical results show that our scheme
can suppress Eve's attack success rate to the level of random guessing, even if
she knows all the symbols transmitted through other antenna modes.

segments in untrimmed videos, has attracted increasing attentions of the
computer vision community. State-of-the-art solutions for TAL involves
evaluating the frame-level probabilities of three action-indicating phases,
i.e. starting, continuing, and ending; and then post-processing these
predictions for the final localization. This paper delves deep into this
mechanism, and argues that existing methods, by modeling these phases as
individual classification tasks, ignored the potential temporal constraints
between them. This can lead to incorrect and/or inconsistent predictions when
some frames of the video input lack sufficient discriminative information. To
alleviate this problem, we introduce two regularization terms to mutually
regularize the learning procedure: the Intra-phase Consistency (IntraC)
regularization is proposed to make the predictions verified inside each phase;
and the Inter-phase Consistency (InterC) regularization is proposed to keep
consistency between these phases. Jointly optimizing these two terms, the
entire framework is aware of these potential constraints during an end-to-end
optimization process. Experiments are performed on two popular TAL datasets,
THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Our approach clearly outperforms the baseline both
quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed regularization also generalizes
to other TAL methods (e.g., TSA-Net and PGCN). code:

current network embedding models mainly focus on single-network applications.
Thus, both of them cannot be directly applied to solve the cross-network node
classification problem. This motivates us to propose an adversarial
cross-network deep network embedding (ACDNE) model to integrate adversarial
domain adaptation with deep network embedding so as to learn network-invariant
node representations that can also well preserve the network structural
information. In ACDNE, the deep network embedding module utilizes two feature
extractors to jointly preserve attributed affinity and topological proximities
between nodes. In addition, a node classifier is incorporated to make node
representations label-discriminative. Moreover, an adversarial domain
adaptation technique is employed to make node representations
network-invariant. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed

embeddings related to the action. Given a new test instance from the same
domain, SymNet architecture with pre-trained parameters scores each ground
action and chooses the best action. This can be accomplished in a single
forward pass without any retraining on the test instance, thus implicitly
representing a neural generalized policy for the whole domain. Our experiments
on nine RDDL domains from IPPC demonstrate that SymNet policies are
significantly better than random and sometimes even more effective than
training a state-of-the-art deep reactive policy from scratch.

incorporated in the simulations diminishes, making them difficult to analyse. A
potential solution is the use of probabilistic inference to assess the
uncertainty of the simulation parameters given real observations of the system.
Unfortunately the likelihood function required for inference is generally
expensive to compute or totally intractable. In this paper we propose to
leverage the power of modern simulators and recent techniques in Bayesian
statistics for likelihood-free inference to design a control framework that is
efficient and robust with respect to the uncertainty over simulation
parameters. The posterior distribution over simulation parameters is propagated
through a potentially non-analytical model of the system with the unscented
transform, and a variant of the information theoretical model predictive
control. This approach provides a more efficient way to evaluate trajectory
roll outs than Monte Carlo sampling, reducing the online computation burden.
Experiments show that the controller proposed attained superior performance and
robustness on classical control and robotics tasks when compared to models not
accounting for the uncertainty over model parameters.

keeping the plane states doping fixed, the leading pairing symmetry solution
becomes an unconventional $f$-wave symmetry. The mechanism behind the $f$-wave
pairing is the competition between the plane states antiferromagnetic nesting
and chain states' uniaxial nesting. We also find that the pairing strength is
strongly augmented when the flat band bottom of the chain state passes the

be realized in YBCO cuprates in future experiments where the self-doping
mechanism between the chain and plane states can be minimized so that only

an alternative to the standard FI mechanism, which is reviewed in this
conference paper. It is obtained by replacing the FI model with a manifestly
gauge-invariant action such that its functional form is determined by two
arbitrary real functions of a single complex variable. One of these functions
generates a superconformal kinetic term for the vector multiplet, while the
other yields a generalised FI term. Coupling such a vector multiplet model to

neural networks, by partitioning the network and distributing it across several
physical nodes, activations and gradients are exchanged between physical nodes,
rather than raw data. Nevertheless, when a neural network is partitioned and
distributed among physical nodes, failure of physical nodes causes the failure
of the neural units that are placed on those nodes, which results in a
significant performance drop. Current approaches focus on resiliency of
training in distributed neural networks. However, resiliency of inference in
distributed neural networks is less explored. We introduce ResiliNet, a scheme
for making inference in distributed neural networks resilient to physical node
failures. ResiliNet combines two concepts to provide resiliency: skip
hyperconnection, a concept for skipping nodes in distributed neural networks
similar to skip connection in resnets, and a novel technique called failout,
which is introduced in this paper. Failout simulates physical node failure
conditions during training using dropout, and is specifically designed to
improve the resiliency of distributed neural networks. The results of the
experiments and ablation studies using three datasets confirm the ability of
ResiliNet to provide inference resiliency for distributed neural networks.

expressed using simple constructs present in the quantum computing: binary
fraction expansion format, comonotone/independent random variables, controlled
gates, and convex combinations, and is therefore suitable for a quantum

training data to learn their parameters. However, in practice, the negative
samples of training data are usually selected from an unannotated conversation
data set at random. The generated training data is likely to contain noise and
affect the performance of the response selection models. To address this
difficulty, we consider utilizing the underlying correlation in the data
resource itself to derive different kinds of supervision signals and reduce the
influence of noisy data. More specially, we consider a main-complementary task
pair. The main task (\ie our focus) selects the correct response given the last
utterance and context, and the complementary task selects the last utterance
given the response and context. The key point is that the output of the
complementary task is used to set instance weights for the main task. We
conduct extensive experiments in two public datasets and obtain significant
improvement in both datasets. We also investigate the variant of our approach
in multiple aspects, and the results have verified the effectiveness of our

availability, where the set of eligible clients may change during the training

performance of the classical Federated Averaging algorithm (FedAvg for short).
Thus, we propose a simple distributed non-convex optimization algorithm, called
Federated Latest Averaging (FedLaAvg for short), which leverages the latest
gradients of all clients, even when the clients are not available, to jointly
update the global model in each iteration. Our theoretical analysis shows that
FedLaAvg attains the convergence rate of $O(E^{1/2}/(N^{1/4} T^{1/2}))$,
achieving a sublinear speedup with respect to the total number of clients. We
implement FedLaAvg along with several baselines and evaluate them over the

demonstrate that FedLaAvg achieves more stable training than FedAvg in both
convex and non-convex settings and indeed reaches a sublinear speedup.

implements two types of well established QMC algorithms: Variational Monte
Carlo (VMC), and Diffusion Monte Carlo in its robust and efficient lattice
regularized variant. A key feature of the code is the possibility of using
strongly correlated many-body wave functions. The electronic wave function (WF)
is obtained by applying a Jastrow factor, which takes into account dynamical
correlations, to the most general mean-field ground state, written either as an
antisymmetrized geminal product with spin-singlet pairing, or as a Pfaffian,
including both singlet and triplet correlations. This wave function can be
viewed as an efficient implementation of the so-called resonating valence bond
(RVB) ansatz, first proposed by L. Pauling and P. W. Anderson in quantum
chemistry and condensed matter physics, respectively. The RVB ansatz
implemented in TurboRVB has a large variational freedom, including the Jastrow
correlated Slater determinant as its simplest, but nontrivial case. Moreover,
it has the remarkable advantage of remaining with an affordable computational
cost, proportional to the one spent for the evaluation of a single Slater
determinant. The code implements the adjoint algorithmic differentiation that
enables a very efficient evaluation of energy derivatives, comprising the ionic
forces. Thus, one can perform structural optimizations and molecular dynamics
in the canonical NVT ensemble at the VMC level. For the electronic part, a full
WF optimization is made possible thanks to state-of-the-art stochastic
algorithms for energy minimization. The code has been efficiently parallelized
by using a hybrid MPI-OpenMP protocol, that is also an ideal environment for
exploiting the computational power of modern GPU accelerators.

nodes in a data graph GD based on a given pattern graph GP. GPNM has become
increasingly important in many applications, e.g., group finding and expert
recommendation. In real scenarios, both GP and GD are updated frequently.
However, the existing GPNM methods either need to perform a new GPNM procedure
from scratch to deliver the node matching results based on the updated GP and
GD or incrementally perform the GPNM procedure for each of the updates, leading
to low efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a new method to
efficiently deliver the node matching results on the updated graphs. In this
paper, we first analyze and detect the elimination relationships between the
updates. Then, we construct an Elimination Hierarchy Tree (EH-Tree) to index
these elimination relationships. In order to speed up the GPNM process, we
propose a graph partition method and then propose a new updates-aware GPNM
method, called UA-GPNM, considering the single-graph elimination relationships
among the updates in a single graph of GP or GD, and also the cross-graph
elimination relationships between the updates in GP and the updates in GD.
UA-GPNM first delivers the GPNM result of an initial query, and then delivers
the GPNM result of a subsequent query, based on the initial GPNM result and the
multiple updates that occur between two queries. The experimental results on
five real-world social graphs demonstrate that our proposed UA-GPNM is much
more efficient than the state-of-the-art GPNM methods.

defines the roles for the nodes based on their tasks in the pipeline, i.e.,

from the user agents is completed through the bandwidth-optimized Collector

Checking the execution result is then distributed among a more extensive set of

Flow's Consensus Nodes do not execute the transaction. Instead, Verification

2-dimensional assignment as a base heuristic. This auction algorithm is
particularly well-suited for our context, because through the use of prices, it
can advantageously use the solution of an assignment problem as a starting
point for solving other related assignment problems, and this can greatly speed
up the execution of the rollout algorithm.

complexity. We show that finding the exact solution is just as hard as finding
its parity (i.e. if the solution is even or odd) for a large number of
classical problems, including All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Diameter,
Radius, Median, Second Shortest Path, Maximum Consecutive Subsums, Min-Plus
Convolution, and $0/1$-Knapsack.
  A direct reduction from a problem to its parity version is often difficult to
design. Instead, we revisit the existing hardness reductions and tailor them in
a problem-specific way to the parity version. Nearly all reductions from APSP
in the literature proceed via the (subcubic-equivalent but simpler) Negative
Weight Triangle (NWT) problem. Our new modified reductions also start from NWT
or a non-standard parity variant of it. We are not able to establish a
subcubic-equivalence with the more natural parity counting variant of NWT,
where we ask if the number of negative triangles is even or odd. Perhaps
surprisingly, we justify this by designing a reduction from the
seemingly-harder Zero Weight Triangle problem, showing that parity is
(conditionally) strictly harder than decision for NWT.

fit towards a specific domain, which cannot adapt to other domains without
extensive retraining. In this paper, we address the problem of designing a
universal object detection model that exploits diverse category granularity
from multiple domains and predict all kinds of categories in one system.
Existing works treat this problem by integrating multiple detection branches
upon one shared backbone network. However, this paradigm overlooks the crucial
semantic correlations between multiple domains, such as categories hierarchy,
visual similarity, and linguistic relationship. To address these drawbacks, we
present a novel universal object detector called Universal-RCNN that
incorporates graph transfer learning for propagating relevant semantic
information across multiple datasets to reach semantic coherency. Specifically,
we first generate a global semantic pool by integrating all high-level semantic
representation of all the categories. Then an Intra-Domain Reasoning Module
learns and propagates the sparse graph representation within one dataset guided
by a spatial-aware GCN. Finally, an InterDomain Transfer Module is proposed to
exploit diverse transfer dependencies across all domains and enhance the
regional feature representation by attending and transferring semantic contexts
globally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms multiple-branch models and achieves the
state-of-the-art results on multiple object detection benchmarks (mAP: 49.1% on

since the initial policy ensures a quick-start of learning and intermediate
guidance allows to avoid unnecessary exploration. Taking this inspiration, we
propose knowledge guided policy network (KoGuN), a novel framework that
combines human prior suboptimal knowledge with reinforcement learning. Our
framework consists of a fuzzy rule controller to represent human knowledge and
a refine module to fine-tune suboptimal prior knowledge. The proposed framework
is end-to-end and can be combined with existing policy-based reinforcement

This paradigm requires careful manual hyper-parameter tuning for mining good

nondetections that are excellent high redshift candidates. Of the matched
compact AGNs, 92% exhibit QSO mid-infrared colours (W1-W2>0.5). Therefore, our
sample of high frequency compact sources has a very high rate of identification
with mid-infrared QSOs. We find counterparts for 88% of 387 compact
steep-spectrum (CSS) sources in the AT20G survey, 82%$\pm$5% of which exhibit
QSO mid-infrared colours and have moderate redshifts (median redshift = 0.82),

redshifts (median redshift = 0.13). The latter classified into late- and
early-type galaxies using their mid-infrared colours shows a majority

that a larger fraction of these CSS sources are embedded in hosts with higher
gas densities than average early-type galaxies. We compare mid-infrared colours
of our AGNs against those reported for AGNs primarily selected using non-radio

of turbulent-laminar bands in plane channel flow is studied via direct
numerical simulations using the parallel pseudospectral code ChannelFlow in a
narrow computational domain tilted by $24^{\circ}$ with respect to the
streamwise direction. Mutual interactions between bands are studied through
their propagation velocities. Energy profiles show that the flow surrounding
isolated turbulent bands returns to the laminar base flow over large distances.
Depending on the Reynolds number, a turbulent band can either decay to laminar
flow or split into two bands. As with past studies of other wall-bounded shear
flows, in most cases survival probabilities are found to be consistent with
exponential distributions for both decay and splitting, indicating that the
processes are memoryless. Statistically estimated mean lifetimes for decay and
splitting are plotted as a function of the Reynolds number and lead to the
estimation of a critical Reynolds number $Re_{\text{cross}}\simeq 965$, where
decay and splitting lifetimes cross at greater than $10^6$ advective time
units. The processes of splitting and decay are also examined through analysis
of their Fourier spectra. The dynamics of large-scale spectral components seem

However, comparisons between these models and observations are non-trivial

compared to observational data in different observables: the column density,
bremsstrahlung flux, rotation measure, H$\alpha$ flux, and synchrotron or
cyclotron flux. Projections were calculated by rotating and moving the
astrosphere model to the desired position and orientation and by then computing
the value of a given patch on the sphere by a modified line-of-sight
integration. Contributions to the selected observable made by all model cells
that are connected to the patch by the line of sight in question were taken
into account. When the model produces a bow shock, a distinct parabolic
structure produced by the outer astrosheath can be seen in every observable of
the projection, the exact shape depending on the orientations of the line of
sight and the stellar motion. Of all four examined astrosphere models, only
that of $\lambda$ Cephei shows fluxes that are higher than current
observational thresholds. This is due to the strong stellar wind and

best performing operator for the current search instance. Addressing this
issue, we propose to integrate the memory into EMCQ for combinatorial t-wise
test suite generation using reinforcement learning based on the Q-learning

generation on industrial programs can impact the use of such techniques as
Q-EMCQ. Thus, there is a need to evaluate this kind of approach against

required to cover the code as well as finding faults. We applied Q-EMCQ on 37

this letter, we present an interferometric method, in which, any qubit state,
whether mixed or pure, can be inferred from the visibility, phase shift and
average intensity of an interference pattern using a single shot measurement --
hence, we call it Quantum State Interferography. This provides us with a ""black

the quantum state. In contrast, standard QST requires at least two measurements
for pure state qubit and at least three measurements for mixed state qubit
reconstruction. We then go on to show that QSI is more resource efficient than
QST for quantification of entanglement in pure bipartite qubits. We
experimentally implement our method with high fidelity using the polarisation
degree of freedom of light. An extension of the scheme to pure states involving
$d-1$ interferograms for $d$-dimensional systems is also presented. Thus, the
scaling gain is even more dramatic in the qudit scenario for our method where

source in the radial velocity (RV) data. This noise impedes the detection of
small exoplanets. Moreover, the unknown statistics (amplitude, distribution)
related to this noise make it difficult to estimate the false alarm probability
(FAP) for exoplanet detection tests. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations (MHD) of stellar
convection to design detection methods that can provide both a reliable
estimate of the FAP and a high detection power. We tested the realism of 3D
simulations in producing solar RV by comparing them with the observed disk
integrated velocities taken by the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO
spacecraft. We presented a new detection method based on periodograms
standardized by these simulated time series, applying several detection tests
to these standarized periodograms. The power spectral density of the 3D
synthetic convective noise is consistent with solar RV observations for short
periods. For regularly sampled observations, the analytic expressions of FAP
derived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram standardized
by 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work
(Higher-Criticism, Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer
better detection performance than classical tests (based on the highest
periodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems and planets with
eccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable
synthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series
can be used to access to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP
of tests that are a critical element in the detection of exoplanets down to the
cm/s level.

of the QC-DMRG (Quantum Chemistry Density Matrix Renormalization Group) method,
a recent state-of-the-art method for numerically solving the $N$-electron
Schr\""odinger equation. It is well known that the accuracy of TT approximations
is governed by the tail of the associated singular values, which in turn
strongly depends on the ordering of the one-body basis.
  Here we find that the singular values $s_1\ge s_2\ge ... \ge s_d$ of tensors
representing ground states of noninteracting Hamiltonians possess a surprising
inversion symmetry, $s_1s_d=s_2s_{d-1}=s_3s_{d-2}=...$, thus reducing the tail
behaviour to a single hidden invariant, which moreover depends explicitly on
the ordering of the basis. For correlated wavefunctions, we find that the tail
is upper bounded by a suitable superposition of the invariants. Optimizing the
invariants or their superposition thus provides a new ordering scheme for
QC-DMRG. Numerical tests on simple examples, i.e. linear combinations of a few
Slater determinants, show that the new scheme reduces the tail of the singular
values by several orders of magnitudes over existing methods, including the
widely used Fiedler order.

\emph{robust} formulation of the problem features a further parameter $z$ and
allows up to $z$ points of $V$ (outliers) to be disregarded when computing the

constrained variants of the robust $k$-center problem, namely, the Robust
Matroid Center (RMC) problem, where the set of returned centers are constrained
to be an independent set of a matroid of rank $k$ built on $V$, and the Robust
Knapsack Center (RKC) problem, where each element $i\in V$ is given a positive

$(3+\epsilon)$-approximation ratio, which is a mere additive term $\epsilon$

obliviously adapt to the intrinsic complexity of the dataset, captured by its

reconstruction. To solve this problem, most of previous approaches either
partially explore available information or blindly utilize unnecessary
information to align each point set, which may lead to the undesired results or
introduce extra computation complexity. To this end, this paper consider the
multi-view registration problem as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and
proposes a novel multi-view registration approach under the perspective of
Expectation-Maximization (EM). The basic idea of our approach is that different
data points are generated by the same number of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).
For each data point in one point set, its nearest neighbors can be searched
from other well-aligned point sets. Then, we can suppose this data point is
generated by the special GMM, which is composed of each nearest neighbor
adhered with one Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, it is
reasonable to define the likelihood function including all rigid
transformations, which requires to be estimated for multi-view registration.
Subsequently, the EM algorithm is utilized to maximize the likelihood function
so as to estimate all rigid transformations. Finally, the proposed approach is
tested on several bench mark data sets and compared with some state-of-the-art
algorithms. Experimental results illustrate its super performance on accuracy,
robustness and efficiency for the registration of multi-view point sets.

weighted atomic congestion games with polynomial cost functions of maximum

exist, while nonexistence was established only for small constants, namely for
$1.153$-PNE. We improve significantly upon this gap, proving that such games in
general do not have $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{d})$-approximate PNE, which provides
the first super-constant lower bound.
  Furthermore, we provide a black-box gap-introducing method of combining such
nonexistence results with a specific circuit gadget, in order to derive
NP-completeness of the decision version of the problem. In particular,
deploying this technique we are able to show that deciding whether a weighted
congestion game has an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$-PNE is NP-complete. Previous
hardness results were known only for the special case of exact equilibria and
arbitrary cost functions.
  The circuit gadget is of independent interest and it allows us to also prove
hardness for a variety of problems related to the complexity of PNE in
congestion games. For example, we demonstrate that the question of existence of
$\alpha$-PNE in which a certain set of players plays a specific strategy
profile is NP-hard for any $\alpha < 3^{d/2}$, even for unweighted congestion
games.
  Finally, we study the existence of approximate equilibria in weighted
congestion games with general (nondecreasing) costs, as a function of the

is depressed compared to the quiet Sun. This so-called Wilson depression is
caused by the Lorentz force of the strong magnetic field inside the spots.
However, it is not understood in detail yet, how the Wilson depression is
related to the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or to other
properties of the sunspot.
  Aims: We aim to study the dependence of the Wilson depression on the
properties of the magnetic field of the sunspots and how exactly the magnetic
field contributes to balancing the Wilson depression with respect to the gas
pressure of the surroundings of the spots.
  Methods: Our study is based on 24 spectropolarimetric scans of 12 individual
sunspots performed with Hinode. We derived the Wilson depression for each spot
using both, a recently developed method that is based on minimizing the
divergence of the magnetic field, and an approach developed earlier that
enforces an equilibrium between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure
inside the spot and the gas pressure in the quiet Sun, thus neglecting the
influence of the curvature force. We then performed a statistical analysis by
comparing the Wilson depression resulting from the two techniques with each
other and by relating them to various parameters of the sunspots, such as their
size or the strength of the magnetic field.
  Results: We find that the Wilson depression becomes larger for spots with a
stronger magnetic field, but not as much as one would expect from the increased
magnetic pressure. This suggests that the curvature integral provides an
important contribution to the Wilson depression, particularly for spots with a
weak magnetic field. Our results indicate that the geometry of the magnetic
field in the penumbra is different between spots with different strengths of
the average umbral magnetic field.

models; in such models, dust in denser, cooler regions (i.e. regions of
increased $\Sigma_{\rm ISM}$) tends to grow and therefore to have increased
$\kappa_{500}$. We show, using a toy model, that the presence of a range of
dust temperatures along the line of sight can lead to spuriously low estimated
values of $\kappa_{500}$. If in regions of higher $\Sigma_{\rm ISM}$ the range
of dust temperatures extends to lower values (as seems likely), the magnitude
of this effect may be sufficient to explain the apparent anti-correlation
between $\kappa_{500}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm ISM}$. Therefore there may not be any

theoretical expectations.

Majorana's stellar representation (MSR) is applied to 1D multiband models
consisting of asymmetric nearest-neighbor hopping and imaginary on-site
potentials. The number of edge states isolated from the continuous bulk bands
in the complex energy plane is successfully linked with a topological invariant
constructed from MSR. Specifically, the number of isolated edge states can be
obtained from a winding number defined for the Majorana stars, which also
allows for a geometric visualization of the topology related to the isolated
edge modes. A remarkable success of our approach is that our winding number
characterization remains valid even in the presence of exceptional points of
the continuous bulk bands, where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable and
hence conventional topological invariants such as the Zak phase and the Chern
number cannot be properly defined. Furthermore, cases with the so-called
non-Hermitian skin effect are also studied, showing that the bulk-boundary
correspondence between our defined winding numbers and isolated edge states can
be restored. Of particular interest is a four-band example with an odd number
of isolated edge states, where the Zak phase approach necessarily fails upon
removing the skin effect, but our MSR-based characterization works equally
well. For these reasons, our study is expected to be widely useful in
topological studies of non-Hermitian multiband systems, regardless of the skin
effect or the presence of the exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems.

challenging to adapt to areas beyond those they have been developed for. In
this paper, we advocate a paradigm shift for LUR models: We propose the
Data-driven, Open, Global (DOG) paradigm that entails models based on purely

within this paradigm will alleviate the need for experts to adapt models to the
local characteristics of the available data sources and thus facilitate the
generalizability of air pollution models to new areas on a global scale. In
order to illustrate the feasibility of the DOG paradigm for LUR, we introduce a
deep learning model called MapLUR. It is based on a convolutional neural
network architecture and is trained exclusively on globally and openly
available map data without requiring manual feature engineering. We compare our
model to state-of-the-art baselines like linear regression, random forests and
multi-layer perceptrons using a large data set of modeled $\text{NO}_2$

introduced their DYN method to calculate coronal temperature profiles from
given radial distributions of the coronal and solar wind (SW) electron
densities. Several such temperature profiles are calculated and presented
corresponding to a set of given empirical density models derived from eclipse
observations and in-situ measurements of the electron density and bulk velocity
at 1 AU. The DYN temperature profiles obtained for the equatorial and polar
regions of the corona challenge the results deduced since 1958 from singular
hydrodynamical models of the SW. In these models - where the expansion velocity
transits through a singular saddle point - the maximum coronal temperature is
predicted to be located at the base of the corona, while in all DYN models the
altitude of the maximum temperature is found at significantly higher altitudes
in the mid-corona. Furthermore, the maximum of the DYN-estimated temperatures
is found at much higher altitudes over the polar regions and coronal holes,
than over the equator. However, at low altitudes, in the inner corona, the DYN
temperatures are always smaller at high latitudes, than at low equatorial
latitudes. This appears well in agreement with existing coronal hole
observations. These findings have serious implications on the open questions:
what is the actual source of the coronal heating, and where is the maximum
energy deposited within the solar corona?

massive particles (WIMPs) below which discovery is impeded due to an almost
irreducible background of neutrinos. Directional gas time projection chambers
could discriminate against solar neutrinos, relevant for WIMP masses
$\lesssim$10 GeV. At higher masses $\gtrsim$100 GeV the floor is set by the
background of atmospheric neutrinos. Probing below this part of the floor would
require very large target exposures. Since gas-based detectors would be
prohibitively large at this scale, we instead reevaluate the prospects for
liquid noble experiments to probe below the neutrino floor. We combine all
potential methods of subtracting the neutrino background to determine how much
of this difficult to reach, but well-motivated, parameter space it is feasible
to reach. Most notably, we quantify whether a proposed directional signal in
xenon and argon experiments called ""columnar recombination"" can help in this
task. We find that even if the strength of this effect is amplified beyond
current experimental results, the quantity of directional information contained
in the recombination signal is too low to realistically discriminate against
the atmospheric neutrino background. Instead, benefiting from the refined
measurements of neutrino fluxes by experiments such as DUNE and JUNO will be
the most practical means to push direct WIMP searches below the neutrino floor.
For an ultimate global coordination of xenon and argon experiments, we show
that the neutrino floor is a surmountable barrier. The direct detection of 100
GeV-scale supersymmetric WIMPs may, eventually, be within reach.

referred to as M-mode while at AUG as intermediate phase or I-phase. This
contribution aims at a comparative analysis of these phenomena in terms of the
density and temperature pedestal properties, the magnetic oscillations and
symmetries. Lithium beam emission spectroscopy (Li-BES) and reflectometer
measurements at JET and AUG show that the M-mode and the I-phase modulates the
plasma edge density. A high frequency oscillation of the magnetics and the
density at the pedestal is also associated with both the M-mode and the
I-phase, and its power is modulated with the LFO frequency. The power
modulation happens simultaneously in every Mirnov coil signal where it can be
detected. The bursts of the magnetic signals and the density at the pedestal
region are followed by the flattening of the density profile, and by a radially
outward propagating density pulse in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The analysis
of the helium line ratio spectroscopy (He-BES) signals at AUG revealed that the
electron temperature is modulated in phase with the density, thus the I-phase
modulates the pressure profile gradient. This analysis gave opportunity to
compare Li-BES and He-BES density profiles at different locations suggesting a
toroidal and poloidal symmetry of the density modulation. The presented results
indicate that the regimes, the AUG I-phase and the JET M-mode, exhibit similar
characteristics, which leads to the conclusion that the regimes are likely the
same.

energy resources into existing electric power grids. Due to the uncertain
nature of renewable energy resources, network operators are faced with new
challenges in balancing load and generation. In order to meet the new
requirements, intelligent distributed energy resource plants can be used which
provide as virtual power plants e.g. demand side management or flexible
generation. However, the calculation of an adequate schedule for the unit
commitment of such distributed energy resources is a complex optimization
problem which is typically too complex for standard optimization algorithms if
large numbers of distributed energy resources are considered. For solving such
complex optimization tasks, population-based metaheuristics -- as e.g.
evolutionary algorithms -- represent powerful alternatives. Admittedly,
evolutionary algorithms do require lots of computational power for solving such
problems in a timely manner. One promising solution for this performance
problem is the parallelization of the usually time-consuming evaluation of
alternative solutions. In the present paper, a new generic and highly scalable
parallel method for unit commitment of distributed energy resources using
metaheuristic algorithms is presented. It is based on microservices, container
virtualization and the publish/subscribe messaging paradigm for scheduling
distributed energy resources. Scalability and applicability of the proposed
solution are evaluated by performing parallelized optimizations in a big data
environment for three distinct distributed energy resource scheduling
scenarios. The new method provides cluster or cloud parallelizability and is
able to deal with a comparably large number of distributed energy resources.
The application of the new proposed method results in very good performance for
scaling up optimization speed.

Depending on the fault model adopted, hardware and software errors that do not

rather common failures the usual solution is to adopt a stronger fault model,
such as the arbitrary or Byzantine fault model. Algorithms created for this
fault model, however, are considerably more complex and require more system

reach a middle ground is the non-malicious arbitrary fault model. This model
assumes it is possible to detect and filter faults with a given probability, if
these faults are not created with malicious intent, allowing the isolation and
mapping of these faults to benign faults. In this paper we describe how we
incremented an implementation of active replication in the non-malicious fault

evaluate this implementation using a fault injection framework showing that it

state stored in stable memory to guarantee the irreversibility of operations
even in the presence of failures. The performance of these algorithms lean
heavily on the performance of stable memory. Current storage technologies have
a defined performance profile: data is accessed in blocks of hundreds or
thousands of bytes, random access to these blocks is expensive and sequential
access is somewhat better. File system implementations hide some of the
performance limitations of the underlying storage devices using buffers and
caches. However, fail-recovery distributed algorithms bypass some of these
techniques and perform synchronous writes to be able to tolerate a failure
during the write itself. Assuming the distributed system designer is able to
buffer the algorithm's writes, we ask how buffer size and latency complement
each other. In this paper we start to answer this question by characterizing
the performance (throughput and latency) of typical stable memory devices using
a representative set of current file systems.

their excellent performance on graph-based tasks. However, existing research on

the quality of the input data. In this paper, we propose self-enhanced GNN
(SEG), which improves the quality of the input data using the outputs of
existing GNN models for better performance on semi-supervised node
classification. As graph data consist of both topology and node labels, we
improve input data quality from both perspectives. For topology, we observe
that higher classification accuracy can be achieved when the ratio of
inter-class edges (connecting nodes from different classes) is low and propose
topology update to remove inter-class edges and add intra-class edges. For node
labels, we propose training node augmentation, which enlarges the training set
using the labels predicted by existing GNN models. SEG is a general framework
that can be easily combined with existing GNN models. Experimental results
validate that SEG consistently improves the performance of well-known GNN
models such as GCN, GAT and SGC across different datasets.

eigenmode expansion method. We show how important is to take into account the
phase relations between the outputs of all MMIs in order to make a working
design. We have successfully fabricated devices with different channel spacing
on our micron-scale silicon photonics platform, and measurement results
confirmed their expected flat-top operation on a broad band. Using only single
MMI splitters we can not only greatly outperform the bandwidth achieved by
standard directional couplers, but we can also ensure much higher robustness to
fabrication errors, also compared to previous demonstrations based on double
MMIs. Indeed, when compared to those previous attempts, the new results prove
tapered MMIs to be the most robust approach to achieve arbitrary splitting

tasks from few examples. However, standard few-shot classification benchmarks
assume that the representation is learned on a limited amount of base class
data, ignoring the amount of prior knowledge that a human may have accumulated
before learning new tasks. At the same time, even if a powerful representation
is available, it may happen in some domain that base class data are limited or
non-existent. This motivates us to study a problem where the representation is
obtained from a classifier pre-trained on a large-scale dataset of a different
domain, assuming no access to its training process, while the base class data
are limited to few examples per class and their role is to adapt the
representation to the domain at hand rather than learn from scratch. We adapt
the representation in two stages, namely on the few base class data if
available and on the even fewer data of new tasks. In doing so, we obtain from
the pre-trained classifier a spatial attention map that allows focusing on
objects and suppressing background clutter. This is important in the new
problem, because when base class data are few, the network cannot learn where
to focus implicitly. We also show that a pre-trained network may be easily
adapted to novel classes, without meta-learning.

between about six hours and one day allow for slowly varying mixing. The
calculated turbulence dissipation rate values are half to one order of
magnitude larger than those from open-ocean turbulent exchange well away from
bottom topography and surface boundaries. In the deep, turbulent overturns
extend up to 100 m tall, in the ocean-interior, and also reach the lowest
sensor. The overturns are governed by internal-wave-shear and -convection. The
turbulence inertial subrange is observed to extend into the internal wave
frequency band. The associated mixing is not related to bottom friction
processes but to internal wave breaking and near-inertial shear. The mixing
facilitates long (hours to day) and high (exceeding 100 mab) dispersal of
suspended sediments.

calculated structural parameters (lattice constants and bond lengths) agree
well with the experiments. The computed band gap reveals a semiconducting
profile for all these compounds showing a decreasing trend of the band gap
energy by changing the halide ions consecutively from Cl to Br and Br to I.
However, for variation in the B-site cation, the band gap increases by changing
the cation from Pd to Pt via Sn. The most likely compounds, Rb2PdBr6 and
Cs2PtI6, exhibit a band gap within the optimal range of 0.9-1.6 eV for

the optimal value of the dielectric constant, optical conductivity, and

Given a network model, i.e., a set of link directions, in each round of the
execution, the adversary choses a link from the network model, restricted only
by the specification, and delivers messages according to the current link's
directions. Motivated by communication buses with direct acknowledge
mechanisms, we further assume that nodes are aware of which messages have been
delivered.

does not violate the CPT-symmetry as alternative for inflation. With this
approach they described the birth of the Universe from a pair of universes, one
the CPT image of the other, living in pre- and post-big bang epochs. The
CPT-invariance strictly constrains the vacuum states of the quantized fields,
with notable consequences on the cosmological scenarios. Here we examine the
validity of this proposal by adopting the point of view of archaic cosmology,
based on de Sitter projective relativity, with an event-based reading of
quantum mechanics, which is a consequence of the relationship between the
universal information reservoir of the archaic universe and its
out-of-equilibrium state through quantum jumps. In this scenario, the big bang
is caused by the instability of the original (pre)vacuum with respect to the
nucleation of micro-events that represent the actual creation of particles.
Finally, we compare our results with those by Turok et al., including the
analytic continuation across the big bang investigated by Volovik and show that
many aspects of these cosmological scenarios find a clear physical
interpretation by using our approach. Moreover, in the archaic universe
framework we do not have to assume a priori the CPT-invariance like in the
other models of universe, it is instead a necessary consequence of the archaic
vacuum structure and the nucleation process, divided into two specular
universes.

  The main focus of the paper is an analysis of the actions that a single bank

advantage. We show that removing an incoming debt, or donating funds to another
bank can result in a single new solution that is strictly more favorable to the
acting bank. We also show that increasing the bank's external funds or
modifying the priorities of outgoing payments cannot introduce a more favorable
new solution into the system, but may allow the bank to remove some unfavorable
solutions, or to increase its recovery rate. Finally, we show how the actions
of two banks in a simple financial system can result in classical game
theoretic situations like the prisoner's dilemma or the dollar auction,
demonstrating the wide expressive capability of the financial system model.

comprehensive study of finding a short s-t path in the multistage graph model,

short s-t paths in each graph (""snapshot"") such that in the found path sequence
the consecutive s-t paths are ""similar"". We measure similarity by the size of
the symmetric difference of either the vertex set (vertex-similarity) or the
edge set (edge-similarity) of any two consecutive paths. We prove that these
two variants of Multistage s-t Path are already NP-hard for an input sequence
of only two graphs and maximum vertex degree four. Motivated by this fact and
natural applications of this scenario e.g. in traffic route planning, we
perform a parameterized complexity analysis. Among other results, for both
variants, vertex- and edge-similarity, we prove parameterized hardness
(W[1]-hardness) regarding the parameter path length (solution size) for both

fixed-parameter tractability for the parameter solution size, contrasting our

distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases during the
early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected
for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate.
Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland
China, the scaling law $t^{\mu}$ is surprisingly universal, with a range of
exponents $\mu=2.1\pm0.3$. The universality of this behavior indicates that
despite social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical
heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by
fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological
models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of
containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To
this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of
symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in
response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of
parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases
and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit
the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or
oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of
local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the
observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective
contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a
substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the
implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19
secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent

many-body systems at the microscopic level. However, layered or efficient
spin-resolved readout methods have remained scarce as they impose strong
demands on the specific atomic species and constrain the simulated lattice
geometry and size. Here we present a novel high-fidelity bilayer readout, which
can be used for full spin- and density-resolved quantum gas microscopy of
two-dimensional systems with arbitrary geometry. Our technique makes use of an
initial Stern-Gerlach splitting into adjacent layers of a highly-stable
vertical superlattice and subsequent charge pumping to separate the layers by
$21\,\mu$m. This separation enables independent high-resolution images of each
layer. We benchmark our method by spin- and density-resolving two-dimensional
Fermi-Hubbard systems. Our technique furthermore enables the access to advanced
entropy engineering schemes, spectroscopic methods or the realization of
tunable bilayer systems.

bounded by strings and cosmic strings terminated by Nambu monopoles -- could be
produced during the phase transitions in the early Universe. Recent experiments
in superfluid $^3$He reproduced the formation of the KLS domain walls, which
opened the new arena for the detailed study of those objects in human
controlled system with different characteristic lengths. These composite
defects are formed by two successive symmetry breaking phase transitions. In
the first transition the strings are formed, then in the second transition the
string becomes the termination line of the KLS wall. In the same manner, in the
first transition monopoles are formed, and then in the second transition these
monopoles become the termination points of strings. Here we show that in the
vicinity of the second transition the composite defects can be described by
relative homotopy groups. This is because there are two well separated length
scales involved, which give rise to two different classes of the degenerate
vacuum states, $R_1$ and $R_2$, and the composite objects correspond to the
nontrivial elements of the group $\pi_n(R_1,R_2)$. We discuss this on example
of the so-called polar distorted B phase, which is formed in the two-step phase
transition in liquid $^3$He distorted by aerogel. In this system the string
monopoles terminate spin vortices with even winding number, while KLS string
walls terminate on half quantum vortices. In the presence of magnetic field,
vortex-skyrmions are formed, and the string monopole transforms to the nexus.
We also discuss the integer-valued topological invariants of those objects. Our
consideration can be applied to the composite defects in other condensed matter
and cosmological systems.

  of Massive Stars",,,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present two self-consistent procedures that couple the hydrodynamics with
calculations of the line-force in the frame of radiation wind theory. These
procedures give us the line-force parameters, the velocity field, and the
mass-loss rate. The first one is based on the so-called m-CAK theory. A full
set of line-force parameters for $T_\text{eff}\ge 32,000$ K and surface
gravities higher than 3.4 dex for two different metallicities are presented,
along with their corresponding wind parameters. We find that the dependence of
line-force parameters on effective temperature is enhanced by the dependence on
$\log g$. For the case of homogeneous winds (without clumping) comparison of
self-consistent mass-loss rates shows a good agreement with empirical values.
We also consider self-consistent wind solutions that are used as input in
FASTWIND to calculate synthetic spectra. By comparison with the observed
spectra for three stars with clumped winds, we found that varying the clumping
factor the synthetic spectra rapidly converge into the neighbourhood region of
the solution. Therefore, this self-consistent m-CAK procedure significantly
reduces the number of free parameters needed to obtain a synthetic spectrum.
  The second procedure (called Lambert-procedure) provides a self-consistent
solution beyond m-CAK theory, and line-acceleration is calculated by the full
NLTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Both the mass-loss rate and the clumping
factor are set as free parameters, hence their values are obtained by spectral
fitting after the respective self-consistent hydrodynamics is calculated. Since
performing the Lambert-procedure requires significant computational power, the
analysis is made only for the star z-Puppis.
  The promising results gives a positive balance about the future applications
for the self-consistent solutions presented on this thesis.

little attention in recent neural network models. Firstly, getting a

extraction method, and most lexicons are hand crafted, which is very
inefficient for big data. What's more, there is no an effective way to use a

Pre-Attention mechanism for text classification in this paper, which can learn
attention of different words according to their effects in the classification
tasks. The words with different attention can form a domain lexicon.
Experiments on three benchmark text classification tasks show that our models
get competitive result comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. We get
90.5% accuracy on Stanford Large Movie Review dataset, 82.3% on Subjectivity

model without Pre-Attention mechanism, those with Pre-Attention mechanism
improve by 0.9%-2.4% accuracy, which proves the validity of the Pre-Attention
mechanism. In addition, the Pre-Attention mechanism performs well followed by
different types of neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks and
Long Short-Term Memory networks). For the same dataset, when we use
Pre-Attention mechanism to get attention value followed by different neural
networks, those words with high attention values have a high degree of
coincidence, which proves the versatility and portability of the Pre-Attention

trading off between two essential features, namely, quality and diversity. The

dynamically generated from the interaction of a vector and a pseudoscalar

The lower mass pole couples dominantly to $K^*\pi$ and the higher mass pole to

show that the different final $VP$ channels in $D^+\to \nu e^+ V P$ weigh

axis-parallel rectangular labels of common size. In a fully dynamic setting, at
each time step, either a new label appears or an existing label disappears.
Then, the challenge is to maintain a maximum cardinality subset of pairwise
independent labels with sub-linear update time. Motivated by this, we study the
maximal independent set ((MIS)) and maximum independent set (Max-IS) problems
on fully dynamic (insertion/deletion model) sets of axis-parallel rectangles of

maximal induced subgraph in which every vertex has degree at least $k$. For
example, $k$-cores are commonly used to model the unraveling phenomena in

the network leave it, so the remaining users form exactly the $k$-core. In this
paper we study the question whether it is possible to make the network more

mathematical model for the $k$-core construction problem is the following Edge
$k$-Core optimization problem. We are given a graph $G$ and integers $k$, $b$

being parameterized by $k+b+p$ (Chitnis and Talmon, 2018), and APX-hard (Zhou

provable guarantee when the $k$-core has to be constructed from a sparse graph

graph is a forest, Edge $k$-Core is solvable in polynomial time; 2) Edge
$k$-Core is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) being parameterized by the minimum
size of a vertex cover in the input graph. On the other hand, with such
parameterization, the problem does not admit a polynomial kernel subject to a
widely-believed assumption from complexity theory; 3) Edge $k$-Core is FPT
parameterized by $\mathrm{tw}+k$. This improves upon a result of Chitnis and

aeolian flows requires answering the following questions: Is the flow strong
enough to initiate sediment transport, is the flow strong enough to sustain
sediment transport once initiated, and how much sediment is transported by the
flow in the saturated state (i.e., what is the transport capacity)? In the
geomorphological and related literature, the widespread consensus has been that
the initiation, cessation, and capacity of fluvial transport, and the
initiation of aeolian transport, are controlled by fluid entrainment of bed
sediment caused by flow forces overcoming local resisting forces, whereas
aeolian transport cessation and capacity are controlled by impact entrainment
caused by the impacts of transported particles with the bed. Here the physics
of sediment transport initiation, cessation, and capacity is reviewed with
emphasis on recent consensus-challenging developments in sediment transport
experiments, two-phase flow modeling, and the incorporation of granular
physics' concepts. Highlighted are the similarities between dense granular
flows and sediment transport, such as a superslow granular motion known as
creeping (which occurs for arbitrarily weak driving flows) and system-spanning
force networks that resist bed sediment entrainment; the roles of the magnitude
and duration of turbulent fluctuation events in fluid entrainment; the
traditionally overlooked role of particle-bed impacts in triggering entrainment
events in fluvial transport; and the common physical underpinning of transport
thresholds across aeolian and fluvial environments. This sheds a new light on
the well-known Shields diagram, where measurements of fluid entrainment

prove that the testing radius of the indirect test achieves the lower bound,

multiplicative noise removal. The nonlocal self-similarity of natural images
implies that the matrices formed by their nonlocal similar patches are
low-rank. By exploiting this low-rank prior with application to multiplicative
noise removal, we propose a nonlocal low-rank model for this task and develop a
proximal alternating reweighted minimization (PARM) algorithm to solve the
optimization problem resulting from the model. Specifically, we utilize a
generalized nonconvex surrogate of the rank function to regularize the patch
matrices and develop a new nonlocal low-rank model, which is a nonconvex
nonsmooth optimization problem having a patchwise data fidelity and a
generalized nonlocal low-rank regularization term. To solve this optimization
problem, we propose the PARM algorithm, which has a proximal alternating scheme
with a reweighted approximation of its subproblem. A theoretical analysis of
the proposed PARM algorithm is conducted to guarantee its global convergence to
a critical point. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
for multiplicative noise removal significantly outperforms existing methods
such as the benchmark SAR-BM3D method in terms of the visual quality of the
denoised images, and the PSNR (the peak-signal-to-noise ratio) and SSIM (the

device handling shear thinning fluids such as blood, is of utmost importance
for eventual detection of diseases by mixing with the suitable reagents.
Motivated by this proposition, the present study renders a modal stability
analysis of shear thinning fluids in a rotating microchannel modelled by the
Carreau rheological law. When a microchannel is engraved a rotating compact
disc (CD) based device, the centrifugal force acts as the driving force that
actuates the flow and the Coriolis force enhances the mixing process in
significantly short span by destabilizing the flow. An OrrSommerfeld-Squire
analysis is performed to explore the role of these forces on the linear
stability of rotating shear-thinning flow. Reported results on shear thinning
flow with streamwise disturbances indicate that the critical Reynolds number
for the flow transition with viscosity perturbation is nearly half of that of
the critical value for the same without viscosity perturbation. In sharp
contrast, the present analysis considering spanwise disturbances reveals that
the critical Reynolds numbers with and without viscosity perturbation remain
virtually unaltered under rotational effects. However, the viscosity variation
has no significant influence on the Coriolis force-based instability. Numerical
results confirm that a momentous destabilization is possible by aid of the
Coriolis force via generating secondary flow inside the channel. Interestingly,
the roll cells corresponding to the instabilities at lower time constants
exhibit the existence of two distinct vortices, and the centre of the stronger
one is essentially settled towards the unstable stratified region. Moreover,
for a higher value of the time constant, only one vortex occupies the entire
channel.

have relaxed nonradiatively to the ground state at the band edge before

found to be in fair agreement with available experimental data, which include
low-temperature single-dot measurements, though are perhaps systematically
small by a factor of order 1.5, which can plausibly be explained by a
combination of a slightly overestimated dielectric constant and omitted third-
and higher-order terms in the correlation energy. Taking this level of
agreement into account, we estimate that the ground-state biexciton shift for

This value is intermediate among the numerous high-temperature measurements on
NCs of CsPbBr3, which vary from large redshifts of order 100 meV to blueshifts

the learned representations to train a simpler model for predicting time series
movements. We consider a class-conditioned latent variable model. We train an
encoder network to maximize the mutual information between the latent variables
and the trend information conditioned on the encoded observed variables. We
show that conditional mutual information maximization can be approximated by a
contrastive loss. Then, the problem is transformed into a classification task
of determining whether two encoded representations are sampled from the same
class or not. This is equivalent to performing pairwise comparisons of the
training datapoints, and thus, improves the generalization ability of the
encoder network. We use deep autoregressive models as our encoder to capture
long-term dependencies of the sequence data. Empirical experiments indicate
that our proposed method has the potential to advance state-of-the-art
performance.

  (Extended Paper)",,,,,"cs.SE cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  IoT devices are decentralized and deployed in un-stable environments, which
causes them to be prone to various kinds of faults, such as device failure and
network disruption. Yet, current IoT platforms require programmers to handle
faults manually, a complex and error-prone task. In this paper, we present
IoTRepair, a fault-handling system for IoT that (1)integrates a fault
identification module to track faulty devices,(2) provides a library of
fault-handling functions for effectively handling different fault types, (3)
provides a fault handler on top of the library for autonomous IoT fault
handling, with user and developer configuration as input. Through an evaluation
in a simulated lab environment and with various fault injectio
nmethods,IoTRepair is compared with current fault-handling solutions. The fault
handler reduces the incorrect states on average 50.01%, which corresponds to
less unsafe and insecure device states. Overall, through a systematic design of
an IoT fault handler, we provide users flexibility and convenience in handling
complex IoT fault handling, allowing safer IoT environments.

tetrahedron operator is exactly marginal in the large-$N$ limit and for a
purely imaginary tetrahedron coupling a line of real infrared fixed points
(parametrized by the absolute value of the tetrahedron coupling) is found for
the other two couplings. These fixed points have real critical exponents and a
real spectrum of bilinear operators, satisfying unitarity constraints. This
raises the question whether at large-$N$ the model is unitary, despite the

discuss the operator mixing for composite operators and we give a perturbative

adapting a similar proof from the long-range Ising model. At last, we identify
the scaling operators at the fixed point and compute the two- and three-point

the time-optimal protocol that drives a general initial state to a target state

by a Lindblad master equation. Dissipation typically drives the system to the
maximally mixed state; consequently, there generally exists an optimal
evolution time beyond which the decoherence prevents the system from getting
closer to the target state. For some specific dissipation channel, however, the
optimal control can keep the system from the maximum entropy state for
infinitely long. The conditions under which this specific situation arises are
discussed in detail. The numerical procedure to construct the time-optimal

efficiently evaluate the time-dependent singular control which turns out to be
crucial in controlling either an isolated or a dissipative qubit.

invertible mapping on a sample space that can be used to induce a
transformation from a simple probability distribution to a more complex one: if
the simple distribution can be rapidly sampled and its density evaluated, then
so can the complex distribution. Our first application to gravitational waves
uses an autoregressive flow, conditioned on detector strain data, to map a
multivariate standard normal distribution into the posterior distribution over
system parameters. We train the model on artificial strain data consisting of
IMRPhenomPv2 waveforms drawn from a five-parameter $(m_1, m_2, \phi_0, t_c,
d_L)$ prior and stationary Gaussian noise realizations with a fixed power
spectral density. This gives performance comparable to current best
deep-learning approaches to gravitational-wave parameter estimation. We then
build a more powerful latent variable model by incorporating autoregressive
flows within the variational autoencoder framework. This model has performance
comparable to Markov chain Monte Carlo and, in particular, successfully models
the multimodal $\phi_0$ posterior. Finally, we train the autoregressive latent
variable model on an expanded parameter space, including also aligned spins

  We focus on locally checkable graph problems; these are problems in which a
solution is globally feasible if it looks feasible in all constant-radius

questions related to locality are undecidable in general, and even if we focus
on the case of labeled paths and cycles, determining locality is

  We complement prior negative results with efficient algorithms for the cases

identify polynomial-time-computable properties of the automaton $\mathcal{M}$

widely believed to be a key factor limiting the extent of Earth's biosphere and
its impact on remotely detectable features of Earth's atmospheric chemistry.
Continental weathering is conventionally considered to be the only source of
bioavailable phosphorus to the marine biosphere, with submarine hydrothermal
processes acting as a phosphorus sink. Here, we use a novel 29Si tracer
technique to demonstrate that alteration of submarine basalt under anoxic
conditions leads to significant soluble phosphorus release, with an estimated
ratio between phosphorus release and CO2 consumption (P/CO2) of 3.99+/-1.03
umol/mmol. This ratio is comparable to that of modern rivers, suggesting that
submarine weathering under anoxic conditions is potentially a significant
source of bioavailable phosphorus to planetary oceans and that volatile-rich
Earth-like planets lacking exposed continents could develop robust biospheres
capable of sustaining remotely detectable atmospheric biosignatures.

the solar flare. Rain is thought to be caused by a thermal instability, a
localized runaway cooling of material in the corona. The models that
demonstrate this require extremely long duration heating on the order of the
radiative cooling time, localized near the footpoints of the loops. In flares,
electron beams are thought to be the primary energy transport mechanism,
driving strong footpoint heating during the impulsive phase that causes
evaporation, filling and heating flare loops. Electron beams, however, do not
act for a long period of time, and even supposing that they did, their heating
would not remain localized at the footpoints. With a series of numerical
experiments, we show directly that these two issues mean that electron beams
are incapable of causing the formation of rain in flare loops. This result
suggests that either there is another mechanism acting in flare loops
responsible for rain, or that the modeling of the cooling of flare loops is
somehow deficient. To adequately describe flares, the standard model must
address this issue to account for the presence of coronal rain.

certain framed graphs in $F\times I$ called $3$-webs subject to the skein
relations encapsulating relations between $U_q(sl(3))$-representations. These
skein algebras are quantizations of the $SL(3)$-character varieties of
surfaces. It is expected that their theory parallels that of the Kauffman
bracket skein algebras. We make the first step towards developing that theory
by proving that the reduced $SU_3$-skein algebra of any surface of finite type
is finitely generated.
  We achieve that result by developing a theory of canonical forms of webs in
surfaces. Specifically, we show that for any ideal triangulation of $F$ every
reduced $3$-web can be uniquely decomposed into unions of pyramid formations of
hexagons and disjoint arcs in the faces of the triangulation with possible
additional ""crossbars"" connecting their edges along the ideal triangulation. We
show that such canonical position is unique up to ""crossbar moves"". That leads
us to an associated system of coordinates for webs in triangulated surfaces
(counting intersections of the web with the edges of the triangulation and
their rotation numbers inside of the faces of the triangulation) which
determine a reduced web uniquely.
  Finally, we relate our skein algebras to $\cal A$-varieties of Fock-Goncharov
and to $\text{Loc}_{SL(3)}$-varieties of Goncharov-Shen. We believe that our
coordinate system for webs is a manifestation of a (quantum) mirror symmetry

generalized Darcy's law, in which the equivalent fracture permeability is
upscaled from the detailed geological characterizations. The liquid in the much

due to the non-forward neutrino scattering processes in a matter background

the initial neutrino state is depleted but does not actually disappear (the
initial neutrino transitions into a neutrino of a different flavor but does not
decay) those processes should be associated with decoherence effects that
cannot be described in terms of the coherent evolution of the state vector.
Based on the formalism developed in our previous work for treating the
non-forward scattering processes using the notion of the stochastic evolution
of the state, we identify the jump operators, as used in the context of the
master or Lindblad equation, in terms of the results of the the calculation of
the non-forward neutrino scattering contribution to the imaginary part of the

effects of the decoherence terms under various conditions and environments,

$\phi^{2}$ potential can be consistent with the observed bound on $r$ whilst
retaining the successful prediction for $n_{s}$. Here we show that the Palatini
$\phi^{2} R^2$ inflation model can also solve the super-Planckian inflaton
problem of $\phi^{2}$ chaotic inflation, and that the model can be consistent
with Planck scale-suppressed potential corrections. If $\alpha \gtrsim
10^{12}$, where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of the $R^2$ term, the inflaton in
the Einstein frame, $\sigma$, remains sub-Planckian throughout inflation. In
addition, if $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{20}$ then the predictions of the model are
unaffected by Planck-suppressed potential corrections in the case where there
is a broken shift symmetry, and if $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{32}$ then the
predictions are unaffected by Planck-suppressed potential corrections in
general. The value of $r$ is generally small, with $r \lesssim 10^{-5}$ for
$\alpha \gtrsim 10^{12}$. We calculate the maximum possible reheating
temperature, $T_{R\;max}$, corresponding to instantaneous reheating. For
$\alpha \approx 10^{32}$, $T_{R\; max}$ is approximately $10^{10}$ GeV, with
larger values of $T_{R\;max}$ for smaller $\alpha$. For the case of
instantaneous reheating, we show that $n_{s}$ is in agreement with the 2018
Planck results to within 1-$\sigma$, with the exception of the $\alpha \approx
10^{32}$ case, which is close to the 2-$\sigma$ lower bound. Following
inflation, the inflaton condensate is likely to rapidly fragment and form
oscillons. Reheating via inflaton decays to right-handed neutrinos can easily
result in instantaneous reheating. We determine the scale of unitarity
violation and show that, in general, unitarity is conserved during inflation.

propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses
electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective measurement of two kinematics
components that are typically used to assess motor learning and thereby
adaptation: i) the intent to initiate a goal-directed movement, and ii) the
reaction time (RT) of that movement. We evaluated our CNN on data acquired from
an in-house experiment where 13 subjects moved a rehabilitation robotic arm in
four directions on a plane, in response to visual stimuli. Our CNN achieved
average test accuracies of 80.08% and 79.82% in a binary classification of the
intent (intent vs. no intent) and RT (slow vs. fast), respectively. Our results
demonstrate how individual movement components implicated in distinct types of
motor learning can be predicted from synchronized EEG data acquired before the
start of the movement. Our approach can, therefore, inform robotic adaptation
in real-time and has the potential to further improve one's ability to perform
the rehabilitation task.

speed. We show how the observed infrared variability of the pre-transition disc
system LRLL~31 can be modelled by a dust ejecta fan from the inner-most regions
of the disc whose height is partially dependent on the jet flow speed. The
greater the jet flow speed, the higher is the potential dust fan scale height.
An increase in mass accretion onto the star tends to increase the height and

that different scenarios of cosmic evolution can be discussed using Noether

for metamodeling of nonlinear structural systems with scarce data. The basic
concept is to incorporate physics knowledge (e.g., laws of physics, scientific
principles) into deep long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which boosts the
learning within a feasible solution space. The physics constraints are embedded
in the loss function to enforce the model training which can accurately capture
latent system nonlinearity even with very limited available training datasets.
Specifically for dynamic structures, physical laws of equation of motion, state
dependency and hysteretic constitutive relationship are considered to construct
the physics loss. In particular, two physics-informed multi-LSTM network
architectures are proposed for structural metamodeling. The satisfactory
performance of the proposed framework is successfully demonstrated through two
illustrative examples (e.g., nonlinear structures subjected to ground motion

issues, reduce the need of big training datasets, and improve the robustness of
the trained model for more reliable prediction. As a result, the
physics-informed deep learning paradigm outperforms classical
non-physics-guided data-driven neural networks.

purpose hardware to perform so-called mining operations that secure the system,
with miners receiving freshly minted tokens as a reward for their work. A
notable example of such a cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which is primarily mined
using ASIC based machines. Due to the supposed profitability of cryptocurrency
mining, such hardware has been in great demand in recent years, in-spite of
high associated costs like electricity.
  In this work, we show that because mining rewards are given in the mined
cryptocurrency, while expenses are usually paid in some fiat currency such as
the USD, cryptocurrency mining is in fact a bundle of financial options. When
exercised, each option converts electricity to tokens.
  We provide a method of pricing mining hardware based on this insight, and
prove that any other price creates arbitrage. Our method shows that contrary to
the popular belief that mining hardware is worth less if the cryptocurrency is
highly volatile, the opposite effect is true: volatility increases value. Thus,
if a coin's volatility decreases, some miners may leave, affecting security.
  We compare the prices produced by our method to prices obtained from popular
tools currently used by miners and show that the latter only consider the
expected returns from mining, while neglecting to account for the inherent risk
in mining, which is due to the high exchange-rate volatility of
cryptocurrencies.
  Finally, we show that the returns made from mining can be imitated by trading
in bonds and coins, and create such imitating investment portfolios.
Historically, realized revenues of these portfolios have outperformed mining,
showing that indeed hardware is mispriced.

gravity in the early epoch by a 5-d theory with scalar $\psi(r)$. The
acceleration term in the Raychaudhuri equation has been shown to be positive
for flat FRW metric. The scalar $\psi(r)$ satisfies a non-linear differential
equation which is solved. Though singular, the acceleration term turns out to
be finite. With this, the equations for the Hubble parameter H(t) and the scale
factor $a(t)$ are obtained. These are analyzed using 'fixed point analysis'.
Without the scalar field, the age of the universe is finite showing a beginning
of the universe and with out bounce. With the contribution of the scalar
included, the age of the universe is shown to be infinite, thereby resolving
the singularity. The scale factor $a(t)$ exhibits classical bounce, the bounce
being proportional to the effect of the scalar field. The effect of the 5-d
gravity in the early universe is to cause defocussing of the world lines, give
infinite age of the universe thereby resolving the big bang singularity and
classical bounce for the FRW scale factor.

attractive in large scale memory and neuromorphic applications as it is
non-filamentary, area scalable and has multiple resistance states along with
excellent endurance and retention. The PCMO RRAM exhibit area scalable
resistive switching when in contact with the reactive electrode. The interface
redox reaction based resistance switching is observed electrically. Yet,
whether resistance change occurs through partial (close to interface) or entire
bulk is largely debated. Essentially, a two-terminal device is unable to
provide direct evidence of the resistance change location in the PCMO RRAM. In
this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel three-terminal
RRAM device in which a thin third terminal (~20nm) is inserted laterally in a
typical vertical 2 terminal RRAM device of PCMO thickness of ~80nm. Using the
3T-RRAM method, we show that resistance change occurs largely at the upper bulk
(near reactive electrode interface) - which is highly asymmetric. Yet it
produces SCLC based resistance change with symmetric IV characteristics. It is
the first time that an interface redox and bulk SCLC based resistance change
has been experimentally shown as correlated and consistent - enabled by the 3rd
terminal of the RRAM. Such a study enables a critical understanding of the
device which enables the design and development of PCMO RRAM for memory and
neuromorphic computing applications.

discussed. The discussion focuses on the departure from equilibrium;
represented as a macroscopic ""drift"" velocity. Then a continuous flow, phase
change driven molecular dynamics setup is used to investigate steady state
condensation at a flat liquid-vapor interface of argon at various phase change
rates and temperatures to elucidate the effect of equilibrium departure. MAC is
computed directly from the kinetic theory based Hertz-Knudsen (H-K) and Schrage
(exact and approximate) expressions without the need for a priori physical
definitions, ad hoc particle injection/removal or particle counting. MAC values
determined from the approximate and exact Schrage expressions
($\alpha_{app}^{Schrage}$ and $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$) are between 0.8 and
0.9, while MAC values from the H-K expression ($\alpha^{H-K}$) are above unity
for all cases tested. $\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ yields values closest to the
results from transition state theory [J Chem Phys, 118, 1392-1399 (2003)]. The
departure from equilibrium does not affect the value of
$\alpha_{exact}^{Schrage}$ but causes $\alpha^{H-K}$ to vary drastically
emphasizing the importance of a drift velocity correction. Additionally,
equilibrium departure causes a non-uniform distribution in vapor properties. At
the condensing interface, a local rise in vapor temperature and a drop in vapor
density are observed when compared with the corresponding bulk values.

Previous attempts to learn VAEs for language data faced challenges due to

observations and latent variables, and is robust against posterior collapse. As
such, it learns informative representations whose dimension can be an order of
magnitude higher than existing language VAEs. Importantly, the SentenceMIM loss
has no hyper-parameters, simplifying optimization. We compare sentenceMIM with
VAE, and AE on multiple datasets. SentenceMIM yields excellent reconstruction,
comparable to AEs, with a rich structured latent space, comparable to VAEs. The
structured latent representation is demonstrated with interpolation between

with a tiny electro-optic modal volume of only 0.58 $\mu {\rm m}^3$. The
modulators enable efficient electro-optic driving of high-Q photonic cavity
modes in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and allow us to achieve
electro-optic switching at 11 Gb/s with a bit-switching energy as low as 22 fJ.
