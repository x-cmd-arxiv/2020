unknown network protocols by analyzing observable network messages. To perform
correct deduction of message semantics or behavior analysis, accurate message
type identification is an essential first step. However, identifying message
types is particularly difficult for binary protocols, whose structural features
are hidden in their densely packed data representation. We leverage the
intrinsic structural features of binary protocols and propose an accurate
method for discriminating message types.
  Our approach uses a similarity measure with continuous value range by
comparing feature vectors where vector elements correspond to the fields in a
message, rather than discrete byte values. This enables a better recognition of
structural patterns, which remain hidden when only exact value matches are
considered. We combine Hirschberg alignment with DBSCAN as cluster algorithm to
yield a novel inference mechanism. By applying novel autoconfiguration schemes,
we do not require manually configured parameters for the analysis of an unknown
protocol, as required by earlier approaches.
  Results of our evaluations show that our approach has considerable advantages
in message type identification result quality and also execution performance
over previous approaches.

significant attention due to the invent of different types graph neural

Conventional GCNs can be applied to simple graphs where each edge connects only
two nodes. But many modern days applications need to model high order
relationships in a graph. Hypergraphs are effective data types to handle such
complex relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to apply
graph convolution on hypergraphs with variable hyperedge sizes. We use the
classical concept of line graph of a hypergraph for the first time in the
hypergraph learning literature. Then we propose to use graph convolution on the

similarly to a stationary magnetic field and lifts the spin degeneracy of

that could derive it. Thus, in this work we have raised this issue by proposing
two new nonlinear interaction functions and constrain them using cosmic
microwave background (CMB) from Planck 2018, baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO), dark energy survey and a measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 2019. The dark energy equation of state is
considered to be constant throughout the work and the geometry of the universe
is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic with zero spatial curvature. Our
analyses report that a non-zero interaction is always allowed by the
observational data and the dark energy equation of state is bent towards the
phantom regime. In particular, when $H_0$ from HST is added to Planck 2018+BAO,
we find an evidence for a non-zero coupling at more than $2\sigma$ confidence
level. Our analyses also report that for both the models, $H_0$ is close to its
local measurements and thus alleviating the $H_0$ tension. In particular, one
of the interacting models perfectly solves the $H_0$ tension.

position of catheters must be assessed on all radiographs, as serious
complications can arise if catheters are malpositioned. However, due to the
large number of radiographs performed each day, there can be substantial delays
between the time a radiograph is performed and when it is interpreted by a
radiologist. Computer-aided approaches hold the potential to assist in
prioritizing radiographs with potentially malpositioned catheters for
interpretation and automatically insert text indicating the placement of
catheters in radiology reports, thereby improving radiologists' efficiency.
After 50 years of research in computer-aided diagnosis, there is still a
paucity of study in this area. With the development of deep learning
approaches, the problem of catheter assessment is far more solvable. Therefore,
we have performed a review of current algorithms and identified key challenges
in building a reliable computer-aided diagnosis system for assessment of
catheters on radiographs. This review may serve to further the development of
machine learning approaches for this important use case.

samples that is sublinear in the domain.
  To do this, we develop a structural lemma describing monotone probability
distributions. The structural lemma has further implications to the sample
complexity of basic testing tasks for analyzing monotone probability
distributions over the Boolean cube: We use it to give nontrivial upper bounds
on the tasks of estimating the distance of a monotone distribution to uniform

of monotone probability distributions over the Boolean cube, our algorithms are
the first to have sample complexity lower than known lower bounds for the same

  One further consequence of our learning algorithm is an improved sample

(AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service
attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a
framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries.
HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java
objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test.
We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed
inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing,
HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java
programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities
outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high
CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We
evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular
Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time
Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by
comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of
AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In
this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously
unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and
received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that
micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that
micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.

required to make a prediction, for each month of a 5-year future time period,
of three key outcomes: clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale
Cognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog13), and total volume of the ventricles. The
methods used by challenge participants included multivariate linear regression,
machine learning methods such as support vector machines and deep neural
networks, as well as disease progression models. No single submission was best
at predicting all three outcomes. For clinical diagnosis and ventricle volume
prediction, the best algorithms strongly outperform simple baselines in
predictive ability. However, for ADAS-Cog13 no single submitted prediction
method was significantly better than random guesswork. Two ensemble methods
based on taking the mean and median over all predictions, obtained top scores
on almost all tasks. Better than average performance at diagnosis prediction
was generally associated with the additional inclusion of features from
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). On the
other hand, better performance at ventricle volume prediction was associated
with inclusion of summary statistics, such as the slope or maxima/minima of
biomarkers. TADPOLE's unique results suggest that current prediction algorithms
provide sufficient accuracy to exploit biomarkers related to clinical diagnosis
and ventricle volume, for cohort refinement in clinical trials for Alzheimer's
disease. However, results call into question the usage of cognitive test scores
for patient selection and as a primary endpoint in clinical trials.

However, several recent studies showed that community detection is vulnerable

studies on certifying robustness of community detection against such

Specifically, we develop the first certified robustness guarantee of community
detection against adversarial structural perturbation. Given an arbitrary
community detection method, we build a new smoothed community detection method
via randomly perturbing the graph structure. We theoretically show that the
smoothed community detection method provably groups a given arbitrary set of
nodes into the same community (or different communities) when the number of
edges added/removed by an attacker is bounded. Moreover, we show that our
certified robustness is tight. We also empirically evaluate our method on
multiple real-world graphs with ground truth communities.

  interactions with and without a mean current",,"Phys. Rev. Fluids 6, 024801 (2021)","10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.024801",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we show that Stokes drift may be significantly affected when
an incident intermediate or shallow water surface wave travels over a
corrugated sea-floor. The underlying mechanism is Bragg resonance -- reflected
waves generated via nonlinear resonant interactions between an incident wave
and a rippled bottom. We theoretically explain the fundamental effect of two
counter-propagating Stokes waves on Stokes drift and then perform numerical
simulations of Bragg resonance using High-order Spectral method. A
monochromatic incident wave on interaction with a patch of bottom ripple yields
a complex interference between the incident and reflected waves. When the
velocity induced by the reflected waves exceeds that of the incident, particle
trajectories reverse, leading to a backward drift. Lagrangian and
Lagrangian-mean trajectories reveal that surface particles near the up-wave
side of the patch are either trapped or reflected, implying that the rippled
patch acts as a non-surface-invasive particle trap or reflector. On increasing
the length and amplitude of the rippled patch; reflection, and thus the
effectiveness of the patch, increases. The inclusion of realistic constant
current shows noticeable differences between Lagrangian-mean trajectories with
and without the rippled patch. Theoretical analysis reveals additional terms in
the Stokes drift arising from the particular solution due to
mean-current--bottom-ripple interactions, irrespective of whether Bragg
resonance condition is met. Our analyses may be useful for designing
artificial, corrugated sea-floor patches for mitigating microplastics and other
forms of ocean pollution. We also expect that sea-floor corrugations,
especially in the nearshore region, may significantly affect oceanic tracer
transport.

origin of the recently discovered globular cluster FSR 1758, often associated
with some past merger event, and which happens to be projected toward the
Galactic bulge, by a detailed study of its Galactic orbit, and to assign it to
the most suitable Galactic component. We employ three different analytical
time-independent potential models to calculate the orbit of the cluster by
using the Gauss Radau spacings integration method. In addition, a
time-dependent bar potential model is added to account for the influence of the
Galactic bar. We run a large suite of simulations to account for the
uncertainties in the initial conditions, in a Montecarlo fashion. We confirm
previous indications that the globular cluster FSR 1758 possesses a retrograde
orbits with high eccentricity. The comparative analysis of the orbital
parameters of star clusters in the Milky Way, in tandem with recent metallicity
estimates, allows us to conclude that FSR1758 is indeed a Galactic bulge
intruder. The cluster can therefore be considered an old metal poor halo
globular cluster formed {\it in situ} and which is passing right now in the
bulge region. Its properties, however, can be roughly accounted for also
assuming that the cluster is part of some stream of extra-Galactic origin. We
conclude that assessing the origin, either Galactic or extra-galactic, of
globular clusters is surely a tantalising task. In any case, by using an {\it
Occam's razor} argument, we tend to prefer an {\it in situ} origin for FSR
1758.

one is given a collection of weighted applications of constraints from a finite
constraint language $\Gamma$, over a common set of variables, and the goal is
to assign Boolean values to the variables so that the total weight of satisfied
constraints is maximized. There exists an elegant dichotomy theorem providing a
criterion on $\Gamma$ for the problem to be polynomial-time solvable and
stating that otherwise it becomes NP-hard. We study the NP hard cases through
the lens of kernelization and provide a complete characterization of Max
CSP$(\Gamma)$ with respect to the optimal compression size. Namely, we prove
that Max CSP$(\Gamma)$ parameterized by the number of variables $n$ is either
polynomial-time solvable, or there exists an integer $d \ge 2$ depending on
$\Gamma$, such that
  1. An instance of \textsc{Max CSP$(\Gamma)$} can be compressed into an
equivalent instance with $O(n^d\log n)$ bits in polynomial time,
  2. Max CSP$(\Gamma)$ does not admit such a compression to $O(n^{d-\epsilon})$
bits unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{co-NP} / \text{poly}$.
  Our reductions are based on interpreting constraints as multilinear
polynomials combined with the framework of constraint implementations. As
another application of our reductions, we reveal tight connections between
optimal running times for solving Max CSP$(\Gamma)$. More precisely, we show
that obtaining a running time of the form $O(2^{(1-\epsilon)n})$ for particular
classes of Max CSPs is as hard as breaching this barrier for Max $d$-SAT for
some $d$.

linear support vector machine and logistic loss single hidden layer network for
binary classification on several image benchmarks, thus establishing that our
method is on-par in test accuracy with convex losses. We then subject them to
accurately trained substitute model black box attacks on the same image
benchmarks and find them to be more robust than convex counterparts. On CIFAR10

perturbation of 0.0625 we see that the MLP01 network loses 27\% in accuracy

us much of what we know today on how key biophysical (e.g. ECM stiffness) and
biochemical (e.g. cytokine gradients) parameters within the tumor
microenvironment guided and regulated tumor invasion. One limitation of the
single tumor cell invasion assay was that it did not account for cell-cell

co-culture spheroid invasion assay that was compatible with microscopic
imaging. Micrometer scale co-culture spheroids (1:1 ratio of metastatic breast

an array of microwells, and then were embedded within a collagen matrix in a

that the spatial distribution of the two cell types within the tumor spheroid
critically regulated tumor invasion. This work linked tumor architecture with

better estimated with the distances close to the lower limit of the previously

rotator, we have considered the partial accretion/ejection from the co-rotation

brings at least equally best fitting to the observed X-ray luminosity and the

the mass accretion rate which causes the change in observed $L_{\mathrm{x}}$ of

variability attributed to their rotation, while the majority of older and less
active stars, including the Sun, have more complex and non-regular light-curves
which do not have clear rotational-modulation signals. Consequently, the
rotation periods have been successfully determined only for a small fraction of
the Sun-like stars observed by transit-based planet-hunting missions, such as
CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS. This suggests that only a small fraction of such
systems have been properly identified as solar-like analogs. We apply a new
method for determining rotation periods of low-activity stars, like the Sun.
The method is based on calculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) of
stellar brightness variations and identifying a tell-tale inflection point in
the spectrum. The rotation frequency is then proportional to the frequency of
that inflection point. In this paper test this GPS method against available
photometric records of the Sun. We apply GPS, autocorrelation functions,
Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and wavelet analyses to the total solar irradiance
(TSI) time series obtained from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on the Solar
Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and the Variability of solar
IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) experiment on the SOlar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) missions. We analyse the performance of all
methods at various levels of solar activity. We show that the GPS method
returns accurate values of solar rotation independently of the level of solar
activity. In particular, it performs well during periods of high solar
activity, when TSI variability displays an irregular pattern and other methods
fail. Our results suggest that the GPS method can successfully determine the
rotational periods of stars with both regular and non-regular light-curves.

channel, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) appears as an attractive
solution to support massive machine type communication (mMTC) that faces a
massive number of devices competing to access the limited number of shared
radio resources. In this paper, we first analytically study the throughput
performance of NOMA-based random access (RA), namely NOMA-RA. We show that
while increasing the number of power levels in NOMA-RA leads to a further gain
in maximum throughput, the growth of throughput gain is slower than linear.
This is due to the higher-power dominance characteristic in power-domain NOMA
known in the literature. We explicitly quantify the throughput gain for the
very first time in this paper. With our analytical model, we verify the
performance advantage of the proposed NOMA-RA scheme by comparing with the
baseline multi-channel slotted ALOHA (MS-ALOHA), with and without capture
effect. Despite the higher-power dominance effect, the maximum throughput of
NOMA-RA with four power levels achieves over three times that of the MS-ALOHA.
However, our analytical results also reveal the sensitivity of load on the
throughput of NOMA-RA. To cope with the potential bursty traffic in mMTC
scenarios, we propose adaptive load regulation through a practical user barring
algorithm. By estimating the current load based on the observable channel
feedback, the algorithm adaptively controls user access to maintain the optimal
loading of channels to achieve maximum throughput. When the proposed user
barring algorithm is applied, simulations demonstrate that the instantaneous
throughput of NOMA-RA always remains close to the maximum throughput confirming
the effectiveness of our load regulation.

predictions enable rapid generation of contextual hypotheses that bias the
outcome of the recognition process. This mechanism is especially advantageous
in situations of uncertainty, when visual input is ambiguous. In addition, the
human visual system continuously updates its knowledge about the world based on
the gaps between its prediction and the visual feedback. Convolutional neural
networks are feed forward in nature and lack such top-down contextual
attenuation mechanisms. As a result, although they process massive amounts of
visual information during their operation, the information is not transformed

interact is insufficiently known. To better understand this dynamics, we
develop a tracking algorithm for cold pool gust fronts. Rather than tracking
thermodynamic anomalies, which do not generally coincide with the gust front
boundaries, our approach tracks the dynamical cold pool outflow. Our algorithm
first determines the locus of the precipitation event. Second, relative to this
origin and for each azimuthal bin, the steepest gradient in the near-surface
horizontal radial velocity $v_r$ is employed to determine the respective locus
of the cold pool gust front edge. Steepest $v_r$-gradients imply largest
updraft velocities, hence strongest dynamical triggering. Results are compared
to a previous algorithm based on the steepest gradient in temperature ---
highlighting the benefit of the method described here in determining
dynamically active gust front regions. Applying the method to a range of

pools. A linear relation emerges between the peak rain intensity of a given

number density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ of precipitation cells, and that interaction
scales quadratically with $\rho(\mathbf{r})$. Our model mimics global energy
constraints by limiting further cell production when many cells are present.
The phase diagram shows a continuous phase transition between a continuum and
an aggregated state. Strong cold pool-cold pool interaction gives a uniform
convective phase, while weak interaction yields few and independent cells.
Segregation results for intermediate interaction strength.

the composable finite-size effects become more significant with the

meta-GGA functionals. Our results show that for the relative energies of
isomers with respect to reference CCSD(T) values, the uncorrected SCAN
functional has the smallest deviation of 21 meV, better than that for the MP2

than SIC-LSDA and SIC-PBE, but it reverses the ordering of the two lowest
isomers for water hexamer anions. Removing self interaction error (SIE)
corrects the tendency of LSDA, PBE, and SCAN to over-bind the extra electron.
The vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of water cluster anions, obtained from
the total energy differences of corresponding anion and neutral clusters, are
significantly improved by removing self-interaction and are better than the
hybrid B3LYP functional, but fall short of MP2 accuracy. Removing SIE results
in substantial improvement in the position of the eigenvalue of the extra

excellent approximation to the VDE, especially for SIC-PBE where the mean

users often demand image compression methods to be mathematically lossless. But
lossless image coding has a rather low compression ratio (around 2:1 for
natural images). The only known technique to achieve significant compression
while meeting the stringent fidelity requirements is the methodology of
$\ell_\infty$-constrained coding that was developed and standardized in
nineties. We make a major progress in $\ell_\infty$-constrained image coding
after two decades, by developing a novel CNN-based soft
$\ell_\infty$-constrained decoding method. The new method repairs compression
defects by using a restoration CNN called the $\ell_\infty\mbox{-SDNet}$ to map
a conventionally decoded image to the latent image. A unique strength of the
$\ell_\infty\mbox{-SDNet}$ is its ability to enforce a tight error bound on a
per pixel basis. As such, no small distinctive structures of the original image
can be dropped or distorted, even if they are statistical outliers that are
otherwise sacrificed by mainstream CNN restoration methods. More importantly,
this research ushers in a new image compression system of
$\ell_\infty$-constrained encoding and deep soft decoding
($\ell_\infty\mbox{-ED}^2$). The $\ell_\infty \mbox{-ED}^2$ approach beats the
best of existing lossy image compression methods (e.g., BPG, WebP, etc.) not
only in $\ell_\infty$ but also in $\ell_2$ error metric and perceptual quality,
for bit rates near the threshold of perceptually transparent reconstruction.
Operationally, the new compression system is practical, with a low-complexity
real-time encoder and a cascade decoder consisting of a fast initial decoder
and an optional CNN soft decoder.

training deep networks in practice. SGD is known to find a flat minimum that
often generalizes well. However, it is mathematically unclear how deep learning
can select a flat minimum among so many minima. To answer the question
quantitatively, we develop a density diffusion theory (DDT) to reveal how
minima selection quantitatively depends on the minima sharpness and the
hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
theoretically and empirically prove that, benefited from the Hessian-dependent
covariance of stochastic gradient noise, SGD favors flat minima exponentially
more than sharp minima, while Gradient Descent (GD) with injected white noise
favors flat minima only polynomially more than sharp minima. We also reveal
that either a small learning rate or large-batch training requires
exponentially many iterations to escape from minima in terms of the ratio of

Numerical investigation shows that each figure-eight solution has some
bifurcation points. Six bifurcation patterns are known with respect to the

  In this paper we will show the followings. The variational principle of

the study of which greatly important especially for the widely adopted
real-time image processing tasks (e.g., object detection, tracking). In this
paper, we initiate the first step to comprehensively investigate the potential
hazards of the blur effect for DNN, caused by object motion. We propose a novel
adversarial attack method that can generate visually natural motion-blurred
adversarial examples, named motion-based adversarial blur attack (ABBA). To
this end, we first formulate the kernel-prediction-based attack where an input
image is convolved with kernels in a pixel-wise way, and the misclassification
capability is achieved by tuning the kernel weights. To generate visually more
natural and plausible examples, we further propose the saliency-regularized
adversarial kernel prediction, where the salient region serves as a moving
object, and the predicted kernel is regularized to achieve naturally visual
effects. Besides, the attack is further enhanced by adaptively tuning the
translations of object and background. A comprehensive evaluation on the
NeurIPS'17 adversarial competition dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of
ABBA by considering various kernel sizes, translations, and regions. The
in-depth study further confirms that our method shows more effective
penetrating capability to the state-of-the-art GAN-based deblurring mechanisms

submodular function $f = g - \ell$ expressed as the difference between a
monotone submodular function $g$ and a modular function $\ell$. Indeed,
submodularity is inherently related to the notions of diversity, coverage, and
representativeness. In particular, finding the mode of many popular
probabilistic models of diversity, such as determinantal point processes,
submodular probabilistic models, and strongly log-concave distributions,
involves maximization of (regularized) submodular functions. Since a
regularized function $f$ can potentially take on negative values, the classic
theory of submodular maximization, which heavily relies on the non-negativity
assumption of submodular functions, may not be applicable. To circumvent this
challenge, we develop the first one-pass streaming algorithm for maximizing a
regularized submodular function subject to a $k$-cardinality constraint. It
returns a solution $S$ with the guarantee that $f(S)\geq(\phi^{-2}-\epsilon)
\cdot g(OPT)-\ell (OPT)$, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio. Furthermore, we
develop the first distributed algorithm that returns a solution $S$ with the
guarantee that $\mathbb{E}[f(S)] \geq (1-\epsilon) [(1-e^{-1}) \cdot
g(OPT)-\ell(OPT)]$ in $O(1/ \epsilon)$ rounds of MapReduce computation, without
keeping multiple copies of the entire dataset in each round (as it is usually
done). We should highlight that our result, even for the unregularized case
where the modular term $\ell$ is zero, improves the memory and communication
complexity of the existing work by a factor of $O(1/ \epsilon)$ while arguably
provides a simpler distributed algorithm and a unifying analysis. We also
empirically study the performance of our scalable methods on a set of real-life
applications, including finding the mode of distributions, data summarization,
and product recommendation.

candidates for the central engines of fast radio bursts (FRBs), since the first
localized repeating burst FRB 121102 happens in a star forming dwarf galaxy,
which is similar to the host galaxies of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and
long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). However, FRB 180924 and FRB 190523 are localized
to massive galaxies with low rates of star formation, compared with the host of
FRB 121102. Meanwhile, the offsets between the bursts and host centers are
about 4 kpc and 29 kpc for FRB 180924 and FRB 190523, respectively. These
properties of hosts are similar to short gamma-ray bursts \textbf{(SGRBs)},
which are produced by mergers of binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron
star-black hole (NS-BH). Therefore, the NSs powering FRBs may be formed in BNS
mergers. In this paper, we study the BNS merger rates, merger times, and
predict their most likely merger locations for different types of host galaxies
using population synthesis method. We find that the BNS merger channel is
consistent with the recently reported offsets of FRB 180924 and FRB 190523. The
offset distribution of short GRBs is well reproduced by population synthesis
using galaxy model which is similar to GRB hosts. The event rate of FRBs
(including non-repeating and repeating), is larger than those of BNS merger and
short GRBs, which requires a large fraction of observed FRBs emitting several
bursts. Using curvature radiation by bunches in NS magnetospheres, we also
predict the observational properties of FRBs from BNS mergers, including the
dispersion measure, and rotation measure. At late times ($t\geq1$yr), the
contribution to dispersion measure and rotation measure from BNS merger ejecta

  We consider two variations of fairness constraint for the problem of
correlation clustering where each node has a color, and the goal is to form

number of colors in each cluster is $1:p$, we get
$\mathcal{O}(p^2)$-approximation algorithm. Our algorithm could be extended to
the case of multiple colors. We prove this problem is NP-hard.

invariant to factors of variability not related to speaker identity.
Disentanglement of speaker representations is one of the techniques used to
improve robustness of speaker representations to both intrinsic factors that
are acquired during speech production (e.g., emotion, lexical content) and
extrinsic factors that are acquired during signal capture (e.g., channel,
noise). Disentanglement in neural speaker representations can be achieved
either in a supervised fashion with annotations of the nuisance factors
(factors not related to speaker identity) or in an unsupervised fashion without
labels of the factors to be removed. In either case it is important to
understand the extent to which the various factors of variability are entangled
in the representations. In this work, we examine speaker representations with
and without unsupervised disentanglement for the amount of information they
capture related to a suite of factors. Using classification experiments we
provide empirical evidence that disentanglement reduces the information with
respect to nuisance factors from speaker representations, while retaining
speaker information. This is further validated by speaker verification
experiments on the VOiCES corpus in several challenging acoustic conditions. We
also show improved robustness in speaker verification tasks using data
augmentation during training of disentangled speaker embeddings. Finally, based

and three different proteins [lysozyme (Lys), myoglobin (Myo), and bovine serum

its birefringence. Further, as the protein concentrates, it forms cracks under

drying process is examined using an automated image processing technique that
reveals three unique regimes: a steady upsurge, a speedy rise, and an eventual
saturation. The high values of standard deviation show the complexity, the
roughness, and inhomogeneity of the image surface. A semi-automated image

consecutive cracks by converting those into high contrast images. The outcome

from a long-range N\'{e}el order to a short-range ``spin liquid'' via the
superexchange anisotropy, giving rise to a complex phase diagram at finite

the charge is always self-localized in the N\'{e}el ordered phase, a second
insulating phase emerges, in which the doped holes become paired but remain
localized while the transverse spin-spin correlation reduces to short-ranged
one to make the N\'{e}el order classical. Only when the N\'{e}el order totally
disappears by further reducing anisotropy, does the pairing become truly
coherent as characterized by a Luther-Emery state. In sharp contrast, the
pairing is totally absent in the in-plane ferromagnetic XXZ regime, where a
direct transition from the charge self-localization in the N\'{e}el ordered

success of knowledge distillation, better understanding of how it benefits
student model's training dynamics remains under-explored. In this paper, we
categorize teacher's knowledge into three hierarchical levels and study its
effects on knowledge distillation: (1) knowledge of the `universe', where KD
brings a regularization effect through label smoothing; (2) domain knowledge,
where teacher injects class relationships prior to student's logit layer
geometry; and (3) instance specific knowledge, where teacher rescales student
model's per-instance gradients based on its measurement on the event
difficulty. Using systematic analyses and extensive empirical studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we confirm that the aforementioned three
factors play a major role in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, based on our
findings, we diagnose some of the failure cases of applying KD from recent
studies.

we define a reward function that is inversely proportional to the distance to
its neighbor, and then adjust the credibility based on the reward derived at
the present step and the previous credibility. In such a way, the interaction

consequence of unitarity which is the fundamental symmetry of quantum
mechanics. In order to study the conservation of information, we need to
understand the nature of the entanglement entropy. The entropy of Hawking
radiation is approximately equal to the maximum of entanglement entropy if a
black hole is in a state before the Page time, i.e., when the entropy of
Hawking radiation is smaller than the entropy of the black hole. However, if
there exists a process generating smaller entanglements rather than maximal
entanglements, the entropy of Hawking radiation will become smaller than the
maximum of the entanglement entropy before the Page time. If this process
accumulates, even though the probability is small, the emitted radiation can
eventually be distinguished from the exactly thermal state. In this paper, we
provide several interpretations of this phenomenon: (1) information of the
collapsed matter is emitted before the Page time, (2) there exists a firewall
or a non-local effect before the Page time, or (3) the statistical entropy is
greater than the areal entropy; a monster is formed. Our conclusion will help
resolve the information loss paradox by providing groundwork for further

FWHM; $\sim$4.5 kpc at $z=2$), we find that the half-light radius of H$\alpha$
is significantly larger than that of the FIR continuum in half of the sample,
and on average H$\alpha$ is a median factor of $2.0\pm0.4$ larger. Having
explored various ways to correct for the attenuation, we find that the
attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$-based SFRs are systematically lower than the
IR-based SFRs by at least a median factor of $3\pm1$, which cannot be explained
by the difference in half-light radius alone. In addition, we find that in 40%
of cases the total $V$-band attenuation ($A_V$) derived from energy balance
modeling of the full ultraviolet(UV)-to-FIR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) is significantly higher than that derived from SED modeling using only
the UV-to-NIR part of the SEDs, and the discrepancy appears to increase with
increasing total infrared luminosity. Finally, considering all our findings

distributions in SMGs, and possibly also in less IR luminous $z\sim2$ massive
star-forming galaxies, can be decomposed into three main components; the
diffuse dust heated by older stellar populations, the more obscured and
extended young star-forming HII regions, and the heavily obscured central
regions that have a low filling factor but dominate the infrared luminosity in

intermediate layers is still a challenge due to the opaque internal state and

interpret intermediate layers by quantifying its ability to distinguish a
user-defined concept (from random examples), the questions of robustness
(variation against the choice of random examples) and effectiveness (retrieval
rate of concept images) remain. We investigate these two properties and propose
improvements to make concept activations reliable for practical use.
  Effectiveness: If the intermediate layer has effectively learned a
user-defined concept, it should be able to recall --- at the testing step ---
most of the images containing the proposed concept. For instance, we observed
that the recall rate of Tiger shark and Great white shark from the ImageNet
dataset with ""Fins"" as a user-defined concept was only 18.35% for VGG16. To
increase the effectiveness of concept learning, we propose A-CAV --- the
Adversarial Concept Activation Vector --- this results in larger margins
between user concepts and (negative) random examples. This approach improves
the aforesaid recall to 76.83% for VGG16.
  For robustness, we define it as the ability of an intermediate layer to be
consistent in its recall rate (the effectiveness) for different random seeds.
We observed that TCAV has a large variance in recalling a concept across
different random seeds. For example, the recall of cat images (from a layer
learning the concept of tail) varies from 18% to 86% with 20.85% standard
deviation on VGG16. We propose a simple and scalable modification that employs
a Gram-Schmidt process to sample random noise from concepts and learn an
average ""concept classifier"". This approach improves the aforesaid standard

projected into side information templates such as attributes. However, the
irregular distribution of templates makes classification results confused. To
alleviate this issue, we propose a novel framework called Discriminative Anchor
Generation and Distribution Alignment Model (DAGDA). Firstly, in order to
rectify the distribution of original templates, a diffusion based graph
convolutional network, which can explicitly model the interaction between class
and side information, is proposed to produce discriminative anchors. Secondly,
to further align the samples with the corresponding anchors in anchor space,
which aims to refine the distribution in a fine-grained manner, we introduce a
semantic relation regularization in anchor space. Following the way of
inductive learning, our approach outperforms some existing state-of-the-art
methods, on several benchmark datasets, for both conventional as well as
generalized ZSL setting. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments strongly
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

minimise. While the theory of admissible losses from both a computational and
statistical perspective is well-developed, these offer a panoply of different
choices. In practice, this choice is typically made in an \emph{ad hoc} manner.
In hopes of making this procedure more principled, the problem of
\emph{learning the loss function} for a downstream task (e.g., classification)
has garnered recent interest. However, works in this area have been generally
empirical in nature.
  In this paper, we revisit the {\sc SLIsotron} algorithm of Kakade et al.
(2011) through a novel lens, derive a generalisation based on Bregman
divergences, and show how it provides a principled procedure for learning the
loss. In detail, we cast {\sc SLIsotron} as learning a loss from a family of
composite square losses. By interpreting this through the lens of \emph{proper
losses}, we derive a generalisation of {\sc SLIsotron} based on Bregman
divergences. The resulting {\sc BregmanTron} algorithm jointly learns the loss
along with the classifier. It comes equipped with a simple guarantee of
convergence for the loss it learns, and its set of possible outputs comes with
a guarantee of agnostic approximability of Bayes rule. Experiments indicate
that the {\sc BregmanTron} substantially outperforms the {\sc SLIsotron}, and
that the loss it learns can be minimized by other algorithms for different
tasks, thereby opening the interesting problem of \textit{loss transfer}
between domains.

by the pitch of the twisted stacking of their constituent rod-like molecules.
Under homeotropic anchoring conditions where the molecules prefer to orient
perpendicular to an interface, cholesteric interfaces exhibit striped phases
with stripe widths commensurate with the pitch. Conversely, planar anchoring
conditions have the molecules remain in the plane of the interface so that the
CLC twists perpendicular to it. Recent work [L. Tran et al. Phys. Rev. X 7,
041029 (2017)] shows that varying the anchoring conditions dramatically
rearranges the CLC stripe pattern, exchanging defects in the stripe pattern
with defects in the molecular orientation of the liquid crystal molecules. We
show with experiments and numerical simulations that the CLC stripes also
undergo an undulation instability when we transition from homeotropic to planar
anchoring conditions and vice versa. The undulation can be interpreted as a
transient relaxation of the CLC resulting from a strain in the cholesteric
layers due to a tilting pitch axis, with properties analogous to the classic
Helfrich-Hurault instability. We focus on CLC shells in particular and show
that the spherical topology of the shell also plays an important role in
shaping the undulations.

measured in very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays with the VERITAS observatory.
This is the highest flux state for Mrk 421 ever observed in VHE $\gamma$-rays.
Data are analyzed from a coordinated campaign across multiple instruments
including VHE $\gamma$-ray (VERITAS, MAGIC), high-energy (HE) $\gamma$-ray
(Fermi-LAT), X-ray (Swift}, RXTE, MAXI), optical (including the GASP-WEBT
collaboration and polarization data) and radio (Mets\""ahovi, OVRO, UMRAO).
Light curves are produced spanning multiple days before and after the peak of
the VHE flare, including over several flare `decline' epochs. The main flare
statistics allow 2-minute time bins to be constructed in both the VHE and
optical bands enabling a cross-correlation analysis that shows evidence for an
optical lag of $\sim$25-55 minutes, the first time-lagged correlation between
these bands reported on such short timescales. Limits on the Doppler factor
($\delta \gtrsim 33$) and the size of the emission region ($ \delta^{-1}R_B
\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{13}\,\,\mbox{cm}$) are obtained from the fast
variability observed by VERITAS during the main flare. Analysis of
10-minute-binned VHE and X-ray data over the decline epochs shows an
extraordinary range of behavior in the flux-flux relationship: from linear to
quadratic to lack of correlation to anti-correlation. Taken together, these
detailed observations of an unprecedented flare seen in Mrk 421 are difficult
to explain by the classic single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model.

that the hypotheses expanded only once at each decoding step in most cases;

connected subgraph of $G$ containing $R$ and minimizing the sum of weights of
its edges. We observe that many approximation algorithms for Steiner Tree
follow a similar scheme (meta-algorithm) and perform (exhaustively) a similar
routine which we call star contraction. Here, by a star contraction, we mean
finding a star-like subgraph in the input graph minimizing the ratio of its
weight to the number of contained terminals minus one. It is not hard to see
that the well-known MST-approximation seeks the best star to contract among
those containing two terminals only. We perform an empirical study of star
contractions with the relaxed condition on the number of terminals in each star
contraction. Our experiments suggest the following: -- if the algorithm
performs star contractions exhaustively, the quality of the solution is usually
slightly better than Zelikovsky's 11/6-approximation algorithm, -- on average
the quality of the solution returned by the MST-approximation algorithm
improves with every star contraction, -- the same holds for iterated MST
(MST+), which outperforms MST in every measurement while keeping very fast
running time (on average $\sim 3\times$ slower than MST), -- on average the
quality of the solution obtained by exhaustively performing star contraction is
about 16\% better than the initial MST-approximation, and -- we propose a more
precise way to find the so-called improved stars which yield a slightly better
solution within a comparable running time (on average $\sim 3\times$ slower).
Furthermore, we propose two improvements of Zelikovsky's 11/6-approximation
algorithm and we empirically confirm that the quality of the solution returned

Exploring Starts (MCES), where the Q-function is estimated by averaging the
Monte Carlo returns, and the policy is improved by choosing actions that
maximize the current estimate of the Q-function. Exploration is performed by
""exploring starts"", that is, each episode begins with a randomly chosen state
and action, and then follows the current policy to the terminal state. In the
classic book on RL by Sutton & Barto (2018), it is stated that establishing
convergence for the MCES algorithm is one of the most important remaining open
theoretical problems in RL. However, the convergence question for MCES turns
out to be quite nuanced. Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis (1996) provide a
counter-example showing that the MCES algorithm does not necessarily converge.
Tsitsiklis (2002) further shows that if the original MCES algorithm is modified
so that the Q-function estimates are updated at the same rate for all
state-action pairs, and the discount factor is strictly less than one, then the
MCES algorithm converges. In this paper we make headway with the original and
more efficient MCES algorithm given in Sutton & Barto (1998), establishing
almost sure convergence for Optimal Policy Feed-Forward MDPs, which are MDPs
whose states are not revisited within any episode when using an optimal policy.
Such MDPs include a large class of environments such as all deterministic
environments and all episodic environments with a timestep or any monotonically
changing values as part of the state. Different from the previous proofs using
stochastic approximations, we introduce a novel inductive approach, which is

  Fair Score Normalization","Accepted in Pattern Recognition Letters",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Current face recognition systems achieve high progress on several benchmark
tests. Despite this progress, recent works showed that these systems are
strongly biased against demographic sub-groups. Consequently, an easily
integrable solution is needed to reduce the discriminatory effect of these
biased systems. Previous work mainly focused on learning less biased face
representations, which comes at the cost of a strongly degraded overall
recognition performance. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fair
score normalization approach that is specifically designed to reduce the effect
of bias in face recognition and subsequently lead to a significant overall
performance boost. Our hypothesis is built on the notation of individual
fairness by designing a normalization approach that leads to treating similar
individuals similarly. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available
datasets captured under controlled and in-the-wild circumstances. Results
demonstrate that our solution reduces demographic biases, e.g. by up to 82.7%
in the case when gender is considered. Moreover, it mitigates the bias more
consistently than existing works. In contrast to previous works, our fair
normalization approach enhances the overall performance by up to 53.2% at false
match rate of 0.001 and up to 82.9% at a false match rate of 0.00001.
Additionally, it is easily integrable into existing recognition systems and not

1) the time series is often of variable-length and incomplete due to different

inter-individual variability to external factors like stress and environment.
This paper addresses these challenges and brings us closer to the potential of

HeartSpace implements a Siamese-triplet network to optimize representations by
jointly capturing intra- and inter-series correlations during the embedding

time-variation in the parameters in the form of their state- or regime-specific
values. Importantly, this time-variation is governed by a discrete-valued
latent stochastic process with limited memory. More specifically, the current
value of the state indicator is determined only by the value of the state
indicator from the previous period, thus the Markov property, and the
transition matrix. The latter characterizes the properties of the Markov
process by determining with what probability each of the states can be visited
next period, given the state in the current period. This setup decides on the
two main advantages of the Markov switching models. Namely, the estimation of
the probability of state occurrences in each of the sample periods by using
filtering and smoothing methods and the estimation of the state-specific
parameters. These two features open the possibility for improved
interpretations of the parameters associated with specific regimes combined
with the corresponding regime probabilities, as well as for improved

model. We describe the Pantheon sample observations of Type Ia supernovae, 31

  For the $w$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models in the flat case and with spatial

machine learning assisted object reconstruction algorithms in particle physics
almost exclusively predict properties on an object-by-object basis. Traditional
approaches from computer vision either impose implicit constraints on the
object size or density and are not well suited for sparse detector data or rely
on objects being dense and solid. The object condensation method proposed here
is independent of assumptions on object size, sorting or object density, and
further generalises to non-image-like data structures, such as graphs and point
clouds, which are more suitable to represent detector signals. The pixels or
vertices themselves serve as representations of the entire object, and a
combination of learnable local clustering in a latent space and confidence
assignment allows one to collect condensates of the predicted object properties
with a simple algorithm. As proof of concept, the object condensation method is
applied to a simple object classification problem in images and used to
reconstruct multiple particles from detector signals. The latter results are
also compared to a classic particle flow approach.

invariant due to the coupling between the vector Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes with
two types of scalar KK modes. It is interesting to generalize this result to a
brane world model with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions. In this work,
we first investigate the case with three extra dimensions. After KK
decomposition, there are three types of scalar KK modes. In addition to the
mutual coupling between these scalar modes, there are also coupling between the
scalar and the vector KK modes. The coupling constants are not all independent.
The relationships between the coupling constants enable us to obtain a gauge
invariant effective action, from which we can see that the masses of the vector
KK modes depend on all the three extra dimensions. The masses of the scalar
modes, however, depend only on two of the three extra dimensions. Then we
generalize the results into branes with codimension $d$ ($d=1, 2...$), and find
that $d$ will directly affect the masses of the KK modes. But there is always a
gauge invariant effective action for the massive vector KK modes.

magnitude range from 5.1 mag to 19.3 mag at distances between 80 and 380 pc
from the Sun. The stream has a nearly cylindrical shape with length and
thickness of about 700 pc and 100 pc, respectively. The total stellar mass
contained in the stream is about 770 M_Sun, and the members are gravitationally
unbound. For the stream we found an age of about 135 Myr. In many astrophysical
properties Psc-Eri is comparable to the open cluster M45 (the Pleiades): in its
age, its luminosity function (LF), its Present-day mass Function (PDMF) as well
as in its total mass. Nonetheless, the two stellar ensembles are completely
unlike in their physical appearance. We cautiously give two possible
explanations for this disagreement: (i) the star-formation efficiency in their
parental molecular clouds was higher for the Pleiades than for Psc-Eri or/and
(ii) the Pleiades had a higher primordial mass segregation immediately after
the expulsion of the molecular gas of the parental cloud.

not use SPARQL, despite the obvious advantages of using a database system. This
is due to the mismatch between SPARQL and machine learning tools in terms of
data model and programming style. Machine learning tools work on data in
tabular format and process it using an imperative programming style, while
SPARQL is declarative and has as its basic operation matching graph patterns to
RDF triples. We posit that a good interface to knowledge graphs from a machine
learning software stack should use an imperative, navigational programming
paradigm based on graph traversal rather than the SPARQL query paradigm based
on graph patterns. In this paper, we present RDFFrames, a framework that
provides such an interface. RDFFrames provides an imperative Python API that
gets internally translated to SPARQL, and it is integrated with the PyData
machine learning software stack. RDFFrames enables the user to make a sequence
of Python calls to define the data to be extracted from a knowledge graph
stored in an RDF database system, and it translates these calls into a compact
SPQARL query, executes it on the database system, and returns the results in a
standard tabular format. Thus, RDFFrames is a useful tool for data preparation
that combines the usability of PyData with the flexibility and performance of
RDF database systems.

and direction) and folding angle in 2D materials is important to optimize the
device performance. Conventionally, the accurate measurement of both strain
amplitude and direction requires the combined usage of multiple tools, such as
atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, etc.
Here, we demonstrated the usage of a single tool, polarization-dependent second
harmonic generation (SHG) imaging, to determine the folding angle and strain
vector accurately in atomically thin tungsten disulfide (WS2). We find that
trilayer WS2 folds with folding angle of 600 show 9 times SHG enhancement due
to vector superposition of SH wave vectors coming from the individual folding
layers. Strain dependent SHG quenching and enhancement is found parallel and
perpendicular respectively to the direction of the compressive strain vector.
However, despite a variation in strain angle, the total SHG remains constant
which allows us to determine the local strain vector accurately using
photoelastic approach. We also demonstrate that band-nesting induced transition
(C peak) can highly enhance SHG, which can be significantly modulated by
strain. Our results would pave the way to enable novel applications of the TMDs

to study smooth homotopical problems of infinite-dimensional
$C^\infty$-manifolds in convenient calculus. More precisely, we discuss the
smoothing of maps, sections, principal bundles, and gauge transformations.
  We first introduce the notion of hereditary $C^\infty$-paracompactness along
with the semiclassicality condition on a $C^\infty$-manifold, which enables us
to use local convexity in local arguments. Then, we prove that for
$C^\infty$-manifolds $M$ and $N$, the smooth singular complex of
$C^\infty(M,N)$ is weakly equivalent to the ordinary singular complex of
$\mathcal{C}^0(M,N)$ under the hereditary $C^\infty$-paracompactness and
semiclassicality conditions on $M$. We next generalize this result to sections
of fiber bundles over a $C^\infty$-manifold $M$ under the same conditions on
$M$. Further, we establish the Dwyer-Kan equivalence between the simplicial
groupoid of smooth principal $G$-bundles over $M$ and that of continuous
principal $G$-bundles over $M$ for a Lie group $G$ and a $C^\infty$-manifold
$M$ under the same conditions on $M$, encoding the smoothing results for
principal bundles and gauge transformations.
  For the proofs, we fully faithfully embed the category $C^\infty$ of
$C^\infty$-manifolds into the category $\mathcal{D}$ of diffeological spaces
and develop the smooth homotopy theory of diffeological spaces via a
homotopical algebraic study of the model category $\mathcal{D}$ and the model
category $\mathcal{C}^0$ of arc-generated spaces. Then, the hereditary
$C^\infty$-paracompactness and semiclassicality conditions on $M$ imply that
$M$ has the smooth homotopy type of a cofibrant object in $\mathcal{D}$. This
result can be regarded as a smooth refinement of the results of Milnor, Palais,
and Heisey on the homotopy type of infinite-dimensional topological manifolds.

not known. This requires finding the correct behavior among a vast number of
possible behaviors without having the knowledge of the reinforcement signals.
In these cases, an exhaustive search may be needed. However, this might not be
feasible especially when optimizing artificial neural networks in continuous

(NPSP), where we evolve synaptic plasticity rules to produce as many novel

evaluate the NPSP on maze-navigation on deceptive maze environments that

accurate theoretical predictions. In this work, we focus on higher order
statistics of the weak lensing convergence field, namely its cumulants such as
skewness and kurtosis and its one-point probability distribution (PDF), and we
quantify using perturbation theory the corrections coming from post-Born
effects, meaning beyond the straight-line and independent lenses
approximations. At first order, two such corrections arise: lens-lens couplings
and geodesic deviation. Though the corrections are small for low source
redshifts (below a few percents) and therefore for galaxy lensing, they become
important at higher redshifts, notably in the context of CMB lensing, where the
non-gaussianities computed from tree-order perturbation theory are found to be
of the same order as the signal itself. We include these post-Born corrections
on the skewness into a prediction for the one-point convergence PDF obtained
with large deviation theory and successfully test these results against

static spherically symmetric charged black hole with a scalar hair. We provide
semi-analytic bounds on the greybody factors and study the sparsity of Hawking
radiation of mass-less uncharged scalar fields. Our results show that the
scalar and electric charges contribute oppositely to the greybody factor and
the sparsity of the Hawking radiation cascade. Also, the greybody factor
decreases and the Hawking emission spectra become more sparse with the
reduction in the black hole (ADM) mass.

properties of materials. Two dimensional (2D) materials such as 2D transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are particularly well suited for this purpose
because they have high flexibility and they can withstand high deformations
before rupture. Local strain engineering in 2D TMDs is achieved via strained
wrinkles. Wrinkles on thick layers of TMDs are reported to show interesting
photoluminescence enhancement due to bandgap modulation and funneling effect.
However, the wrinkles in ultrathin TMDs have not been investigated because they
can easily fall down to form folds in these ultrathin layers of TMDCs. Here, we
have achieved both wrinkles and folds simultaneously in 1-3L WS2 using a new
fabrication technique. A layer dependent reduction in surface potential is
found for both folded layers and perfect pack layers due to the dominant
interlayer screening effect. Strain dependent modulation in semi conductive
junction properties is observed for strain induced wrinkles through current
scanning. Thermo-ionic modelling suggests that the strained (1.6%) wrinkles can
lower the Schottky barrier height (SBH) by 20%. Upon illumination, SBH reduces
significantly due to photo-generated carriers. Our results present an important
advance towards controlling the optoelectronic properties of atomically thin
WS2 via strain engineering, with applications in optoelectronics, quantum
optics and nanophotonics device fabrication.

without the typical assumption of constant or slowly-varying speed. Instead, we
impose the rotor speed to have a constant (unknown) sign and a non-zero
magnitude at all times. For the design of the proposed scheme, meaningful Lie
group formalism is adopted to describe the rotor position as an element of the
unit circle. This choice, however, leads to a non-contractible state space, and
therefore it introduces topological constraints that complicate the achievement
of global/semi-global and robust results. In this respect it is shown that the
proposed observer, which employs a clock to periodically reset the estimates,
is semi-globally practically asymptotically stable, and thus it improves a
continuous-time version designed under the same assumptions. As highlighted in
the simulation results, the novel hybrid strategy leads to enhanced transient
performance, notably without any modification of the gains employed in the
continuous-time solution. These features motivate to augment the observer with
a discrete-time identifier, leading to significantly faster rotor flux

one for each tenant, coexist on the same service network. The tenants
themselves need to be able to dynamically create and customize their own VSNs
to support their initial and changing functional and performance requirements.
These tasks are problematic for them due to: 1) platform-specific knowledge
required, 2) the existence of a large number of customization options and their
dependencies, and 3) the complexity in deriving the right subset of options. In
this paper, we present an approach to enable and simplify the tenant-driven
customization of multi-tenant service networks. We propose to use feature as a
high-level customization abstraction. A regulated collaboration among a set of
services in the service network realizes a feature. A software engineer can
design a customization policy for a service network using the mappings between
features and collaborations, and enact the policy with the controller of the
service network. A tenant can then specify the requirements for its VSN as a
set of functional and performance features. A customization request from a
tenant triggers the customization policy of the service network, which
(re)configures the corresponding VSN at runtime to realize the selected
features. We show the feasibility of our approach with two case studies and a
performance evaluation.

with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we
adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation

In real scenarios, most domain adaptation algorithms face the challenges from

conventional methods suffer from overfitting and fail to successfully transfer
the knowledge of the source to the target domain. To address these issues, the
following two techniques are proposed. First, we introduce the optimized
decision tree construction method with convolutional neural networks, in which
the data at each node are split into equal sizes while maximizing the
information gain. It generates balanced decision trees on deep features because
of the even-split constraint, which contributes to enhanced discrimination
power and reduced overfitting problem. Second, to tackle the domain
misalignment problem, we propose the domain alignment loss which penalizes
uneven splits of the source and target domain data. By collaboratively
optimizing the information gain of the labeled source data as well as the
entropy of unlabeled target data distributions, the proposed CoBRF algorithm
achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

toward the central high-density regions of such galaxies. We show that, under
reasonable assumptions and initial conditions, the process can build up central
BH masses of order $10^4-10^6\, M_\odot$ within some $10^7$ yr, so effectively
providing heavy seeds before standard disk (Eddington-like) accretion takes
over to become the dominant process for further BH growth. Remarkably, such a
mechanism may provide an explanation, alternative to super-Eddington accretion
rates, for the buildup of billion solar masses BHs in quasar hosts at $z\gtrsim
7$, when the age of the Universe $\lesssim 0.8$ Gyr constitutes a demanding
constraint; moreover, in more common ETG progenitors at redshift $z\sim 2-6$ it
can concur with disk accretion to build such large BH masses even at moderate
Eddington ratios $\lesssim 0.3$ within the short star-formation duration
$\lesssim$ Gyr of these systems. Finally, we investigate the perspectives to
detect the merger events between the migrating stellar remnants and the
accumulating central supermassive BH via gravitational wave emission with
future ground and space-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and

precise locations of abrupt changes in large data sequences. There are many
application domains for such models, such as medicine, neuroscience or
genomics. Often, practitioners have prior knowledge about the changes they are
looking for. For example in genomic data, biologists sometimes expect peaks: up
changes followed by down changes. Taking advantage of such prior information
can substantially improve the accuracy with which we can detect and estimate
changes. Hocking et al. [2020] described a graph framework to encode many

about the types of change that are possible and implements several loss

alternative approach to information-theoretic skill discovery. Crucially, EDL
optimizes the same information-theoretic objective derived from the empowerment
literature, but addresses the optimization problem using different machinery.
We perform an extensive evaluation of skill discovery methods on controlled

overcoming the coverage problem, reducing the dependence of learned skills on

specifier, referred to as the Clue, which consists of the previous frame's
coarse mask and coordinates information. We also propose a novel refine module
which shows the better performance compared with the general ones by using a

cooling of the hot inner accretion flow that surrounds the bursting neutron
star. Given that GS 1826-24 remained persistently in the hard state over the
period 2003-2008 and presented regular bursting properties, we stacked the
spectra of the X-ray bursts detected by INTEGRAL (JEM-X and ISGRI) and
XMM-Newton (RGS) during that period to study the effect of the burst photons on
the properties of the Comptonizing medium. The extended energy range provided
by these instruments allows the simultaneous observation of the burst and
persistent emission spectra. We detect an overall change in the shape of the
persistent emission spectrum in response to the burst photon shower. For the
first time, we observe simultaneously a drop in the hard X-ray emission,
together with a soft X-ray excess with respect to the burst blackbody emission.
The hard X-ray drop can be explained by burst-induced coronal cooling, while
the bulk of the soft X-ray excess can be described by fitting the burst
emission with an atmosphere model, instead of a simple blackbody model.
Traditionally, the persistent emission was assumed to be invariant during X-ray
bursts, and more recently to change only in normalization but not in spectral
shape; the observed change in the persistent emission level during X-ray bursts
may thus trigger the revision of existing neutron star mass-radius constraints,
as the derived values rely on the assumption that the persistent emission does
not change during X-ray bursts. The traditional burst fitting technique leads
to up to a 10% overestimation of the bolometric burst flux in GS 1826-24, which
significantly hampers the comparisons of the KEPLER and MESA model against this
'textbook burster'.

main frequentist property is easy to understand and to prove. We show that
Robbins' confidence sequences may be justified under various views of

obey the strong likelihood principle. They are easy to compute, even when
inference is on a parameter of interest, especially using a closed-form

uncertainty of the employed dense stereo matching procedure. Additionally
modelling the latter, however, is particularly beneficial if the domain of the
training data varies from that of the data to be processed. For this purpose,
in the present work the idea of probabilistic deep learning is applied to the
task of dense stereo matching for the first time. Based on the well-known and
commonly employed GC-Net architecture, a novel probabilistic neural network is
presented, for the task of joint depth and uncertainty estimation from epipolar
rectified stereo image pairs. Instead of learning the network parameters
directly, the proposed probabilistic neural network learns a probability
distribution from which parameters are sampled for every prediction. The
variations between multiple such predictions on the same image pair allow to
approximate the model uncertainty. The quality of the estimated depth and
uncertainty information is assessed in an extensive evaluation on three
different datasets.

attribute autoencoder to learn both node embedding and attribute embedding
jointly in latent space. Moreover, attention mechanism is employed in structure
encoder to learn the importance between a node and its neighbors for an
effective capturing of structure pattern, which is important to anomaly
detection. Besides, by taking both the node embedding and attribute embedding
as inputs of attribute decoder, the cross-modality interactions between network
structure and node attribute are learned during the reconstruction of node
attribute. Finally, anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction
errors of nodes from both the structure and attribute perspectives. Extensive

robotics applications because they involve various interactions with the

efficiently estimate the order and positions of the objects to be tidied up by
learning the parameters of a probabilistic generative model. The model allows a
robot to learn the distributions of the co-occurrence probability of the
objects and places to tidy up using the multimodal sensor information collected
in a tidied environment. Additionally, we develop an autonomous robotic system
to perform the tidy-up operation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
method by an experimental simulation that reproduces the conditions of the Tidy
Up Here task of the World Robot Summit 2018 international robotics competition.
The simulation results show that the proposed method enables the robot to
successively tidy up several objects and achieves the best task score among the

binary classifier without any negative data. It has two building blocks: PU
class-prior estimation (CPE) and PU classification; the latter has been well
studied while the former has received less attention. Hitherto, the
distributional-assumption-free CPE methods rely on a critical assumption that
the support of the positive data distribution cannot be contained in the
support of the negative data distribution. If this is violated, those CPE

we cannot verify the assumption based on the data. In this paper, we rethink
CPE for PU learning-can we remove the assumption to make CPE always valid? We
show an affirmative answer by proposing Regrouping CPE (ReCPE) that builds an
auxiliary probability distribution such that the support of the positive data
distribution is never contained in the support of the negative data
distribution. ReCPE can work with any CPE method by treating it as the base

positive bias of its base. Empirically, ReCPE improves all state-of-the-art CPE

defining the notion of stationarity for a point process existing on such a

construct functional summary statistics for Poisson processes defined on convex

used to investigate treatment effects, but are often subject to time-dependent
confounding. Marginal structural models (MSMs), estimated using inverse
probability of treatment weighting or the g-formula, are popular for handling
this problem. With increasing development of advanced causal inference methods,
it is important to be able to assess their performance in different scenarios
to guide their application. Simulation studies are a key tool for this, but
their use to evaluate causal inference methods has been limited. This paper
focuses on the use of simulations for evaluations involving MSMs in studies
with a time-to-event outcome. In a simulation, it is important to be able to
generate the data in such a way that the correct form of any models to be
fitted to those data is known. However, this is not straightforward in the
longitudinal setting because it is natural for data to be generated in a
sequential conditional manner, whereas MSMs involve fitting marginal rather
than conditional hazard models. We provide general results that enable the form
of the correctly-specified MSM to be derived based on a conditional data
generating procedure, and show how the results can be applied when the
conditional hazard model is an Aalen additive hazard or Cox model. Using
conditional additive hazard models is advantageous because they imply additive
MSMs that can be fitted using standard software. We describe and illustrate a
simulation algorithm. Our results will help researchers to effectively evaluate
causal inference methods via simulation.

The
proteins needed to form and maintain flagella are synthesized in the cell body
and transported to the distal tips. What `rulers' or `timers' a specific type
of cells use to strike a balance between the outward and inward transport of
materials so as to maintain a particular length of its flagella in the steady
state is one of the open questions in cellular self-organization. Even more
curious is how the two flagella of biflagellates, like Chlamydomonas
Reinhardtii, communicate through their base to coordinate their lengths. In
this paper we develop a stochastic model for flagellar length control based on
a time-of-flight (ToF) mechanism. This ToF mechanism decides whether or not
structural proteins are to be loaded onto an intraflagellar transport (IFT)
train just before it begins its motorized journey from the base to the tip of
the flagellum. Because of the ongoing turnover, the structural proteins
released from the flagellar tip are transported back to the cell body also by
IFT trains. We represent the traffic of IFT trains as a totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process (TASEP). The ToF mechanism for each flagellum,
together with the TASEP-based description of the IFT trains, combined with a
scenario of sharing of a common pool of flagellar structural proteins in
biflagellates, can account for all key features of experimentally known
phenomena. These include ciliogenesis, resorption, deflagellation as well as
regeneration after selective amputation of one of the two flagella. We also
show that the experimental observations of Ishikawa and Marshall are consistent
with the ToF mechanism of length control if the effects of the mutual exclusion
of the IFT trains captured by the TASEP are taken into account. Moreover, we
make new predictions on the flagellar length fluctuations and the role of the
common pool.

perform face detection/alignment and FAC independently. The inherent
dependencies between these tasks are not fully exploited. In addition, most
methods predict all facial attributes using the same CNN network architecture,
which ignores the different learning complexities of facial attributes. To
address the above problems, we propose a novel deep multi-task multi-label CNN,
termed DMM-CNN, for effective FAC. Specifically, DMM-CNN jointly optimizes two
closely-related tasks (i.e., facial landmark detection and FAC) to improve the
performance of FAC by taking advantage of multi-task learning. To deal with the
diverse learning complexities of facial attributes, we divide the attributes
into two groups: objective attributes and subjective attributes. Two different
network architectures are respectively designed to extract features for two
groups of attributes, and a novel dynamic weighting scheme is proposed to
automatically assign the loss weight to each facial attribute during training.
Furthermore, an adaptive thresholding strategy is developed to effectively
alleviate the problem of class imbalance for multi-label learning. Experimental
results on the challenging CelebA and LFWA datasets show the superiority of the
proposed DMM-CNN method compared with several state-of-the-art FAC methods.

the NS-WD post-merger, after cooling and angular momentum redistribution, may
collapse to either a black hole or a new NS or even remains as a hybrid WDNS,
depending on the total mass of the NS and WD. In particular, the newly formed
NS can be a magnetar if the core of the WD collapsed into the NS while large
quantities of degenerate electrons of the WD compressed to the outer layers of

of the newborn magnetar. Such a magnetar can power the repeating FRBs by the
magnetic reconnections due to the crustal movements or starquakes.

inefficient or infeasible to process very big data using such a method in a
single machine. Moreover, big data are often distributedly collected and stored
on different machines. Thus, such data generally bear strong heterogeneous
noise. It is essential and useful to develop distributed matrix decomposition
for big data analytics. Such a method should scale up well, model the
heterogeneous noise, and address the communication issue in a distributed
system. To this end, we propose a distributed Bayesian matrix decomposition
model (DBMD) for big data mining and clustering. Specifically, we adopt three
strategies to implement the distributed computing including 1) the accelerated
gradient descent, 2) the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
and 3) the statistical inference. We investigate the theoretical convergence
behaviors of these algorithms. To address the heterogeneity of the noise, we
propose an optimal plug-in weighted average that reduces the variance of the
estimation. Synthetic experiments validate our theoretical results, and
real-world experiments show that our algorithms scale up well to big data and
achieves superior or competing performance compared to other distributed
methods.

state. This evolution is studied numerically in a two-dimensional configuration
using a phase-field method coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations. Varying
the control parameters of the model, we exhibit two types of equilibria:
diffusive and convective. In the latter case, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in
the liquid phase shapes the solid-liquid front, and a macroscopic topography is
observed. A simple way of predicting these equilibrium positions is discussed

and the statistical distributions of training and test data differ
significantly in the existing datasets. To solve these problems, dimensional
reduction and sample augmentation must be considered. In this paper, a novel PD
classification algorithm based on sparse kernel transfer learning combined with
a parallel optimization of samples and features is proposed. Sparse transfer
learning is used to extract effective structural information of PD speech
features from public datasets as source domain data, and the fast ADDM
iteration is improved to enhance the information extraction performance. To
implement the parallel optimization, the potential relationships between
samples and features are considered to obtain high-quality combined features.
First, features are extracted from a specific public speech dataset to
construct a feature dataset as the source domain. Then, the PD target domain,
including the training and test datasets, is encoded by convolution sparse
coding, which can extract more in-depth information. Next, parallel
optimization is implemented. To further improve the classification performance,
a convolution kernel optimization mechanism is designed. Using two
representative public datasets and one self-constructed dataset, the
experiments compare over thirty relevant algorithms. The results show that when
taking the Sakar dataset, MaxLittle dataset and DNSH dataset as target domains,
the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvements in classification
accuracy. The study also found large improvements in the algorithms in this
paper compared with nontransfer learning approaches, demonstrating that
transfer learning is both more effective and has a more acceptable time cost.

with these criteria, like the Watts-Strogatz algorithm in the case of
small-world networks. However, this practice comes to study the model's
dynamics over the specific networks generated by one algorithm instead of the
dynamics over the class of networks of interest, possibly inducing a strong
bias in results. We identify three problematics related to this bias: (i)
representativity of a network generator to a class of networks, (ii)
conclusiveness of simulations over a class of networks and (iii) the gain in
conclusiveness when refining the criteria for network choice. We propose an
experimental protocol and instantiate it on small-world networks for epidemics,

are two usual ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an
analytic formula obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or
automatic differentiation through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the
asymptotic error made by these estimators as a function of the optimization
error. We find that the error of the automatic estimator is close to the square
of the error of the analytic estimator, reflecting a super-efficiency
phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator greatly depends on the
convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze it for gradient

estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments on
toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the
computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to

three main phases available for quantum computations: at zero $K$ we have the
case of Cirac-Zoller quantum computer, below a certain critical amplitude
$K<K_c$ the ions are in the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) phase, with
delocalized phonon modes and free chain sliding, and above the critical
amplitude $K>K_c$ ions are in the pinned Aubry phase with a finite frequency
gap protecting quantum gates from temperature and other external fluctuations.
For the Aubry phase, in contrast to the Cirac-Zoller and KAM phases, the phonon
gap remains independent of the number of ions placed in the trap keeping a
fixed ion density around the trap center. We show that in the Aubry phase the
phonon modes are much better localized comparing to the Cirac-Zoller and KAM
cases. Thus in the Aubry phase the recoil pulses lead to local oscillations of
ions while in other two phases they spread rapidly over the whole ion chains
making them rather sensible to external fluctuations. We argue that the
properties of localized phonon modes and phonon gap in the Aubry phase provide
advantages for the ion quantum computations in this phase with a large number

defects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction,
making this segmentation challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose in this
paper a new approach for projecting anomalous data on a autoencoder-learned

autoencoder's loss function. This energy can be augmented with regularization
terms that model priors on what constitutes the user-defined optimal

loss of high-frequency information caused by the autoencoder bottleneck. This
allows to produce images of higher quality than classic reconstructions. Our

propose the concept of RIS-aided cell-free network to improve the capacity with

Note that most of the scenarios considered in existing works are special cases
of the general scenario studied in this paper, and the proposed joint precoding
framework can serve as a general solution to maximize the capacity in most

directions. Moving in these directions corresponds to human-interpretable image
transformations, such as zooming or recoloring, enabling a more controllable

performed in a supervised manner, requiring human labels, pretrained models, or
some form of self-supervision. These requirements severely restrict a range of
directions existing approaches can discover. In this paper, we introduce an
unsupervised method to identify interpretable directions in the latent space of
a pretrained GAN model. By a simple model-agnostic procedure, we find
directions corresponding to sensible semantic manipulations without any form of
(self-)supervision. Furthermore, we reveal several non-trivial findings, which
would be difficult to obtain by existing methods, e.g., a direction
corresponding to background removal. As an immediate practical benefit of our
work, we show how to exploit this finding to achieve competitive performance
for weakly-supervised saliency detection.

mainly due to their rarity. Perrin pseudoprimes are one of the rarest known

a fast algorithm but also an idea how most of them are structured to minimize
the amount of numbers one have to test. We present a quick algorithm for
testing Perrin pseudoprimes and develop some ideas on how Perrin pseudoprimes
might be structured. This leads to some conjectures that still need to be
proved. We think that we have found well over 90% of all 20-digit Perrin
pseudoprimes. Overall, we have been able to calculate over 9 million Perrin
pseudoprimes with our method, including some very large ones. The largest

previously known just over 100,000 Perrin pseudoprimes, of which the largest
have 20 digits. In addition, we propose two new sequences that do not provide
any pseudoprimes up to $10^9$ at all.

other on a set of $n$ locations. In each round, every player visits one of the
locations and the game finishes when the players meet at the same location. The
goal is to devise strategies for both players that minimize the expected
waiting time till the rendezvous.
  In the asymmetric case, when the strategies of the players may differ, it is
known that the optimum expected waiting time of $\frac{n+1}{2}$ is achieved by
the wait-for-mommy pair of strategies, where one of the players stays at one
location for $n$ rounds, while the other player searches through all the $n$
locations in a random order. However, if we insist that the players are
symmetric --- they are expected to follow the same strategy --- then the best
known strategy, proposed by Anderson and Weber, achieves an asymptotic expected
waiting time of $0.829 n$.
  We show that the symmetry requirement indeed implies that the expected
waiting time needs to be asymptotically larger than in the asymmetric case.
Precisely, we prove that for every $n\geqslant 2$, if the players need to
employ the same strategy, then the expected waiting time is at least
$\frac{n+1}{2}+\varepsilon n$, where $\varepsilon=2^{-36}$.

techniques can be designed to achieve simultaneously high strength and high

hardening capacity which results in a favorable strength-ductility combination.
Unfortunately, no constitutive model has been established to simulate and
analyze the characteristic kinematic hardening behavior of GS metal to
understand the relationship between their microstructure and macroscopic
response. In this work, we developed a deformation-mechanismbased strain
gradient plasticity model considering the plasticity heterogeneities from the
grain to the sample scale. A back stress model, which accounts for the
dependency of dislocation pile-ups on grain size, is established to describe
the cyclic deformation properties of GS materials. The established model
unified the geometrically necessary dislocations accommodating internal
plasticity heterogeneities, the resulting back stress and reversible
dislocations during reverse loading into a strain gradient plasticity
framework, without introducing excessive numbers of independent material
parameters. A finite element implementation of the model quantitatively
predicts the uniaxial tensile and tensile-compressive responses of a GS copper
bar as well as of a reference sample with homogeneous grain size. It is found
that GS copper exhibits enhanced kinematic hardening which results mainly from
fine grains in the GS layer and contributes to the considerable ductility of
the GS material. The model allows to investigate the mechanical response and
optimize the properties of materials with various types of spatially
heterogeneous grain microstructures.

approaches, service robots are frequently failed to recognize many objects in
real human-centric environments. For these robots, object recognition is a
challenging task due to the high demand for accurate and real-time response
under changing and unpredictable environmental conditions. Most of the recent
approaches use either the shape information only and ignore the role of color
information or vice versa. Furthermore, they mainly utilize the $L_n$ Minkowski
family functions to measure the similarity of two object views, while there are
various distance measures that are applicable to compare two object views. In
this paper, we explore the importance of shape information, color constancy,
color spaces, and various similarity measures in open-ended 3D object
recognition. Towards this goal, we extensively evaluate the performance of
object recognition approaches in three different configurations, including
\textit{color-only}, \textit{shape-only}, and \textit{ combinations of color
and shape}, in both offline and online settings. Experimental results
concerning scalability, memory usage, and object recognition performance show
that all of the \textit{combinations of color and shape} yields significant
improvements over the \textit{shape-only} and \textit{color-only} approaches.
The underlying reason is that color information is an important feature to
distinguish objects that have very similar geometric properties with different
colors and vice versa. Moreover, by combining color and shape information, we
demonstrate that the robot can learn new object categories from very few
training examples in a real-world setting.

other scenarios only when deployed with data located at one edge only, i.e.,
without edge computing wide data synchronization. In case of applications
requiring data synchronization through the cloud, edge-cloud scales around a
factor 10 times better than cloud-only, until certain number of concurrent

CO(1$\rightarrow$0) or CO(2$\rightarrow$1) with the Plateau de Bure
interferometer and its successor NOEMA, as part of five observational programs
carried out between 2012 and 2017. We have compared the molecular gas to
stellar mass ratio $M(H_2)/M_\star$, star formation rate (SFR), and depletion
time ($\tau_{\rm dep}$) of the LIRGs with those of a compilation of cluster and
field star forming galaxies. The targeted LIRGs have SFR, $M(H_2)/M_\star$, and
$\tau_{\rm dep}$ that are consistent with those of both main sequence (MS)
field galaxies and star forming galaxies from the comparison sample. However we
find that the depletion time, normalized to the MS value, increases with
increasing $r/r_{200}$, with a significance of $2.8\sigma$, which is ultimately
due to a deficit of cluster core LIRGs with $\tau_{\rm dep}\gtrsim\tau_{\rm
dep,MS}$. We suggest that a rapid exhaustion of the molecular gas reservoirs
occurs in the cluster LIRGs and is effective in suppressing their star
formation. This mechanism may explain the exponential decrease of the fraction
of cluster LIRGs with cosmic time. The compression of the gas in LIRGs,
possibly induced by intra-cluster medium shocks, may be responsible for the
short depletion timescales, observed in a large fraction of cluster core LIRGs.

transmission technology is required to enable the efficient use of the optical

challenges, the emergence of Elastic Optical Networks (EON) has brought new
conceptions in the operation of optical networks, improving flexibility and
efficiency for the next generation core networks. In EON, traffic demands are
typically supported by allocating bandwidth-variable optical channels with
heterogeneous modulation formats in a spectral-efficient manner. Elastic
optical path networks require the routing, modulation level, and spectrum
allocation (RMLSA) to efficiently allocate optical spectrum resources to
optical paths. To address the RMLSA problem, Modulation Scheme approaches have
recently been proposed to allow the use of any routing and spectrum assignment

Modulation Scheme that enables the routing of traffic through dynamic
multi-modulation allocation in multiple hops to achieve blocking performance
improvement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive
modulation scheme achieves a reduction in bandwidth blocking of up to two
orders of magnitude in an underloaded network scenario, and 86% with higher
loads, playing an important role in spectrum savings compared with the

reflected in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. ECG signal is a weak,
non-stationary, and nonlinear signal, which indicates the health of a heart in
terms of temporal variations of electromagnetic pulses from the heart. Abnormal
fluctuations in ECG signal invokes the possibility of various cardiovascular
disorders, which is diagnosed through intuitive analysis of the ECG reports by
the medical practitioners. This could be made fast, accurate, and simple by
imposing advanced nonlinear tools on the recorded ECG signals. In this paper, a
well-known nonlinear technique, i.e., Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method
is adopted to extract the hidden information in the recorded ECG signal. Here,
we try to explore the human heart as a dynamic model and perform EMD on ECG
reports distinguishing arrhythmia from normal data obtained from the widely
used MIT-BIH database. EMD essentially involves the decomposition of the signal
into a finite number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), keeping its original
properties unaltered. For analysis, we use the powerful Savitzky-Golay (SG)
filter for removing non-stationary noises from the ECG signals. The popular
nonlinear parameter Hurst Exponent (H) is estimated for every IMF by R/S
technique. We identified a distinct margin of the H of 1st IMFs in between the
normal and the arrhythmia affected patients. Our model confirms with 94.92%
certainty the chances of occurrence of arrhythmia disease in patients by
diagnosing ECG signals without performing other expensive and time-consuming
techniques such as Holter test, echocardiogram, and stress test.

liquid exists over a relatively large temperature window because of the
frustrated nature of the RKKY interaction produced by a 2D electron gas. In

stabilizing the classical spin liquid state down to T=0. By using series

resistivity upturn, which is accompanied by a negative magnetoresistivity due
to suppression of the electron-spin scattering.

plasma (CAP) is one major application in the field of plasma medicine because
it provides a simple and effective way to sterilize heat-sensitive materials.
Therefore, one has to know whether plasma treatment affects the treated
surfaces, and thus causes long-term surface modifications. In this
contribution, the effect of cold atmospheric Surface Micro-Discharge (SMD)
plasma on different materials and its sporicidal behavior was investigated.
Hence, different material samples (stainless steel, different polymers and
glass) were plasma-treated for 16 hours, simulating multiple plasma treatments
using an SMD plasma device. Afterwards, the material samples were analyzed
using surface analysis methods such as laser microscopy, contact angle
measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the
device was used to investigate the behavior of Bacillus atrophaeus endospores
inoculated on material samples at different treatment times. The interaction
results for plasma-treated endospores show, that a log reduction of the spore
count between 4.3 and 6.2 can be achieved within 15 min of plasma treatment.
Besides, the surface analysis revealed, that there were three different types
of reactions the probed materials showed to plasma treatment, ranging from no
changes to shifts of the materials' free surface energies and oxidation. As a
consequence, it should be taken into account that even though cold atmospheric
plasma treatment is a non-thermal method to inactivate microorganisms on
heatsensitive materials, it still affects surface properties of the treated
materials. Therefore, the focus of future work must be a further classification
of plasma-caused material modifications.

research enabling numerous applications especially in the Musical Information
Retrieval domain. This complex task, that is also related to other topics such

birth to numerous approaches, mostly based on advanced signal processing-based
algorithms. However, these techniques are often non-generic, allowing the
extraction of definite physical properties of the signal (pitch, octave), but
not allowing arbitrary vocabularies or more general annotations. On top of
that, these techniques are one-sided, meaning that they can extract symbolic
data from an audio signal, but cannot perform the reverse process and make
symbol-to-signal generation. In this paper, we propose an bijective approach
for signal/symbol translation by turning this problem into a density estimation
task over signal and symbolic domains, considered both as related random
variables. We estimate this joint distribution with two different variational
auto-encoders, one for each domain, whose inner representations are forced to
match with an additive constraint, allowing both models to learn and generate
separately while allowing signal-to-symbol and symbol-to-signal inference. In
this article, we test our models on pitch, octave and dynamics symbols, which
comprise a fundamental step towards music transcription and label-constrained

both calibrated temporal and spatial correlations between VLF signals and

VLF receiver system (Cohen et al., 2010) deployed at the Elginfield Observatory
near London, Ontario, Canada (43N, 81W) to monitor VLF radio signals and
correlate with all-sky video recordings of fireballs. This survey from May 2017
to March 2019 was cued using fireballs detected by the Southern Ontario Meteor
Network (Brown et al., 2010; Weryk et al., 2007). The GPS conditioned timing of
the AWESOME system was continuously synchronized with video recordings directly
in the video stream to ensure sub-frame VLF-optical time calibration. The
AWESOME system has two orthogonal VLF antennas which permits directional
calculation of incoming VLF signals, which were compared to the apparent
optically measured locations of simultaneously detected fireballs. VLF events
potentially linked to fireballs were checked against the National Lightning
Detection Network (NLDN) database to remove false positive association with
lightning. During the two year survey interval, over 80 bright meteors
(apparent magnitude brighter than -5, brightest recorded event -7.8) were
detected and compared to VLF signals detected by the AWESOME system. No
definitive evidence was found for VLF emission from meteors up to a limiting
magnitude of -7.8.

constructing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for network data. They allow
determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it
possible to take action immediately. However, considering the large number of
packets that has to be inspected, for example in cloud/fog and edge computing,
the question of computational efficiency arises. We show that by using a novel
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the
number of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping
classification accuracy high. To minimize the computational expenses of the
RL-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the
classifier and the RL logic. Thus, no additional resources are consumed by the
sampling in deployment. Comparing to various other sampling techniques,
SparseIDS consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to
sample only relevant packets. A major novelty of our RL-based approach is that
it can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other
approaches proposed in the domain of Natural Language Processing but can even
skip arbitrarily many packets in one step. This enables saving even more
computational resources for long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of
choosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for
different attack types and network flows. Finally we build an automatic
steering mechanism that can guide SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired
level of sparsity.

sensitive Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) cameras. The data

for unevenly spaced data. Here, we formulate the Discrete Chi-square Method
(DCM) that can determine the best model for many signals superimposed on
arbitrary polynomial trends. DCM minimizes the Chi-square for the data in the
multi-dimensional tested frequency space. The required number of tested
frequency combinations remains manageable, because the method test statistic is
symmetric in this tested frequency space. With our known tested constant
frequency grid values, the non-linear DCM model becomes linear, and all results
become unambiguous. We test DCM with simulated data containing different
mixtures of signals and trends. DCM gives unambiguous results, if the signal
frequencies are not too close to each other, and none of the signals is too
weak. It relies on brute computational force, because all possible free
parameter combinations for all reasonable linear models are tested. DCM works
like winning a lottery by buying all lottery tickets. Anyone can reproduce all
our results with the DCM computer code. All files, variables and other program
code related items are printed in magenta colour. Our Appendix gives detailed
instructions for using dcm.py. We also present one preliminary real use case,
where DCM is applied to the observed (O) minus the computed (C) eclipse epochs
of a binary star, XZ And. This DCM analysis reveals evidence for the possible
presence of a third and a fourth body in this system. One recent study of a
very large sample of binary stars indicated that the probability for detecting
a fourth body from the O-C data of eclipsing binaries is only about 0.00005.

priors, which do not capture weight correlations in the prior and do not
provide a parsimonious interface to express properties in function space. A
desirable class of priors would represent weights compactly, capture
correlations between weights, facilitate calibrated reasoning about
uncertainty, and allow inclusion of prior knowledge about the function space
such as periodicity or dependence on contexts such as inputs. To this end, this
paper introduces two innovations: (i) a Gaussian process-based hierarchical
model for network weights based on unit embeddings that can flexibly encode
correlated weight structures, and (ii) input-dependent versions of these weight
priors that can provide convenient ways to regularize the function space
through the use of kernels defined on contextual inputs. We show these models
provide desirable test-time uncertainty estimates on out-of-distribution data,
demonstrate cases of modeling inductive biases for neural networks with kernels

demonstrate competitive predictive performance on an active learning benchmark.

of graphs assumes that the relations within the network are binary (for
instance, between pairs of nodes); however, this is not always true for many
real-life scenarios, such as peer-to-peer communication schemes, paper
co-authorship, or social network interactions. For such scenarios, it is often
the case that the underlying network is better and more naturally modeled by
hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a single
(hyper)edge can connect any number of vertices. Hypergraphs allow modelers to
have a complete representation of multi-relational (many-to-many) networks;
hence, they are extremely suitable for analyzing and discovering more subtle
dependencies in such data structures.
  Working with hypergraphs requires new software libraries that make it
possible to perform operations on them, from basic algorithms (such as
searching or traversing the network) to computing significant hypergraph
measures, to including more challenging algorithms (such as community
detection). In this paper, we present a new software library,
SimpleHypergraphs.jl, written in the Julia language and designed for
high-performance computing on hypergraphs and propose two new algorithms for
analyzing their properties: s-betweenness and modified label propagation.
  We also present various approaches for hypergraph visualization integrated
into our tool. In order to demonstrate how to exploit the library in practice,
we discuss two case studies based on the 2019 Yelp Challenge dataset and the
collaboration network built upon the Game of Thrones TV series. The results are
promising and they confirm the ability of hypergraphs to provide more insight
than standard graph-based approaches.

according to some similarity criteria. This paper addresses a generalization
called quasi-clustering that allows overlapping of clusters, and which we link
to biclustering. Biclustering simultaneously groups the objects and features so
that a specific group of objects has a special group of features. In recent
years, biclustering has received a lot of attention in several practical
applications. In this paper we consider a bi-objective optimization of
biclustering problem with binary data. First we present an integer programing
formulations for the bi-objective optimization biclustering. Next we propose a
constructive heuristic based on the set intersection operation and its
efficient implementation for solving a series of mono-objective problems used
inside the Epsilon-constraint method (obtained by keeping only one objective
function and the other objective function is integrated into constraints).
Finally, our experimental results show that using CPLEX solver as an exact
algorithm for finding an optimal solution drastically increases the
computational cost for large instances, while our proposed heuristic provides
very good results and significantly reduces the computational expense.

Yunes and Pretorius (2009) investigate whether LIGO's template-based searches
encode fundamental assumptions, especially the assumption that the background
theory of general relativity is an accurate description of the phenomena
detected in the search. They construct the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE)
framework in response, which broadens those assumptions and allows for wider
testing under more flexible assumptions. Their methods are consistent with work
on confirmation and testing found in Carnap (1936), Hempel (1969), and Stein
(1992, 1994), with the following principles in common: that confirmation is
distinct from testing, and that, counterintuitively, revising a theory's formal
basis can make it more broadly empirically testable. These views encourage a
method according to which theories can be made abstract, to define families of
general structures for the purpose of testing. With the development of the ppE

in the system. However, it is necessary for the developers to strive for
minimum complexity, as increased complexity introduces security risks in the
software, which can cause severe monetary and reputational damage to a

beings with various examples found in previous years where security breaches
led to severe consequences. Hence it is vital to maintain low complexity and
simple design of structure. Various developers tend to introduce deliberate

internet-of-everything represent a major challenge for broadband wireless
networks. This requires a paradigm shift towards the development of innovative
technologies for next generation wireless systems. One of the key challenges is
the scarcity of spectrum, owing to the unprecedented broadband penetration rate
in recent years. A promising solution is the proposal of visible light
communications (VLC), which explores the unregulated visible light spectrum to
enable high-speed communications, in addition to efficient lighting. This
solution offers a wider bandwidth that can accommodate ubiquitous broadband
connectivity to indoor users and offload data traffic from cellular networks.
Although VLC is secure and able to overcome the shortcomings of RF systems, it
suffers from several limitations, e.g., limited modulation bandwidth. In this
respect, solutions have been proposed recently to overcome this limitation. In
particular, most common orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access
techniques initially proposed for RF systems, e.g., space-division multiple
access (SDMA) and NOMA, have been considered in the context of VLC. In spite of
their promising gains, the performance of these techniques is somewhat limited.
Consequently, in this article a new and generalized multiple access technique,
called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), is introduced and investigated
for the first time in VLC networks. We first provide an overview of the key
multiple access technologies used in VLC systems. Then, we propose the first
comprehensive approach to the integration of RSMA with VLC systems. In our
proposed framework, SINR expressions are derived and used to evaluate the
weighted sum rate (WSR) of a two-user scenario. Our results illustrate the
flexibility of RSMA in generalizing NOMA and SDMA, and its WSR superiority in
the VLC context.

Automatic detection of distress, such as depression, is an active area of
research. Current approaches utilise vocal, facial, and bodily modalities. Of
these, the bodily modality is the least investigated, partially due to the
difficulty in extracting bodily representations from videos, and partially due
to the lack of viable datasets. Existing body modality approaches use automatic
categorization of expressions to represent body language as a series of
specific expressions, much like words within natural language. In this
dissertation I present a new type of feature, within the body modality, that
represents meta information of gestures, such as speed, and use it to predict a
non-clinical depression label. This differs to existing work by representing
overall behaviour as a small set of aggregated meta features derived from a
person's movement. In my method I extract pose estimation from videos, detect
gestures within body parts, extract meta information from individual gestures,
and finally aggregate these features to generate a small feature vector for use
in prediction tasks. I introduce a new dataset of 65 video recordings of
interviews with self-evaluated distress, personality, and demographic labels.
This dataset enables the development of features utilising the whole body in
distress detection tasks. I evaluate my newly introduced meta-features for
predicting depression, anxiety, perceived stress, somatic stress, five standard
personality measures, and gender. A linear regression based classifier using
