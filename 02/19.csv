algorithms deployed in consequential domains (e.g. in criminal justice) treat
different demographic groups ""fairly."" However, there are several proposed
notions of fairness, typically mutually incompatible. Using criminal justice as
an example, we study a model in which society chooses an incarceration rule.
Agents of different demographic groups differ in their outside options (e.g.
opportunity for legal employment) and decide whether to commit crimes. We show
that equalizing type I and type II errors across groups is consistent with the
goal of minimizing the overall crime rate; other popular notions of fairness

unknown number of components, obtained by replicating a given set of finite
state automata. Components communicate by executing atomic interactions whose
participants update their states simultaneously. We introduce an interaction
logic to specify both the type of interactions (e.g.\ rendez-vous, broadcast)

embedded in monadic second order logic of finitely many successors, and is
therefore decidable.
  Proving safety properties of such a parameterized system, like deadlock
freedom or mutual exclusion, requires to infer an inductive invariant that
contains all reachable states of all system instances, and no unsafe state. We
present a method to automatically synthesize inductive invariants directly from
the formula describing the interactions, without costly fixed point iterations.
We experimentally prove that this invariant is strong enough to verify safety
properties of a large number of systems including textbook examples (dining
philosophers, synchronization schemes), classical mutual exclusion algorithms,
cache-coherence protocols and self-stabilization algorithms, for an arbitrary

evidence: How widely is model protection used in apps? How robust are existing
model protection techniques? What impacts can (stolen) models incur? To that
end, we built a simple app analysis pipeline and analyzed 46,753 popular apps
collected from the US and Chinese app markets. We identified 1,468 ML apps
spanning all popular app categories. We found that, alarmingly, 41% of ML apps
do not protect their models at all, which can be trivially stolen from app
packages. Even for those apps that use model protection or encryption, we were
able to extract the models from 66% of them via unsophisticated dynamic

real-world wireless networks, where the two types of traffic coexist and share
limited radio resources. We focus on single-transmitter, single-antenna
wireless networks with cache-aided receivers, where the wireless channel is
modelled by a degraded Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC). For this setting, we
study the delay-rate trade-off, which characterizes the content delivery time
and non-content communication rates that can be achieved simultaneously. We
propose a scheme based on the separation principle, which isolates the coded
caching and multicasting problem from the physical layer transmission problem.
We show that this separation-based scheme is sufficient for achieving an
information-theoretically order optimal performance, up to a multiplicative
factor of 2.01 for the content delivery time, when working in the generalized
degrees of freedom (GDoF) limit. We further show that the achievable
performance is near-optimal after relaxing the GDoF limit, up to an additional
additive factor of 2 bits per dimension for the non-content rates. A key
insight emerging from our scheme is that in some scenarios considerable amounts
of non-content traffic can be communicated while maintaining the minimum
content delivery time, achieved in the absence of non-content messages;

This is the
third in a series of papers on the closure phase delay-spectrum technique
designed to detect the HI 21cm emission from cosmic reionization. We present
the details of the data and models employed in the power spectral analysis, and
discuss limitations to the process. We compare images and visibility spectra
made with HERA data, to parallel quantities generated from sky models based on
the GLEAM survey, incorporating the HERA telescope model. We find reasonable
agreement between images made from HERA data, with those generated from the
models, down to the confusion level. For the visibility spectra, there is broad
agreement between model and data across the full band of $\sim 80$MHz. However,
models with only GLEAM sources do not reproduce a roughly sinusoidal spectral
structure at the tens of percent level seen in the observed visibility spectra
on scales $\sim 10$ MHz on 29 m baselines. We find that this structure is
likely due to diffuse Galactic emission, predominantly the Galactic plane,
filling the far sidelobes of the antenna primary beam. We show that our current
knowledge of the frequency dependence of the diffuse sky radio emission, and
the primary beam at large zenith angles, is inadequate to provide an accurate
reproduction of the diffuse structure in the models. We discuss implications
due to this missing structure in the models, including calibration, and in the
search for the HI 21cm signal, as well as possible mitigation techniques.

that a stable final equilibrium state exists, and the nonstationary components

nonperturbatively that equilibration implies an FDR for the anharmonic

first-order perturbative results: that the net energy exchange vanishes after
relaxation in the open system dynamics and an equilibrium state exists at late

formulations of cohesive subgraphs lead to NP-hard problems, finding a densest
subgraph can be done in polynomial time. As such, the densest subgraph model
has emerged as the most popular notion of cohesiveness. Recently, the data
mining community has started looking into the problem of computing k densest
subgraphs in a given graph, rather than one, with various restrictions on the
possible overlap between the subgraphs. However, there seems to be very little
known on this important and natural generalization from a theoretical
perspective. In this paper we hope to remedy this situation by analyzing three
natural variants of the k densest subgraphs problem. Each variant differs
depending on the amount of overlap that is allowed between the subgraphs. In
one extreme, when no overlap is allowed, we prove that the problem is NP-hard
for k >= 3. On the other extreme, when overlap is allowed without any
restrictions and the solution subgraphs only have to be distinct, we show that
the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to k, and admits a PTAS
for constant k. Finally, when a limited of overlap is allowed between the
subgraphs, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for k = 2.

is a single vertex. We show that isolating cycles in polyhedral graphs can be
extended to larger ones: every isolating cycle $C$ of length $6 \leq |E(C)| <
\left \lfloor \frac{2}{3}(|V(G)|+4) \right \rfloor$ implies an isolating cycle
$C'$ of larger length that contains $V(C)$. By ""hopping"" iteratively to such
larger cycles, we obtain a powerful and very general inductive motor for
proving long cycles and computing them (we will give an algorithm with
quadratic running time). This is the first step towards the so far elusive
quest of finding a universal induction that captures longest cycles of
polyhedral graph classes.
  Our motor provides also a method to prove linear lower bounds on the length
of Tutte cycles, as $C'$ will be a Tutte cycle of $G$ if $C$ is. We prove in
addition that $|E(C')| \leq |E(C)|+3$ if $G$ contains no face of size five,
which gives a new tool for results about cycle spectra, and provides evidence
that faces of size five may obstruct long cycles in many graph classes. We test
our motor on the following conjecture about essentially 4-connected graphs.
  A planar graph is \emph{essentially $4$-connected} if it is 3-connected and
every of its 3-separators is the neighborhood of a single vertex. Jackson and
Wormald proved that every essentially 4-connected planar graph $G$ on $n$
vertices contains a cycle of length at least $\frac{2}{5}(n+2)$, and this
result has recently been improved multiple times, culminating in the lower
bound $\frac{5}{8}(n+2)$. However, the currently best known upper bound is
given by an infinite family of such graphs in which no graph $G$ contains a
cycle that is longer than $\left \lfloor \frac{2}{3}(n+4) \right \rfloor$; this
upper bound is still unmatched.
  Using isolating cycles, we improve the lower bound to match the upper. All
our results are tight.

for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given a large number of
cognitive assessment tools and time-limited office visits, it is important to
determine a proper set of cognitive tests for different subjects. Most current
studies create guidelines of cognitive test selection for a targeted
population, but they are not customized for each individual subject. In this
manuscript, we develop a machine learning paradigm enabling personalized
cognitive assessments prioritization. Method: We adapt a newly developed
learning-to-rank approach PLTR to implement our paradigm. This method learns
the latent scoring function that pushes the most effective cognitive
assessments onto the top of the prioritization list. We also extend PLTR to
better separate the most effective cognitive assessments and the less effective
ones. Results: Our empirical study on the ADNI data shows that the proposed
paradigm outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on identifying and
prioritizing individual-specific cognitive biomarkers. We conduct experiments
in cross validation and level-out validation settings. In the two settings, our
paradigm significantly outperforms the best baselines with improvement as much
as 22.1% and 19.7%, respectively, on prioritizing cognitive features.
Conclusions: The proposed paradigm achieves superior performance on
prioritizing cognitive biomarkers. The cognitive biomarkers prioritized on top
have great potentials to facilitate personalized diagnosis, disease subtyping,
and ultimately precision medicine in AD.

quantum system reduced density matrix coupled to a non-Markovian harmonic
environment. Critically, the combined system of the open system fully coupled
to its environment is thermalised at finite temperature using an imaginary time
evolution procedure before the application of real time evolution. This
initialises the combined system in the correct canonical equilibrium state
rather than being initially decoupled. We apply our theory to the spin-boson
Hamiltonian and develop a number of competing ESLN variants designed to reduce
the numerical divergence of the trace of the open system density matrix. We
find that a careful choice of the driving noises is essential for improving
numerical stability. We also investigate the effect of applying higher order
numerical schemes for solving stochastic differential equations, such as the
Stratonovich-Heun scheme, and conclude that stochastic sampling dominates
convergence with the improvement associated with the numerical scheme being
less important for short times but required for late times. To verify the
method and its numerical implementation, we consider evolution under a fixed
Hamiltonian and show that the system either remains in, or approaches, the
correct canonical equilibrium state at long times. Additionally, evolution of
the open system under non-equilibrium Landau-Zener (LZ) driving is considered
and the asymptotic convergence to the LZ limit was observed for vanishing
system-environment coupling and temperature. When coupling and temperature are
non-zero, initially thermalising the combined system at a finite time in the
past was found to be a better approximation of the true LZ initial state than a
pure state.

We use this observation to exploit class boundaries from off-the-shelf semantic
segmentation networks and refine them to predict instance labels. Towards this
goal BBFNet predicts coarse watershed levels and uses them to detect large
instance candidates where boundaries are well defined. For smaller instances,
whose boundaries are less reliable, BBFNet also predicts instance centers by
means of Hough voting followed by mean-shift to reliably detect small objects.
A novel triplet loss network helps merging fragmented instances while refining
boundary pixels. Our approach is distinct from previous works in panoptic
segmentation that rely on a combination of a semantic segmentation network with
a computationally costly instance segmentation network based on bounding box
proposals, such as Mask R-CNN, to guide the prediction of instance labels using
a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) approach. We benchmark our proposal-free method on

  time consciousness literature",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this theoretical work the temporal aspect of consciousness is analyzed. We
start from the notion that while conscious experience seems to change
constantly, yet for any of its contents to be consciously perceived they must
last for some non-zero duration of time, which appears to constitute certain
conflict. We posit that, in terms of phenomenological analysis of
consciousness, the temporal aspect, and this apparent conflict in particular,
might be the most basic property, likely inherent to any conceivable form of
consciousness. It is then outlined how taking this perspective offers a
concrete way of relating the properties of consciousness directly to the neural
plasticity mechanisms of learning and memory, and specifying how exactly
subjective experience might be related to processes of information integration.
In particular, we propose synaptic clock to constitute a content-specific
neural substrate of consciousness, explaining how it would correspond to this
temporal aspect. Then, we propose a viewpoint, in which moments of subjective
time have different durations, depending on the type of information processed,
proportional to the time units of corresponding synaptic clocks, and being in
principle different for different brain regions and nervous systems in
different animal species. Relation and possible contributions of this viewpoint
to the extensional model of time consciousness are discussed. Finally, we
consider the two alternative views on the structure of consciousness, namely a
static and a dynamic one, and argue in favor of the latter, proposing that
consciousness can be best understood if change is considered its only
dimension.

theory of sequential and cotunneling transport to relate the dI/dV spectra with
the spin properties of nanographenes probed by STM. This approach permits us to
connect the dI/dV with the many-body energies and wavefunctions of the graphene
nanostructures. We apply this method describing the electronic states of the
nanographenes by means of exact diagonalization of the Hubbard model within a
restricted Active Space. This permits us to provide a proper quantum
description of the emergence of local moments in graphene and its interplay
with transport. We discuss the results of this theory in the case of diradical
nanographenes, such as triangulene, rectangular ribbons and the Clar goblet,

This approach permits us to calculate both the dI/dV spectra, that yields
excitation energies, as well as the atomically resolved conductivity maps, that
provide information on the wavefunctions of the collective spin modes.

points $P$ in $\mathbb R^d$, a root point $s\in P$ and a budget $\mathcal B>0$,
find a path that starts from $s$, has total length at most $\mathcal B$, and
visits as many points of $P$ as possible. This problem is known to be NP-hard,
hence we study $(1-\delta)$-approximation algorithms. The previous
Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for this problem, due to Chen and
Har-Peled (2008), runs in time $n^{O(d\sqrt{d}/\delta)}(\log
n)^{(d/\delta)^{O(d)}}$, and improving on this time bound was left as an open
problem. Our main contribution is a PTAS with a significantly improved time
complexity of $n^{O(1/\delta)}(\log n)^{(d/\delta)^{O(d)}}$.
  A known technique for approximating the orienteering problem is to reduce it
to solving $1/\delta$ correlated instances of rooted $k$-TSP (a $k$-TSP tour is
one that visits at least $k$ points). However, the $k$-TSP tours in this
reduction must achieve a certain excess guarantee (namely, their length can
surpass the optimum length only in proportion to a parameter of the optimum
called excess) that is stronger than the usual $(1+\delta)$-approximation. Our
main technical contribution is to improve the running time of these $k$-TSP
variants, particularly in its dependence on the dimension $d$. Indeed, our
running time is polynomial even for a moderately large dimension, roughly up to
$d=O(\log\log n)$ instead of $d=O(1)$.

exponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources required grow
exponentially with the number of qubits $N$ or the depth $D$ of the circuit.
Real quantum computing devices, however, are characterized by an exponentially
decaying fidelity $\mathcal{F} \sim (1-\epsilon)^{ND}$ with an error rate
$\epsilon$ per operation as small as $\approx 1\%$ for current devices. In this
work, we demonstrate that real quantum computers can be simulated at a tiny
fraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our
algorithms compress the representations of quantum wavefunctions using matrix
product states (MPS), which capture states with low to moderate entanglement
very accurately. This compression introduces a finite error rate $\epsilon$ so
that the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing
devices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with $N$
and $D$. We illustrate our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for
qubits connected in both one and two dimensional lattices. We find that
$\epsilon$ can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to a
minimum error $\epsilon_\infty$. Getting below $\epsilon_\infty$ requires
computing resources that increase exponentially with
$\epsilon_\infty/\epsilon$. For a two dimensional array of $N=54$ qubits and a
circuit with Control-Z gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices

swept bandpass filter, such that the intensity trace exhibits no dips or
high-frequency distortions, which are the main source of noise in the laser. In
the same way, a small detuning from the ideal sweep filter frequency can be
tolerated. Furthermore, we find that the filter's group delay dispersion
improves the coherence properties of the laser, and acts as a self-stabilizing

  level-sets","54 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider level-sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, for
$d\geq 3$, above a given real-valued height parameter $h$. As $h$ varies, this
defines a canonical percolation model with strong, algebraically decaying
correlations. We prove that three natural critical parameters associated to
this model, namely $h_{**}(d)$, $h_{*}(d)$ and $\bar h(d)$, respectively
describing a well-ordered subcritical phase, the emergence of an infinite
cluster, and the onset of a local uniqueness regime in the supercritical phase,
actually coincide, i.e. $h_{**}(d)=h_{*}(d)= \bar h(d)$ for any $d \geq 3$. At
the core of our proof lies a new interpolation scheme aimed at integrating out
the long-range dependence of the Gaussian free field. The successful
implementation of this strategy relies extensively on certain novel
renormalization techniques, in particular to control so-called large-field
effects. This approach opens the way to a complete understanding of the
off-critical phases of strongly correlated percolation models.

generalized Heisenberg coupling of the form ${\cal H}_{\rm RKKY} \propto
{\sigma}_{1,i} {\cal I}_{ij} {\sigma}_{2,j}$ with a symmetric matrix ${\cal
I}_{ij}$, addition of small antisymmetric linear spin-orbit coupling term leads
to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling with an antisymmetric matrix ${\cal
I}'_{ij}$. We demonstrate that besides the oscillatory dependence on the
distance, all coupling strengths strongly depend on the relative orientation of
the two impurities with respect to the lattice. This yields a strongly
anisotropic behavior for ${\cal I}_{ij}$ such that by only rotating one
impurity around another at a constant distance, we can see further oscillations
of the RKKY couplings. This unprecedented effect is unique to our system which
combines spin-orbit coupling with strongly anisotropic Fermi surfaces. We
further find that all of the RKKY terms have two common features: a tetragonal
warping in their map of spatial variations, and a complex beating pattern.
Intriguingly, all these features survive in all dopings and we see them in both
electron- and hole-doped cases. In addition, due to the lower dimensionality
combined with the effects of different spin-orbit couplings, we see that only
one symmetric off-diagonal term, ${\cal I}_{xy}$ and two DM components ${\cal
I}'_{xz}$ and ${\cal I}'_{yz}$ are nonvanishing, while the remaining three
off-diagonal components are identically zero. This manifests another drastic
difference of RKKY interaction in half-Heusler topological semimetals compared
to the electronic systems with spin-1/2 effective description.

J. H. Conway's ordered field $\mathbf{No}$ of surreal numbers was brought to
the fore and employed to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an
ordered field (ordered $K$-vector space) to be isomorphic to an initial
subfield ($K$-subspace) of $\mathbf{No}$, i.e. a subfield ($K$-subspace) of
$\mathbf{No}$ that is an initial subtree of $\mathbf{No}$. In this sequel to
[15], piggybacking on the just-said results, analogous results are established
for ordered exponential fields, making use of a slight generalization of
Schmeling's conception of a transseries field. It is further shown that a wide
range of ordered exponential fields are isomorphic to initial exponential
subfields of $(\mathbf{No}, \exp)$. These include all models of
$T(\mathbb{R}_W, e^x)$, where $\mathbb{R}_W$ is the reals expanded by a
convergent Weierstrass system $W$. Of these, those we call
trigonometric-exponential fields are given particular attention. It is shown
that the exponential functions on the initial trigonometric-exponential

canonical exponential functions on their surcomplex counterparts. The image of

indicate that the reversible magnetization does not solely depend on the
interaction field, but it is indeed a function of the interaction field to
coercivity ratio. Furthermore, for large porosities, the interaction field
linearly changes with the porosity highlighting the predominant effects of
dipole-dipole interactions on the interaction fields. However, at low
porosities, the interaction field shows a nonlinear relationship with the
porosity indicating the dipole fluctuations effects dominantly determine the

problems and their generalizations which have received considerable attention
in the recent literature. The previously known algorithms for these problems
are based on the augmentation framework, a tailored integer programming variant
of local search. In this paper we propose a different approach. Our algorithm
relies on parametric search and a new proximity bound. We show that
block-structured linear programming can be solved efficiently via an adaptation
of a parametric search framework by Norton, Plotkin, and Tardos in combination
with Megiddo's multidimensional search technique. This also forms a subroutine
of our algorithm for the integer programming case by solving a strong
relaxation of it. Then we show that, for any given optimal vertex solution of
this relaxation, there is an optimal integer solution within $\ell_1$-distance
independent of the dimension of the problem. This in turn allows us to find an
optimal integer solution efficiently. We apply our techniques to integer and
linear programming with $n$-fold structure or bounded dual treedepth, two
benchmark problems in this field. We obtain the first algorithms for these

and its cost model ability to generate optimized mappings for various operators
of DNN models on to the accelerator's compute and memory resources. But,
existing cost models lack a formal boundary over the operators for precise and
tractable analysis, which poses adaptability challenges for new DNN operators.
To address this challenge, we leverage the recently introduced Maestro
Data-Centric (MDC) notation. We develop a formal understanding of DNN operators
whose mappings can be described in the MDC notation, because any mapping
adhering to the notation is always analyzable by the MDC's cost model.
Furthermore, we introduce a transformation for translating mappings into the
MDC notation for exploring the mapping space.
  Searching for the optimal mappings is challenging because of the large space
of mappings, and this challenge gets exacerbated with new operators and diverse
accelerator configurations.To address this challenge, we propose a decoupled
off-chip/on-chip approach that decomposes the mapping space into off-chip and
on-chip subspaces, and first optimizes the off-chip subspace followed by the
on-chip subspace. The motivation for this decomposition is to reduce the size
of the search space dramatically and also to prioritize the optimization of
off-chip data movement, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude more compared to the
on-chip data movement. We implemented our approach in a tool called {\em
Marvel}, and another major benefit of our approach is that it is applicable to
any DNN operator conformable with the MDC notation.

on the framed-ALOHA (f-ALOHA), which can be optimized by flexibly organizing
devices' transmission and re-transmission. However, this optimization is
generally intractable due to the lack of information about complex traffic
generation statistics and the occurrence of the random collision. In this
article, we first summarize the general structure of access control
optimization for different random access schemes, and then review the existing
access control optimization based on Machine Learning (ML) and non-ML
techniques. We demonstrate that the ML-based methods can better optimize the
access control problem compared with non-ML based methods, due to their
capability in solving high complexity long-term optimization problem and
learning experiential knowledge from reality. To further improve the random
access performance, we propose two-step learning optimizers for access control
optimization, which individually execute the traffic prediction and the access
control configuration. In detail, our traffic prediction method relies on
online supervised learning adopting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can
accurately capture traffic statistics over consecutive frames, and the access
control configuration can use either a non-ML based controller or a
cooperatively trained Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based controller
depending on the complexity of different random access schemes. Numerical
results show that the proposed two-step cooperative learning optimizer
considerably outperforms the conventional Deep Q-Network (DQN) in terms of

nonnegative-integer-valued Radon measures, whose correlation functions are all

isometies between a pair of Hilbert spaces plays an important role. Many
examples of DPPs in one-, two-, and higher-dimensional spaces are demonstrated,
where several types of weak convergence from finite DPPs to infinite DPPs are
given. Dynamical extensions of DPP are realized in one-dimensional systems of
diffusive particles conditioned never to collide with each other. They are
regarded as one-dimensional stochastic log-gases, or the two-dimensional
Coulomb gases confined in one-dimensional spaces. In the second section, we
consider such interacting particle systems in one dimension. We introduce a
notion of determinantal martingale and prove that, if the system has
determinantal martingale representation (DMR), then it is a determinantal
stochastic process (DSP) in the sense that all spatio-temporal correlation
function are expressed by a determinant. In the last section, we construct
processes of Gaussian free fields (GFFs) on simply connected proper subdomains
of $\mathbb{C}$ coupled with interacting particle systems defined on boundaries
of the domains. There we use multiple Schramm--Loewner evolutions (SLEs) driven
by the interacting particle systems. We prove that, if the driving processes
are time-changes of the log-gases studied in the second section, then the
obtained GFF with multiple SLEs are stationary. The stationarity defines an
equivalence relation of GFFs, which will be regarded as a generalization of the
imaginary surface studied by Miller and Sheffield.

differentiable trees demonstrate promising results in the literature, they are
typically slow in training and inference as they do not support conditional

differentiable trees used in the literature and over 20x reduction in the
number of parameters compared to gradient boosted trees, while maintaining
competitive performance. Moreover, experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Fashion

planktonic organisms, and floating debris such as plastics. In particular, the
estimated travel time can be used to compute an estimated Lagrangian distance,
which is often more informative than Euclidean distance in understanding
connectivity between locations. Our methodology is purely data-driven, and

meaning caused by a change in semantic roles of words or phrases because they
do not acknowledge the type of grammatical relations, also known as typed

between two inputs of a sequence using a control input. We also introduce a
Tree-LSTM model called Typed Dependency Tree-LSTM that uses the sentence
dependency parse structure as well as the dependency type to embed sentence
meaning into a dense vector. The proposed model outperformed its type-unaware
counterpart in two typical NLP tasks - Semantic Relatedness Scoring and
Sentiment Analysis, in a lesser number of training epochs. The results were
comparable or competitive with other state-of-the-art models. Qualitative
analysis showed that changes in the voice of sentences had little effect on the
model's predicted scores, while changes in nominal (noun) words had a more
significant impact. The model recognized subtle semantic relationships in
sentence pairs. The magnitudes of learned typed dependencies embeddings were
also in agreement with human intuitions. The research findings imply the
significance of grammatical relations in sentence modeling. The proposed models
would serve as a base for future researches in this direction.

  In this paper, we consider a generalization of the above formulation where

one, particularly when one needs to strike a balance between the value of the

the collection is known a priori, as well as in online settings, where the

problem, where a unit speed robot searches the half-line (or $1$-ray) for a
hidden item. The searcher is probabilistically faulty, and detection of the
item with each visitation is an independent Bernoulli trial whose probability
of success $p$ is known. The objective is to minimize the worst case expected
detection time, relative to the distance of the hidden item to the origin. A
variation of the same problem was first proposed by Gal in 1980. Then in 2003,
Alpern and Gal [The Theory of Search Games and Rendezvous] proposed a so-called
monotone solution for searching the line ($2$-rays); that is, a trajectory in
which the newly searched space increases monotonically in each ray and in each
iteration. Moreover, they conjectured that an optimal trajectory for the
$2$-rays problem must be monotone. We disprove this conjecture when the search
domain is the half-line ($1$-ray). We provide a lower bound for all monotone
algorithms, which we also match with an upper bound. Our main contribution is
the design and analysis of a sequence of refined search strategies, outside the
family of monotone algorithms, which we call $t$-sub-monotone algorithms. Such
algorithms induce performance that is strictly decreasing with $t$, and for all
$p \in (0,1)$. The value of $t$ quantifies, in a certain sense, how much our
algorithms deviate from being monotone, demonstrating that monotone algorithms
are sub-optimal when searching the half-line.

super-Alfv\'enic material. Aligned fields have little impact on the overall
lifetime of the clouds over the non-magnetized case, although they do increase
the mixing between the wind and cloud material by a factor of $\approx 3.$
Transverse fields lead to magnetic draping, which isolates the clouds, but they
also squeeze material in the direction perpendicular to the field lines, which
leads to rapid mass loss. A resolution study suggests that the magnetized
simulations have somewhat better convergence properties than non-magnetized
simulations, and that a resolution of 64 zones per cloud radius is sufficient
to accurately describe these interactions. We conclude that the combined

dispersion in the mass ratio between black hole mass and stellar mass is
significantly more consistent with the MBII prediction ($\sim0.3~$dex), than
with the SAM ($\sim0.7~$dex), even when accounting for observational
uncertainties. Hence, our observations can distinguish between the different
recipes adopted in the models. The mass relations in the MBII are highly
dependent on AGN feedback while the relations in the SAM are more sensitive to
galaxy merger events triggering nuclear activity. Moreover, the intrinsic
scatter in the mass ratio of our high-$z$ sample is comparable to that observed
in the local sample, all but ruling out the proposed scenario the correlations
are purely stochastic in nature arising from some sort of cosmic central limit

disruption but still hosts its nuclear star cluster (NSC), M54, at its center.
In this paper, we present a detailed kinematic characterization of the three
stellar populations present in M54: young metal-rich (YMR); intermediate-age
metal-rich (IMR); and old metal-poor (OMP), based on the spectra of $\sim6500$
individual M54 member stars extracted from a large MUSE/VLT dataset. We find
that the OMP population is slightly flattened with a low amount of rotation
($\sim0.8$ km s$^{-1}$) and with a velocity dispersion that follows a Plummer
profile. The YMR population displays a high amount of rotation ($\sim5$ km
s$^{-1}$) and a high degree of flattening, with a lower and flat velocity
dispersion profile. The IMR population shows a high but flat velocity
dispersion profile, with some degree of rotation ($\sim2$ km s$^{-1}$). We
complement our MUSE data with information from \textit{Gaia DR2} and confirm
that the stars from the OMP and YMR populations are comoving in 3D space,
suggesting that they are dynamically bound. While dynamical evolutionary
effects (e.g. energy equipartition) are able to explain the differences in
velocity dispersion between the stellar populations, the strong differences in
rotation indicate different formation paths for the populations, as supported
by an $N$-body simulation tailored to emulate the YMR-OMP system. This study
provides additional evidence for the M54 formation scenario proposed in our
previous work, where this NSC formed via GC accretion (OMP) and in situ
formation from gas accretion in a rotationally supported disc (YMR).

their star formation rate and stellar mass, they are expected to exhibit
complex star formation histories (SFH), with short-term fluctuations. The goal
of this pilot study is to present a method that will identify galaxies that are
undergoing a strong variation of star formation activity in the last tens to
hundreds Myr. In other words, the proposed method will determine whether a
variation in the last few hundreds of Myr of the SFH is needed to properly
model the SED rather than a smooth normal SFH. To do so, we analyze a sample of
COSMOS galaxies using high signal-to-noise ratio broad band photometry. We
apply Approximate Bayesian Computation, a state-of-the-art statistical method
to perform model choice, associated to machine learning algorithms to provide
the probability that a flexible SFH is preferred based on the observed flux
density ratios of galaxies. We present the method and test it on a sample of
simulated SEDs. The input information fed to the algorithm is a set of
broadband UV to NIR (rest-frame) flux ratios for each galaxy. The method has an
error rate of 21% in recovering the right SFH and is sensitive to SFR
variations larger than 1 dex. A more traditional SED fitting method using
CIGALE is tested to achieve the same goal, based on fits comparisons through
Bayesian Information Criterion but the best error rate obtained is higher, 28%.
We apply our new method to the COSMOS galaxies sample. The stellar mass
distribution of galaxies with a strong to decisive evidence against the smooth
delayed-$\tau$ SFH peaks at lower M* compared to galaxies where the smooth
delayed-$\tau$ SFH is preferred. We discuss the fact that this result does not
come from any bias due to our training. Finally, we argue that flexible SFHs
are needed to be able to cover that largest SFR-M* parameter space possible.

quantum superposition principle have been recently proposed. There, a control
quantum system can coherently determine the order in which a target quantum
system undergoes $N$ gate operations. This process, known as the quantum
$N$-switch, is a resource for several information-processing tasks. In
particular, it provides a computational advantage -- over fixed-gate-order
quantum circuits -- for phase-estimation problems involving $N$ unknown unitary
gates. However, the corresponding algorithm requires an experimentally
unfeasible target-system dimension (super)exponential in $N$. Here, we
introduce a promise problem for which the quantum $N$-switch gives an
equivalent computational speed-up with target-system dimension as small as 2
regardless of $N$. We use state-of-the-art multi-core optical-fiber technology
to experimentally demonstrate the quantum $N$-switch with $N=4$ gates acting on
a photonic-polarization qubit. This is the first observation of a quantum
superposition of more than $N=2$ temporal orders, demonstrating its usefulness
for efficient phase-estimation.

ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope program, which has assembled a sample of 43
QSOs that pierce the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Andromeda (M31) from R=25
to 569 kpc (25 of them probing gas from 25 kpc to about the virial radius-Rvir
= 300 kpc-of M31). Our large sample provides an unparalleled look at the
physical conditions and distribution of metals in the CGM of a single galaxy
using ions that probe a wide range of gas phases (Si II, Si III, Si IV, C II, C
IV, and O VI, the latter being from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer). We find that Si III and O VI have near unity covering factor
maintained all the way out to 1.2Rvir and 1.9Rvir, respectively. We show that
Si III is the dominant ion over Si II and Si IV at any R. While we do not find
that the properties of the CGM of M31 depend strongly on the azimuth, we show
that they change remarkably around 0.3-0.5Rvir, conveying that the inner
regions of the CGM of M31 are more dynamic and have more complicated
multi-phase gas-structures than at R>0.5Rvir. We estimate the metal mass of the
CGM within Rvir as probed by Si II, Si III, and Si IV is 2x10^7 Msun and by O
VI is >8x10^7 Msun, while the baryon mass of the 10^4-10^5.5 K gas is ~4x10^10
(Z/0.3 Zsun)^(-1) Msun within Rvir. We show that different zoom-in cosmological
simulations of L* galaxies better reproduce the column density profile of O VI
with R than Si III or the other studied ions. We find that observations of the
M31 CGM and zoom-in simulations of L* galaxies have both lower ions showing
higher column density dispersion and dependence on R than higher ions,
indicating that the higher ionization structures are larger and/or more broadly
distributed.

mass, metallicity, dust) of the clump and galaxy, we explore scenarios in which
the clump formed \emph{in-situ} (e.g., a star forming complex) or
\emph{ex-situ} (e.g., a dwarf galaxy being accreted). If it formed
\emph{in-situ}, we conclude that the clump is likely a single entity as opposed
to a aggregation of smaller star clusters, making it one of the most dense star
clusters cataloged. If it formed \emph{ex-situ}, then we are witnessing an
accretion event with a 1:40 stellar mass ratio. However, our data alone are not
informative enough to distinguish between \emph{in-situ} and \emph{ex-situ}
scenarios to a high level of significance. We posit that the addition of
high-fidelity metallicity information, such as [OIII]4363\AA, which can be
detected at modest S/N with only a few hours of JWST/NIRSpec time, may be a
powerful discriminant. We suggest that studying larger samples of moderately

on the circle. Ott and Antonsen identified a special class of densities which
is invariant under the dynamics and on which the dynamics are low-dimensional
and analytically tractable. The reduction to the OA manifold has been used to
analyze the dynamics of many variants of the Kuramoto model. To address the
fundamental question of whether the OA manifold is attracting, we develop a
systematic technique using weighted averages of Poisson measures for analyzing
dynamics off the OA manifold. We show that for models with a finite number of
populations, the OA manifold is {\it not} attracting in any sense; moreover,
the dynamics off the OA manifold is often more complex than on the OA manifold,
even at the level of macroscopic order parameters. The OA manifold consists of
Poisson densities $\rho_\omega$. A simple extension of the OA manifold consists
of averages of pairs of Poisson densities; then the hyperbolic distance between
the centroids of each Poisson pair is a dynamical invariant (for each
$\omega$). These conserved quantities, defined on the double Poisson manifold,
are a measure of the distance to the OA manifold. This invariance implies that
chimera states, which have some but not all populations in sync, can never be
stable in the full state space, even if stable in the OA manifold. More
broadly, our framework facilitates the analysis of multi-population continuum
Kuramoto networks beyond the restrictions of the OA manifold, and has the
potential to reveal more intricate dynamical behavior than has previously been
observed for these networks.

properties of these galaxies, providing valuable insight on the formation and
evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. Using the Nearest Neighbour method, we
measure the local density of each object ranging from small to large scales

general galaxy population in the field, we conclude that LBAs, on average,
populate denser regions at small scales ($\sim$ $1.5Mpc$), but are located in
similar environment to other star-forming galaxies at larger scales ($\sim$

influence the star formation activity in LBAs, before infall onto larger galaxy

nitrogen are relatively higher (ICF$_{\rm neutral}=0.05$-0.7) than those for

Reachable set theory is used to translate the cost-minimization problem into a
geometric path-planning problem and formulate the reachable delta-v minimum, a
new metric to assess optimality and quantify reachability of a maneuver scheme.
Next, this paper presents a methodology to compute maneuver schemes that meet
this new optimality criteria and achieve a prescribed reconfiguration. Though
the methodology is applicable to any linear time-variant system, this paper
leverages a state representation in ROE to derive new globally optimal maneuver
schemes in orbits of arbitrary eccentricity. The methodology is also used to
generate quantifiably sub-optimal solutions when the optimal solutions are
unreachable. Further, this paper determines the mathematical impact of
uncertainties on achieving the desired end state and provides a geometric
visualization of those effects on the reachable set. The proposed algorithms
are tested in realistic reconfiguration scenarios and validated in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

a graph and a few labeled vertices, labeling the remaining vertices is a
high-impact problem with applications in several tasks, such as recommender
systems, fraud detection and protein identification. However, traditional
methods rely on edges for spreading labels, which is limited as all edges are
not equal. Vertices with stronger connections participate in higher-order
structures in graphs, which calls for methods that can leverage these
structures in the semi-supervised learning tasks.
  To this end, we propose Higher-Order Label Spreading (HOLS) to spread labels
using higher-order structures. HOLS has strong theoretical guarantees and
reduces to standard label spreading in the base case. Via extensive
experiments, we show that higher-order label spreading using triangles in
addition to edges is up to 4.7% better than label spreading using edges alone.
Compared to prior traditional and state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method
leads to statistically significant accuracy gains in all-but-one cases, while
remaining fast and scalable to large graphs.

Such spectral holes in the susceptibility, microscopically described in terms
of Fano resonances, can already occur in setups of only two or three frustrated

$\Lambda$-shape. For larger clusters of magnetic moments, the corresponding
level schemes separate into almost isolated many-body $\Lambda$-schemes, in the
sense that either the transition matrix elements between them are negligibly
small or the energy difference of the transitions is strongly off-resonant to
the drive. This enables the observation of Fano resonances, caused by many-body
quantum corrections to the common Ising approximation also in the thermodynamic

NP-to-NP variations. Over time, the rate slowed substantially, though remaining
well above the bulk rate. The initial activation energies (Eas) were
correspondingly low and doubled as a few monolayer's worth of material were
sublimed from the surfaces. The high initial rates and low Eas are attributed
to large numbers of edge and other low coordination sites on the NP surfaces,
and the changes are attributed to atomic-scale ""smoothing"" of the surface by
preferential sublimation of the less stable sites. The emissivity of the NPs

sophisticated, ironically, as defense getting stronger and the cost of a breach
continuing to rise. Understanding the thought processes and behaviors of

have no incentive to share the trades associated with their illegal activities.
One opportunity to observe the actions the adversaries perform is through the
use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) which generate alerts in the event
that suspicious behavior was detected. The alerts raised by these systems
typically describe the suspicious actions via the form of attack 'signature',
which do not necessarily reveal the true intent of the attacker performing the

do not connect the action types to observables of standard intrusion detection

address these gaps, this work proposes the Action-Intent Framework (AIF) to
complement existing Cyber Attack Kill Chains and Attack Taxonomies. The AIF

provides lower latent access failure probability than the K-repetition scheme.

a class of codes for efficient communication over the AWGN channel at rates
approaching the channel capacity. In a standard SPARC, codewords are sparse
linear combinations of columns of an i.i.d. Gaussian design matrix, while in a
spatially coupled SPARC the design matrix has a block-wise structure, where the
variance of the Gaussian entries can be varied across blocks. A well-designed
spatial coupling structure can significantly enhance the error performance of
iterative decoding algorithms such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP).
  In this paper, we obtain a non-asymptotic bound on the probability of error
of spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding. Applying this bound to a simple
band-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP
decoding achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The bound also highlights
how the decay of error probability depends on each design parameter of the
spatially coupled SPARC. An attractive feature of AMP decoding is that its
asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) can be predicted via a deterministic
recursion called state evolution. Our result provides the first proof that the
MSE concentrates on the state evolution prediction for spatially coupled
designs. Combined with the state evolution prediction, this result implies that
spatially coupled SPARCs with the proposed band-diagonal design are
capacity-achieving. Using the proof technique used to establish the main
result, we also obtain a concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to
compressed sensing with spatially coupled design matrices. Finally we provide
numerical simulation results that demonstrate the finite length error
performance of spatially coupled SPARCs. The performance is compared with coded

object V$^*$ CN Cha in the constellation of Chamaeleon. The object had long
period ($\sim\! 250\,$day), high amplitude ($\sim\! 3\,$mag) optical
variability in its recent past, preceding an increase in optical brightness by
$\sim\! 8\,$magnitudes and a persistence at this luminosity for about 3 years,
followed by a period of $\sim\! 1.4\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ dimming. The
object's current optical luminosity seems to be dominated by H$\alpha$

among the lowest luminosity novae ever observed.

stochastically more expensive than evading, even in absence of controls and

comply. The incentives here are deductions of specific VAT documented expenses
from the income tax. The issue is very well known and deduction policies at
work in many countries. The aim is to compute the right parameters for each
precise class of taxpayers. VAT evasion is a collusive conduct between the two
counterparts of the transaction. I therefore first explore the convenience for
the two private counterparts to agree on the joint evasion and to form a
coalition. Crucial is that compliance incentives break the agreement among the
transaction participants' coalition about evading. The game solution leads to
boundaries for marginal tax rates or deduction percentages, depending on
parameters, able to create incentives to comply The stylized example presented
here for VAT policies, already in use in many countries, is an attempt to
establish a more general method for tax design, able to make compliance the
""dominant strategy"", satisfying the ""outside option"" constraint represented by
evasion, even in absence of audit and sanctions. The theoretical results
derived here can be easily applied to real data for precise tax design

ambient magnetosheath at a (relative) speed faster than the local magnetosonic

were recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing to
magnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of
Earth bow shock. To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow
waves, we perform a statistical study to examine which solar wind conditions
favor their formation and whether it is common for them to accelerate
particles. We identified 364 out of 2859 (13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow
wave or shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show
that large solar wind plasma beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
strength, large solar wind Alfven Mach number, and strong solar wind dynamic
pressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also show that
magnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with
higher maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming
that it is common for these structures to accelerate particles. In particular,
magnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron energy flux enhanced on average
by a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient
magnetosheath. Our study implies that magnetosheath jets can contribute to
shock acceleration of particles especially for high Mach number shocks.

suprathermal electrons in the ambient magnetosheath convect towards a bow wave,
some electrons are shock-drift accelerated and reflected towards the ambient

surface in the parameter space for finding the global optima with minimal
function evaluations. The response surface is modeled as correlated surrogates
using GPs on noisy data. The GP posterior predictive variance is exploited for
smart adaptive sampling. This balances the exploration versus exploitation
trade-off which is key in reaching the global optima under limited budget. We
demonstrate our technique on an actuated planar pendulum and safety-critical
quadrotor in simulation with changing parameters. We also benchmark our results
against solvers using interior point method and sequential quadratic program.
By reconfiguring the controller with new optimized parameters iteratively, we
drastically improve trajectory tracking of the system versus the nominal case
and other solvers.

gripping force, mainly originated from the van der Waals force between the

reversibly varying the physical properties (e.g., stiffness) of the composite
via external stimuli. The maximal gripping force Fmax and its tunability depend
on, among other factors, the stress distribution on the gripping interface and
its fracture dynamics (during detaching), which in turn are determined by the
composite microstructure. Here, we present a computational framework for the
modeling and design of a class of binary smart composites containing a porous
low-melting-point alloy (LMPA) phase and a polymer phase, in order to achieve
desirable dynamically tunable dry adhesion. In particular, we employ spatial
correlation functions to quantify, model and represent the complex
bi-continuous microstructure of the composites, from which a wide spectrum of
realistic virtual 3D composite microstructures can be generated using
stochastic optimization. A recently developed volume-compensated
lattice-particle (VCLP) method is then employed to model the dynamic
interfacial fracture process to compute Fmax for different composite
microstructures. We focus on the interface defect tuning (IDT) mechanism for
dry adhesion tuning enabled by the composite, in which the thermal expansion of
the LMPA phase due to Joule heating initializes small cracks on the adhesion
interface, subsequently causing the detachment of the gripper from the object
due to interfacial fracture. We find that for an optimal microstructure among
the ones studied here, a 10-fold dynamic tuning of Fmax before and after the
thermal expansion of the LMPA phase can be achieved. Our computational results
can provide valuable guidance for experimental fabrication of the LMPA-polymer

carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Previous investigations have showed that with an
increase in CNT diameter, its preferred configuration changes from a circular
form to a flattened shape that can be obtained in high pressure or tension
conditions. The ReaxFF reactive force field can reveal detailed chemical
interactions at the atomistic scale. To enable ReaxFF simulations on
CNT/polymer interfaces, we trained force field parameters to capture the proper
structure of flattened carbon nanotubes (flCNTs), i.e. dumbbell-like shape
CNTs, against available polymer consistent force field -- interface force field
(PCFF-IFF) data which had good proximity to density functional theory (DFT)

using the optimized force field to study the polymerization of diglycidyl ether
of bisphenol F (Bis F) and diethyltoluenediamine (DEDTA) molecules in vicinity
of circular and flattened CNTs. Our results indicate that the flat regions of
flCNT are more favorable spots for the polymers to settle compared to curved
regions due to higher binding energies. Moreover, higher dimer generation
around flCNT results in more effective coating of the CNT which leads to higher
load transfer in compared to circular CNT. According to our results there is a
high alignment between polymers and CNT surface which is due to strong pi-pi
interactions of aromatic carbon rings in the polymers and CNTs. These ReaxFF
simulations indicate the capability of this method to simultaneously observe
the polymerization of monomers along with their interactions with CNTs.

store a large amount $dsize$ of source data for a long duration using a large
number $N$ of unreliable storage nodes, each with capacity $nsize$. The storage
overhead $\beta$ is the fraction of system capacity available beyond $dsize$,
i.e., $\beta = 1- \frac{dsize}{N \cdot nsize}$. Storage nodes fail randomly
over time and are replaced with initially empty nodes, and thus data is erased
from the system at an average rate $erate = \lambda \cdot N \cdot nsize$, where
$1/\lambda$ is the average lifetime of a node before failure. To maintain
recoverability of the source data, a repairer continually reads data over a
network from nodes at some average rate $rrate$, and generates and writes data
to nodes based on the read data. The main result is that, for any repairer, if
the source data is recoverable at each point in time then it must be the case
that $rrate \ge \frac{erate}{2 \cdot \beta}$ asymptotically as $N$ goes to
infinity and beta goes to zero. This inequality provides a fundamental lower
bound on the average rate that any repairer needs to read data from the system
in order to maintain recoverability of the source data.

is in terms of the initial incident (reference) illumination of the object to

gains in sample efficiency, due to the ease of reusing or generating new
experience by proposing goals. One approach,self-play, allows an agent to
""play"" against itself by alternatively setting and accomplishing goals,
creating a learned curriculum through which an agent can learn to accomplish
progressively more difficult goals. However, self-play has been limited to goal
curriculum learning or learning progressively harder goals within a single
environment. Recent work on robotic agents has shown that varying the
environment during training, for example with domain randomization, leads to
more robust transfer. As a result, we extend the self-play framework to jointly

most fruitful domain randomization strategy with self-play. Our method,
Self-Supervised Active Domain Randomization(SS-ADR), generates a coupled

$\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ with an approximation ratio better than $2$ for STP is
known, it is mostly preferred in integer programming as an implementation of
STP, since there exists a formulation of compact size, which turns out to be
very effective in practice.
  It is known that the integrality gap of $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ is at most
$2$, and a long standing open question is whether the integrality gap is less
than $2$ or not. The best lower bound so far is $\frac{36}{31} \approx 1.161$
proven by Byrka et al. [BGRS13]. Based on the work of Chakrabarty et al.
[CDV11] about embedding STP instances into simplices by considering appropriate
dual formulations, we improve on this result by constructing a new class of
instances and showing that their integrality gaps tend at least to $\frac{6}{5}

  More precisely, we consider the class of equivalent LP-relaxations
$\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}^{+}$, that can be obtained by strengthening
$\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ by already known straightforward Steiner vertex degree
constraints, and show that the worst case ratio regarding the optimum value
between $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ and $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}^{+}$ is at least
$\frac{6}{5}$. Since $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}^{+}$ is a lower bound for the
hypergraphic relaxations ($\mathrm{\mathcal{HYP}}$), another well-known class
of equivalent LP-relaxations on which the current best $(\ln(4) +

oscillations can be described through the theory of weak measurements with pre
and post-selection. The weak nature of neutrino detection allows simultaneous
determination of flavor and energy without problems related to the collapse of
the wavefunction. Together with post-selection, a non-trivial quantum
interference emerges, allowing one to describe a flavor neutrino as one single
particle, despite its superposition of masses. We write down the flavor
equation of motion and calculate the flavor oscillation probability by showing
precisely how a single neutrino interferes with itself.

Gaussian smearing, are ineffective in isolating ground state nucleons in a
uniform background magnetic field. There is evidence that residual Landau mode
physics remains at the quark level, even when QCD interactions are present. In
this work, quark-level projection operators are constructed from the $SU(3)
\times U(1)$ eigenmodes of the two-dimensional lattice Laplacian operator
associated with Landau modes. These quark-level modes are formed from a
periodic finite lattice where both the background field and strong interactions
are present. Using these eigenmodes, quark-propagator projection operators
provides the enhanced hadronic energy-eigenstate isolation necessary for
calculation of nucleon energy shifts in a magnetic field. The magnetic
polarisability of both the proton and neutron is calculated using this method
on the $32^3 \times 64$ dynamical QCD lattices provided by the PACS-CS
Collaboration. A chiral effective-field theory analysis is used to connect the
lattice QCD results to the physical regime, obtaining magnetic polarisabilities
of $\beta^p = 2.79(22)({}^{+13}_{-18}) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$ and $\beta^n =
2.06(26)({}^{+15}_{-20}) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, where the numbers in

  Smooth Min-Max Problems","29 pages; accepted to SIAM Journal on Optimization (as of May 2021)",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an efficient algorithm for finding first-order Nash equilibria in
min-max problems of the form $\min_{x \in X}\max_{y\in Y} F(x,y)$, where the
objective function is smooth in both variables and concave with respect to $y$;
the sets $X$ and $Y$ are convex and ""projection-friendly,"" and $Y$ is compact.
Our goal is to find an $(\varepsilon_x,\varepsilon_y)$-first-order Nash
equilibrium with respect to a stationarity criterion that is stronger than the
commonly used proximal gradient norm. The proposed approach is fairly simple:
we perform approximate proximal-point iterations on the primal function, with
inexact oracle provided by Nesterov's algorithm run on the regularized function
$F(x_t,\cdot)$, $x_t$ being the current primal iterate. The resulting iteration
complexity is $O(\varepsilon_x{}^{-2} \varepsilon_y{}^{-1/2})$ up to a
logarithmic factor. As a byproduct, the choice $\varepsilon_y =
O(\varepsilon_x{}^2)$ allows for the $O(\varepsilon_x{}^{-3})$ complexity of
finding an $\varepsilon_x$-stationary point for the standard Moreau envelope of
the primal function. Moreover, when the objective is strongly concave with
respect to $y$, the complexity estimate for our algorithm improves to
$O(\varepsilon_x{}^{-2}{\kappa_y}^{1/2})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where
$\kappa_y$ is the condition number appropriately adjusted for coupling. In both
scenarios, the complexity estimates are the best known so far, and are only
known for the (weaker) proximal gradient norm criterion. Meanwhile, our
approach is ""user-friendly:"" (i) the algorithm is built upon running a variant
of Nesterov's accelerated algorithm as subroutine and avoids extragradient
steps; (ii) the convergence analysis recycles the well-known results on
accelerated methods with inexact oracle. Finally, we extend the approach to
non-Euclidean proximal geometries.

algebraic blinding techniques for constructing such maps. An earlier approach
involving Weil restriction can be regarded as a special case of blinding in our
framework. However, the techniques developed in this paper are more general,
more robust, and easier to analyze. The trilinear maps constructed in this
paper are efficiently computable. The relationship between the published
entities and the hidden entities under the blinding scheme is described by
algebraic conditions. Finding points on an algebraic set defined by such
conditions for the purpose of unblinding is difficult as these algebraic sets
have dimension at least linear in $n$ and involves $\Omega(n^2)$ variables,
where $n$ is the security parameter. Finding points on such algebraic sets in
general takes time exponential in $n^2\log n$ with the best known methods.
Additionally these algebraic sets are characterized as being {\em triply
confusing} and most likely {\em uniformly confusing} as well. These properties
provide additional evidence that efficient algorithms to find points on such
algebraic sets seems unlikely to exist. In addition to algebraic blinding, the
security of the trilinear maps also depends on the computational complexity of
a trapdoor discrete logarithm problem which is defined in terms of an
associative non-commutative polynomial algebra acting on torsion points of a
blinded product of elliptic curves.

that can lead to powerful attacks. Despite significant progress made by decades
of research on mitigation techniques, existing countermeasures fall short due
to either limited coverage or overly high overhead. Furthermore, they require
external mechanisms (e.g., spatial memory safety) to protect their metadata.
Otherwise, their protection can be bypassed or disabled. To address these
limitations, we present robust points-to authentication, a novel runtime scheme
for detecting all kinds of temporal memory corruptions. We built a prototype
system, called PTAuth, that realizes this scheme on ARM architectures. PTAuth
contains a customized compiler for code analysis and instrumentation and a
runtime library for performing the points-to authentication as a protected
program runs. PTAuth leverages the Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) feature,
provided by the ARMv8.3 and later CPUs, which serves as a simple hardware-based
encryption primitive. PTAuth uses minimal in-memory metadata and protects its
metadata without requiring spatial memory safety. We report our evaluation of
PTAuth in terms of security, robustness and performance using 150 vulnerable
programs from Juliet test suite and the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. PTAuth detects
all three categories of heap-based temporal memory corruptions, generates zero
false alerts, and slows down program execution by 26% (this number was measured
based on software-emulated PAC; it is expected to decrease to 20% when using
hardware-based PAC). We also show that PTAuth incurs 2% memory overhead thanks
to the efficient use of metadata.

equations. Specifically, we consider the case of a non-degenerate diffusivity
function that is a (non-negative) polynomial of the dependent variable of the
problem. We motivate these types of equations using Einstein's random walk
paradigm, leading to a partial differential equation in non-divergence form. On
the other hand, using conservation principles leads to a partial differential
equation in divergence form. A transformation is derived to handle both cases.
Then, a maximum principle (on both an unbounded and a bounded domain) is
proved, in order to obtain bounds above and below for the time-evolution of the
solutions to the non-linear diffusion problem. Specifically, these bounds are
based on the fundamental solution of the linear problem (the so-called
Aronson's Green function). Having thus sandwiched the long-time asymptotics of
solutions to the non-linear problems between two fundamental solutions of the
linear problem, we prove that, unlike the case of degenerate diffusion, a
non-degenerate diffusion equation's solution converges onto the linear
diffusion solution at long times. Select numerical examples support the
mathematical theorems and illustrate the convergence process. Our results have
implications on how to interpret asymptotic scalings of potentially anomalous

rely on source categories to learn features discriminative for the target, we
propose a novel neighborhood clustering technique to learn the structure of the
target domain in a self-supervised way. Second, we use entropy-based feature
alignment and rejection to align target features with the source, or reject
them as unknown categories based on their entropy. We show through extensive

Problem (SVP). In this paper, we present new algorithms that improve the
state-of-the-art for provable classical/quantum algorithms for SVP. We present
the following results. $\bullet$ A new algorithm for SVP that provides a smooth
tradeoff between time complexity and memory requirement. For any positive
integer $4\leq q\leq \sqrt{n}$, our algorithm takes $q^{13n+o(n)}$ time and
requires $poly(n)\cdot q^{16n/q^2}$ memory. This tradeoff which ranges from
enumeration ($q=\sqrt{n}$) to sieving ($q$ constant), is a consequence of a new
time-memory tradeoff for Discrete Gaussian sampling above the smoothing
parameter.
  $\bullet$ A quantum algorithm for SVP that runs in time $2^{0.950n+o(n)}$ and
requires $2^{0.5n+o(n)}$ classical memory and poly(n) qubits. In Quantum Random
Access Memory (QRAM) model this algorithm takes only $2^{0.835n+o(n)}$ time and
requires a QRAM of size $2^{0.293n+o(n)}$, poly(n) qubits and $2^{0.5n}$
classical space. This improves over the previously fastest classical (which is
also the fastest quantum) algorithm due to [ADRS15] that has a time and space
complexity $2^{n+o(n)}$.
  $\bullet$ A classical algorithm for SVP that runs in time $2^{1.669n+o(n)}$
time and $2^{0.5n+o(n)}$ space. This improves over an algorithm of [CCL18] that
has the same space complexity.
  The time complexity of our classical and quantum algorithms are obtained
using a known upper bound on a quantity related to the lattice kissing number
which is $2^{0.402n}$. We conjecture that for most lattices this quantity is a
$2^{o(n)}$. Assuming that this is the case, our classical algorithm runs in
time $2^{1.292n+o(n)}$, our quantum algorithm runs in time $2^{0.750n+o(n)}$
and our quantum algorithm in QRAM model runs in time $2^{0.667n+o(n)}$.

shown strong few-shot performance in supervised and reinforcement learning
settings. However, specifically in the case of meta-reinforcement learning
(meta-RL), we can show that gradient-based meta-learners are sensitive to task
distributions. With the wrong curriculum, agents suffer the effects of
meta-overfitting, shallow adaptation, and adaptation instability. In this work,
we begin by highlighting intriguing failure cases of gradient-based meta-RL and
show that task distributions can wildly affect algorithmic outputs, stability,
and performance. To address this problem, we leverage insights from recent
literature on domain randomization and propose meta Active Domain Randomization
(meta-ADR), which learns a curriculum of tasks for gradient-based meta-RL in a
similar as ADR does for sim2real transfer. We show that this approach induces
more stable policies on a variety of simulated locomotion and navigation tasks.
We assess in- and out-of-distribution generalization and find that the learned
task distributions, even in an unstructured task space, greatly improve the
adaptation performance of MAML. Finally, we motivate the need for better
benchmarking in meta-RL that prioritizes \textit{generalization} over
single-task adaption performance.

toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks. The evolving
nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as
capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of
time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving
topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal
as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the
temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate
temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature
interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block
and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical
Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network
recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively
infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The
proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task,
and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We
evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal
settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares
favorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph
embedding approaches.

scalar-valued nonlinear function that appears in uncertain systems governed by
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By employing an infinite-dimensional
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as the hypothesis space, the nonlinear
estimation problem in finite-dimensional Euclidean space is recast into that of
constructing a linear observer in the infinite-dimensional RKHS. The analysis
of convergence is facilitated by the introduction of a novel condition of
partial persistent excitation (partial PE), which is defined for a subspace of
the RKHS. Using this condition, we prove that the projection of the function
estimation error onto the PE subspace converges in norm asymptotically to zero.
While this is an abstract notion of convergence that depends implicitly on the
kernel used to define the RKHS, we derive conditions that ensure the pointwise
convergence of the function estimates over the PE subset. This paper
additionally introduces a weaker but geometrically intuitive notion of a
partial PE condition, one that resembles PE conditions as they have been
formulated historically in Euclidean spaces. Sufficient conditions are derived
that describe when the two conditions are equivalent. Finally, qualitative
properties of the convergence proofs derived in the paper are illustrated with
numerical simulations.

interest that are commonly held in practice. In particular, it generally
encounters difficulty when there is a lack of such beliefs over some or all the

put forward called integrated organic inference that is based on a fusion of
Fisherian and Bayesian reasoning. Depending on the pre-data knowledge that is
held about any given model parameter, inferences are made about the parameter
conditional on all other parameters using one of three methods of inference,
namely organic fiducial inference, bispatial inference and Bayesian inference.
The full conditional post-data densities that result from doing this are then
combined using a framework that allows a joint post-data density for all the
parameters to be sensibly formed without requiring these full conditional
densities to be compatible. Various examples of the application of this theory
are presented. Finally, the theory is defended against possible criticisms

to physical solutions for the metric even for positive potentials; solutions
are unique for a given configuration only up to a branch choice; solutions on
one branch can apparently end at nonsingular points of the metric and their
continuation on alternate branches lead to nonsingular bouncing solutions;
unitary gauge perturbations can go unstable even when degenerate terms in the
Lagrangian are infinitesimal. The attractor solution leads to an inflationary
scenario where slow-roll parameters vary and running of the tilt can be large
even with no explicit features in the potential far from the end of inflation,
requiring the optimized slow-roll approach for predicting observables.

performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks. The results
revealed the positive impact of familiarization tours on trust, takeover, and
handback performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only
improved when practice was presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of
exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups
converged to those of the high fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a)
experiencing automation failures during the training may reduce costs
associated with first failures in highly automated driving; b) the VR tour with

as sympathetic eruption. Studies on sympathetic eruptions are not uncommon.
However, in the existed reports, the causal links between sympathetic eruptions
remain rather speculative. In this work, we present detailed observations of a
sympathetic filament eruption event, where an identifiable causal link between
two eruptive filaments is observed. On 2015 November 15, two filaments (F1 in
the north and F2 in the south) were located at the southwestern quadrant of
solar disk. The main axes of them were almost parallel to each other. Around
22:20 UT, F1 began to erupt, forming two flare ribbons. The southwestern ribbon
apparently moved to southwest and intruded southeast part of F2. This
continuous intrusion caused F2's eventual eruption. Accompanying the eruption
of F2, flare ribbons and post-flare loops appeared in northwest region of F2.
Meanwhile, neither flare ribbons nor post-flare loops could be observed in
southeastern area of F2. In addition, the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolations show that the magnetic fields above F2 in the southeast region
are much weaker than that in the northwest region. These results imply that the
overlying magnetic fields of F2 were not uniform. So we propose that the
southwest ribbon formed by eruptive F1 invaded F2 from its southeast region
with relatively weaker overlying magnetic fields in comparison with its
northwest region, disturbing F2 and leading F2 to erupt eventually.

a precursor to the enhancement of the strength of exchange disorder via the
spin-lattice coupling, which causes the spin freezing. In contrast to the
magnetic-field-suppressed Curie-type softening in the bulk modulus, the
trigonal shear modulus exhibits softening with a characteristic minimum upon
cooling, which is enhanced by the magnetic field at temperatures below $\sim$20

suggests a coupling of the lattice to the dynamical spin-cluster state. For

However, it is just a metric changing linearly with time and irrelevant of
context-awareness. We propose a context-based metric, named as Urgency of
Information (UoI), to measure the nonlinear time-varying importance and the
non-uniform context-dependence of the status information. This paper first
establishes a theoretical framework for UoI characterization and then provides
UoI-optimal status updating and user scheduling schemes in both single-terminal
and multi-terminal cases. Specifically, an update-index-based scheme is
proposed for a single-terminal system, where the terminal always updates and
transmits when its update index is larger than a threshold. For the
multi-terminal case, the UoI of the proposed scheduling scheme is proven to be
upper-bounded and its decentralized implementation by Carrier Sensing Multiple
Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is also provided. In the simulations,
the proposed updating and scheduling schemes notably outperform the existing

registering two partial point sets of the same object with very limited

to the plane of symmetry, we can largely increase the overlap between the sets
and therefore boost the registration process. However, prior knowledge about
the plane of symmetry is generally unavailable or at least very hard to find,
especially with limited partial views, and finding this plane could strongly
benefit from a prior alignment of the partial point sets. We solve this
chicken-and-egg problem by jointly optimizing the relative pose and symmetry
plane parameters, and notably do so under global optimality by employing the
branch-and-bound (BnB) paradigm. Our results demonstrate a great improvement

problems. With the same setting, DNNs however learn a relative smooth solution
regardless of the dimension, this is, DNNs implicitly bias towards functions
with more low-frequency components among all functions that can fit the

  Zha","Beyond Clicks: Modeling Multi-Relational Item Graph for Session-Based
  Target Behavior Prediction","Short paper with 7 pages, WWW'2020",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Session-based target behavior prediction aims to predict the next item to be
interacted with specific behavior types (e.g., clicking). Although existing
methods for session-based behavior prediction leverage powerful representation
learning approaches to encode items' sequential relevance in a low-dimensional
space, they suffer from several limitations. Firstly, they focus on only
utilizing the same type of user behavior for prediction, but ignore the
potential of taking other behavior data as auxiliary information. This is
particularly crucial when the target behavior is sparse but important (e.g.,
buying or sharing an item). Secondly, item-to-item relations are modeled
separately and locally in one behavior sequence, and they lack a principled way
to globally encode these relations more effectively. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel Multi-relational Graph Neural Network model for
Session-based target behavior Prediction, namely MGNN-SPred for short.
Specifically, we build a Multi-Relational Item Graph (MRIG) based on all
behavior sequences from all sessions, involving target and auxiliary behavior
types. Based on MRIG, MGNN-SPred learns global item-to-item relations and
further obtains user preferences w.r.t. current target and auxiliary behavior
sequences, respectively. In the end, MGNN-SPred leverages a gating mechanism to
adaptively fuse user representations for predicting next item interacted with
target behavior. The extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of MGNN-SPred by comparing with state-of-the-art
session-based prediction methods, validating the benefits of leveraging
auxiliary behavior and learning item-to-item relations over MRIG.

relative counts of items and hierarchical elimination, along with a new PAC

through polarization measurements or using the velocity gradient technique. We
show the advantages that our techniques have compared to the traditional

from observations. The first technique that we describe in detail employs
structure functions of velocity centroids and structure functions of Stokes
parameters. We provide analytical expressions for obtaining magnetic field
strength from observational data. We successfully test our results using
synthetic observations obtained with results of MHD turbulence simulations. We
measure velocity and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales using two,
three and four point structure functions and compare the performance of these
tools. We show that, unlike the DCF, our technique is capable of providing the
detailed distribution of POS magnetic field and it can measure magnetic field
strength in the presence of both velocity and magnetic field distortions
arising from external shear and self-gravity. The second technique applies the
velocity gradient technique to velocity channel maps in order to obtain the
Alfven Mach number and uses the amplitudes of the gradients to obtain the sonic
Mach number. The ratio of these two Mach numbers provides the intensity of
magnetic field in the region contributing to the emission in the channel map.

(orbital) period--luminosity relations (PLRs), combined with the well-defined
mass--luminosity relation for the systems' primary stars and assuming solar
metallicity, we calculated the objects' masses, radii, and luminosities. Our
sample of fully eclipsing CBs contains 1530 W-, 710 A-, and 95 B-type CBs. A
comparison with literature data and with the results from different surveys
confirms the accuracy and coherence of our measurements. The period
distributions of the various CB subtypes are different, hinting at a possible
evolutionary sequence. W-type CBs are clearly located in a strip in the total
mass versus mass ratio plane, while A-type CBs may exhibit a slightly different
dependence. There are no significant differences among the PLRs of A- and
W-type CBs, but the PLR zero points are affected by their mass ratios and
fill-out factors. Determination of zero-point differences for different types
of CBs may help us improve the accuracy of the resulting PLRs. We demonstrate

power system operations and planning, but it is generally hard to solve due to
its nonconvex and large-scale nature. This paper proposes a scalable
decomposition approach in which the power network is decomposed into a master
network and a number of subnetworks, where each network has its own AC-OPF
subproblem. This formulates a two-stage optimization problem and requires only
a small amount of communication between the master and subnetworks. The key
contribution is a smoothing technique that renders the response of a subnetwork
differentiable with respect to the input from the master problem, utilizing
properties of the barrier problem formulation that naturally arises when
subproblems are solved by a primal-dual interior-point algorithm. Consequently,
existing efficient nonlinear programming solvers can be used for both the
master problem and the subproblems. The advantage of this framework is that
speedup can be obtained by processing the subnetworks in parallel, and it has
convergence guarantees under reasonable assumptions. The formulation is readily
extended to instances with stochastic subnetwork loads. Numerical results show
favorable performance and illustrate the scalability of the algorithm which is
able to solve instances with more than 11 million buses.

nanoparticles can greatly improve the direct solar thermal conversion
performance. Considering that the surface plasmon resonance frequency of
metallic nanoparticles, such as gold, silver, and aluminum, is usually located
in the ultraviolet to visible range, the absorption coefficient of a plasmonic
nanofluid must be spectrally tuned for full utilization of the solar radiation
in a broad spectrum. In the present study, a modern design process in the form
of a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to the tailoring of the spectral
absorption coefficient of a plasmonic nanofluid. To do this, the major
components of a conventional GA, such as the gene description, fitness function
for the evaluation, crossover, and mutation function, are modified to be
suitable for the inverse problem of tailoring the spectral absorption
coefficient of a plasmonic nanofluid. By applying the customized GA, we
obtained an optimal combination for a blended nanofluid with the desired
spectral distribution of the absorption coefficient, specifically a uniform
distribution, solar-spectrum-like distribution, and a step-function-like
distribution. The resulting absorption coefficient of the designed plasmonic
nanofluid is in good agreement with the prescribed spectral distribution within
about 10\% to 20\% of error when six types of nanoparticles are blended.
Finally, we also investigate how the inhomogeneous broadening effect caused by
the fabrication uncertainty of the nanoparticles changes their optimal
combination.

Previous analysis of cluster randomized experiments under the Neyman-Rubin

in vision loss, if undetected in early stage. Therefore, diagnosis of glaucoma
in its early stage may prevent further vision loss. In this paper, we propose a
convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for automated glaucoma
diagnosis by employing retinal fundus images. This approach employs transfer
learning technique and local binary pattern (LBP) based data augmentation. In
the proposed approach, we employ Alexnet as a pre-trained CNN model which is
used for transfer learning. Initially, the proposed approach divides the fundus
image dataset into training and testing data. Further, the color fundus images
in training and testing data are separated into red (R), green (G), and blue
(B) channels. Additionally, the LBP-based data augmentation is performed on
training data. Specifically, we compute LPBs for each of the channel. Finally,
the augmented training data is used to train the CNN model via transfer
learning. In testing stage, the R, G, and B channels of test image are fed to
the trained CNN model which generates 3 decisions. We employ a decision level
fusion technique to combine the decisions obtained from the trained CNN model.
The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on the public RIM-ONE
fundus image database, achieves state-of-the-art performance for glaucoma
diagnosis.

tensor field is identified in the study of global conformal diffeomorphisms on
Finsler manifolds as a natural generalization of the Schwarzian derivative.
Then, a natural definition of a Mobius mapping on Finsler manifolds is given
and its properties are studied. In particular, it is shown that Mobius mappings
are mappings that preserve circles and vice versa. Therefore, if a forward
geodesically complete Finsler manifold admits a Mobius mapping, then the
indicatrix is conformally diffeomorphic to the Euclidean sphere $ S^{n-1}$ in $

formation of supermassive BHs. Here we reinvestigate the gaseous dynamical
friction, which was claimed to be inefficient with radiative feedback from BHs
in literature, by performing 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that solve
the flow structure in the vicinity of BHs. We consider a $10^4~M_\odot$ BH
moving at the velocity $V_{\rm flow}$ through the homogeneous medium with
metallicity $Z$ in the range of $0-0.1~Z_\odot$ and density $n_{\infty}$. We
show that, if $n_{\infty} \lesssim 10^{6}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and $V_{\rm flow}
\lesssim 60~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the BH is accelerated forward because of the
gravitational pull from a dense shell ahead of an ionized bubble around the BH,
regardless of the value of $Z$. If $n_{\infty} \gtrsim 10^{6}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$,
however, our simulation shows the opposite result. The ionized bubble and
associating shell temporarily appear, but immediately go downstream with
significant ram pressure of the flow. They eventually converge into a massive
downstream wake, which gravitationally drags the BH backward. The BH
decelerates over the timescale of $\sim 0.01$~Myr, much shorter than the
dynamical timescale in galactic disks. Our results suggest that IMBHs that
encounter the dense clouds rapidly migrate toward galactic centers, where they
possibly coalescence with others.

long-term seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals. In the
formulation of our developed AME learning approach, the original tourist

volatility components. Then, the ARIMA is used to forecast the trend component,
the SARIMA is used to forecast seasonal component with a 12-month cycle, while
the LSSVR is used to forecast remainder volatility components. Finally, the
forecasting results of the three components are aggregated to generate an
ensemble forecasting of tourist arrivals by the LSSVR based nonlinear ensemble
approach. Furthermore, a direct strategy is used to implement multi-step-ahead
forecasting. Taking two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test, the
empirical results demonstrate that our proposed AME learning approach can
achieve higher level and directional forecasting accuracy compared with other
benchmarks used in this study, indicating that our proposed approach is a
promising model for forecasting tourist arrivals with high seasonality and
volatility.

have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the

These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated
dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two
aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across
domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs;
and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time
cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State
Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and
slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a
complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive
nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly
reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also
detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain
level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art
joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency
of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art

to the user. In this work, we show that an attacker can launch a data poisoning
attack to a recommender system to make recommendations as the attacker desires
via injecting fake users with carefully crafted user-item interaction data.
Specifically, an attacker can trick a recommender system to recommend a target
item to as many normal users as possible. We focus on matrix factorization
based recommender systems because they have been widely deployed in industry.
Given the number of fake users the attacker can inject, we formulate the
crafting of rating scores for the fake users as an optimization problem.
However, this optimization problem is challenging to solve as it is a
non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop
several techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. For
instance, we leverage influence function to select a subset of normal users who
are influential to the recommendations and solve our formulated optimization
problem based on these influential users. Our results show that our attacks are
effective and outperform existing methods.

observability of the environment. While in this setting, each agent's
experience may be inconsistent with each other, which may cause the inaccuracy
and oscillation of the option-value's estimation. Therefore, we propose a novel
option learning algorithm, the successor representation option learning to
solve it by decoupling the environment dynamics from rewards and learning the
option-value under each agent's preference. MAPTF can be easily combined with
existing deep RL and MARL approaches, and experimental results show it
significantly boosts the performance of existing methods in both discrete and
continuous state spaces.

consists of a white dwarf and a main sequence K7 star with clear signs of
chromospheric and spot activity. The light curve of this system shows
$\sim0.2$mag ellipsoidal variability with a period of 0.297549d and a short
total eclipse of the white dwarf. Based on our analysis of the spectral and
photometric data, we estimated the parameters of the system. The K7V star is
tidally deformed but does not fill its Roche lobe (the filling factor is about
0.86). The orbital inclination is $i=73^\circ.1\pm 0^\circ.2$, the mass ratio
is $q=M_2/M_1\approx 0.88$. The parameters of the K7V star are $M_2\approx
0.64$M$_{\odot}$, $R_2=0.645\pm 0.012$R$_{\odot}$, $T_2\approx 4070$K. The
parameters of the white dwarf are $M_1\approx 0.72$M$_{\odot}$, $R_1=0.013\pm
0.003$R$_{\odot}$, $T_1=8700\pm 1100$K. Photometric observations in different
bands revealed that the maximum depth of the eclipse is in the \textit{SDSS r}
filter, which is unusual for a system of a white dwarf and a late main sequence
star. We suspect that this system is a product of the evolution of a common
envelope binary star, and that the white dwarf accretes the stellar wind from
the secondary star (the so-called low-accretion rate polar, LARP).

corresponding to each movie clip to recognize 7 emotions, i.e., Anger, Disgust,
Fear, Happy, Surprise, Sad and Neutral. Overall, 24 observers participated in
our collection of the training set, including 19 observers who participated in
only one session watching 80 videos from 7 classes and 5 observers who
participated multiple times and watched all the videos. All videos were
presented in an order balanced fashion. Leave-one-observer-out was employed in
this classification task. We report the classification accuracy of our
baseline, a three-layer network, on this initial training set while training
with signals from all participants, only single participants and only multiple

dataset by arousal or valence, which achieves 68.66% and 72.72% separately.
Finally, we provide a two-step network. The first step is to classify the
features into high/low arousal or positive/negative valence by a network. Then
the arousal/valence middle output of the first step is concatenated with
feature sets as input of the second step for emotion recognition. We found that
adding arousal or valence information can help to improve the classification

Based on this interpretation, we carried out N-body simulations to investigate
orbital evolution of planets within the protoplanetary disk and after the disk
dispersal. Before the disk dispersal, our N-body simulations include both
migration and mass-growth of the planet coupled with evolution of the disk. By
varying the disk parameters, we produce a variety of widely-separated planetary
systems consisting of three super-Jupiters at the end of disk dispersal. We
found the outer planet is more massive than the inner one, and the migration of
the innermost planet is inefficient due to the accretion of outer planet(s). We
also showed how the final configuration and the final planetary mass depend on
disk parameters. The migration is found to be convergent and no planet-pair has

merger-formed massive BH speeds with typical escape velocities from globular
and nuclear clusters. We show that a globular cluster is highly unlikely to
form and retain a 100 Msun BH if the spin of the BH is low (a<0.3) as such BHs
acquire high recoil speeds (>200 km/s) that exceed typical escape speeds from
globular clusters (50 km/s). However, a very low-spinning (a=0.1) and massive
(100 Msun) BH could be formed and retained in a galactic nuclear star cluster.
Even though such massive merger-formed BHs with such low spins acquire high
speeds during formation (400 km/s), they may avoid ejection since massive
nuclear clusters have high escape velocities (300-500 km/s). A future detection
of a massive BH in the pair-instability mass gap with low spin would therefore
not be proof of the existence of primordial BHs, which are sometimes claimed to
have low spins and arbitrarily high masses.

one Boolean equation from the system. The Boolean equation assigned at any
particular node is a {\em private} equation known to this node only, and the
nodes aim to compute the exact set of solutions to the system without
exchanging their local equations. We show that each private Boolean equation
can be locally lifted to a linear algebraic equation under a basis of Boolean
vectors, leading to a network linear equation that is distributedly solvable
using existing distributed linear equation algorithms as a subroutine. A number
of exact or approximate solutions to the induced linear equation are then
computed at each node from different initial values. The solutions to the
original Boolean equations are eventually computed locally via a Boolean vector
search algorithm. We prove that given solvable Boolean equations, when the
initial values of the nodes for the distributed linear equation solving step
are i.i.d selected according to a uniform distribution in a high-dimensional
cube, our algorithms return the exact solution set of the Boolean equations at
each node with high probability. Furthermore, we present an algorithm for
distributed verification of the satisfiability of Boolean equations, and prove
its correctness. Finally, we show that by utilizing linear equation solvers
with differential privacy to replace the in-network computing routines, the
overall distributed Boolean equation algorithms can be made differentially
private. Under the standard Laplace mechanism, we prove an explicit level of
noises that can be injected in the linear equation steps for ensuring a
prescribed level of differential privacy.

meaning the inability of the quantum walker to completely escape from its

dependent on the dimension and the explicit form of the local coin. A four
state discrete-time quantum walk on a square lattice is defined by its unitary
coin operator, acting on the four dimensional coin Hilbert space. The well
known example of the Grover coin leads to a partial trapping, i.e., there
exists some escaping initial state for which the probability of staying at the

exhibit strong trapping, where such escaping state does not exist. We present a
systematic study of coins leading to trapping, explicitly construct all such

the planet, we find a much larger radius uncertainty of 3.6%. This is due to a
degeneracy between the transit radius ratio, the limb-darkening, and the impact
parameter caused by the inability to constrain the transit impact parameter in
the presence of stellar variability. We find that surface brightness
inhomogeneity due to photospheric granulation contributes a lower limit of only
2 ppm to the photometry in-transit. The radius uncertainty due to granulation
and oscillations, combined with the degeneracy with the transit impact
parameter, accounts for a significant fraction of the error budget of the PLATO
mission, before detector or observational noise is introduced to the light
curve. If it is possible to constrain the impact parameter or to obtain
follow-up observations at longer wavelengths where limb-darkening is less
significant, this may enable higher precision radius measurements.

is that neutron star matter can continuously be connected to two-flavor
color-superconducting (2SC) phase with an additional condensate of $d$-quarks
in the $^3P_2$ channel. I discuss here two aspects of this novel phase. First,
I introduce the notion of continuity based on the patterns of symmetry breaking

physics mechanism of $d$-quark $^3P_2$ pairing in analogy to nuclear physics.
Our finding serves as the theoretical underpinning for the phenomenological

formation of resonant systems is using hydrodynamical simulations. Usually, the
force (torque) acting on a planet is calculated using the forces from the gas
disc and the star, while the gas accelerations are computed using the pressure
gradient, the star, and the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For the
non-migrating the neglect of the disc gravity results in a consistent torque
calculation while for the migrating case it is inconsistent. We aim to study
how much this inconsistent torque calculation can affect the final
configuration of a two-planet system. Our focus will be on low-mass planets
because most of the multi-planetary systems, discovered by the Kepler survey,
have masses around 10 Earth masses. Performing hydrodynamical simulations of
planet-disc interaction, we measure the torques on non-migrating and migrating
planets for various disc masses as well as density and temperature slopes with
and without considering the disc self-gravity. Using this data, we find a
relation that quantifies the inconsistency, use it in an N-body code, and
perform an extended parameter study modelling the migration of a planetary
system with different planet mass ratios and disc surface densities, in order
to investigate the impact of the torque inconsistency on the architecture of
the planetary system. Not considering disc self-gravity produces an
artificially larger torque on the migrating planet that can result in tighter
planetary systems. The deviation of this torque from the correct value is
larger in discs with steeper surface density profiles. In hydrodynamical
modelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial to account for the torque
correction, otherwise the results favour more packed systems.

four-photon detection of Kelu-1, J0331-27 is only the second L dwarf detected
in X-rays, and much more distant than other ultracool dwarfs with X-ray
detections (photometric distance of 240 pc). From an optical spectrum with the
VIMOS instrument at the VLT, we determine the spectral type of J0331-27 to be
L1. The X-ray flare has an energy of E_X,F ~ 2x10^33 erg, placing it in the
regime of superflares. No quiescent emission is detected, and from 2.5 Msec of
XMM data we derive an upper limit of L_X,qui < 10^27 erg/s. The flare peak
luminosity L_X,peak = 6.3x10^29 erg/s, flare duration tau_decay ~ 2400 s, and
plasma temperature (~16 MK) are similar to values observed in X-ray flares of M
dwarfs. This shows that strong magnetic reconnection events and the ensuing
plasma heating are still present even in objects with photospheres as cool as
~2100 K. However, the absence of any other flares above the detection threshold
of E_X,F ~2.5x10^32 erg in a total of ~2.5 Ms of X-ray data yields a flare
energy number distribution inconsistent with the canonical power law dN/dE ~
E^-2, suggesting that magnetic energy release in J0331-27 -- and possibly in
all L dwarfs -- takes place predominantly in the form of giant flares.

induces a softening of the phonon frequency. Overall, the variation of in-plane
strain from -0.36% to +0.48% yields the decrease of the phonon frequency from
409.6 cm-1 to 377.5 cm-1 which occurs due to the ~1% change of the inter-atomic
distances. The magnetic exchange -driven phonon splitting Delta(W) in three

increases on cooling in NiO relaxed film as in the previously published work on

changes. Consequently, to our knowledge none of them is ideal for scenarios in
which (i) query processing must be done in realtime, and (ii) the underlying
graph G is massive, with frequent updates.
  Motivated by this, we propose SimPush, a novel algorithm that answers single
source SimRank queries without any pre-computation, and at the same time
achieves significantly higher query processing speed than even the fastest
known index-based solutions. Further, SimPush provides rigorous result quality
guarantees, and its high performance does not rely on any strong assumption of

employs a radically different algorithmic design that focuses on (i)
identifying a small number of nodes relevant to the query, and subsequently
(ii) computing statistics and performing residue push from these nodes only.
  We prove the correctness of SimPush, analyze its time complexity, and compare
its asymptotic performance with that of existing methods. Meanwhile, we
evaluate the practical performance of SimPush through extensive experiments on

years ago. Research shows that malleability improves system performance, but
its utilization in HPC never became widespread. The causes are the difficulty
in developing malleable applications, and the lack of support and integration
of the different layers of the HPC software stack. However, in the last years,
malleability in job scheduling is becoming more critical because of the
increasing complexity of hardware and workloads. In this context, using nodes
in an exclusive mode is not always the most efficient solution as in
traditional HPC jobs, where applications were highly tuned for static
allocations, but offering zero flexibility to dynamic executions. This paper
proposes a new holistic, dynamic job scheduling policy, Slowdown Driven
(SD-Policy), which exploits the malleability of applications as the key
technology to reduce the average slowdown and response time of jobs. SD-Policy
is based on backfill and node sharing. It applies malleability to running jobs
to make room for jobs that will run with a reduced set of resources, only when
the estimated slowdown improves over the static approach. We implemented
SD-Policy in SLURM and evaluated it in a real production environment, and with
a simulator using workloads of up to 198K jobs. Results show better resource
utilization with the reduction of makespan, response time, slowdown, and energy

investment costs. In this paper, two swarm-based meta-heuristic algorithms,
particle swarm optimization (PSO) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) were
developed to solve optimal placement and sizing of DG units in the quest for
transmission network planning. A supportive technique, loss sensitivity factors
(LSF) was used to identify potential buses for optimal location of DG units.
The feasibility of the algorithms was confirmed on two IEEE bus test systems

solutions and they outperform each other in different metrics. The WOA real

offer unique properties due to spin-orbit coupling and symmetry breaking,
yielding effects such as exchange bias, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,
spin-pumping, spin-transfer torques, conversion between charge and spin
currents and vice-versa. These interfacial phenomena play crucial roles for
magnetic data storage and transfer applications, which require forming FM
nano-structures embedded in non-ferromagnetic matrices. Here, we investigate
the possiblity of creating such nano-structures by ion-irradiation. We study
the effect of lateral confinement on the ion-irradiation-induced reduction of
non-magnetic metal oxides (e.g., antiferro- or paramagnetic) to form
ferromagnetic metals. Our findings are later exploited to form 3-dimensional
magnetic interfaces between Co, CoO and Pt by spatially-selective irradiation
of CoO/Pt multilayers. We demonstrate that the mechanical displacement of the O
atoms plays a crucial role during the reduction from insulating,
non-ferromagnetic cobalt oxides to metallic cobalt. Metallic cobalt yields both
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the generated Co/Pt nano-structures, and,
at low temperatures, exchange bias at vertical interfaces between Co and CoO.
If pushed to the limit of ion-irradiation technology, this approach could, in
principle, enable the creation of densely-packed, atomic scale ferromagnetic
point-contact spin-torque oscillator (STO) networks, or conductive channels for
current-confined-path based current perpendicular-to-plane giant
magnetoresistance read-heads.

solutions of the generalized Dirichlet problem for open sets by the
Perron-Wiener-Brelot method using only harmonic upper and lower functions.
  In this note it is shown that, by elementary ""metric"" considerations and
without using any potential theory, such results can be obtained for general

predicted recently and a few of these predicted structures have already been
successfully fabricated. Herein, by using first-principles calculations we
investigated the effects of rippling a PC monolayer, one of the most stable
modifications of layered PC, under large compressive strains. Similar to
phosphorene, layered PC was found to have the extraordinary ability to bend and
form ripples with large curvatures under a sufficiently large strain applied
along its armchair direction. The band gap size, workfunction, and Young's
modulus of rippled PC monolayer are predicted to be highly tunable by strain
engineering. Moreover, a direct-indirect band gap transition is observed under
the compressive strains in a range from 6 to 11%. Another important feature of
PC monolayer rippled along the armchair direction is the possibility of its
rolling to a PC nanotube (PCNT) under extreme compressive strains. These tubes
of different sizes exhibit high thermal stability, possess a comparably high
Young's modulus, and a well tunable band gap which can vary from 0 to 0.95 eV.
In addition, for both structures, rippled PC and PCNTs, we have explained the
changes in their properties under compressive strain in terms of the
modification of their structural parameters.

to simulate new datasets preserving important data features such as spatial
patterns from observed datasets while using only minimal assumptions. However,
such methods cannot generate extreme events beyond the observed range of data

processes to extrapolate observed data towards yet unobserved high quantiles.
Original data are first enriched with new values in the tail region, and then
classical resampling algorithms are applied to enriched data. In a first
approach to enrichment that we label ""naive resampling"", we generate an
independent sample of the marginal distribution while keeping the rank order of
the observed data. We point out inaccuracies of this approach around the most
extreme values, and therefore develop a second approach that works for datasets
with many replicates. It is based on the asymptotic representation of extreme
events through two stochastically independent components: a magnitude variable,
and a profile field describing spatial variation. To generate enriched data, we
fix a target range of return levels of the magnitude variable, and we resample
magnitudes constrained to this range. We then use the second approach to
generate heatwave scenarios of yet unobserved magnitude over France, based on
daily temperature reanalysis training data for the years 2010 to 2016.

there exist strong pairwise relations between pixels in natural images, which
can be utilized to propagate the sparse map to a much denser one. In this
paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to learn such pairwise relations,
which consists of two branches, a unary segmentation network which learns the
label probabilities for each pixel, and a pairwise affinity network which
learns affinity matrix and refines the probability map generated from the unary
network. The refined results by the pairwise network are then used as
supervision to train the unary network, and the procedures are conducted
iteratively to obtain better segmentation progressively. To learn reliable
pixel affinity without accurate annotation, we also propose to mine confident
regions. We show that iteratively training this framework is equivalent to
optimizing an energy function with convergence to a local minimum. Experimental

financial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten
years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm
which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and
security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this
ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is
supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and
price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on
DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem
with a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020.
  First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design
to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market
share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the
minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel
strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed
the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the
need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack
details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack
vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi
lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we
develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol,
focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol
solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a
lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized
within 19 days.

in the context of consensus protocols. Originally proposed for powering the
Stellar payment network, FBASs can instantiate Byzantine quorum systems without
requiring out-of-band agreement on a common set of validators; every node is
free to decide for itself with whom it requires agreement. Sybil-resistant and
yet energy-efficient consensus protocols can therefore be built upon FBASs, and
the ""decentrality"" possible with the FBAS paradigm might be sufficient to
reduce the use of environmentally unsustainable proof-of-work protocols. In
this paper, we first demonstrate how the robustness of individual FBASs can be
determined, by precisely determining their safety and liveness buffers and
therefore enabling a comparison with threshold-based quorum systems. Using
simulations and example node configuration strategies, we then empirically
investigate the hypothesis that while FBASs can be bootstrapped in a bottom-up
fashion from individual preferences, strategic considerations should
additionally be applied by node operators in order to arrive at FBASs that are
robust and amenable to monitoring. Finally, we investigate the reported
""open-membership"" property of FBASs. We observe that an often small group of
nodes is exclusively relevant for determining liveness buffers and prove that
membership in this top tier is conditional on the approval by current top tier
nodes if maintaining safety is a core requirement.

state-of-the-art query engines for federated query processing over Semantic

paper, we present query optimization techniques guided by heuristics that take
the physical design of a Data Lake into account. The heuristics are implemented
on top of Ontario, a SPARQL query engine for Semantic Data Lakes. Using
source-specific heuristics, the query engine is able to generate more efficient
query execution plans by exploiting the knowledge about indexes and
normalization in relational databases. We show that heuristics which take the

spatial fluctuations $\delta\lambda(r)$ of the Cooper attraction constant. When
strength of fluctuations $\delta\lambda(r)$ exceeds some critical magnitude,
usual mean-field-like scenario of the q-SMT breaks down due to spontaneous
formation of local droplets of superconducting phase. The density of these
droplets grows exponentially with the increase of average attraction constant
$\lambda$. Interaction between the droplet's order parameters is due to
proximity effect via normal metal and scales with distance $\propto 1/r^\beta$
, with $2 < \beta \le 3$. We account for this interaction by means of a
real-space strong-disorder renormalization group (RG). Near the q-SMT the RG
flow is, formally, a dual equivalent of the Kosterlitz-Thouless RG. The
corresponding line of fixed points describes a Griffiths phase of a metal with
large fractal clusters of superconducting islands. Typical number of islands in
a cluster grows as $N_\delta \sim 1/\delta$, where $0 < \delta \ll 1 $ is the
distance to the critical point. Superconducting side is described by a runaway
of RG trajectories into the strong-coupling region. Close to the transition
point on the SC side, $0<-\delta \ll 1$, RG trajectories possess an extremum as
function of the RG parameter $|\delta|^{1/2} \ln(1/T\tau)$. It results in a
wide temperature range where physical properties are nearly $T$-independent.

which enable subject-matter (epidemiological) interpretation of such data
whether with uncorrelated or correlated predictors. To this end, response
functions should include not only terms linear in predictors but also higher
order ones (e.g. quadratic and cross terms). For epidemiological interpretation
of a regression model, the suggestion is to construct conditional functions
derived from the general regression function with the values of all predictor
variables held fixed excepting one predictor. Unlike the conventional
techniques based on linear-predictor models in which the coefficient at any
variable is interpreted, our approach proposes to interpret this conditional
function, which is multivariate for any predictor being dependent on the values
of all the other predictors. It is such functions that can describe
relationships between Y and a predictor that have different forms in different
predictor domains. The paper discusses differences in the interpretation of the
proposed conditional functions between cases involving correlated and

point assists a mobile device (MD) to execute an application consisting of
multiple tasks following a general task call graph. The objective is to jointly
determine the offloading decision of each task and the resource allocation
under time-varying wireless fading channels and stochastic edge computing
capability, so that the energy-time cost (ETC) of the MD is minimized. Solving
the problem is particularly hard due to the combinatorial offloading decisions
and the strong coupling among task executions under the general dependency
model. Conventional numerical optimization methods are inefficient to solve
such a problem, especially when the problem size is large. To address the
issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the
actor-critic learning structure. In particular, the actor network utilizes a
DNN to learn the optimal mapping from the input states to the binary offloading
decision of each task. Meanwhile, by analyzing the structure of the optimal
solution, we derive a low-complexity algorithm for the critic network to
quickly evaluate the ETC performance of the offloading decisions output by the
actor network. With the low-complexity critic network, we can quickly select
the best offloading action and subsequently store the state-action pair in an
experience replay memory as the training dataset to continuously improve the
action generation DNN. To further reduce the complexity, we show that the
optimal offloading decision exhibits an one-climb structure, which can be
utilized to significantly reduce the search space of action generation.
Numerical results show that for various types of task graphs, the proposed
algorithm achieves up to $99.1\%$ of the optimal performance while
significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to the existing
optimization methods.

intractable but sampling is possible, are ubiquitous in the natural sciences.
The models typically have free parameters that need to be inferred from data

the experiments so that the collected data are most useful. The field of
Bayesian experimental design advocates that, ideally, we should choose designs
that maximise the mutual information (MI) between the data and the parameters.
For implicit models, however, this approach is severely hampered by the high
computational cost of computing posteriors and maximising MI, in particular
when we have more than a handful of design variables to optimise. In this
paper, we propose a new approach to Bayesian experimental design for implicit
models that leverages recent advances in neural MI estimation to deal with
these issues. We show that training a neural network to maximise a lower bound
on MI allows us to jointly determine the optimal design and the posterior.
Simulation studies illustrate that this gracefully extends Bayesian
experimental design for implicit models to higher design dimensions.

This paper addresses this problem by proposing two comprehensive,

future algorithmic developments into well-defined categories, considering two
different criteria: the source of inspiration and the behavior of each

From our analysis we conclude that a poor relationship is often found between

similarities in terms of behavior between different algorithms are greater than
what is claimed in their public disclosure: specifically, we show that more
than one-third of the reviewed bio-inspired solvers are versions of classical

a precision that is limited not only by sensing noise, but additionally by the

estimation in the presence of both motility and sensing noise. We introduce a
minimal model of a stationary chemotactic agent in the plane subject to
rotational diffusion, which uses Bayesian estimation to optimally infer a
gradient direction from noisy concentration measurements. Contrary to the known
case of gradient sensing by temporal comparison, we show that for spatial
comparison, the ultimate precision of gradient sensing scales not with the
rotational diffusion time, but with its square-root. To achieve this precision,
an individual agent needs to know its own rotational diffusion coefficient.
This agent can accurately estimate the expected variability within an ensemble
of agents. If an agent, however, does not account for its own motility noise,
Bayesian estimation fails in a characteristic manner.

1,~0 < i < N$ cannot transmit together. We develop new throughput-optimal
scheduling policies requiring only the empty-nonempty state of each queue that
we term Queue Nonemptiness-Based (QNB) policies. We propose a Policy Splicing
technique to combine scheduling policies for small networks in order to
construct throughput-optimal policies for larger networks, some of which also
aim for low delay. For $N = 3,$ there exists a sum-queue length optimal QNB
scheduling policy. We show, however, that for $N > 4,$ there is no QNB policy
that is sum-queue length optimal over all arrival rate vectors in the capacity
region.
  We then extend our results to a more general class of interference
constraints that we call cluster-of-cliques (CoC) conflict graphs. We consider
two types of CoC networks, namely, Linear Arrays of Cliques (LAoC) and
Star-of-Cliques (SoC) networks. We develop QNB policies for these classes of
networks, study their stability and delay properties, and propose and analyze
techniques to reduce the amount of state information to be disseminated across
the network for scheduling. In the SoC setting, we propose a throughput-optimal
policy that only uses information that nodes in the network can glean by
sensing activity (or lack thereof) on the channel. Our throughput-optimality
results rely on two new arguments: a Lyapunov drift lemma specially adapted to
policies that are queue length-agnostic, and a priority queueing analysis for

fundamental mechanism for generating adaptive innovations, diversity, and
sophisticated features, relatively little effort has been made to quantify
exaptation outside the topic of biological evolution. We think that this
concept provides a useful framework for characterising the emergence of
innovations in science. This article explores the notion that exaptation arises
from the usage of scientific ideas in domains other than the area that they
were originally applied to. In particular, we adopt a normalised entropy and an
inverse participation ratio as observables that reveal and quantify the concept
of exaptation. We identify distinctive patterns of exaptation and expose
specific examples of papers that display those patterns. Our approach

incorporated in future wireless networks, in particular 5G and beyond networks,

techniques, though widely used in terrestrial communication systems, have not
been applied to LEO satellite communication systems. In this paper, we propose
a massive MIMO transmission scheme with full frequency reuse (FFR) for LEO
satellite communication systems and exploit statistical channel state
information (sCSI) to address the difficulty of obtaining instantaneous CSI
(iCSI) at the transmitter. We first establish the massive MIMO channel model
for LEO satellite communications and simplify the transmission designs via
performing Doppler and delay compensations at user terminals (UTs). Then, we
develop the low-complexity sCSI based downlink (DL) precoder and uplink (UL)
receiver in closed-form, aiming to maximize the average
signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ASLNR) and the average
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR), respectively. It is shown that
the DL ASLNRs and UL ASINRs of all UTs reach their upper bounds under some
channel condition. Motivated by this, we propose a space angle based user
grouping (SAUG) algorithm to schedule the served UTs into different groups,
where each group of UTs use the same time and frequency resource. The proposed
algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the lower and upper
bounds of the achievable rate coincide when the number of satellite antennas or
UT groups is sufficiently large. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed massive MIMO transmission scheme with FFR significantly enhances the
data rate of LEO satellite communication systems. Notably, the proposed sCSI
based precoder and receiver achieve the similar performance with the iCSI based
ones that are often infeasible in practice.

2016, L. Qu \cite{Q} proposed a new approach to constructing quadratic planar
functions over $\F_{2^n}$. Very recently, D. Bartoli and M. Timpanella
\cite{Bartoli} characterized the condition on coefficients $a,b$ such that the
function $f_{a,b}(x)=ax^{2^{2m}+1}+bx^{2^m+1} \in\F_{2^{3m}}[x]$ is a planar
function over $\F_{2^{3m}}$ by the Hasse-Weil bound.
  In this paper, using the Lang-Weil bound, a generalization of the Hasse-Weil
bound, and the new approach introduced in \cite{Q}, we completely characterize
the necessary and sufficient conditions on coefficients of four classes of
planar functions over $\F_{q^k}$, where $q=2^m$ with $m$ sufficiently large
(see Theorem \ref{main}). The first and last classes of them are over
$\F_{q^2}$ and $\F_{q^4}$ respectively, while the other two classes are over
$\F_{q^3}$. One class over $\F_{q^3}$ is an extension of $f_{a,b}(x)$
investigated in \cite{Bartoli}, while our proofs seem to be much simpler. In
addition, although the planar binomial over $\F_{q^2}$ of our results is
finally a known planar monomial, we also answer the necessity at the same time
and solve partially an open problem for the binomial case proposed in \cite{Q}.

homotopy type theory. We start by showing that all these types can be
constructed from the groupoid quotient. We define an internal notion of
signatures for HITs, and for each signature, we construct a bicategory of
algebras in 1-types and in groupoids. We continue by proving initial algebra
semantics for our signatures. After that, we show that the groupoid quotient
induces a biadjunction between the bicategories of algebras in 1-types and in
groupoids. Then we construct a biinitial object in the bicategory of algebras
in groupoids, which gives the desired algebra. From all this, we conclude that
all finitary 1-truncated HITs can be constructed from the groupoid quotient.
  We present several examples of HITs which are definable using our notion of
signature. In particular, we show that each signature gives rise to a HIT
corresponding to the freely generated algebraic structure over it. We also
start the development of universal algebra in 1-types. We show that the
bicategory of algebras has PIE limits, i.e. products, inserters and equifiers,
and we prove a version of the first isomorphism theorem for 1-types. Finally,
we give an alternative characterization of the foundamental groups of some
HITs, exploiting our construction of HITs via the groupoid quotient. All the
results are formalized over the UniMath library of univalent mathematics in
Coq.

also long range crystalline deformations dynamically governed by acoustic waves

require detectors for thermal and cold neutrons. Helium-3 has been one of the
main actors in thermal and cold neutron detection for many years. Nowadays
neutron facilities around the world are pushing their technologies to increase
the available flux delivered at the instruments, this enables a completely new
science landscape. Complementary with the increasing available flux, a better
signal-to-background ratio (S/B) enables to perform new types of measurements.
To this aim, this manuscript re-examines the background sensitivity of today's
""gold standard"" neutron detection. Fast neutrons and gamma-rays are the main
background species in neutron scattering experiments. The efficiency
(sensitivity) of detecting fast neutrons, cosmic rays and gamma-rays, for a
Helium-3-based detector is studied here through the comparison with Helium-4
counters. The comparison to Helium-4 allows to separate the thermal (and cold)
neutron to the fast neutron contributions in Helium-3-based counters, which are
otherwise entangled; verifying previous results from an indirect method. A
relatively high sensitivity is found. Moreover, an estimate for the cosmic
neutron fluence, also a source of background, at ground level at ESS is
presented in this manuscript.

fairness for the problem of learning scoring functions from binary labeled

functional nature of the ROC curve, the gold standard measure of ranking
accuracy in this context, leads to several ways of formulating fairness
constraints. We introduce general families of fairness definitions based on the
AUC and on ROC curves, and show that our ROC-based constraints can be
instantiated such that classifiers obtained by thresholding the scoring
function satisfy classification fairness for a desired range of thresholds. We
establish generalization bounds for scoring functions learned under such
constraints, design practical learning algorithms and show the relevance our
approach with numerical experiments on real and synthetic data.

types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer

new objective that we call anchoring, where the learner uses bilevel
optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact
the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are
learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is
approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory

interfacing with dissimilar materials, yet this has proven to be extremely
challenging. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of metallic delafossite
PdCrO2 films by pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE). The fundamental role of the PLE
growth conditions, epitaxial strain, and chemical and structural
characteristics of the substrate is investigated by growing under various
growth conditions and on various types of substrates. While strain plays a
large role in improving the crystallinities, the direct growth of epitaxial
PdCrO2 films without impurity phases was not successful. We attribute this
difficulty to both the chemical and structural dissimilarities between the
substrates and volatile nature of PdO layer, which make nucleation of the right
phase difficult. This difficulty was overcome by growing CuCrO2 buffer layers
before PdCrO2 were grown. Unlike PdCrO2, CuCrO2 films were rather readily grown
with a relatively wide growth window. Only monolayer thick buffer layer was
sufficient to grow the correct PdCrO2 phase. This result indicates that the
epitaxy of Pd-based delafossites is extremely sensitive to the chemistry and
structure of the interface, necessitating near perfect substrate materials. The
resulting films are commensurately strained and show an antiferromagnetic
transition at 40 K that persists down to as thin as 3.6 nm in thickness.

We present a semi-analytical approach for modeling the global structures of a
trans-fast magnetosonic relativistic jet, which should be ejected from a plasma
source nearby a black hole in a funnel region enclosed by dense accreting flow
and also disk corona around the black hole. Our model consistently includes the
inflow and outflow part of the GRMHD solution along the magnetic field lines
penetrating the black hole horizon. After the rotational energy of the black
hole is extracted electromagnetically by the negative energy GRMHD inflow, the
huge electromagnetic energy flux then propagates from the inflow to the outflow
region across the plasma source, and in the outflow region the electromagnetic
energy converts to the fluid kinetic energy. Eventually, the accelerated
outflow must exceed the fast-magnetosonic wave speed. We apply the
semi-analytical trans-fast magnetosonic flow model to the black hole
magnetosphere for both parabolic and split-monopole magnetic field
configurations, and discuss the general flow properties; that is, jet
acceleration, jet magnetization, and the locations of some characteristic
surfaces of the black hole magnetosphere. We have confirmed that, at large
distance, the GRMHD jet solutions are in good agreement with the previously
known trans-fast special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (SRMHD) jet
properties, as expected. The flexibility of the model provides a prompt and

overabundances to the pollution from a former AGB companion, now a white

extrinsic S stars is the overabundance of niobium (Nb) in the latter class. We

share the distinctive features of both intrinsic and extrinsic S stars, namely
the presence of Tc along with a Nb overabundance. BD+79 156 is the first clear
case of a bitrinsic star, i.e. a doubly s-process-enriched object, first
through mass transfer in a binary system, and then through internal
nucleosynthesis (responsible for the Tc-enrichment in BD+79 156 which must
therefore have reached the AGB phase of its evolution). This hybrid nature of
the s-process pattern in BD+79 156 is supported by its binary nature and its
location in the HR diagram just beyond the onset of the third dredge-up on the
AGB. The Tc-rich, binary S-star o1Ori with a WD companion was another
long-standing candidate for a similar hybrid s-process enrichment. However the
marginal overabundance of Nb derived ino1Ori does not allow to trace
unambiguously the evidence of a large pollution coming from the AGB progenitor

such things in the cosmos --- a radically uncertain quantity. Despite this
prior uncertainty, anthropic considerations give rise to Bayesian updates, and
thus predictions. The Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA), a school of anthropic
probability, has previously been used for this purpose. Here, we derive
predictions from the alternative school, the Self-Indication Assumption (SIA),
and point out its features. SIA favors a higher appearance rate of
expansionistic life, but our existence at the present cosmic time means that
such life cannot be too common (else our galaxy would long ago have been
overrun). This combination squeezes our vast prior uncertainty into a few
orders of magnitude. Details of the background cosmology fall out, and we are
left with some stark conclusions. E.g. if the limits to technology allow a
civilization to expand at speed $v$, the probability of at least one expanding
cosmological civilization being visible on our past light cone is
$1-\frac{v^3}{c^3}$. We also show how the SIA estimate can be updated from the

centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large

distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists
of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local
FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to
the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL
model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify
how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle
deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the
performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a
joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the
convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during
convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis
and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication
rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35% compared with the baseline
design.

distribution, including the predicted pair-instability mass gap. These data
require robust quantitative predictions, which are challenging to obtain. The
most massive BH progenitors experience episodic mass ejections on timescales
shorter than the convective turn-over timescale. This invalidates the
steady-state assumption on which the classic mixing-length theory relies. We
compare the final BH masses computed with two different versions of the stellar
evolutionary code \texttt{MESA}: (i) using the default implementation of
\cite{paxton:18} and (ii) solving an additional equation accounting for the
timescale for convective deceleration. In the second grid, where stronger
convection develops during the pulses and carries part of the energy, we find
weaker pulses. This leads to lower amounts of mass being ejected and thus
higher final BH masses of up to $\sim$\,$5\,M_\odot$. The differences are much
smaller for the progenitors which determine the maximum mass of BHs below the
gap. This prediction is robust at $M_{\rm BH, max}\simeq 48\,M_\odot$, at least
within the idealized context of this study. This is an encouraging indication
that current models are robust enough for comparison with the present-day

better understand the fundamental properties of these networks, but many of the
theoretical results proposed have only been for shallow networks. In this
paper, we study an important primitive for understanding the meaningful input
space of a deep network: span recovery. For $k<n$, let $\mathbf{A} \in
\mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ be the innermost weight matrix of an arbitrary feed
forward neural network $M:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, so $M(x)$ can be
written as $M(x) = \sigma(\mathbf{A} x)$, for some network $\sigma:\mathbb{R}^k
\to \mathbb{R}$. The goal is then to recover the row span of $\mathbf{A}$ given
only oracle access to the value of $M(x)$. We show that if $M$ is a
multi-layered network with ReLU activation functions, then partial recovery is
possible: namely, we can provably recover $k/2$ linearly independent vectors in
the row span of $\mathbf{A}$ using poly$(n)$ non-adaptive queries to $M(x)$.
Furthermore, if $M$ has differentiable activation functions, we demonstrate
that full span recovery is possible even when the output is first passed
through a sign or $0/1$ thresholding function; in this case our algorithm is
adaptive. Empirically, we confirm that full span recovery is not always
possible, but only for unrealistically thin layers. For reasonably wide
networks, we obtain full span recovery on both random networks and networks
trained on MNIST data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of span recovery
as an attack by inducing neural networks to misclassify data obfuscated by
controlled random noise as sensical inputs.

processor (ARM Cortex A9) execution latency, the CNN/BCNN FPGA-based hardware
accelerator reduces their latency by over 92%. Compared with non-optimized FPGA
implementations, the proposed optimization method reduces the processing
latency by over 44% for CNN and BCNN. Compared with the GPU implementation, the
latency of CNN implementation with the proposed optimization method is reduced
by 85.49%, while the power consumption is reduced by 86.91%. Although the
latency of BCNN implementation with the proposed optimization method is larger
compared with the GPU implementation, the power consumption is reduced by
86.14%. The FPGA-based neural network hardware accelerators provide a promising
solution for mm-wave RoF systems.

the price of VSTOXX futures through a combination of stochastic processes and
machine learning methods. We formulate a simple and efficient pricing
methodology for VSTOXX futures, which assumes a Heston-type stochastic process
for the underlying EURO STOXX 50 market. Under these dynamics, approximate
analytical formulas for the implied volatility smile and the VSTOXX index have
recently been derived. We use the EURO STOXX 50 option implied volatilities and
the VSTOXX index value to estimate the parameters of this Heston model.
Following the calibration, we calculate theoretical VSTOXX future prices and
compare them to the actual market prices. While theoretical and market prices
are usually in line, we also observe time periods, during which the market
price does not agree with our Heston model. We collect a variety of market
features that could potentially explain the price deviations and calibrate two
machine learning models to the price difference: a regularized linear model and
a random forest. We find that both models indicate a strong influence of
accumulated trader positions on the VSTOXX futures price.

revealed substructures such as gaps and rings, which may indicate forming

within the disk, which can affect a shape of the planet-induced gap. In this
paper, we investigate effects of fast inward migration of the planet on the gap
shape, by carrying out hydrodynamic simulations. We found that when the
migration timescale is shorter than the timescale of the gap-opening, the
orbital radius is shifted inward as compared to the radial location of the gap.
We also found a scaling relation between the radial shift of the locations of
the planet and the gap as a function of the ratio of the timescale of the
migration and gap-opening. Our scaling relation also enables us to constrain
the gas surface density and the viscosity when the gap and the planet are
observed. Moreover, we also found the scaling relation between the location of
the secondary gap and the aspect ratio. By combining the radial shift and the
secondary gap, we may constrain the physical condition of the planet formation
and how the planet evolves in the protoplanetary disk, from the observational
morphology.

scale. The large temperature difference between LNG and water means LNG will
boil violently if spilled onto water. This may cause a physical explosion known
as rapid phase transition (RPT). Since RPT results from a complex interplay
between physical phenomena on several scales, the risk of its occurrence is
difficult to estimate. In this work, we present a combined fluid-dynamic and
thermodynamic model to predict the onset of delayed RPT. On the basis of the
full coupled model, we derive analytical solutions for the location and time of
delayed RPT in an axisymmetric steady-state spill of LNG onto water. These
equations are shown to be accurate when compared to simulation results for a
range of relevant parameters. The relative discrepancy between the analytic
solutions and predictions from the full coupled model is within 2% for the RPT
position and within 8% for the time of RPT. This provides a simple procedure to
quantify the risk of occurrence for delayed RPT for LNG on water. Due to its
modular formulation, the full coupled model can straightforwardly be extended
to study RPT in other systems.

graphs that can be turned into a chordal graph by adding at most k edges or,
equivalently, the class of graphs of fill-in at most k. We discover that a
number of fundamental intractable optimization problems being parameterized by
k admit subexponential algorithms on graphs from Chordal-ke. We identify a
large class of optimization problems on Chordal-ke that admit algorithms with
the typical running time 2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}. Examples of the
problems from this class are finding an independent set of maximum weight,
finding a feedback vertex set or an odd cycle transversal of minimum weight, or
the problem of finding a maximum induced planar subgraph. On the other hand, we
show that for some fundamental optimization problems, like finding an optimal
graph coloring or finding a maximum clique, are FPT on Chordal-ke when
parameterized by k but do not admit subexponential in k algorithms unless ETH
fails. Besides subexponential time algorithms, the class of Chordal-ke graphs
appears to be appealing from the perspective of kernelization (with parameter
k). While it is possible to show that most of the weighted variants of
optimization problems do not admit polynomial in k kernels on Chordal-ke
graphs, this does not exclude the existence of Turing kernelization and
kernelization for unweighted graphs. In particular, we construct a polynomial
Turing kernel for Weighted Clique on Chordal-ke graphs. For (unweighted)
Independent Set we design polynomial kernels on two interesting subclasses of
Chordal-ke, namely, Interval-ke and Split-ke graphs.

when an object transits a rotating star. Stars rotate differentially and this
affects the shape and amplitude of this signal, on a level that can no longer
be ignored with precise spectrographs. Highly misaligned planets provide a
unique opportunity to probe stellar differential rotation via the RM effect, as
they cross several stellar latitudes. In this sense, WASP-7, and its hot
Jupiter with a projected misalignment of \sim 90{\deg}, is one of the most
promising targets. The aim of this work is to understand if the stellar
differential rotation is measurable through the RM signal for systems with a
geometry similar to WASP-7. In this sense, we use a modified version of SOAP3.0
to explore the main hurdles that prevented the precise determination of the
differential rotation of WASP-7. We also investigate whether the adoption of
the next generation spectrographs, like ESPRESSO, would solve these issues.
Additionally, we assess how instrumental and stellar noise influence this
effect and the derived geometry of the system. We found that, for WASP-7, the
white noise represents an important hurdle in the detection of the stellar
differential rotation, and that a precision of at least 2m/s or better is
essential.

  dimension","25 pages",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We find sets naturally arising in Diophantine approximation whose Cartesian
products exceed the expected Hausdorff dimension, that is the sum of the single
dimensions. We also address their packing dimensions. Examples include $n$-fold
products of the set of Liouville numbers as well as of the Diophantine numbers
with prescribed irrationality exponent. In particular, we show that almost
every real number with respect to Lebesgue measure can be written as the sum of
two numbers with sufficiently large prescribed irrationality exponents. A
similar result holds when restricting to classical missing digit Cantor sets.
This implies that the subset of numbers with prescribed large irrationality
exponent has full packing dimension, i.e. the same packing dimension as the
entire Cantor set. This complements results on the Hausdorff dimension of these
sets, an intensely studied topic. Our proofs extend ideas of Erd\H{o}s.

semiconducting nanowire (NW) attached to superconducting leads and a
ferromagnetic insulator (FI). We show that a sizable equilibrium spin
polarization arises in the NW due to the interplay between the superconducting
correlations and the exchange field in the FI. The resulting magnetization has
a nonlocal contribution that spreads in the NW over the superconducting
coherence length and is opposite in sign to the local spin polarization induced
by the magnetic proximity effect in the normal state. For a Josephson-junction
setup, we show that the nonlocal magnetization can be controlled by the
superconducting phase bias across the junction. Our findings are relevant for
the implementation of Majorana bound states in state-of-the-art hybrid
structures.

Conventionally, the \HII\ bubble size distribution can be derived from the

reionization, which, however, is observationally challenging even for the
upcoming large radio interferometer arrays. Given that these interferometers

model, which extends the SQ learning model introduced by Kearns to the quantum
setting. Our model can be also seen as a restriction of the quantum PAC
learning model: here, the learner does not have direct access to quantum
examples, but can only obtain estimates of measurement statistics on them.
Theoretically, this model provides a simple yet expressive setting to explore
the power of quantum examples in machine learning. From a practical
perspective, since simpler operations are required, learning algorithms in the
QSQ model are more feasible for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We
prove a number of results about the QSQ learning model. We first show that
parity functions, (log n)-juntas and polynomial-sized DNF formulas are
efficiently learnable in the QSQ model, in contrast to the classical setting
where these problems are provably hard. This implies that many of the
advantages of quantum PAC learning can be realized even in the more restricted
quantum SQ learning model. It is well-known that weak statistical query
dimension, denoted by WSQDIM(C), characterizes the complexity of learning a
concept class C in the classical SQ model. We show that log(WSQDIM(C)) is a
lower bound on the complexity of QSQ learning, and furthermore it is tight for
certain concept classes C. Additionally, we show that this quantity provides
strong lower bounds for the small-bias quantum communication model under
product distributions. Finally, we introduce the notion of private quantum PAC
learning, in which a quantum PAC learner is required to be differentially
private. We show that learnability in the QSQ model implies learnability in the
quantum private PAC model. Additionally, we show that in the private PAC
learning setting, the classical and quantum sample complexities are equal, up

new non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates for a wide class of

Finally, we empirically illustrate our theoretical results via two numerical

  In these methods, for an input, an explanation is in the form of a contrast
point differing in very few features from the original input and lying in a
different class. Other works try to build globally interpretable models like
decision trees and rule lists based on the data using actual labels or based on

can be useful, they may not be consistent with local explanations from a
specific black-box of choice. In this work, we explore the question: Can we
produce a transparent global model that is simultaneously accurate and
consistent with the local (contrastive) explanations of the black-box model? We
introduce a natural local consistency metric that quantifies if the local
explanations and predictions of the black-box model are also consistent with
the proxy global transparent model. Based on a key insight we propose a novel
method where we create custom boolean features from sparse local contrastive
explanations of the black-box model and then train a globally transparent model
on just these, and showcase empirically that such models have higher local
consistency compared with other known strategies, while still being close in
performance to models that are trained with access to the original data.

brown dwarf companion to HD13724 and obtain a low-resolution spectrum. Methods.
We combine the radial-velocity measurements of CORALIE and HARPS taken over two
decades and high contrast imaging from SPHERE to obtain a dynamical mass
estimate. From the SPHERE data we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the
companion from Y to J band, as well as photometric measurements from IRDIS in
the J, H and K bands. Results. Using high-contrast imaging with the SPHERE
instrument at the VLT, we report the first images of a brown dwarf companion to
the host star HD13724. It has an angular separation of 175.6 $\pm$ 4.5 mas and
H-band contrast of $10.61\pm0.16$ mag and, using the age estimate of the star
to be $\sim$1 Gyr, gives an isochronal mass estimate of $\sim$44
$M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. By combining radial-velocity and imaging data we also
obtain a dynamical mass of $50.5^{+3.3}_{-3.5} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. Through
fitting an atmospheric model, we estimate a surface gravity of $\log g = 5.5$
and an effective temperature of 1000K. A comparison of its spectrum with
observed T dwarfs estimates a spectral type of T4 or T4.5, with a T4 object

properties of the flows are described by a new set of dynamical tensor
variables. In this work we explore the non-linear dynamics of those variables
in a conformal fluid. Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the
Divergence Type Theories (DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of
thermodynamics is fulfilled non-perturbatively. The tensor modes include two
divergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant
generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equation, and that are particularly
relevant because they couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the
dynamics of this irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories
such as DTTs, thermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force, which
excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum conservation. From
fluctuation-dissipation considerations it follows that the random force is
Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in turn excite
vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing a
consistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor
dynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism plus the Two-Particle
Irreducible Effective Action (2PIEA) formalism, we obtain the one-loop
corrected equations for the relevant two-point correlation functions of the
model: the retarded propagator and the Hadamard function. The overall result of
the self-consistent dynamics of the irreducible tensor modes at this order is a

networks (DNN) spikes recently owing to their superior performance and
efficiency. However, today's DNN accelerators primarily focus on accelerating
specific ""kernels"" such as convolution and matrix multiplication, which are
vital but only part of an end-to-end DNN-enabled application. Meaningful
speedups over the entire application often require supporting computations that
are, while massively parallel, ill-suited to DNN accelerators. Integrating a
general-purpose processor such as a CPU or a GPU incurs significant data
movement overhead and leads to resource under-utilization on the DNN
accelerators.
  We propose Simultaneous Multi-mode Architecture (SMA), a novel architecture
design and execution model that offers general-purpose programmability on DNN
accelerators in order to accelerate end-to-end applications. The key to SMA is
the temporal integration of the systolic execution model with the GPU-like SIMD
execution model. The SMA exploits the common components shared between the
systolic-array accelerator and the GPU, and provides lightweight
reconfiguration capability to switch between the two modes in-situ. The SMA
achieves up to 63% performance improvement while consuming 23% less energy than
the baseline Volta architecture with TensorCore.

we apply its variant with the self-attention mechanism for the sequence
embedding. Moreover, in order to better handle the irregularity of data, we
enhance the self-attention mechanism with consideration of different time
intervals. We have developed a visual analytics system to support comparative
studies of patient records. To make a comparison of sequences with different

its interactive interface, the user can quickly identify patients of interest

rapidly-changing algorithms for computer vision. The majority of existing work
focuses on accelerating image classification, while other fundamental vision
problems, including object detection and instance segmentation, have not been
adequately addressed. Compared with image classification, detection problems
are more sensitive to the spatial variance of objects, and therefore, require
specialized convolutions to aggregate spatial information. To address this,
recent work proposes dynamic deformable convolution to augment regular
convolutions. Regular convolutions process a fixed grid of pixels across all
the spatial locations in an image, while dynamic deformable convolutions may
access arbitrary pixels in the image and the access pattern is input-dependent
and varies per spatial location. These properties lead to inefficient memory
accesses of inputs with existing hardware. In this work, we first investigate
the overhead of the deformable convolution on embedded FPGA SoCs, and then show
the accuracy-latency tradeoffs for a set of algorithm modifications including
full versus depthwise, fixed-shape, and limited-range. These modifications
benefit the energy efficiency for embedded devices in general as they reduce
the compute complexity. We then build an efficient object detection network
with modified deformable convolutions and quantize the network using
state-of-the-art quantization methods. We implement a unified hardware engine
on FPGA to support all the operations in the network. Preliminary experiments
show that little accuracy is compromised and speedup can be achieved with our
co-design optimization for the deformable convolution.

perturbation theory and other perturbative treatment of first principle
electronic structure theories. The cost of computing the polarizability
operator generally scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_{e}^4)$ where $N_e$ is the number
of electrons in the system. The recently developed adaptively compressed
polarizability operator (ACP) formulation [L. Lin, Z. Xu and L. Ying,
Multiscale Model. Simul. 2017] reduces such complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(N_{e}^3)$ in the context of phonon calculations with a large basis
set for the first time, and demonstrates its effectiveness for model problems.
In this paper, we improve the performance of the ACP formulation by splitting
the polarizability into a near singular component that is statically
compressed, and a smooth component that is adaptively compressed. The new split
representation maintains the $\mathcal{O}(N_e^3)$ complexity, and accelerates
nearly all components of the ACP formulation, including Chebyshev interpolation
of energy levels, iterative solution of Sternheimer equations, and convergence
of the Dyson equations. For simulation of real materials, we discuss how to
incorporate nonlocal pseudopotentials and finite temperature effects. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using one-dimensional model problem

(HWENO) scheme with artificial linear weights is proposed for one and two
dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws, where the zeroth-order and the
first-order moments are used in the spatial reconstruction. We construct the
HWENO methodology using a nonlinear convex combination of a high degree
polynomial with several low degree polynomials, and the associated linear
weights can be any artificial positive numbers with only requirement that their
summation equals one. The one advantage of the HWENO scheme is its simplicity
and easy extension to multi-dimension in engineering applications for we can
use any artificial linear weights which are independent on geometry of mesh.
The another advantage is its higher order numerical accuracy using less
candidate stencils for two dimensional problems. In addition, the HWENO scheme
still keeps the compactness as only immediate neighbor information is needed in
the reconstruction and has high efficiency for directly using linear
approximation in the smooth regions. In order to avoid nonphysical oscillations
nearby strong shocks or contact discontinuities, we adopt the thought of
limiter for discontinuous Galerkin method to control the spurious oscillations.
Some benchmark numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the capability of
the proposed scheme.

Extremely high assignment precision is necessary with low measurement
frequencies and limited computational resources. The new ""Spacecraft
Angles-only MUltitarget tracking System"" (SAMUS) algorithm has been developed
to meet these objectives and constraints. It combines domain-specific modeling
of target kinematics with multi-hypothesis techniques to autonomously track
multiple unknown targets using only sequential camera images. A measurement
transform ensures that target motion in the observer reference frame follows
consistent parametric models; curve fitting is used to predict track behavior;
and kinematically-derived track gating and scoring criteria are applied to
improve the efficiency and accuracy of the multi-hypothesis approach.
Monte-Carlo testing with high-fidelity simulations demonstrates close to 100%
measurement assignment precision and strong recall across a range of
multi-spacecraft formations, in both near-circular and eccentric orbits.
Tracking is maintained in the presence of eclipse periods, significant
measurement noise, and partially known swarm maneuvers. A comparison to other
tracking algorithms reveals strong advantages in precision, robustness and
computation time, crucial for spaceborne angles-only navigation.

be replaced or recharged frequently which impedes their pervasive deployment. A
promising alternative is to employ energy harvesters that convert the
environmental energy into electrical energy. Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH)
converts the ambient motion/vibration energy into electrical energy to power
the IoT sensor nodes. However, most previous works employ KEH without
dynamically tracking the optimal operating point of the transducer for maximum
power output. In this paper, we systematically analyse the relation between the
operating point of the transducer and the corresponding energy yield. To this
end, we explore the voltage-current characteristics of the KEH transducer to
find its Maximum Power Point (MPP). We show how this operating point can be
approximated in a practical energy harvesting circuit. We design two hardware
circuit prototypes to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism and
analyse the harvested energy using a precise load shaker under a wide set of
controlled conditions typically found in human-centric applications. We analyse
the dynamic current-voltage characteristics and specify the relation between
the MPP sampling rate and harvesting efficiency which outlines the need for
dynamic MPP tracking. The results show that the proposed energy harvesting
mechanism outperforms the conventional method in terms of generated power and
offers at least one order of magnitude higher power than the latter.

making use of a minimalistic model of a cyanine dye J-aggregate, we demonstrate
that long-range transport efficiency is enhanced when exciting the aggregate

proposed a hypothesis that interprets choice of action as the X-point for

function that decreases with actions. This hypothesis is based on humans
psychologically balancing the value of utility and norms in selecting actions.
Using the hypothesis and approximation, we were able to isolate and infer
utility function and norm function from real-world measurement data of actions
on environmental conditions and elucidate the interaction between the both
functions that led from current status to target actions. As examples of
collective data that aggregate decision-making of individuals, we looked at the
changes in power usage before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the
correlation between national GDP and CO2 emission in different countries. The
first example showed that the perceived benefits of power (i.e., utility of
power usage) was stronger than the power usage restrictions imposed by norms
after the earthquake, contrary to our expectation. The second example showed
that a reduction of CO2 emission in each country was not related to utility
derived from GDP but to norms related to CO2 emission. Going forward, we will
apply this new X-point model to actual social practices involving normative
problems, and design the approaches for the diagnosis, prognosis and
intervention of social systems by IT systems.

(distribution norm). A comprehensive solution incorporating these three

features are first extracted from the raw nodal time-series data by kernel
autoregressive-moving-average modeling to reveal non-linear dependencies and
low-rank representations, and then mapped onto the Grassmann manifold
(Grassmannian). All clustering tasks are performed by leveraging the underlying
Riemannian geometry of the Grassmannian in a novel way. To validate the
proposed framework, brain-network clustering is considered, where extensive
numerical tests on synthetic and real functional magnetic resonance imaging

Given a data distribution, Bayes-TrEx finds in-distribution examples with a
specified prediction confidence. We demonstrate several use cases of
Bayes-TrEx, including revealing highly confident (mis)classifications,
visualizing class boundaries via ambiguous examples, understanding novel-class
extrapolation behavior, and exposing neural network overconfidence. We use
Bayes-TrEx to study classifiers trained on CLEVR, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, and

The deployment of preventive measures and operational forecasts can be aided by

for wildfire ignition points observed in the French Mediterranean basin since
1995, and we fit a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process with monthly

with GIS software and kriging techniques; second, INLA-based estimation with
high-dimensional response vectors and latent models is facilitated through
intra-year subsampling, taking into account the occurrence structure of

when the granularity of forecasting step improves as the highly dynamic nature
of road network and inherent rareness of accident records in one training

and dynamic inter-subregion correlations. Furthermore, we adopt multi-task and
region selection schemes to highlight citywide most-likely accident subregions,
bridging the gap between biased risk values and sporadic accident distribution.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness

comprises three distinct stages: planetary ejection, interplanetary transit and
planetary entry. However, it is debatable whether organisms transported within
the ejecta can survive all three stages. If the conjecture is granted, that
life can indeed be safely transmitted from one world to another, then it is not
only a topic pertaining to planetary science but also biological sciences.
Hence, these stages are only the first three factors of the equation. The other
factors for successful lithopanspermia are the quality, quantity and
evolutionary strategy of the transmitted organisms. When expanding into new
environments, invading organisms often do not survive in the first attempt and
usually require several attempts through propagule pressure to obtain a
foothold. There is a crucial difference between this terrestrial situation and
the one brought about by lithopanspermia. While invasive species on Earth
repeatedly enters a new habitat, a species pragmatically arrives on another
solar system body only once; thus, an all-or-nothing response will be in
effect. The species must survive in the first attempt, which limits the
probability of survival. In addition, evolution sets a boundary through the
existence of an inverse proportionality between the exchanges of life between
two worlds, thus further restricting the probability of survival. However,
terrestrial populations often encounter unpredictable and variable
environmental conditions, which in turn necessitates an evolutionary response.
Thus, one evolutionary mode in particular, bet hedging, is the evolutionary
strategy that best smooth out this inverse proportionality.

bio-inspired Spiking neural networks (SNN) has enabled some interesting models
and applications. However designing large-scale and high-performance model is
yet a challenge due to the lack of robust training algorithms. A bio-plausible
SNN model with spatial-temporal property is a complex dynamic system. Each
synapse and neuron behave as filters capable of preserving temporal
information. As such neuron dynamics and filter effects are ignored in existing
training algorithms, the SNN downgrades into a memoryless system and loses the
ability of temporal signal processing. Furthermore, spike timing plays an
important role in information representation, but conventional rate-based spike
coding models only consider spike trains statistically, and discard information
carried by its temporal structures. To address the above issues, and exploit
the temporal dynamics of SNNs, we formulate SNN as a network of infinite
impulse response (IIR) filters with neuron nonlinearity. We proposed a training
algorithm that is capable to learn spatial-temporal patterns by searching for
the optimal synapse filter kernels and weights. The proposed model and training
