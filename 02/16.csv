pseudonymity to its users by establishing identity using public keys as
transaction end-points. These transactions are recorded on an immutable public
ledger called Blockchain which is an append-only data structure. The popularity
of Bitcoin has increased unreasonably. The general trend shows a positive
response from the common masses indicating an increase in trust and privacy
concerns which makes an interesting use case from the analysis point of view.
Moreover, since the blockchain is publicly available and up-to-date, any
analysis would provide a live insight into the usage patterns which ultimately
would be useful for making a number of inferences by law-enforcement agencies,
economists, tech-enthusiasts, etc. In this paper, we study various applications
and techniques of performing data analytics over Bitcoin blockchain from a
graph theoretic perspective. We also propose a framework for performing such
data analytics and explored a couple of use cases using the proposed framework.

bursts (GRBs), we perform time-resolved spectral analysis on a sample of 70
pulses in 68 short GRBs with burst duration $T_{90}\lesssim2$ s detected by the
\textit{Fermi}/GBM. We apply a Bayesian analysis to all spectra that have
statistical significance $S\ge15$ within each pulse and apply a cut-off power
law (CPL) model. We then select in each pulse the timebin that has the maximal
value of the low energy spectral index, %$\alpha_{\rm max}$, for further
analysis. Under the assumption that the main emission mechanism is the same
throughout each pulse, such an analysis is indicative of pulse emission. We
find that $\sim$1/3 of short GRBs are consistent with a pure, non-dissipative
photospheric model, at least, around the peak of the pulse. This fraction is
larger compare to the corresponding one (1/4) obtained for long GRBs. For these
bursts, we find (i) a bi-modal distribution in the values of the Lorentz
factors and the hardness ratios; (ii) an anti-correlation between $T_{90}$ and
the peak energy, $E_{\rm pk}$: $T_{90} \propto E_{\rm pk}^{-0.50\pm0.19}$. This
correlation disappears when we consider the entire sample. Our results thus
imply that the short GRB population may in fact be composed of two separate
populations: one being a continuation of the long GRB population to shorter
durations, and the other one being distinctly separate with different physical
properties. Furthermore, thermal emission is initially ubiquitous, but is
accompanied at longer times by additional radiation (likely synchrotron).

current resitance is a function of its previous resistance. As such, the
behaviour of the device is influenced by changing the way in which potential is
applied across it. Ultimately, information can be encoded on memristors.
Biological substrates have already been shown to exhibit some memristive
properties. However, many memristive devices are yet to be found. Here we show
that the fruit bodies of grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus exhibit
memristive behaviours. This paper presents the I-V characteristics of the

NOAO Deep Wide-field survey (NDWFS) of the Bo\""otes field. The selection was
based on optical/mid-ir photometry used to train three different machine
learning (ML) algorithms. Objects taken as quasars by the ML algorithms are
required to be detected at $5\sigma$ significance in deep radio maps to be
classified as candidate quasars. The optical imaging came from the SDSS and the
PS1 $3\pi$ survey; mid-ir photometry was taken from the SDWFS survey; and radio
data was obtained from deep LOFAR imaging of the NDWFS-Bo\""otes field. The
requirement of a $5\sigma$ LOFAR detection allowed us to reduce the stellar
contamination in our sample by two orders of magnitude. The sample comprises
134 objects, including both photometrically selected candidate quasars (47) and
spectroscopically confirmed quasars (83). The depth of our LOFAR observations
allowed us to detect the radio-emission of quasars that would be otherwise
classified as radio-quiet. Around $65\%$ of the quasars in the sample are
fainter than $M_{\textrm{1450}}=-24.0$, a regime where the OLF of quasars
selected through their radio emission, has not been investigated in detail. It
has been demonstrated that in cases where mid-ir wedge-based AGN selection is
not possible due to a lack of appropriate data, the selection of quasars using
ML algorithms trained with optical/mid-ir photometry in combination with LOFAR
data provides an excellent approach for obtaining samples of quasars. We
demonstrate that RSQs show an evolution similar to that exhibited by faint
quasars $(M_{\textrm{1450}}\leq-22.0)$. Finally, we find that RSQs may compose
up to $\sim20\%$ of the whole faint quasar population (radio-detected plus
radio-undetected).

employs PolyDG methods, i.e. discontinuous Galerkin methods on general
polygonal and polyhedral (polytopic, for short) grids, featuring elements with
edges/faces that may be in arbitrary number (potentially unlimited) and whose
measure may be arbitrarily small. Our approach is then very well suited to tame
the geometrical complexity featured by most of applications in the
computational geoscience field. From the modelling point of view, we adopt a
reduction strategy that treats fractures as manifolds of codimension one and we
employ the primal version of Darcy's law to describe the flow in both the bulk
and the fracture network. In addition, some physically consistent conditions
couple the two problems, allowing for jump of pressure at their interface, and
they as well prescribe the behaviour of the fluid along the intersections,
imposing pressure continuity and flux conservation. Both the bulk and fracture
discretizations are obtained employing the Symmetric Interior Penalty DG method
extended to the polytopic setting. The key instrument to obtain a polyDG
approximation of the problem in the fracture network is the generalization of
the concepts of jump and average at the intersection, so that the contribution
from all the fractures is taken into account. We prove the well-posedness of
the discrete formulation and perform an error analysis obtaining a priori
hp-error estimates. All our theoretical results are validated performing
preliminary numerical tests with known analytical solution.

tree containing edges of varying rates such that any two terminals $u$, $v$
with priorities $P(u)$, $P(v)$ are connected using edges of rate
$\min\{P(u),P(v)\}$ or better. The case where edge costs are proportional to
their rate is approximable to within a constant factor of the optimal solution.
For the more general case of non-proportional costs, this problem is hard to
approximate with ratio $c \log \log n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in
the graph. A simple greedy algorithm by Charikar et al., however, provides a
$\min\{2(\ln |T|+1), \ell \rho\}$-approximation in this setting, where $\rho$
is an approximation ratio for a heuristic solver for the Steiner tree problem
and $\ell$ is the number of priorities or levels (Byrka et al. give a Steiner

should be task-specific, as opposed to shared between tasks. We investigate
this issue for the problem of jointly learning named entity recognition (NER)

allows for deeper task-specificity than does prior work. In particular, we
introduce additional task-specific bidirectional RNN layers for both the NER

for different datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for both
tasks on the ADE dataset; on the CoNLL04 dataset, we achieve SOTA results on
the NER task and competitive results on the RE task while using an order of
magnitude fewer trainable parameters than the current SOTA architecture. An
ablation study confirms the importance of the additional task-specific layers
for achieving these results. Our work suggests that previous solutions to joint
NER and RE undervalue task-specificity and demonstrates the importance of
correctly balancing the number of shared and task-specific parameters for MTL
approaches in general.

determine its density distribution and kinematics. This model is constrained by
a column density line shape sample extracted from the {\it HST}/COS archival
data, which contains 186 AGN sight lines. We find that the Si IV ion density
distribution is dominated by an extended disk along the $z$-direction (above or
below the midplane), i.e., $n(z)=n_0\exp(-(z/z_0)^{0.82})$, where $z_0$ is the
scale height of $6.3_{-1.5}^{+1.6}$ kpc (northern hemisphere) and
$3.6_{-0.9}^{+1.0}$ kpc (southern hemisphere). The density distribution of the
disk in the radial direction shows a sharp edge at $15-20$ kpc given by,
$n(r_{\rm XY})=n_0\exp(-(r_{\rm XY}/r_0)^{3.36})$, where $r_0 \approx
12.5\pm0.6$ kpc. The difference of density distributions over $r_{\rm XY}$ and
$z$ directions indicates that the warm gas traced by \ion{Si}{4} is mainly
associated with disk processes (e.g., feedback or cycling gas) rather than
accretion. We estimate the mass of the warm gas (within 50 kpc) is $\log (M(50
{\rm kpc})/M_\odot)\approx8.1$ (assuming $Z\approx0.5Z_\odot$), and a $3\sigma$
upper limit of $\log (M(250 {\rm kpc})/M_\odot)\approx9.1$ (excluding the
Magellanic system). Kinematically, the warm gas disk is nearly co-rotating with
the stellar disk at $v_{\rm rot}=215\pm3\rm~km~s^{-1}$, which lags the midplane
rotation by about $8\rm~km~s^{-1}~kpc^{-1}$ (within 5 kpc). Meanwhile, we note
that the warm gas in the northern hemisphere has significant accretion with
$v_{\rm acc}$ of $69\pm 7\rm ~km~s^{-1}$ at 10 kpc (an accretion rate of
$-0.60_{-0.13}^{+0.11}~M_\odot\rm~yr^{-1}$), while in the southern hemisphere,
there is no measurable accretion, with an upper limit of
$0.4~M_\odot\rm~yr^{-1}$.

time-series data from the ASAS-3, KELT and MASCARA surveys were employed to
improve existing rotational period information and derive rotational periods
for mCP stars hitherto not known to be photometric variables. Our final sample
consists of 294 mCP stars, a considerable amount of which (more than 40%) are
presented here as photometric variables for the first time. In addition, we
identified 24 mCP star candidates that show light variability in agreement with
rotational modulation but lack spectroscopic confirmation. The rotational
period distribution of our sample agrees well with the literature.Most stars
are between 100Myr and 1Gyr old, with an apparent lack of very young stars. No
objects were found on the zero age main sequence; several stars seem to have
evolved to the subgiant stage, albeit well before the first dredge-up. We
identified four eclipsing binaries (HD 244391, HD 247441, HD 248784 and HD

mCP stars are very rarely found in close binary systems, particularly eclipsing

Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data

interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is
preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any

several interesting new physics questions associated with detecting as well as

$M_{\mu}$, the muon mass fraction $M_{\mu}/M_{\rm NS}$ over the NS mass $M_{\rm
NS}$ and the muon radial density profile $\rho_{\mu}(r)$ in NSs of varying
masses. We investigate these quantities within a minimum model for the core of
NSs consisting of neutrons, protons, electrons, and muons using an explicitly
isospin-dependent parametric Equation of State (EOS) constrained by available
nuclear laboratory experiments and the latest astrophysical observations of NS
masses, radii and tidal deformabilities. We found that the absolutely maximum
muon mass $M_{\mu}$ and its mass fraction $M_{\mu}/M_{\rm NS}$ in the most
massive NSs allowed by causality are about 0.025 $M_\odot$ and 1.1\%,
respectively. For the most massive NS of mass 2.14 $M_\odot$ observed so far,
they reduce to about 0.020 $M_\odot$ and 0.9\%, respectively. We also study
respective effects of individual parameters describing the EOS of high-density
neutron-rich nucleonic matter on the muon contents in NSs with varying masses.
We found that the most important but uncertain nuclear physics ingredient for
determining the muon contents in NSs is the high-density nuclear symmetry
energy.

  As web push notifications (WPNs) are relatively new, their role in ad

  Using PushAdMiner, we collected and analyzed 21,541 WPN messages by visiting

This article gives a short introduction to integrals used in lattice QCD where
the interactions of gluon and quark elementary particles are investigated,
explains the alternative integration methods we developed and shows results of
applying them to models with one physical dimension. The new quadrature rules
avoid the sign-problem and can therefore be used to perform simulations at

around the hierarchical structure of the variational multiscale (VMS)

structure of the ROM basis: In the first step, we use the ROM projection to
separate the scales into three categories: (i) resolved large scales, (ii)
resolved small scales, and (iii) unresolved scales. In the second step, we
explicitly identify the VMS-ROM closure terms, i.e., the terms representing the
interactions among the three types of scales. In the third step, we use
available data to model the VMS-ROM closure terms. Thus, instead of
phenomenological models used in VMS for standard numerical discretizations
(e.g., eddy viscosity models), we utilize available data to construct new
structural VMS-ROM closure models. Specifically, we build ROM operators
(vectors, matrices, and tensors) that are closest to the true ROM closure terms
evaluated with the available data. We test the new data-driven VMS-ROM in the
numerical simulation of four test cases: (i) the 1D Burgers equation with
viscosity coefficient $\nu = 10^{-3}$; (ii) a 2D flow past a circular cylinder

quasi-geostrophic equations at Reynolds number $Re=450$ and Rossby number

estimates from different sources. However, as HLL is increasingly used to
detect attacks, it can itself become the target of attackers that want to avoid
being detected. To the best of our knowledge, the security of HLL has not been
studied before. In this letter, we take an initial step in its study by first
exposing a vulnerability of HLL that allows an attacker to manipulate its
estimate. This shows the importance of designing secure HLL implementations. In
the second part of the letter, we propose an efficient protection technique to
detect and avoid the HLL manipulation. The results presented strongly suggest
that the security of HLL should be further studied given that it is widely
adopted in many networking and computing applications.

of years of escape modulated by diffusive separation and preferential loss of

clusters (GCs) predict that second generation (2G) stars form in a compact and
dense subsystem embedded in a more extended first-generation (1G) system. If
these scenarios are accurate, a consequence of the denser 2G formation
environment is that 2G binaries should be more significantly affected by
stellar interactions and disrupted at a larger rate than 1G binaries. The
fractions and properties of binary stars can thus provide a dynamical
fingerprint of the formation epoch of multiple-population GCs and their
subsequent dynamical evolution. We investigate the connection between binaries
and multiple populations in five GCs, NGC 288, NGC 6121 (M 4), NGC 6352, NGC

F336W, F438W, F606W and F814W filters with a large number of simulated
binaries. In the inner regions probed by our data we do not find large
differences between the local 1G and the 2G binary incidences in four of the
studied clusters, the only exception being M 4 where the 1G binary incidence is
about three times larger than the 2G incidence. The results found are in
general agreement with the results of simulations predicting significant
differences in the global 1G and 2G incidences and in the local values in the
clusters' outer regions but similar incidences in the inner regions. The
significant difference found in M 4 is consistent with simulations with a
larger fraction of wider binaries. Our analysis also provides the first
evidence of mixed (1G-2G) binaries, a population predicted by numerical
simulations to form in a cluster's inner regions as a result of stellar
encounters during which one component of a binary is replaced by a star of a
different population.

robust loss functions. Specifically, through mutual amelioration between robust
loss hyperparameter and network parameters in our method, both of them can be
simultaneously finely learned and coordinated to attain solutions with good
generalization capability. Four kinds of SOTA robust loss functions are
attempted to be integrated into our algorithm, and comprehensive experiments
substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the proposed method
in both its accuracy and generalization performance, as compared with

quasicrystal (QC). To settle several fundamental issues of the SC on the QC, we
use an attractive Hubbard model to perform a systematic study on the Penrose
lattice. The first issue is the Cooper instability of the QC, i.e., no Fermi
surface under an infinitesimal attractive interaction. Starting from the
two-electron problem outside the filled Fermi-sea, we analytically prove that
an infinitesimal Hubbard attraction can lead to the Cooper instability as long
as the density of state is nonzero at the Fermi level, which provides the basis
of the SC on the QC. Our numerical results yield that the Cooper pairing always
takes place between the two time-reversal states, satisfying the Anderson's
theorem. On this theorem, we perform a mean-field (MF) study at both zero and
finite temperatures. The MF study also shows that an arbitrarily weak
attraction can lead to the pairing order, with the resulted pairing state being
well described by the BCS theory and the thermal dynamic behaviors being well
consistent with experimental results. The second issue is about the superfluid
density on the QC without translational symmetry. It's clarified that although
the normal state of the system locates at the critical point of the
metal-insulator transition, the pairing state exhibits real SC, carrying finite
superfluid density that can be verified by the Meissner effect, consistent with
experiment also. These revealed properties of the SC on the Penrose lattice are
universal for all QCs.

in situ electric field in the skin is used as a surrogate of nerve activation.
In the low-frequency dosimetry, a high but inaccurate in situ electric field
has been reported at positions where a skin-to-skin contact exists, whose
relation to the stimulation is controversial. One of the reasons for high
electric fields may be attributable to the current resolution of anatomical
models. In this study, we first evaluate the stimulation threshold at postures
of skin-to-skin contact experimentally for different hand/finger positions to
represent skin touching/non-touching scenarios. We confirm that the
skin-to-skin contact does not lower the threshold current of magnetic
stimulation devices needed to induce pain. Second, a new method is proposed for
hand modeling to configure different finger positions using static hand models
with similar postures to the experiments. We compute the in situ electric field
at skin-to-skin contact for the different hand posture scenarios that indicate
an excessive raise of the electric field in skin-to-skin regions that is not
justified by the experiments. The comparison suggests that a high in situ
electric field in the skin would be caused by poor modeling of the skin layers,
which is not enough to represent in a resolution of the order of a millimeter.

conventional BP decoding algorithm treats binary stabilizer codes as additive
codes over GF(4). This algorithm has a relatively complex process of handling
check-node messages, which incurs higher decoding complexity. Moreover, BP
decoding of a stabilizer code usually suffers a performance loss due to the
many short cycles in the underlying Tanner graph. In this paper, we propose a
refined BP decoding algorithm for quantum codes with complexity roughly the
same as binary BP. For a given error syndrome, this algorithm decodes to the
same output as the conventional quaternary BP but the passed node-to-node
messages are single-valued, unlike the quaternary BP, where multivalued
node-to-node messages are required. Furthermore, the techniques of message
strength normalization can naturally be applied to these single-valued messages
to improve the performance. Another observation is that the message-update
schedule affects the performance of BP decoding against short cycles. We show
that running BP with message strength normalization according to a serial

Mixture Density Network (MDN) and the accept-reject method. The proposed
simulator can generate the random knock intensity signal corresponding to the
input signal. The generated knock intensity has a consistent probability
distribution with the real engine. Firstly, the statistical analysis is
conducted with the experimental data. From the analysis results, some important
assumptions on the statistical properties of the knock intensity are made.
Regarding the knock intensity as a random variable on the discrete-time index,
it is independent and identically distributed if the input of the engine is
identical. The probability distribution of the knock intensity under identical
input can be approximated by the Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM). The parameter of
the GMM is a function of the input. Based on these assumptions, two
sub-problems for establishing the statistical simulator are formulated: One is
to approximate the function from input to the parameters of the knock intensity
distribution with an absolutely continuous function; The other one is to design
a random number generator that outputs the random data consistent with the
given distribution. The MDN is applied to approximate the probability density
of the knock intensity and the accept-reject algorithm is used for the random
number generator design. The proposed method is evaluated in experimental
data-based validation.

collection of scores, is an important model component, which is widely used in
information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining. However, if the top-k
operation is implemented in an algorithmic way, e.g., using bubble algorithm,
the resulting model cannot be trained in an end-to-end way using prevalent
gradient descent algorithms. This is because these implementations typically
involve swapping indices, whose gradient cannot be computed. Moreover, the
corresponding mapping from the input scores to the indicator vector of whether
this element belongs to the top-k set is essentially discontinuous. To address
the issue, we propose a smoothed approximation, namely the SOFT (Scalable
Optimal transport-based diFferenTiable) top-k operator. Specifically, our SOFT
top-k operator approximates the output of the top-k operation as the solution
of an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem. The gradient of the SOFT
operator can then be efficiently approximated based on the optimality
conditions of EOT problem. We apply the proposed operator to the k-nearest
neighbors and beam search algorithms, and demonstrate improved performance.

says that if we consider only continuous activation functions $\sigma$, then a
standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to
approximate any continuous multivariate function $f$ to any given approximation
threshold $\varepsilon$, if and only if $\sigma$ is non-polynomial. In this
paper, we give a direct algebraic proof of the theorem. Furthermore we shall
explicitly quantify the number of hidden units required for approximation.
Specifically, if $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact, then a neural network
with $n$ input units, $m$ output units, and a single hidden layer with
$\binom{n+d}{d}$ hidden units (independent of $m$ and $\varepsilon$), can
uniformly approximate any polynomial function $f:X \to \mathbb{R}^m$ whose
total degree is at most $d$ for each of its $m$ coordinate functions. In the
general case that $f$ is any continuous function, we show there exists some
$N\in \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-n})$ (independent of $m$), such that $N$ hidden
units would suffice to approximate $f$. We also show that this uniform
approximation property (UAP) still holds even under seemingly strong conditions
imposed on the weights. We highlight several consequences: (i) For any $\delta
> 0$, the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights $w$ in the last
layer to satisfy $|w| < \delta$. (ii) There exists some $\lambda>0$ (depending
only on $f$ and $\sigma$), such that the UAP still holds if we restrict all

Using data generated from the current policy, FOCOPS first finds the optimal

addition to offering insight into the structure-function relationship of
networked systems, such an understanding is a critical step towards the ability

We investigate the role of community structure in the controllability of
structural brain networks. At the region level, we find that certain network
measures of community structure are sometimes statistically correlated with
measures of linear controllability. However, we then demonstrate that this
relationship depends on the distribution of network edge weights. We highlight
the complexity of the relationship between community structure and

models with varying mesoscale architectures and edge weight distributions.
Finally, we demonstrate that weighted subgraph centrality, a measure rooted in
the graph spectrum, and which captures higher-order graph architecture, is a
stronger and more consistent predictor of controllability. Our study
contributes to an understanding of how the brain's diverse mesoscale structure

different style. While various methods have been proposed to advance the state
of the art, they often assume the transfer output follows a delta distribution,
and thus their models cannot generate different style transfer results for a
given input text. To address the limitation, we propose a one-to-many text
style transfer framework. In contrast to prior works that learn a one-to-one
mapping that converts an input sentence to one output sentence, our approach
learns a one-to-many mapping that can convert an input sentence to multiple
different output sentences, while preserving the input content. This is
achieved by applying adversarial training with a latent decomposition scheme.
Specifically, we decompose the latent representation of the input sentence to a
style code that captures the language style variation and a content code that
encodes the language style-independent content. We then combine the content
code with the style code for generating a style transfer output. By combining
the same content code with a different style code, we generate a different
style transfer output. Extensive experimental results with comparisons to
several text style transfer approaches on multiple public datasets using a
diverse set of performance metrics validate effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

form of sequence pairs which have zero aperiodic autocorrelation zones and
cross-correlation zone at certain time-shifts. Recent paper by Liu \textit{et

CZCPs. We introduce the term cross Z-complementary ratio and re-categorise the
CZCPs, both perfect and non-perfect, based on that. We propose a systematic
construction of CZCPs based on generalised Boolean functions (GBFs). We further
extend the lengths of the CZCPs by using the insertion method. The proposed
CZCPs are all of new lengths of the form
$2^\alpha10^\beta26^\gamma+2~(\alpha\geq1)$, $10^\beta+2$, $26^\gamma+2$ and
$10^\beta 26^\gamma+2$. Finally we propose a construction of optimal binary
CZCPs having parameters $(12,5)$ and $(24,11)$ from binary Barker sequences.
These CZCPs are also extended to $(12N,5N)$- CZCPs and $(24N,11N)$- CZCPs,
where $N$ is the length of a binary Golay complementary pair (GCP). During the
proof, we also found a new structural property of binary CZCPs and concluded
all binary GCPs are CZCPs too. Finally, we give some numerical simulations to
confirm that depending on the number of multi-paths, the proposed CZCPs can be
used to design SM training matrix which attains the minimum mean square error.

significant transaction throughput and network scalability issues due to the

strategy. To overcome this, committee-based approaches (e.g., Elastico) that
partition the outstanding transaction set into shards and (randomly) select
multiple committees to process these transactions in parallel have been
proposed and have become very popular. However, by design these committee or
shard-based blockchain solutions are easily vulnerable to the Sybil attacks,
where an adversary can easily compromise/manipulate the consensus protocol if
it has enough computational power to generate multiple Sybil committee members
(by generating multiple valid node identifiers). Despite the straightforward
nature of these attacks, they have not been systematically analyzed. In this
paper, we fill this research gap by modelling and analyzing Sybil attacks in a
representative and popular shard-based protocol called Elastico. We show that
the PoW technique used for identifier or ID generation in the initial phase of
the protocol is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, and a node with high hash-power
can generate enough Sybil IDs to successfully compromise Elastico. We
analytically derive conditions for two different categories of Sybil attacks

inferred uncertainty to guide efficient selection of instances for labeling,
enabling better performance assessment with fewer labels. We demonstrate

became slowly increasing towards its maximum at $~$2700 to be followed by its

(OFDMA) belong to a class of signal modulation and multiple-access techniques
in which information of multiple users are multiplexed and carried on
subcarriers within a shared spectrum. Compared with OFDMA, IFDMA has lower
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). However, IFDMA poses two rigid constraints
on subcarrier allocation: 1) the subcarriers occupied by a user must be
evenly-spaced among the available subcarriers. 2) the number of subcarriers
used by a user must be a divisor of the total number of subcarriers. This paper
investigates how to overcome these constraints to allow flexible and
fine-grained subcarrier allocation in IFDMA. Specifically, we put forth 1) a
bit-reversal subcarrier allocation scheme whereby the problem of allocating
evenly-spaced subcarriers is transformed to a more intuitive problem of filling
contiguous bins; 2) a multi-stream IFDMA scheme whereby a user can have an
arbitrary number of subcarriers. For the synchronous scenario in which user
requests arrive in a synchronous manner, we show that IFDMA can achieve the
same level of flexibility and granularity as OFDMA in subcarrier allocation.
For the asynchronous scenario in which user requests arrive and depart
asynchronously, we show that the blocking probability of IFDMA is only slightly
worse than that of OFDMA: specifically, the gap between the blocking
probabilities of IFDMA and OFDMA is only 2:56% at a moderate offered load.

endogenously, through some form of non-linear dynamics -- limit cycles or

networks to compress this information in a lower-dimensional space, using
Fisher's linear discriminant as an objective function to maximize the
discriminative power of the network. We test this method on alanine dipeptide,
using the non-linearly separable dataset composed by atomic distances. We then
study an intermolecular aldol reaction characterized by a concerted mechanism.
The resulting variables are able to promote sampling by drawing non-linear
paths in the physical space connecting the fluctuations between metastable
basins. Lastly, we interpret the behavior of the neural network by studying its
relation to the physical variables. Through the identification of its most
relevant features, we are able to gain chemical insight into the process.

acting as a second layer to slower and less scalable blockchain protocols. In
this paper, we present an accessible, low-cost attack in which the attacker
paralyzes multiple payment network channels for several days. The attack is
based on overloading channels with requests that are kept unresolved until
their expiration time. Reaching the maximum allowed unresolved requests (HTLCs)
locks the channel for new payments. The attack is in fact inherent to the way
off-chain networks are constructed, since limits on the number of unresolved
payments are derived from limits on the blockchain. We consider three main
versions of the attack: one in which the attacker attempts to block as many
high liquidity channels as possible, one in which it disconnects as many pairs
of nodes as it can, and one in which it tries to isolate individual nodes from
the network. We evaluate the costs of these attacks on Bitcoin's Lightning
Network and compare how changes in the network have affected the cost of
attack. Specifically, we consider how recent changes to default parameters in
each of the main Lightning implementations contribute to the attacks. As we
evaluate the attacks, we also look at statistics on parameters in the Lightning
Network, which are of independent interest and compare the various
implementations of Lightning nodes. Finally, we suggest mitigation techniques
that make these attacks much harder to carry out.

rates, are obtained via asteroseismic observations. A comparison of core
rotation rates found in this way with core rotation rates as predicted by
stellar evolution models demonstrate a large discrepancy. This means that there
must be a process of angular momentum transport missing in the current theory
of stellar evolution. A new formalism was recently proposed to fill in for this
missing process, which has the Tayler instability as its starting point
(hereafter referred to as `Fuller-formalism'). Aims: We investigate the effect
of the Fuller-formalism on the internal rotation of stellar models with an
initial mass of 2.5 Mo. Methods: Stellar evolution models, including the
Fuller-formalism, of intermediate-mass stars were calculated to make a
comparison between asteroseismically obtained core rotation rates in the core
He burning phase and in the white dwarf phase. Results: Our main results show
that models including the Fuller-formalism can match the core rotation rates
obtained for the core He burning phases. However, these models are unable to
match the rotation rates obtained for white dwarfs. When we exclude the
Fuller-formalism at the end of the core He burning phase, the white dwarf
rotation rates of the models match the observed rates. Conclusions: We conclude
that in the present form, the Fuller-formalism cannot be the sole solution for
the missing process of angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars.

transportation systems, can be abstracted into complex networks. Containing
spreading dynamics (e.g., epidemic transmission and misinformation propagation)
in networked systems is a hot topic in multiple fronts. Most of the previous
strategies are based on the immunization of nodes. However, sometimes, these
node--based strategies can be impractical. For instance, in the train
transportation networks, it is dramatic to isolating train stations for flu
prevention. On the contrary, temporarily suspending some connections between
stations is more acceptable. Thus, we pay attention to the edge-based
containing strategy. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to find
the optimal edge for containing the spreading of the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks. In specific, by
performing a perturbation method to the discrete-Markovian-chain equations of
the SIS model, we derive a formula that approximately provides the decremental
outbreak size after the deactivation of a certain edge in the network. Then, we
determine the optimal edge by simply choosing the one with the largest
decremental outbreak size. Note that our proposed theoretical framework
incorporates the information of both network structure and spreading dynamics.
Finally, we test the performance of our method by extensive numerical
simulations. Results demonstrate that our strategy always outperforms other
strategies based only on structural properties (degree or edge betweenness
centrality). The theoretical framework in this study can be extended to other
spreading models and offers inspirations for further investigations on
edge-based immunization strategies.

fiber (HC-PCF) can be strongly enhanced by the photoionization effect of the

the pump pulse gradually shifts to shorter wavelengths due to soliton-plasma
interactions. When the central wavelength of the blueshifting soliton is close
to the resonance band of the HC-PCF, high-efficiency energy transfer from the
pump light to the DW in the visible region can be obtained. During this DW
emission process, we also observe that the spectral center of the DW gradually
shifts to longer wavelengths leading to a slightly-increased DW bandwidth,
which can be well explained as the consequence of phase-matched coupling
between the pump pulse and the DW. In particular, at an input pulse energy of 6
uJ, the spectral ratio of the DW at the fiber output is measured to be as high
as ~53% together with a conversion efficiency of ~19%. These experimental
results, explained by numerical simulations, pave the way to high-brightness

transport of a dynamically active vector field, such as the linear momentum,
the angular momentum or the vorticity, in general fluid flows. These special
material surfaces (\emph{Lagrangian active barriers}) provide physics-based,
observer-independent boundaries of dynamically active coherent structures. We
find that Lagrangian active barriers evolve from invariant surfaces of an
associated steady and incompressible \emph{barrier equation}, whose right-hand
side is the time-averaged pullback of the viscous stress terms in the evolution
equation for the dynamically active vector field. Instantaneous limits of these
barriers mark objective \emph{Eulerian active barriers} to the short-term
diffusive transport of the dynamically active vector field. We obtain that in
unsteady Beltrami flows, Lagrangian and Eulerian active barriers coincide
exactly with purely advective transport barriers bounding observed coherent
structures. In more general flows, active barriers can be identified by
applying Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) diagnostics, such as the
finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the polar rotation angle, to the appropriate
active barrier equation. In comparison to their passive counterparts, these
\emph{active LCS diagnostics} require no significant fluid particle separation
and hence provide substantially higher-resolved Lagrangian and Eulerian
coherent structure boundaries from temporally shorter velocity data sets. We
illustrate these results and their physical interpretation on two-dimensional,

  Pal","Reinforced active learning for image segmentation","Accepted to ICLR2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning-based approaches for semantic segmentation have two inherent
challenges. First, acquiring pixel-wise labels is expensive and time-consuming.
Second, realistic segmentation datasets are highly unbalanced: some categories
are much more abundant than others, biasing the performance to the most
represented ones. In this paper, we are interested in focusing human labelling
effort on a small subset of a larger pool of data, minimizing this effort while
maximizing performance of a segmentation model on a hold-out set. We present a
new active learning strategy for semantic segmentation based on deep
reinforcement learning (RL). An agent learns a policy to select a subset of
small informative image regions -- opposed to entire images -- to be labeled,
from a pool of unlabeled data. The region selection decision is made based on
predictions and uncertainties of the segmentation model being trained. Our
method proposes a new modification of the deep Q-network (DQN) formulation for
active learning, adapting it to the large-scale nature of semantic segmentation
problems. We test the proof of concept in CamVid and provide results in the
large-scale dataset Cityscapes. On Cityscapes, our deep RL region-based DQN
approach requires roughly 30% less additional labeled data than our most
competitive baseline to reach the same performance. Moreover, we find that our
method asks for more labels of under-represented categories compared to the
baselines, improving their performance and helping to mitigate class imbalance.

directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions
between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from
different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some
reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some
node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability
distribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to
the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the
graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The
pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the
transition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the
graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social
welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to
maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least}
expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out
to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or
allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation
algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly
characterize the ""price of fairness"" in our setting: the ratio between the
highest achievable social welfare and the highest social welfare consistent
with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that for polynomial width
networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP
hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on
the width in our positive results is essential.

in an emerging field of deep learning surface reconstruction, where implicit
functions are popularly implemented as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with
rectified linear units (ReLU). To achieve meshing from learned implicit
functions, existing methods adopt the de-facto standard algorithm of marching
cubes; while promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the MLPs,
due to the discretization nature of marching cubes. Motivated by the knowledge
that a ReLU based MLP partitions its input space into a number of linear
regions, we identify from these regions analytic cells and analytic faces that
are associated with zero-level isosurface of the implicit function, and
characterize the theoretical conditions under which the identified analytic
faces are guaranteed to connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface.
Based on our theorem, we propose a naturally parallelizable algorithm of
analytic marching, which marches among analytic cells to exactly recover the

estimated directly , the huge storage and intensive computation requirements

1, \ldots, n \}$ such that $Y$ does not contain $s+1$ pairwise disjoint sets.
This problem is commonly known as the Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture. We
investigate the $q$-analog of this question, that is we want to determine the
size of a largest family $Y$ of $k$-spaces in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ such that $Y$
does not contain $s+1$ pairwise disjoint $k$-spaces. Here we call two subspaces
disjoint if they intersect trivially.
  Our main result is, slightly simplified, that if $16 s \leq \min\{
q^{\frac{n-k}{4}},$ $q^{\frac{n-2k+1}{3}} \}$, then $Y$ is either small or a
union of intersecting families. Thus we show the Erd\H{os} Matching Conjecture
for this range. The proof uses a method due to Metsch. We also discuss
constructions. In particular, we show that for larger $s$, there are large
examples which are close in size to a union of intersecting families, but
structurally different.

Matching Conjecture for vector spaces and Cameron-Liebler line classes (and
their generalization to $k$-spaces), a popular topic in finite geometry for the

of features into user applications. However, the computational complexity of
these models makes it difficult to run them effectively on resource-constrained
mobile devices. Prior work approached the problem of supporting deep learning
in mobile applications by either decreasing model complexity or utilizing
powerful cloud servers. These approaches each only focus on a single aspect of
mobile inference and thus they often sacrifice overall performance.
  In this work we introduce a holistic approach to designing mobile deep
inference frameworks. We first identify the key goals of accuracy and latency
for mobile deep inference and the conditions that must be met to achieve them.
We demonstrate our holistic approach through the design of a hypothetical
framework called MDInference. This framework leverages two complementary
techniques; a model selection algorithm that chooses from a set of cloud-based
deep learning models to improve inference accuracy and an on-device request
duplication mechanism to bound latency. Through empirically-driven simulations
we show that MDInference improves aggregate accuracy over static approaches by
over 40% without incurring SLA violations. Additionally, we show that with a
target latency of 250ms, MDInference increased the aggregate accuracy in 99.74%
cases on faster university networks and 96.84% cases on residential networks.

low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) communications. OFDM continues its adoption
in the new IoT Wi-Fi standard due to its spectrum efficiency that can support
the demand of massive IoT connectivity. While the IoT Wi-Fi standard offers
many new features to improve power and spectrum efficiency, the basic physical
layer (PHY) structure of transceiver design still conforms to its conventional
design rationale where access points (AP) and clients employ the same OFDM PHY.
In this paper, we argue that current Wi-Fi PHY design does not take full
advantage of the inherent asymmetry between AP and IoT. To fill the gap, we
propose an asymmetric design where IoT devices transmit uplink packets using
the lowest power while pushing all the decoding burdens to the AP side. Such a
design utilizes the sufficient power and computational resources at AP to trade
for the transmission (TX) power of IoT devices. The core technique enabling
this asymmetric design is that the AP takes full power of its high clock rate
to boost the decoding ability. We provide an implementation of our design and
show that it can reduce up to 88% of the IoT's TX power when the AP sets
$8\times$ clock rate.

micro-architecture in ex vivo proximal femur specimens, as visualized on
multi-detector CT, for purposes of biomechanical bone strength prediction. To
this end, volumetric AMFs were computed locally for each voxel of volumes of
interest (VOI) extracted from the femoral head of 146 specimens. The local
anisotropy captured by such AMFs was quantified using a fractional anisotropy
measure; the magnitude and direction of anisotropy at every pixel was stored in
histograms that served as a feature vectors that characterized the VOIs. A
linear multi-regression analysis algorithm was used to predict the failure load
(FL) from the feature sets; the predicted FL was compared to the true FL
determined through biomechanical testing. The prediction performance was
measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) for each feature set. The best
prediction performance was obtained from the fractional anisotropy histogram of
AMF Euler Characteristic (RMSE = 1.01 +- 0.13), which was significantly better
than MDCT-derived mean BMD (RMSE = 1.12 +- 0.16, p<0.05). We conclude that such

Rician Fading is a small signal fading. Rician fading is a hypothetical model
for radio propagation inconsistency produced by fractional cancellation of a
radio signal by itself and as a result the signal reaches in the receiver by
several different paths. In this case, at least one of the destination paths is

both the metric functions, an equation of state (EoS) and a metric function
etc. However, such methods may not always lead to well-behaved solutions and
thereby rejection of the solutions may happen after complete calculations.
Indeed, very recent works on embedding class one methods suggested that the
chances of arriving at the well behaved-solution is very high thereby inspired
us to used it. In class one approach, we have to ansatz one of the metric
potentials and the other can be obtain from the Karmarkar condition. In this
paper, we are proposing new class one solution which is well-behaved in all
physical points of view. We have analyzed the nature of the solution by tuning
the $f(R,T)-$coupling parameter $\chi$ and found that the solution results into
stiffer EoS for $\chi=-1$ than $\chi=1$. This is because for lesser values of
$\chi$, velocity of sound is more, higher $M_{max}$ in $M-R$ curve and the EoS
parameter $\omega$ is larger. The solution satisfy the causality condition,
energy conditions, stable and static under radial perturbations (static
stability criterion) and in equilibrium (modified TOV-equation). The resulting
$M-R$ diagram from this solution is well fitted with observed values of few
compact stars such as PSR J1614-2230, Vela X-1, Cen X-3 and SAX J1808.4-3658.
Therefore, for different values of $\chi$, we have predicted the corresponding
radii and their respective moment of inertia from the $M-I$ curve.

have no problem engaging in tasks that inherently involve non-Archimedean
rewards, and since traditional reinforcement learning rewards are real numbers,
therefore traditional reinforcement learning probably will not lead to AGI. We
indicate two possible ways traditional reinforcement learning could be altered
to remove this roadblock.

to compute a discrete or continuous label for each pixel in the images.
Traditional convolutional layers in neural networks, initially designed for
image classification, are restrictive in these problems since the filter size
limits their receptive fields. In this work, we propose to replace any
traditional convolutional layer with an autoregressive moving-average (ARMA)
layer, a novel module with an adjustable receptive field controlled by the
learnable autoregressive coefficients. Compared with traditional convolutional
layers, our ARMA layer enables explicit interconnections of the output neurons
and learns its receptive field by adapting the autoregressive coefficients of
the interconnections. ARMA layer is adjustable to different types of tasks: for
tasks where global information is crucial, it is capable of learning relatively
large autoregressive coefficients to allow for an output neuron's receptive
field covering the entire input; for tasks where only local information is
required, it can learn small or near zero autoregressive coefficients and
automatically reduces to a traditional convolutional layer. We show both
theoretically and empirically that the effective receptive field of networks
with ARMA layers (named as ARMA networks) expands with larger autoregressive
coefficients. We also provably solve the instability problem of learning and
prediction in the ARMA layer through a re-parameterization mechanism.
Additionally, we demonstrate that ARMA networks substantially improve their
baselines on challenging dense prediction tasks including video prediction and
semantic segmentation.

Computer-aided pathology to analyze microscopic histopathology images for
diagnosis with an increasing number of breast cancer patients can bring the
cost and delays of diagnosis down. Deep learning in histopathology has
attracted attention over the last decade of achieving state-of-the-art
performance in classification and localization tasks. The convolutional neural
network, a deep learning framework, provides remarkable results in tissue
images analysis, but lacks in providing interpretation and reasoning behind the
decisions. We aim to provide a better interpretation of classification results
by providing localization on microscopic histopathology images. We frame the
image classification problem as weakly supervised multiple instance learning
problem where an image is collection of patches i.e. instances. Attention-based
multiple instance learning (A-MIL) learns attention on the patches from the
image to localize the malignant and normal regions in an image and use them to
classify the image. We present classification and localization results on two
publicly available BreakHIS and BACH dataset. The classification and
visualization results are compared with other recent techniques. The proposed
method achieves better localization results without compromising classification
accuracy.

in NLP. The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to
vector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their
contexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We
see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on
incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic
objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for
space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model
exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to
coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions
with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data.
Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in
mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a
metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for
path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called
Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places.
We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different
tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image
classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its
multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML
approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile
embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks.
Detailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution
at one scale but show poor performances in other scales. In contrast,
Space2Vec's multi-scale representation can handle distributions at different
scales.

sets, yet perform poorly on adversarially selected inputs. Most prior work on
adversarial inputs studies oversensitivity: semantically invariant text
perturbations that cause a model's prediction to change when it should not. In
this work we focus on the complementary problem: excessive prediction
undersensitivity, where input text is meaningfully changed but the model's
prediction does not, even though it should. We formulate a noisy adversarial
attack which searches among semantic variations of the question for which a
model erroneously predicts the same answer, and with even higher probability.
Despite comprising unanswerable questions, both SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA models are
vulnerable to this attack. This indicates that although accurate, models tend
to rely on spurious patterns and do not fully consider the information
specified in a question. We experiment with data augmentation and adversarial
training as defences, and find that both substantially decrease vulnerability
to attacks on held out data, as well as held out attack spaces. Addressing
undersensitivity also improves results on AddSent and AddOneSent, and models
furthermore generalise better when facing train/evaluation distribution
mismatch: they are less prone to overly rely on predictive cues present only in
the training set, and outperform a conventional model by as much as 10.9% F1.
