trained on a ""pretext task"" for which labels can be generated cheaply, without
human annotation. A central challenge in this approach is that the feature
extractor quickly learns to exploit low-level visual features such as color
aberrations or watermarks and then fails to learn useful semantic
representations. Much work has gone into identifying such ""shortcut"" features
and hand-designing schemes to reduce their effect. Here, we propose a general
framework for mitigating the effect shortcut features. Our key assumption is
that those features which are the first to be exploited for solving the pretext
task may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained to make the task
harder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext tasks and
datasets by training a ""lens"" network to make small image changes that
maximally reduce performance in the pretext task. Representations learned with
the modified images outperform those learned without in all tested cases.
Additionally, the modifications made by the lens reveal how the choice of
pretext task and dataset affects the features learned by self-supervision.

YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. An incoherent-to-coherent crossover due to the Hund's coupling
induced electronic correlation is revealed below the crossover temperature
$T^*\sim 75\pm15\,\mathrm{K}$. During the electronic crossover, both the Knight
shift ($K$) and the bulk magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) exhibit a similar
nonmonotonic temperature dependence, and a so-called Knight shift anomaly is
also revealed by a careful $K$-$\chi$ analysis. Such an electronic crossover
has been also observed in heavily hole-doped pnictide superconductors
\emph{A}Fe$_2$As$_2$ (\emph{A} = K, Rb, and Cs), which is ascribed to the
Hund's coupling induced electronic correlation. Below $T^*$, the spin-lattice
relaxation rate divided by temperature $(1/T_1T)$ shows a similar suppression
as the Knight shift, suggesting the absence of critical spin fluctuations. This
seems to be in conflict with a predicted magnetic quantum critical point (QCP)
near this system. However, considering a $\mathbf{q}$-dependent ""filter"" effect
on the transferred hyperfine field, a predominant spin fluctuation with A-type
correlation would be perfectly filtered out at $^{89}$Y sites, which is
consistent with the recent inelastic neutron scattering results. Therefore, our
results confirm that, through a Hund's coupling induced electronic crossover,
the magnetic ground state of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ becomes close to an itinerant
magnetic QCP with A-type spin fluctuations. In addition, the possible
superconducting pairing due to spin fluctuations is also discussed.

the impact of the number of task replicas on the offloading delay is

in a common way could provide great value to computational scientists by
solving various numerical and class design issues that routinely arise. This
paper describes the newly developed computational framework that we have built
for rapidly prototyping new physics codes. This framework, called turboPy, is a
lightweight physics modeling framework based on the design of the
particle-in-cell code turboWAVE. It implements a class (called Simulation)
which drives the simulation and manages communication between physics modules,
a class (called PhysicsModule) which handles the details of the dynamics of the
various parts of the problem, and some additional classes such as a Grid class
and a Diagnostic class to handle various ancillary issues that commonly arise.

subject of sustained research interest due to their extraordinary electronic
and optical properties. They also exhibit a wide range of structural phases
because of the different orientations that the atoms can have within a single
layer, or due to the ways that different layers can stack. Here we report the
first study of direct-visualization of structural transformations in
atomically-thin layers under highly non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions.
We probe these transformations at the atomic scale using real-time, aberration
corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and observe strong
dependence of the resulting structures and phases on both heating rate and
temperature. A fast heating rate (25 C/sec) yields highly ordered crystalline
hexagonal islands of sizes of less than 20 nm which are composed of a mixture
of 2H and 3R phases. However, a slow heating rate (25 C/min) yields
nanocrystalline and sub-stoichiometric amorphous regions. These differences are
explained by different rates of sulfur evaporation and redeposition. The use of
non-equilibrium heating rates to achieve highly crystalline and
quantum-confined features from 2D atomic layers present a new route to
synthesize atomically-thin, laterally confined nanostrucutres and opens new
avenues for investigating fundamental electronic phenomena in confined
dimensions.

compositions of eight enstatite chondrites and four aubrites and find that
there is a significant variation of K isotopic compositions among enstatite
meteorites (from -2.34 permil to -0.18 permil). However, K isotopic
compositions of nearly all enstatite meteorites scatter around the Bulk
Silicate Earth (BSE) value. The average K isotopic composition of the eight
enstatite chondrites (-0.47 +/- 0.57 permil) is indistinguishable from the BSE
value (-0.48 +/- 0.03 permil), thus further corroborating the isotopic
similarity between Earth' building blocks and enstatite meteorite precursors.
We found no correlation of K isotopic compositions with the chemical groups,
petrological types, shock degrees, and terrestrial weathering conditions;
however, the variation of K isotopes among enstatite meteorite can be
attributed to the parent body processing. Our sample of the main group aubrite
MIL 13004 is exceptional and has an extremely light K isotopic composition
(delta 41K= -2.34 +/- 0.12 permil). We attribute this unique K isotopic feature

In an empirical application, we find that for one-day ahead volatility matrix

the SUPERBLINK high proper motion catalog. CPM pairs are found by searching for
pairs of stars with angular separations $< 1$ degree and proper motion
differences $\Delta\mu < 40$ mas/year. A Bayesian analysis is then applied in
two steps. In a first pass, we use proper motion differences and angular
separations to distinguish between binaries and chance alignments. In a second
pass, we use parallax data from Gaia DR2 to refine our Bayesian probability
estimates. We present a table of 119,390 pairs which went through the full
analysis, 99,203 of which have probabilities $>95\%$ of being real binaries. Of
those 99,203 high probability pairs, we estimate that only about 364 pairs are
most likely to be false positives. In addition, we identify 57,506 pairs which
have probabilities $>10\%$ from the first pass but have high parallax errors
and therefore were not vetted in the second pass. We examine the projected
physical separation distribution of our highest probability pairs and note that
the distribution is a simple exponential tail and shows no evidence of being
bi-modal. Among pairs with lower probability, wide binaries are detected at
larger separations ($>10^{4-5}$ AU) consistent with the very wide population
suggested in previous studies, however our analysis suggests that these do not
represent a distinct population. We examine the HR diagram of this set of high
probability wide binaries and find evidence for 980 over-luminous components
among 2,227 K+K wide binaries; assuming these represent unresolved sub-systems,
we determine that the higher order multiplicity fraction for K+K wide systems
is at least 39.6\%.

turbulent channel flow. Different actions are proposed, varying the size,
duration and sign of a localised volumetric force that acts near one wall of a
turbulent channel flow, running at a small Reynolds ($Re_\tau=165$) in a small
computational domain. The effect of each action is evaluated comparing the
evolution of the flow with and without the action, gathering statistics over
1700 repetitions of the experiment for each action. The analysis of the results
show that small/short forcings are equally likely to increase or decrease the
skin friction drag, independently of the sign of the forcing (i.e., towards or
away from the wall). When the size or the duration of the forcing increases, so
does the probability of increasing the skin friction. Then, an ""a priori""
analysis is performed, evaluating the state of the flow just before the action,
conditioned to actions that result in a decrease of the skin friction over a
period of one eddy turn-over time. The resulting fields of velocity, wall shear
stresses and wall pressure are consistent with an opposition control strategy,
where the forcing is opposing the vertical motions near the wall. Finally, a
preliminary analysis of the performance of actuation triggered by pressure or
wall shear stresses sensors is evaluated (i.e., ""a posteriori"" analysis). Our
results show that the actuation triggered by a wall shear sensor seems to be
more effective than the actuation triggered by a wall pressure sensor, at least
for the preliminary definitions of sensors and thresholds used here.

small-scale simulations with no more than O(103) particles. Here, we expand
IB-LBM for massive particle-laden flows with more than O(104) particles by two
sequential works. First is the Part I: serial computing on a single CPU core
and following the Part II: parallel computing on many CPU cores. In this Part I
paper, a highly efficient and localized implementation of IB-LBM is proposed
for serial computing. We optimize in three main aspects: swap algorithm for
incompressible LBM, local grid-to-point algorithm for IBM and improved grid
search algorithm for particle pair short-range interaction. In addition,
symmetry algorithm is proposed for the half-calculation of LB collision and
external force term. The computational performance on a single CPU core is
analyzed. Different scales of two dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
particles settling in closed cavities are used for testing. The solid volume
fraction is varied from 0 to 0.40. Simulation results demonstrate that all
calculation parts are dramatically decreased by the improved algorithm. For the
particle-free flows, the Mega Lattice Site Update per Second (MLUPS) can be
achieved up to 36 (2D) and 12 (3D) using the improved algorithm. For the
particle-laden flows, MLUPS can be achieved no lower than 15 (2D) and 7 (3D) in

approach in the general setting of a first-order optimization algorithm, with
possibly biased update directions subject to a geometric drift condition. We
then derive bounds on the expected running time for early stopping variants of

protocol for condition monitoring and anomaly detection in the industrial
Internet of things (IIoT). In the IIoT, the collection, processing, encoding,
and transmission of the sensor readings are usually not for the reconstruction
of the original data but for decision making at the fusion center. By moving
the decision making process to the local end devices, the amount of data
transmission can be significantly reduced, especially when normal signals with
positive decisions dominate in the whole life cycle and the fusion center is
only interested in collecting the abnormal data. The proposed concept combines
compressive sensing, machine learning, data transmission, and joint decision
making. The sensor readings are encoded and transmitted to the fusion center
only when abnormal signals with negative decisions are detected. All the
abnormal signals from the end devices are gathered at the fusion center for a
joint decision with feedback messages forwarded to the local actuators. The
advantage of such an approach lies in that it can significantly reduce the
volume of data to be transmitted through wireless links. Moreover, the
introduction of compressive sensing can further reduce the dimension of data
tremendously. An exemplary case, i.e., diesel engine condition monitoring, is
provided to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme
compared to the conventional ones.

classifiers with tiny perturbations of the input, there has been much
discussion whether they are a ""bug"" that is specific to current neural
architectures and training methods or an inevitable ""feature"" of high
dimensional geometry. In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial
examples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct
realistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be
efficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions under
which these classifiers are provably robust against any adversarial attack even
in high dimensions. Our results show that even when these ""gold standard""
optimal classifiers are robust, CNNs trained on the same datasets consistently
learn a vulnerable classifier, indicating that adversarial examples are often
an avoidable ""bug"". We further show that RBF SVMs trained on the same data
consistently learn a robust classifier. The same trend is observed in
experiments with real images in different datasets.

By directly calculating the critical exponents and constructing the effective
theory in the corresponding critical regime, we find the emergent criticality

  gigahertz magnetic fields",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The novel ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions driven by microwave magnetic
fields, with the motion direction and speed tunable by field parameters,
provides a promising route to drive magnetic skyrmions in materials with poor
conductivity. However, as an indirect motion, skyrmion ratchet motion speed is
generally low in comparison with the direct motions driven by current. Toward
practical applications, it is important to ask if there are mechanisms to
realize ultrafast ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions and how such novel
motion can be integrated into racetrack-type skyrmion devices. In this work, we
explore the effects of defects and edges on the ratchet motion of magnetic
skyrmions under time-varying magnetic fields in GHz. We demonstrate that the
ratchet motion of skyrmion is not only guided along the defect tracks or edges,
but also with a remarkable speed-up (with a factor over ten) compared with that
in the bulk region. The skyrmion ratchet motion speed reaches 100 m/s along a
straight defect track/edge and 10^9 rad/s along a circular edge under a field
of ~50 mT, comparable to those direct motions driven by currents. Moreover, the
skyrmion ratchet motion along the defect track/edge can be facilely controlled
by the field and defect parameters. Analysis based on time-averaged Thiele
equation of skyrmion verifies that such a speed-up effect is due to the
increased time-averaged driving force perpendicular to the skyrmion motion when
it approaches the defect track or edge, analogous to that discovered in direct
motions driven by currents.

encoder of text appears to be at odds with the inherent contextualization and
non-permanence of language use in a dynamic world. However, mapping sentences
into generic fixed-length vectors for downstream similarity and retrieval tasks
has been fruitful, particularly for multilingual applications. How do we manage
this dilemma? In this work we propose Contextual Lensing, a methodology for
inducing context-oriented universal sentence vectors. We break the construction
of universal sentence vectors into a core, variable length, sentence matrix
representation equipped with an adaptable `lens' from which fixed-length
vectors can be induced as a function of the lens context. We show that it is
possible to focus notions of language similarity into a small number of lens
parameters given a core universal matrix representation. For example, we
demonstrate the ability to encode translation similarity of sentences across
several languages into a single weight matrix, even when the core encoder has
not seen parallel data.

  Planning Problems","Submitted to Applied Soft Computing",,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Real-world and complex problems have usually many objective functions that
have to be optimized all at once. Over the last decades, Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are designed to solve this kind of problems.
Nevertheless, some problems have many objectives which lead to a large number
of non-dominated solutions obtained by the optimization algorithms. The large
set of non-dominated solutions hinders the selection of the most appropriate
solution by the decision maker. This paper presents a new algorithm that has
been designed to obtain the most significant solutions from the Pareto Optimal
Frontier (POF). This approach is based on the cone-domination applied to MOEA,
which can find the knee point solutions. In order to obtain the best cone
angle, we propose a hypervolume-distribution metric, which is used to
self-adapt the angle during the evolving process. This new algorithm has been
applied to the real world application in Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Mission
Planning Problem. The experimental results show a significant improvement of
the algorithm performance in terms of hypervolume, number of solutions, and
also the required number of generations to converge.

This development is considered key in the hunt for low-mass rocky exoplanets
around solar-type stars whose discovery with the radial-velocity method
requires cm/s Doppler precision. In order to prove such precise calibration
with an LFC, it must be compared to another calibrator of at least the same
precision. Being the best available spectrograph calibrator, this means
comparing it to a second - fully independent - LFC. This test had long been
pending, but our installation of two LFCs at the ultra-stable spectrograph
HARPS presented the so far unique opportunity for simultaneous calibrations
with two separate LFCs. Although limited in time, the test results confirm the
1 cm/s stability that has long been anticipated by the astronomical community.

entropy of black holes without any particular symmetry in loop quantum gravity.
The idea of characterizing the shape of a horizon by a sequence of local areas
is successfully applied in the scheme to calculate the entropy by the $SO(1,1)$
BF boundary theory matching loop quantum gravity in the bulk. The generating
function for calculating the microscopical degrees of freedom of a given
isolated horizon is obtained. Numerical computations of small black holes
indicate a new entropy formula containing the quantum correction related to the
partition of the horizon. Further evidence shows that, for a given horizon
area, the entropy decreases as a black hole deviates from the spherically
symmetric one, and the entropy formula is also well suitable for big black
holes.

computer programming. In machine learning, it is often used for robust

includes many kinks where it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the
related ranking operator, often used for order statistics and ranking metrics.
It is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or
undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting
and ranking, they do not achieve the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one would
expect from sorting and ranking operations. In this paper, we propose the first
differentiable sorting and ranking operators with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$
space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and
differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable operators
as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and
using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our
approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase
two novel applications: differentiable Spearman's rank correlation coefficient

$p=K \rho^{\Gamma}$, considerable differences in the mass-radius relationships
are found. On the other hand, we also explore quark stars models using the MIT

cognition, behavior, and risk for pathology is a fundamental question in basic

modelling complex non-linear functions. However, it is not clear that complex
functions actually exist between brain connectivity and behavior, and thus if
deep neural networks necessarily outperform simpler linear models, or if their
results would be interpretable. Here we show that, across 52 subject measures
of cognition and behavior, deep neural networks fit to each brain region's
connectivity outperform linear regression, particularly for the brain's
connector hubs--regions with diverse brain connectivity--whereas the two
approaches perform similarly when fit to brain systems. Critically, averaging
deep neural network predictions across brain regions results in the most
accurate predictions, demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to
easily model the various functions that exists between regional brain
connectivity and behavior, carving the brain at its joints. Finally, we shine
light into the black box of deep neural networks using multislice network
models. We determined that the relationship between connector hubs and behavior
is best captured by modular deep neural networks. Our results demonstrate that
both simple and complex relationships exist between brain connectivity and
behavior, and that deep neural networks can fit both. Moreover, deep neural
networks are particularly powerful when they are first fit to the various
functions of a system independently and then combined. Finally, deep neural
networks are interpretable when their architectures are structurally

to check whether a module induced in homology by a bifiltration is

complexity than state-of-the-art decomposition methods for general 2-parameter

quadratic regime the SOCGS algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\log(\log
1/\varepsilon))$ first-order and Hessian oracle calls and $\mathcal{O}(\log
(1/\varepsilon) \log(\log1/\varepsilon))$ linear minimization oracle calls to
achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. This algorithm is useful when the
feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization
oracle, and computing first-order information of the function, although
possible, is costly.

  Systems with Multiple Dispatchers","2 figures",,,,"cs.PF cs.DC math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the load balancing problem in large-scale heterogeneous systems
with multiple dispatchers. We introduce a general framework called
Local-Estimation-Driven (LED). Under this framework, each dispatcher keeps
local (possibly outdated) estimates of queue lengths for all the servers, and
the dispatching decision is made purely based on these local estimates. The
local estimates are updated via infrequent communications between dispatchers
and servers. We derive sufficient conditions for LED policies to achieve
throughput optimality and delay optimality in heavy-traffic, respectively.
These conditions directly imply delay optimality for many previous local-memory
based policies in heavy traffic. Moreover, the results enable us to design new
delay optimal policies for heterogeneous systems with multiple dispatchers.
Finally, the heavy-traffic delay optimality of the LED framework directly
resolves a recent open problem on how to design optimal load balancing schemes
using delayed information.

grounded vision and language embeddings. Biases are present in grounded
embeddings, and indeed seem to be equally or more significant than for
ungrounded embeddings. This is despite the fact that vision and language can
suffer from different biases, which one might hope could attenuate the biases
in both. Multiple ways exist to generalize metrics measuring bias in word
embeddings to this new setting. We introduce the space of generalizations
(Grounded-WEAT and Grounded-SEAT) and demonstrate that three generalizations
answer different yet important questions about how biases, language, and vision
interact. These metrics are used on a new dataset, the first for grounded bias,
created by augmenting extending standard linguistic bias benchmarks with 10,228
images from COCO, Conceptual Captions, and Google Images. Dataset construction
is challenging because vision datasets are themselves very biased. The presence
of these biases in systems will begin to have real-world consequences as they
are deployed, making carefully measuring bias and then mitigating it critical
to building a fair society.

blockchain relies on the premise of honest-majority, namely, the blockchain
system is assumed to be secure as long as the majority of consensus voting
power is honest. And in the case of proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, adversaries
cannot control more than 50% of the network's gross computing power. However,
this 50% threshold is based on the analysis of computing power only, with
implicit and idealistic assumptions on the network and node behavior. Recent
researches have alluded that factors such as network connectivity, presence of
blockchain forks, and mining strategy could undermine the consensus security
assured by the honest-majority, but neither concrete analysis nor quantitative
evaluation is provided. In this paper we fill the gap by proposing an
analytical model to assess the impact of network connectivity on the consensus
security of PoW blockchain under different adversary models. We apply our
analytical model to two adversarial scenarios: 1)
honest-but-potentially-colluding, 2) selfish mining. For each scenario, we
quantify the communication capability of nodes involved in a fork race and
estimate the adversary's mining revenue and its impact on security properties
of the consensus protocol. Simulation results validated our analysis. Our
modeling and analysis provide a paradigm for assessing the security impact of
various factors in a distributed consensus system.

extractors for the task of iris recognition. The question arises: should we
train such structures from scratch on a relatively large iris image dataset, or
it is better to fine-tune the existing models to adapt them to a new domain? In
this work we explore five different sets of weights for the popular ResNet-50
architecture to find out whether iris-specific feature extractors perform
better than models trained for non-iris tasks. Features are extracted from each
convolutional layer and the classification accuracy achieved by a Support
Vector Machine is measured on a dataset that is disjoint from the samples used
in training of the ResNet-50 model. We show that the optimal training strategy
is to fine-tune an off-the-shelf set of weights to the iris recognition domain.
This approach results in greater accuracy than both off-the-shelf weights and a
model trained from scratch. The winning, fine-tuned approach also shows an
increase in performance when compared to previous work, in which only
off-the-shelf (not fine-tuned) models were used in iris feature extraction. We
make the best-performing ResNet-50 model, fine-tuned with more than 360,000

4U 1901+03 observed with Insight-HXMT and NICER. Both spectra and pulse
profiles evolve significantly in the decaying phase of the outburst. Dozens of
flares are observed throughout the outburst. They are more frequent and
brighter at the outburst peak. We find that the flares, which have a duration
from tens to hundreds of seconds, are generally brighter than the persistent
emission by a factor of $\sim$ 1.5. The pulse profile shape during the flares
can be significantly different than that of the persistent emission. In
particular, a phase shift is clearly observed in many cases. We interpret these
findings as direct evidence of changes of the pulsed beam pattern, due to
transitions between the sub- and super-critical accretion regimes on a short
time scale. We also observe that at comparable luminosities the flares' pulse
profiles are rather similar to those of the persistent emission. This indicates
that the accretion on the polar cap of the neutron star is mainly determined by
the luminosity, i.e., the mass accretion rate.

address issues of isolation, performance, compatibility, failure
recoverability, and run-time upgrades. LibrettOS acts as a microkernel OS that
runs servers in an isolated manner. LibrettOS can also act as a library OS
when, for better performance, selected applications are granted exclusive
access to virtual hardware resources such as storage and networking.
Furthermore, applications can switch between the two OS modes with no
interruption at run-time. LibrettOS has a uniquely distinguishing advantage in
that, the two paradigms seamlessly coexist in the same OS, enabling users to
simultaneously exploit their respective strengths (i.e., greater isolation,
high performance). Systems code, such as device drivers, network stacks, and
file systems remain identical in the two modes, enabling dynamic mode switching
and reducing development and maintenance costs.
  To illustrate these design principles, we implemented a prototype of
LibrettOS using rump kernels, allowing us to reuse existent, hardened NetBSD
device drivers and a large ecosystem of POSIX/BSD-compatible applications. We
use hardware (VM) virtualization to strongly isolate different rump kernel
instances from each other. Because the original rumprun unikernel targeted a
much simpler model for uniprocessor systems, we redesigned it to support
multicore systems. Unlike kernel-bypass libraries such as DPDK, applications
need not be modified to benefit from direct hardware access. LibrettOS also
supports indirect access through a network server that we have developed.
Applications remain uninterrupted even when network components fail or need to
be upgraded. Finally, to efficiently use hardware resources, applications can
dynamically switch between the indirect and direct modes based on their I/O
load at run-time.

theoretically in speeding up the training of kernel machines while retaining

approaches proposed to exploit Nystr\""{o}m method in scaling up kernel
machines. However, there is no comparative study over these approaches, and
they were individually analyzed for specific types of kernel machines.
Therefore, it remains a question that the philosophy of which approach is more
promising when it extends to other kernel machines. In this work, motivated by
the column inclusion property of Gram matrices, we develop a new approach with
a clear geometric interpretation for running Nystr\""{o}m-based kernel machines.
We show that the other two well-studied approaches can be equivalently
transformed to be our proposed one. Consequently, analysis established for the
proposed approach also works for these two. Particularly, our proposed approach
makes it possible to develop approximation errors in a general setting.
Besides, our analysis also manifests the relations among the aforementioned two
approaches and another naive one. First, the analytical forms of the
corresponding approximate solutions are only at odds with one term. Second, the
naive approach can be implemented efficiently by sharing the same training
procedure with others. These analytical results lead to the conjecture that the
naive approach can provide more accurate approximate solutions than the other
two sophisticated approaches. Since our analysis also offers ways for computing
the accuracy of these approximate solutions, we run experiments with
classification tasks to confirm our conjecture.

Pedestrian intent, defined as the future action of crossing or not-crossing the

navigate safely and more smoothly. We approach the problem of intent prediction
from two different perspectives and anticipate the intention-to-cross within
both pedestrian-centric and location-centric scenarios. In addition, we

operands, while outer product based approach suffers from poor output locality
due to numerous partial product matrices. Inefficiency in the reuse of either
inputs or outputs data leads to extensive and expensive DRAM access.
  To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient sparse matrix
multiplication accelerator architecture, SpArch, which jointly optimizes the
data locality for both input and output matrices. We first design a highly
parallelized streaming-based merger to pipeline the multiply and merge stage of
partial matrices so that partial matrices are merged on chip immediately after
produced. We then propose a condensed matrix representation that reduces the
number of partial matrices by three orders of magnitude and thus reduces DRAM
access by 5.4x. We further develop a Huffman tree scheduler to improve the
scalability of the merger for larger sparse matrices, which reduces the DRAM
access by another 1.8x. We also resolve the increased input matrix read induced
by the new representation using a row prefetcher with near-optimal buffer
replacement policy, further reducing the DRAM access by 1.5x. Evaluated on 20
benchmarks, SpArch reduces the total DRAM access by 2.8x over previous
state-of-the-art. On average, SpArch achieves 4x, 19x, 18x, 17x, 1285x speedup
and 6x, 164x, 435x, 307x, 62x energy savings over OuterSPACE, MKL, cuSPARSE,
CUSP, and ARM Armadillo, respectively.

  Models",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shifts in environment between development and deployment cause classical
supervised learning to produce models that fail to generalize well to new
target distributions. Recently, many solutions which find invariant predictive
distributions have been developed. Among these, graph-based approaches do not
require data from the target environment and can capture more stable
information than alternative methods which find stable feature sets. However,
these approaches assume that the data generating process is known in the form
of a full causal graph, which is generally not the case. In this paper, we
propose I-SPEC, an end-to-end framework that addresses this shortcoming by
using data to learn a partial ancestral graph (PAG). Using the PAG we develop
an algorithm that determines an interventional distribution that is stable to
the declared shifts; this subsumes existing approaches which find stable
feature sets that are less accurate. We apply I-SPEC to a mortality prediction
problem to show it can learn a model that is robust to shifts without needing
upfront knowledge of the full causal DAG.

  Non-uniform Subsampling of Gradients",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods leverage gradient information of
the potential function of target distribution to explore sample space
efficiently. However, computing gradients can often be computationally
expensive for large scale applications, such as those in contemporary machine
learning. Stochastic Gradient (SG-)MCMC methods approximate gradients by
stochastic ones, commonly via uniformly subsampled data points, and achieve
improved computational efficiency, however at the price of introducing sampling
error. We propose a non-uniform subsampling scheme to improve the sampling
accuracy. The proposed exponentially weighted stochastic gradient (EWSG) is
designed so that a non-uniform-SG-MCMC method mimics the statistical behavior
of a batch-gradient-MCMC method, and hence the inaccuracy due to SG
approximation is reduced. EWSG differs from classical variance reduction (VR)
techniques as it focuses on the entire distribution instead of just the
variance; nevertheless, its reduced local variance is also proved. EWSG can
also be viewed as an extension of the importance sampling idea, successful for
stochastic-gradient-based optimizations, to sampling tasks. In our practical
implementation of EWSG, the non-uniform subsampling is performed efficiently
via a Metropolis-Hastings chain on the data index, which is coupled to the MCMC
algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided, not only to demonstrate EWSG's
effectiveness, but also to guide hyperparameter choices, and validate our
\emph{non-asymptotic global error bound} despite of approximations in the
implementation. Notably, while statistical accuracy is improved, convergence
speed can be comparable to the uniform version, which renders EWSG a practical
alternative to VR (but EWSG and VR can be combined too).

physics of spacetime wormholes to `baby universes' and an ensemble of theories.
We revisit such ideas, using features associated with a negative cosmological
constant and asymptotically AdS boundaries to strengthen the results, introduce
a change in perspective, and connect with recent replica wormhole discussions
of the Page curve. A key new feature is an emphasis on the role of null states.
We explore this structure in detail in simple topological models of the bulk
that allow us to compute the full spectrum of associated boundary theories. The
dimension of the asymptotically AdS Hilbert space turns out to become a random
variable $Z$, whose value can be less than the naive number $k$ of independent
states in the theory. For $k>Z$, consistency arises from an exact degeneracy in
the inner product defined by the gravitational path integral, so that many a
priori independent states differ only by a null state. We argue that a similar
property must hold in any consistent gravitational path integral. We also
comment on other aspects of extrapolations to more complicated models, and on
possible implications for the black hole information problem in the individual
members of the above ensemble.

higher-redshift ($z\sim6.5$) bins and ran Monte Carlo trials, incorporating the
strength of the Ly$\alpha$ emission and the photometric redshift of the

EW(Ly$\alpha$)$>$25{\AA} at $3\sigma$ at the fiducial depth of our survey, and
only those galaxies with EW(Ly$\alpha$)$>$25{\AA} as true LAEs, and finally,
only objects with $m_{AB}<26.8$, we found the LAE fraction to be flat, or
modestly increase from 0.26$\pm0.04$ to 0.30$\pm0.04$. These values relative to
those for lower-redshift samples are consistent with a rising LAE fraction with
redshift out to $z\sim6$, but at $z\sim6.5$ there is some tension between our
results and results from surveys at intrinsically brighter luminosities. We
conclude intrinsically fainter galaxies have Ly$\alpha$ emission, and there is
a steep drop in the LAE fraction from our high-redshift sample at $z\sim6.5$
and from similar galaxies at $z\sim7.5$. This likely indicates we are
witnessing the tail end of the epoch of reionization, as such a drop is not
expected due to changes of intrinsic galaxy properties between these redshifts.

learning, various vector compression schemes, such as quantization,
sparsification and dithering, have become very popular. In designing a
compression method, one aims to communicate as few bits as possible, which
minimizes the cost per communication round, while at the same time attempting
to impart as little distortion (variance) to the communicated messages as
possible, which minimizes the adverse effect of the compression on the overall
number of communication rounds. However, intuitively, these two goals are
fundamentally in conflict: the more compression we allow, the more distorted
the messages become. We formalize this intuition and prove an {\em uncertainty
principle} for randomized compression operators, thus quantifying this
limitation mathematically, and {\em effectively providing asymptotically tight
lower bounds on what might be achievable with communication compression}.
Motivated by these developments, we call for the search for the optimal
compression operator. In an attempt to take a first step in this direction, we
consider an unbiased compression method inspired by the Kashin representation
of vectors, which we call {\em Kashin compression (KC)}. In contrast to all
previously proposed compression mechanisms, KC enjoys a {\em dimension
independent} variance bound for which we derive an explicit formula even in the
regime when only a few bits need to be communicate per each vector entry.

In this work we investigate, given the current interest in neural networks, if
Gabor kernels are the only family of functions performing best in iris
recognition, or if better filters can be learned directly from iris data. We
use (on purpose) a single-layer convolutional neural network as it mimics an
iris code-based algorithm. We learn two sets of data-driven kernels; one
starting from randomly initialized weights and the other from open-source set
of Gabor kernels. Through experimentation, we show that the network does not
converge on Gabor kernels, instead converging on a mix of edge detectors, blob
detectors and simple waves. In our experiments carried out with three
subject-disjoint datasets we found that the performance of these learned
kernels is comparable to the open-source Gabor kernels. These lead us to two
conclusions: (a) a family of functions offering optimal performance in iris
recognition is wider than Gabor kernels, and (b) we probably hit the maximum
performance for an iris coding algorithm that uses a single convolutional
layer, yet with multiple filters. Released with this work is a framework to
learn data-driven kernels that can be easily transplanted into open-source iris

We show that while the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\alpha$)) and the
Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f^{Ly\alpha}_{esc}$) are not significantly
correlated with the central SFI ($S_{\rm 250pc}$), both are positively
correlated with the ratio of surface brightness to galaxy stellar mass ($S_{\rm

equilibrium in the gravitational potential of a galaxy, $P_\mathrm{DE}$. To do
this, we combine arcsecond resolution CO data from PHANGS-ALMA with
multi-wavelength data that traces the atomic gas, stellar structure, and star
formation rate (SFR) for 28 nearby star-forming galaxies. We find that
$P_\mathrm{turb}$ correlates with, but almost always exceeds the estimated
$P_\mathrm{DE}$ on kiloparsec scales. This indicates that the molecular gas is
over-pressurized relative to the large-scale environment. We show that this
over-pressurization can be explained by the clumpy nature of molecular gas; a
revised estimate of $P_\mathrm{DE}$ on cloud scales, which accounts for
molecular gas self-gravity, external gravity, and ambient pressure, agrees well
with the observed $P_\mathrm{turb}$ in galaxy disks. We also find that
molecular gas with cloud-scale
${P_\mathrm{turb}}\approx{P_\mathrm{DE}}\gtrsim{10^5\,k_\mathrm{B}\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}}$
in our sample is more likely to be self-gravitating, whereas gas at lower
pressure appears more influenced by ambient pressure and/or external gravity.
Furthermore, we show that the ratio between $P_\mathrm{turb}$ and the observed
SFR surface density, $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, is compatible with stellar
feedback-driven momentum injection in most cases, while a subset of the regions
may show evidence of turbulence driven by additional sources. The correlation
between $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and kpc-scale $P_\mathrm{DE}$ in galaxy disks is
consistent with the expectation from self-regulated star formation models.
Finally, we confirm the empirical correlation between molecular-to-atomic gas
ratio and kpc-scale $P_\mathrm{DE}$ reported in previous works.

convolved the observed galaxy stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) function with a grid
of M$_{\star}$-independent Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm EDD}$) distributions,
normalised via empirical black hole accretion rate (BHAR) to star formation
rate (SFR) relations. Our simple approach yields an excellent agreement with
the observed XLF since z$\sim$3. We find that the redshift evolution of the
observed XLF can only be reproduced through an intrinsic flattening of the
$\lambda_{\rm EDD}$ distribution, and with a positive shift of the break
$\lambda^{*}$, consistent with an anti-hierarchical behavior. The AGN accretion
history is predominantly made by massive (10$^{10}<$M$_{\star}<$10$^{11}$

with galaxy mergers, becomes dominant only in bright quasars, at $\log$(L$_{\rm

strongly favor a M$_{\star}$-dependent ratio between BHAR and SFR, as BHAR/SFR
$\propto$ M$_{\star}^{0.73[+0.22,-0.29]}$, supporting a non-linear BH buildup

brightness. Overall, the observed [SII]6716/6731 ratio is consistent within
1$\sigma$ with $n_e$ < 30 cm$^{-3}$, with an almost identical distribution for
the DIG and HII regions. The velocity dispersion of the ionised gas indicates
that the DIG has a higher degree of turbulence than the HII regions. Comparison
with photoionisation and shock models reveals that the diffuse component can
only partially be explained via shocks and that it is most likely consistent
with photons leaking from density bounded HII regions or with radiation from
evolved field stars. [abridged]

coming from the nucleus of the galaxy GSN 069, here we report on the detection
of QPEs in the active galaxy named RX J1301.9+2747. QPEs are rapid and
recurrent increases of the X-ray count-rate by more than one order of magnitude
with respect to a stable quiescent level. During a XMM-Newton observation
lasting 48 ks that was performed on 30 and 31 May 2019, three strong QPEs
lasting about half an hour each were detected in the light curves of RX
J1301.9+2747. The first two QPEs are separated by a longer recurrence time
(about 20 ks) compared to the second and third (about 13 ks). This pattern is
consistent with the alternating long-short recurrence times of the GSN 069
QPEs, although the difference between the consecutive recurrence times is
significantly smaller in GSN 069. Longer X-ray observations will better clarify
the temporal pattern of the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 and will allow a detailed
comparison with GSN 069 to be performed. The X-ray spectral properties of QPEs
in the two sources are remarkably similar, with QPEs representing fast
transitions from a relatively cold and likely disk-dominated state to a state
that is characterized by a warmer emission similar to the so-called soft X-ray
excess, a component that is almost ubiquitously seen in the X-ray spectra of
unobscured, radiatively efficient active galaxies. Previous X-ray observations
of RX J1301.9+2747 in 2000 and 2009 strongly suggest that QPEs have been
present for at least the past 18.5 years. The detection of QPEs from a second
galactic nucleus after GSN 069 rules out contamination by a Galactic source in
both cases, such that QPEs ought to be considered a novel extragalactic
phenomenon associated with accreting supermassive black holes.

dimensional frustrated spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet, which was previously
shown to harbor a special exactly solvable point with ""three-coloring"" ground
states in its phase diagram. For appropriately chosen initial product states --
for example, those which correspond to any state of valid three-colors -- we
show the presence of robust quantum revivals, which survive the addition of
anisotropic terms. We also suggest avenues for future experiments which may see
this effect in real materials.

Fourier perturbation algorithm, which is a differential privacy mechanism, and
correct a scaling mistake in its proof. Furthermore, we illustrate significant

anisotropic materials can exhibit nonzero Hall viscosity components. We show
that in 3D anisotropic materials the electronic fluid stress can couple to the

the variations in star formation activity, comparing the properties of giant

efficiency (SFE) is necessary. We thus focus on a strongly barred galaxy to
investigate the impact of the galactic environment on the GMCs properties,
because the SFE is clearly lower in bar regions than in arm regions. In this
paper, we present the $^{12}$CO($1-0$) observations toward the western bar, arm
and bar-end regions of the strongly barred galaxy NGC1300 with ALMA 12-m array
at a high angular resolution of $\sim$40 pc. We detected GMCs associated with
the dark lanes not only in the arm and bar-end regions but also in the bar
region, where massive star formation is not seen. Using the CPROPS algorithm,
we identified and characterized 233 GMCs across the observed regions. Based on
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find that there is virtually no significant
variations in GMC properties (e.g., radius, velocity dispersion, molecular gas
mass, and virial parameter) among the bar, arm and bar-end region. These
results suggest that systematic differences in the physical properties of the
GMCs are not the cause for SFE differences with environments, and that there
should be other mechanisms which control the SFE of the GMCs such as fast
cloud-cloud collisions in NGC1300.

end up in a fully dimerized phase at very large $J_2/J_1$. In the field theory
language, this implies that the coupling constant of the marginal operator
responsible for dimerization changes sign three times. For large enough $J_3$,
the fully dimerized phase is stabilized for all $J_2$, and the phase
transitions between the critical phases and this phase are both
Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_3$ along part of the boundary and turn first

started. However, some challenges are arising in the deployment, integration of

and many questions arise such as whether 5G has long-term evolution or when 5G
will change to a next-generation one. This paper provides long-term migration
options and paths towards 5G considering many key factors such as the cost,
local/national data traffic, marketing, and the standardization trends in the
radio access network (RAN), the transport network (TN), the core network (CN),

representation learning either ignores scene background or treats the whole
scene as one object. Meanwhile, work that considers scene compositionality
treats scene objects only as image patches or 2D layers with alpha maps.
Inspired by the computer graphics pipeline, we design BlockGAN to learn to
first generate 3D features of background and foreground objects, then combine
them into 3D features for the wholes cene, and finally render them into
realistic images. This allows BlockGAN to reason over occlusion and interaction
between objects' appearance, such as shadow and lighting, and provides control
over each object's 3D pose and identity, while maintaining image realism.
BlockGAN is trained end-to-end, using only unlabelled single images, without
the need for 3D geometry, pose labels, object masks, or multiple views of the
same scene. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features to represent
objects allows BlockGAN to learn disentangled representations both in terms of
objects (foreground and background) and their properties (pose and identity).

regression depend on data instances with a fixed number of features. As a
result, those methods cannot be directly applied to variable-length time series
data. One common approach is to perform classification over a sliding window on
the data and aggregate the decisions made at local sections of the time series
in some way, through majority voting for classification or averaging for
regression. The downside to this approach is that minority local information is
lost in the voting process and averaging assumes that each time series
measurement is equal in significance. Also, since time series can be of varying
length, the quality of votes and averages could vary greatly in cases where
there is a close voting tie or bimodal distribution of regression domain.
Summarization conducted by the \textit{SummerTime} method will be a
fixed-length feature vector which can be used in-place of the time series
dataset for use with classical machine learning methods. We use Gaussian
Mixture models (GMM) over small same-length disjoint windows in the time series
to group local data into clusters. The time series' rate of membership for each
cluster will be a feature in the summarization. The model is naturally capable
of converging to an appropriate cluster count. We compare our results to
state-of-the-art studies in physical activity classification and show
high-quality improvement by classifying with only the summarization. Finally,
we show that regression using the summarization can augment energy expenditure
estimation, producing more robust and precise results.

probability $1$ unless computational assumptions are used. Despite its
importance, no physical implementation has been proposed for quantum weak coin
flipping. Here, we present a practical protocol that requires a single photon

Monte Carlo methods and improving the accuracy by replacing IID uniform random
points with quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) points. Recently, it has been shown that
Markov chain QMC remains consistent when the driving sequences are completely
uniformly distributed (CUD). However, the definition of CUD sequences is not
constructive, so an implementation method using short-period Tausworthe
generators (i.e., linear feedback shift register generators over the
two-element field) that approximate CUD sequences has been proposed. In this
paper, we conduct an exhaustive search of short-period Tausworthe generators
for Markov chain QMC in terms of the $t$-value, which is a criterion of
uniformity widely used in the study of QMC methods. We provide a parameter

possibility is particularly interesting given evidence that icy main-belt
objects are known to be present in the Themis asteroid family. We report
results from dynamical analyses specifically investigating the possibility that
icy Themis family members could contribute to the observed population of JFCs.
Numerical integrations show that such dynamical evolution is indeed possible
via a combination of eccentricity excitation apparently driven by the nearby
2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter, gravitational interactions with planets
other than Jupiter, and the Yarkovsky effect. We estimate that, at any given
time, there may be tens of objects from the Themis family on JFC-like orbits
with the potential to mimic active JFCs from the outer solar system, although
not all, or even any, may necessarily be observably active. We find that
dynamically evolved Themis family objects on JFC-like orbits have semimajor
axes between 3.15 au and 3.40 au for the vast majority of their time on such
orbits, consistent with the strong role that the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with
Jupiter likely plays in their dynamical evolution. We conclude that a
contribution from the Themis family to the active JFC population is plausible,
although further work is needed to better characterize this contribution.

the need to integrate various programming and computational models with
evolving and heterogeneous infrastructure. Pervasive and effective abstractions
for distributed infrastructures are thus critical; however, the process of
developing abstractions for scientific applications and infrastructures is not
well understood. While theory-based approaches for system development are
suited for well-defined, closed environments, they have severe limitations for
designing abstractions for scientific systems and applications. The design
science research (DSR) method provides the basis for designing practical
systems that can handle real-world complexities at all levels. In contrast to
theory-centric approaches, DSR emphasizes both practical relevance and
knowledge creation by building and rigorously evaluating all artifacts. We show
how DSR provides a well-defined framework for developing abstractions and
middleware systems for distributed systems. Specifically, we address the
critical problem of distributed resource management on heterogeneous
infrastructure over a dynamic range of scales, a challenge that currently
limits many scientific applications. We use the pilot-abstraction, a widely
used resource management abstraction for high-performance, high throughput, big
data, and streaming applications, as a case study for evaluating the DSR
activities. For this purpose, we analyze the research process and artifacts
produced during the design and evaluation of the pilot-abstraction. We find DSR
provides a concise framework for iteratively designing and evaluating systems.
Finally, we capture our experiences and formulate different lessons learned.

star formation rate (SFR). Our sample consists of $\sim 3200$ galaxies with
integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey with available
determinations of their effective stellar angular momentum within the

namely along the star formation main sequence (SFMS), the $\lambda_{R_e}$
values remain large and almost unchanged over about two orders of magnitude in
stellar mass, with the exception of the lowest masses
$\mathcal{M}_{\star}\lesssim2\times10^{9} \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, where
$\lambda_{R_e}$ slightly decreases. The SFMS is dominated by spiral galaxies
with small bulges. Below the SFMS, but above the characteristic stellar mass
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm crit}\approx2\times10^{11} \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, there is a
sharp decrease in $\lambda_{R_e}$ with decreasing star formation rate: massive
galaxies well below the SFMS are mainly slow-rotator early-type galaxies,
namely genuinely spheroidal galaxies without disks. Below the SFMS and below
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm crit}$ the decrease of $\lambda_{R_e}$ with decreasing SFR
becomes modest or nearly absent: low-mass galaxies well below the SFMS, are
fast-rotator early-type galaxies, and contain fast-rotating stellar disks like
their star-forming counterparts. We also find a small but clear environmental
dependence for the massive galaxies: in the mass range $10^{10.9}-10^{11.5}

model, for a very long time. Hard balls interact by collisions in such models,

ions have large charge, and the hard balls of classical models do not. The
electrodynamics of charge guarantee strong correlations between the movements
of ions on all time scales, even those of atomic scale thermal motion.
Correlations are present whenever Maxwell's equations apply, so they are
present in individual trajectories, not just averages. Indeed, in a series
system like an idealized narrow channel, the correlation is perfect (within the
accuracy of Maxwell's equations) because of conservation of total current (that
includes Maxwell's displacement current, the ethereal ${\varepsilon
}_0{\partial \boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}}/{\partial t}$).The ethereal component of
current prevents spatial variation of total current in a series system. The
stochastic complexity of spatial thermal motion disappears for current }in a
series system. Total current does not depend on location in a series system
like a narrow ion channel on any time scale. Spatial variables are not needed
in the description of total current in a one dimensional channel on any time
scale, according to the Maxwell equations. Removing the spatial dependence of
total current should dramatically simplify theories and simulations, one might
imagine.

difficulty, we introduce the framework of cw-Waldhausen categories, which
includes the concept of weak equivalences leading to the notion of a finite
weak quantum CW-complex in the realm of unital C*-algebras. Here weak
equivalences are unital $*$-homomorphisms that induce an isomorphism on
K-theory. Better still, we construct a noncommutative counterpart of the cup

classical case. To this end, we define k-topology, a noncommutative version of
Grothendieck topology with covering families given by compact principal bundles
and bases related by continuous maps, which leads to the much desired idea of
multiplicative K-theory for noncommutative C*-algebras. Combining this with
cw-Waldhausen structure on the category of compact quantum spaces, we arrive at
the multiplicative K-theory type of finite weak quantum CW-complexes. We show
that non-isomorphic quantizations of the standard CW-complex structure of a

no assumptions on the distribution of the data, the nature of the fitted model,

failure rate of the predictive interval is inflated by a factor of 2. Our

Lasso for regression models and assumes there are more samples than variables.
We extend this method to both model-free and high-dimensional variable

the sparse covariance and principal component knockoff methods. We test these
methods and compare them with the original knockoff method in terms of their
ability to control type I errors and power. The boosted tree model is a complex
system and has more hyperparameters than models with simpler assumptions. In
our framework, these hyperparameters are either tuned through Bayesian
optimization or fixed at multiple levels for trend detection. In simulation
tests, we also compare the properties and performance of importance test
statistics of tree models. The results include combinations of different
knockoffs and importance test statistics. We also consider scenarios that
include main-effect, interaction, exponential, and second-order models while
assuming the true model structures are unknown. We apply our algorithm for

typically is a set of incomparable solutions (i.e., being Pareto non-dominated

particularly for practitioners of Search-Based SE (SBSE). On one hand,
multi-objective optimization could still be relatively new to SE/SBSE

We track the maximum plausible change in composition after each impact. The
final planets span a range of Fe/Mg ratios similar to the Solar System planets,

a few planets with minor iron-depletion, suggesting other mechanisms are at
work. The most iron-rich planets have a lower Fe/Mg ratio than Mercury, and are
less enriched than planets such as Kepler-100b. This indicates that further
work on our understanding of planet formation and further improvement of
precision of mass and radius measurements are required to explain planets at

$p(z|\mathbf{x})$ and $p(z)$ in closed form in terms of a sufficiently
expressive function (Eg. neural network) using our parameterization without

develop two independent use cases for this parameterization:
  1. Mutual Information Maximization (MIM): MIM has become a popular means for
self-supervised representation learning. Neural Bayes allows us to compute
mutual information between observed random variables $\mathbf{x}$ and latent

objective which can optimally label samples from disjoint manifolds present in
the support of a continuous distribution. This can be seen as a specific form
of clustering where each disjoint manifold in the support is a separate
cluster. We design clustering tasks that obey this formulation and empirically
show that the model optimally labels the disjoint manifolds. Our code is

approximate each weight using a single low precision number. Computationally,
we construct the multipoint quantization with an efficient greedy selection
procedure, and adaptively decides the number of low precision points on each
quantized weight vector based on the error of its output. This allows us to
achieve higher precision levels for important weights that greatly influence
the outputs, yielding an 'effect of mixed precision' but without physical mixed

  International Conference on Communications (ICC), June 2020, Dublin, Ireland",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of associating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) to virtual reality (VR) users is studied for a wireless VR network. In
particular, this problem is considered within a cellular network that employs
terahertz (THz) operated RISs acting as base stations. To provide a seamless VR
experience, high data rates and reliable low latency need to be continuously
guaranteed. To address these challenges, a novel risk-based framework based on
the entropic value-at-risk is proposed for rate optimization and reliability
performance. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimization technique is used to
reformulate the problem as a linear weighted function, while ensuring that
higher order statistics of the queue length are maintained under a threshold.
To address this problem, given the stochastic nature of the channel, a
policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed. Since the state
space is extremely large, the policy is learned through a deep-RL algorithm. In
particular, a recurrent neural network (RNN) RL framework is proposed to
capture the dynamic channel behavior and improve the speed of conventional RL
policy-search algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the maximal queue
length resulting from the proposed approach is only within 1% of the optimal
solution. The results show a high accuracy and fast convergence for the RNN
with a validation accuracy of 91.92%.

accuracies are unsatisfactory. Therefore, in order to enjoy the simplicity of
anchor-free detectors and the accuracy of two-stage ones simultaneously, we

namely compressing width. (3) We achieve the second best performance on
CityPersons benchmark, i.e. 9.3% log-average miss rate(MR) on reasonable set,

manage their workers. However, AI has been found at times to be unfair to
workers. Unfairness toward workers has been associated with decreased worker
effort and increased worker turnover. To avoid such problems, AI systems must
be designed to support fairness and redress instances of unfairness. Despite
the attention related to AI unfairness, there has not been a theoretical and
systematic approach to developing a design agenda. This paper addresses the
issue in three ways. First, we introduce the organizational justice theory,
three different fairness types (distributive, procedural, interactional), and
the frameworks for redressing instances of unfairness (retributive justice,
restorative justice). Second, we review the design literature that specifically
focuses on issues of AI fairness in organizations. Third, we propose a design
agenda for AI fairness in organizations that applies each of the fairness types
to organizational scenarios. Then, the paper concludes with implications for
future research.

ability to dexterously manipulate millimeter-scale objects make them appealing
as a grasping mode for general purpose robots. In this work, we present an
ultrasonic, contact-less manipulation device that can be attached to or picked
up by any general purpose robotic arm, enabling millimeter-scale manipulation
with little to no modification to the robot itself. This device is capable of
performing the very first phase-controlled picking action on acoustically
reflective surfaces. With the manipulator placed around the target object, the
manipulator can grasp objects smaller in size than the robot's positioning
uncertainty, trap the object to resist air currents during robot movement, and
dexterously hold a small and fragile object, like a flower bud. Due to the
contact-less nature of the ultrasound-based gripper, a camera positioned to

measure LyA and FUV continuum fluxes reaching the disk surface, which are
responsible for dissociating relevant molecular species (e.g. HCN, N2).
Semi-forbidden C II] 2325 and UV-fluorescent H2 emission were also measured to
constrain inner disk populations of C+ and vibrationally excited H2. We find a
significant positive correlation between 14 micron HCN emission and fluxes from
the FUV continuum and C II] 2325, consistent with model predictions requiring
N2 photodissociation and carbon ionization to trigger the main CN/HCN formation

readily dissociated in disks with stronger FUV irradiation. No clear
relationships are detected between either CN or HCN and LyA or UV-H2 emission.

Here, we present a neural network approach that autonomously discovers reaction
pathways from the time-resolved species concentration data. The proposed
Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN), by design, satisfies the fundamental

Consequently, the CRNN is physically interpretable such that the reaction

chemical pathways is accomplished by training the CRNN with species
concentration data via stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate the
successful implementations and the robustness of the approach in elucidating
the chemical reaction pathways of several chemical engineering and biochemical

expert knowledge in proposing candidate networks and addresses the curse of
dimensionality in complex systems. The physical interpretability also makes the
CRNN capable of not only fitting the data for a given system but also
developing knowledge of unknown pathways that could be generalized to similar

Generation of Optimal Examples is introduced and shown to be able to
efficiently create all the optimal state action pairs necessary to train
G&CNETs without solving optimal control problems. With respect to previous
works, we are able to produce datasets containing a few orders of magnitude
more optimal trajectories and obtain network performances compatible with real
missions requirements. Several schemes able to train representations of either
the optimal policy (thrust profile) or the value function (optimal mass) are

learning successfully and accurately learn the optimal thrust and that a
spacecraft employing the learned thrust is able to reach the target conditions
orbit spending only 2 permil more propellant than in the corresponding
mathematically optimal transfer. Moreover, the optimal propellant mass can be
predicted (in case of value function learning) within an error well within 1%.

We show that consistent estimation remains possible in this challenging

of the data matrix to obtain improved approximation guarantees which go beyond
the standard worst-case analysis. Our approach leads to significantly better
bounds for datasets with known rates of singular value decay, e.g., polynomial
or exponential decay. Our analysis also reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the
approximation factor as a function of k may exhibit multiple peaks and valleys,
which we call a multiple-descent curve. A lower bound we establish shows that
this behavior is not an artifact of our analysis, but rather it is an inherent
property of the CSSP and Nystr\""om tasks. Finally, using the example of a

can be simplified by incorporating the transient potential. Then the dynamic
equation for the mesoscopic degrees of freedom can be simply described by the
Langevin equation with the transient potential (LETP). As a simple and
analytically tractable approximation, we introduce additional degrees of

approximately express the dynamics of the system as the the combination of the
LETP and the dynamics model for the transient potential. The resulting dynamics
model has the same dynamical structure as the responsive particle dynamics

reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, rivaling other state-of-the-art deep RL
methods. Yet, there are two limitations in the current ES practice that may
hinder its otherwise further capabilities. First, most current methods rely on
Monte Carlo type gradient estimators to suggest search direction, where the
policy parameter is, in general, randomly sampled. Due to the low accuracy of
such estimators, the RL training may suffer from slow convergence and require
more iterations to reach optimal solution. Secondly, the landscape of reward
functions can be deceptive and contains many local maxima, causing ES
algorithms to prematurely converge and be unable to explore other parts of the
parameter space with potentially greater rewards. In this work, we employ a
Directional Gaussian Smoothing Evolutionary Strategy (DGS-ES) to accelerate RL
training, which is well-suited to address these two challenges with its ability
to i) provide gradient estimates with high accuracy, and ii) find nonlocal
search direction which lays stress on large-scale variation of the reward
function and disregards local fluctuation. Through several benchmark RL tasks
demonstrated herein, we show that DGS-ES is highly scalable, possesses superior
wall-clock time, and achieves competitive reward scores to other popular policy
gradient and ES approaches.

HI saturation for granted, the atomic gas fraction $f_{\rm atm}$ of galactic
disks can be predicted as a function of the stability parameter
$q=j\sigma/(GM)$, where $M$ and $j$ are the baryonic mass and specific angular
momentum of the disk and $\sigma$ is the HI velocity dispersion Obreschkow et
al. 2016. The log-ratio $\Delta f_q$ between this predictor and the observed
atomic fraction can be seen as a physically motivated `HI deficiency'. While
field disk galaxies have $\Delta f_q \approx0$, objects subject to
environmental removal of HI are expected to have $\Delta f_q>0$. Within this
framework, we revisit the HI deficiencies of satellite galaxies in the Virgo
cluster and in clusters of the EAGLE simulation. We find that observed and
simulated cluster galaxies are HI deficient and that $\Delta f_q$ slightly
increases when getting closer to the cluster centres. The $\Delta f_q$ values
are similar to traditional HI deficiency estimators, but $\Delta f_q$ is more
directly comparable between observations and simulations than morphology-based
deficiency estimators. By tracking the simulated HI deficient cluster galaxies
back in time, we confirm that $\Delta f_q\approx0$ until the galaxies first
enter a halo with $M_{\rm halo}>10^{13} {\rm M_{\odot}}$, at which moment they
quickly lose HI by environmental effects. Finally, we use the simulation to

demonstrations to perform fast Bayesian inference. Bayesian REX can learn to
play Atari games from demonstrations, without access to the game score and can
generate 100,000 samples from the posterior over reward functions in only 5
minutes on a personal laptop. Bayesian REX also results in imitation learning
performance that is competitive with or better than state-of-the-art methods
that only learn point estimates of the reward function. Finally, Bayesian REX
enables efficient high-confidence policy evaluation without having access to
samples of the reward function. These high-confidence performance bounds can be

images, and acquire the dynamics of visual measurements in order to synthesize
a visual-feedback policy. We present a simple controller using an image-space
Lyapunov function, and evaluate the closed-loop performance using three
different class of models for image prediction: deep-learning-based models for
image-to-image translation, an object-centric model obtained from treating each
pixel as a particle, and a switched-linear system where an action-dependent
linear map is used. Through results in simulation and experiment, we show that
for this task, a linear model works surprisingly well -- achieving better
prediction error, downstream task performance, and generalization to new
environments than the deep models we trained on the same amount of data. We
believe these results provide an interesting example in the spectrum of models

hand, asynchronous (async) parallel computing has exhibited significantly
higher speed-up over its synchronous (sync) counterpart. Async-parallel
non-adaptive SGMs have been well studied in the literature from the
perspectives of both theory and practical performance. Adaptive SGMs can also
be implemented without much difficulty in an async-parallel way. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no theoretical result of async-parallel adaptive
SGMs has been established. The difficulty for analyzing adaptive SGMs with
async updates originates from the second moment term. In this paper, we propose
an async-parallel adaptive SGM based on AMSGrad. We show that the proposed

a homogeneous tree T as a simplicial complex whose simplices are vertices V,
edges E or flags F (flags are oriented edges). The ends (infinite geodesic rays
starting at a reference vertex) provide a boundary $\Omega$ for the tree. Then
the horospheres form a trivial principal fiber bundle with base $\Omega$ and
fiber $\mathZ$. There are three such fiber bundles, consisting of horospheres
of vertices, edges or flags, but they are isomorphic: however, no isomorphism
between these fiber bundles maps special sections to special sections (a
special section consists of the set of horospheres through a given vertex, edge
or flag). The groups of automorphisms of the fiber bundles contain a subgroup
$A$ of parallel shifts, analogous to the Cartan subgroup of a semisimple group.
The normalized eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on T are boundary
integrals of complex powers of the Poisson kernel, that is characters of $A$,
and are matrix coefficients of representations induced from $A$ in the sense of
Mackey, the so-called spherical representations.
  The vertex-horospherical Radon transform consists of summation over V in each
vertex-horosphere, and similarly for edges or flags. We prove inversion
formulas for all these Radon transforms, and give applications to harmonic
analysis and the Plancherel measure on T. We show via integral geometry that
the spherical representations for vertices and edges are equivalent. Also, we
define the Radon back-projections and find the inversion operator of each Radon
transform by composing it with its back-projection. This gives rise to a
convolution operator on T, whose symbol is obtained via the spherical Fourier

address this issue, we suggest to use deep learning (DL) to derive an
alternative update scheme for ES in complex data assimilation applications.
Here we show that the DL-based ES method, that is, ES$_\text{(DL)}$, is more
general and flexible. In this new update scheme, a high volume of training data
are generated from a relatively small-sized ensemble of model parameters and
simulation outputs, and possible non-Gaussian features can be preserved in the
training data and captured by an adequate DL model. This new variant of ES is
tested in two subsurface characterization problems with or without Gaussian
assumptions. Results indicate that ES$_\text{(DL)}$ can produce similar (in the
Gaussian case) or even better (in the non-Gaussian case) results compared to
those from ES$_\text{(K)}$. The success of ES$_\text{(DL)}$ comes from the
power of DL in extracting complex (including non-Gaussian) features and
learning nonlinear relationships from massive amounts of training data.
Although in this work we only apply the ES$_\text{(DL)}$ method in parameter
estimation problems, the proposed idea can be conveniently extended to analysis

  In this work, we fill this missing interaction framework gap by proposing a
new CRS framework named Estimation-Action-Reflection, or EAR, which consists of
three stages to better converse with users. (1) Estimation, which builds
predictive models to estimate user preference on both items and item
attributes; (2) Action, which learns a dialogue policy to determine whether to
ask attributes or recommend items, based on Estimation stage and conversation
history; and (3) Reflection, which updates the recommender model when a user

the unusual PdS4 square-planar coordination. By contrast, the layered structure

conversion factors. By using the largest sample of GRB hosts with molecular gas
estimates (25 in total, of which 14 are CO-detected) including results from the
literature, we compared molecular gas properties with those of other
star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The GRB hosts tend to have a higher molecular gas
mass fraction ($\mu_{\rm gas}$) and a shorter gas depletion timescale ($t_{\rm
depl}$) as compared with other SFGs at similar redshifts especially at $z
\lesssim 1$. This could be a common property of GRB hosts or an effect
introduced by the selection of targets which are typically above the
main-sequence line. To eliminate the effect of selection bias, we analyzed
$\mu_{\rm gas}$ and $t_{\rm depl}$ as a function of the distance from the
main-sequence line ($\delta$MS). We find that the GRB hosts follow the same
scaling relations as other SFGs, where $\mu_{\rm gas}$ increases and $t_{\rm
depl}$ decreases with increasing $\delta {\rm MS}$. No molecular gas deficit is
observed when compared to other SFGs of similar SFR and stellar mass. These
findings suggest that the same star-formation mechanism is expected to be

machine players, a generator and a discriminator, designed to learn the
distribution of data. While GANs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
several benchmark learning tasks, GAN minimax optimization still poses great
theoretical and empirical challenges. GANs trained using first-order
optimization methods commonly fail to converge to a stable solution where the
players cannot improve their objective, i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the
underlying game. Such issues raise the question of the existence of Nash
equilibrium solutions in the GAN zero-sum game. In this work, we show through
several theoretical and numerical results that indeed GAN zero-sum games may
not have any local Nash equilibria. To characterize an equilibrium notion
applicable to GANs, we consider the equilibrium of a new zero-sum game with an
objective function given by a proximal operator applied to the original
objective, a solution we call the proximal equilibrium. Unlike the Nash
equilibrium, the proximal equilibrium captures the sequential nature of GANs,
in which the generator moves first followed by the discriminator. We prove that
the optimal generative model in Wasserstein GAN problems provides a proximal
equilibrium. Inspired by these results, we propose a new approach, which we
call proximal training, for solving GAN problems. We discuss several numerical
experiments demonstrating the existence of proximal equilibrium solutions in

improves and extends previous results in four aspects: Our construction offers
a unified viewpoint and covers several known results;
  The resulting scheme has a progressive-viewing property that means the more
shares being stacked together the clearer the secret image would be revealed.

not solve this problem directly, we propose DSNAS, an efficient differentiable
NAS framework that simultaneously optimizes architecture and parameters with a
low-biased Monte Carlo estimate. Child networks derived from DSNAS can be

regularization one of the main problems is how to determine the regularization
parameter which controls the balance between data fitting term and
regularization term. Most methods for selecting this parameter require the
computation of a large number of estimates even in stationary problems. In
dynamic imaging, the parameter selection is even more time consuming since
separate regularization parameters are needed for the spatial and temporal

S-curve with DCE-MR data. We select the spatial regularization parameter using
the S-curve, leaving the temporal regularization parameter as the only free

regularization parameter is selected manually by computing reconstructions with
several values of the temporal regularization parameter.

degree of parallelization. In the context of submodular optimization, adaptive
complexity has become a widely-used measure of an algorithm's ""sequentiality"".
Algorithms in the adaptive model proceed in rounds, and can issue polynomially
many queries to a function $f$ in each round. The queries in each round must be
independent, produced by a computation that depends only on query results
obtained in previous rounds.
  In this work, we examine two fundamental variants of submodular maximization
in the adaptive complexity model: cardinality-constrained monotone
maximization, and unconstrained non-mono-tone maximization. Our main result is
that an $r$-round algorithm for cardinality-constrained monotone maximization
cannot achieve an approximation factor better than $1 - 1/e - \Omega(\min \{
\frac{1}{r}, \frac{\log^2 n}{r^3} \})$, for any $r < n^c$ (where $c>0$ is some
constant). This is the first result showing that the number of rounds must blow
up polynomially large as we approach the optimal factor of $1-1/e$.
  For the unconstrained non-monotone maximization problem, we show a positive
result: For every instance, and every $\delta>0$, either we obtain a
$(1/2-\delta)$-approximation in $1$ round, or a
$(1/2+\Omega(\delta^2))$-approximation in $O(1/\delta^2)$ rounds. In particular
(and in contrast to the cardinality-constrained case), there cannot be an
instance where (i) it is impossible to achieve an approximation factor better
than $1/2$ regardless of the number of rounds, and (ii) it takes $r$ rounds to
achieve a factor of $1/2-O(1/r)$.

Multinomial Logistic Regression model learns a weight vector to differentiate
between any two classes by optimizing over the likelihood objective. With the
advent of big data, the inundation of data has resulted in large dimensional
weight vector and has also given rise to a huge number of classes, which makes
the classical methods applicable for model estimation not computationally

Parallel Iterative Algorithm for MultiNomial LOgistic Regression (PIANO) which

due to the rapid growth of virtual reality applications. Different from
traditional 2D images and videos, omnidirectional contents can provide
consumers with freely changeable viewports and a larger field of view covering
the $360^{\circ}\times180^{\circ}$ spherical surface, which makes the objective
quality assessment of omnidirectional images more challenging. In this paper,
motivated by the characteristics of the human vision system (HVS) and the
viewing process of omnidirectional contents, we propose a novel Viewport
oriented Graph Convolution Network (VGCN) for blind omnidirectional image
quality assessment (IQA). Generally, observers tend to give the subjective
rating of a 360-degree image after passing and aggregating different viewports
information when browsing the spherical scenery. Therefore, in order to model
the mutual dependency of viewports in the omnidirectional image, we build a
spatial viewport graph. Specifically, the graph nodes are first defined with
selected viewports with higher probabilities to be seen, which is inspired by
the HVS that human beings are more sensitive to structural information. Then,
these nodes are connected by spatial relations to capture interactions among
them. Finally, reasoning on the proposed graph is performed via graph
convolutional networks. Moreover, we simultaneously obtain global quality using
the entire omnidirectional image without viewport sampling to boost the
performance according to the viewing experience. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art full-reference
and no-reference IQA metrics on two public omnidirectional IQA databases.

  Variational Autoencoder based Collaborative Filtering",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Matrix factorization (MF) has been widely applied to collaborative filtering
in recommendation systems. Its Bayesian variants can derive posterior
distributions of user and item embeddings, and are more robust to sparse
ratings. However, the Bayesian methods are restricted by their update rules for
the posterior parameters due to the conjugacy of the priors and the likelihood.
Variational autoencoders (VAE) can address this issue by capturing complex
mappings between the posterior parameters and the data. However, current
research on VAEs for collaborative filtering only considers the mappings based
on the explicit data information while the implicit embedding information is
overlooked. In this paper, we first derive evidence lower bounds (ELBO) for
Bayesian MF models from two viewpoints: user-oriented and item-oriented. Based
on the ELBOs, we propose a VAE-based Bayesian MF framework. It leverages not
only the data but also the embedding information to approximate the user-item
joint distribution. As suggested by the ELBOs, the approximation is iterative
with cross feedback of user and item embeddings into each other's encoders.
More specifically, user embeddings sampled at the previous iteration are fed to
the item-side encoders to estimate the posterior parameters for the item
embeddings at the current iteration, and vice versa. The estimation also
attends to the cross-fed embeddings to further exploit useful information. The
decoder then reconstructs the data via the matrix factorization over the
currently re-sampled user and item embeddings.

loopholes in the existing QKD systems. However, in this work, we show an
adversary's capability of exploiting the imperfection of the patch itself to
bypass the patch. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate that, in the
detector under test, the patch of photocurrent monitor against the detector
blinding attack can be defeated by the pulse illumination attack proposed in
this paper. We also analyze the secret key rate under the pulse illumination
attack, which theoretically confirmed that Eve can conduct the attack to learn
the secret key. This work indicates the importance of inspecting the security

negligible. For example in the medical domain, in order to classify whether a
patient has diabetes or not, measuring glucose tolerance can be expensive.
Assuming that the cost of each covariate, and the cost of misclassification can
be specified by the user, our goal is to minimize the (expected) total cost of
classification, i.e. the cost of misclassification plus the cost of the
acquired covariates. We formalize this optimization goal using the
(conditional) Bayes risk and describe the optimal solution using a recursive
procedure. Since the procedure is computationally infeasible, we consequently
introduce two assumptions: (1) the optimal classifier can be represented by a
generalized additive model, (2) the optimal sets of covariates are limited to a
sequence of sets of increasing size. We show that under these two assumptions,
a computationally efficient solution exists. Furthermore, on several medical
datasets, we show that the proposed method achieves in most situations the
lowest total costs when compared to various previous methods. Finally, we
weaken the requirement on the user to specify all misclassification costs by
allowing the user to specify the minimally acceptable recall (target recall).
Our experiments confirm that the proposed method achieves the target recall
while minimizing the false discovery rate and the covariate acquisition costs
better than previous methods.

compression. The key idea is to transfer the knowledge from a deep teacher
model (T) to a shallower student (S). However, existing methods suffer from
performance degradation due to the substantial gap between the learning
capacities of S and T. To remedy this problem, this work proposes Residual
Knowledge Distillation (RKD), which further distills the knowledge by
introducing an assistant (A). Specifically, S is trained to mimic the feature
maps of T, and A aids this process by learning the residual error between them.
In this way, S and A complement with each other to get better knowledge from T.
Furthermore, we devise an effective method to derive S and A from a given model
without increasing the total computational cost. Extensive experiments show
that our approach achieves appealing results on popular classification

genes, is crucial in determining the functional state - accessibility and the
amount of gene expression - of the chromatin. Recent advances in chromosome
conformation capture experiments provide partial information on the chromatin
organization in a cell population, namely the contact count between any segment
pairs, but not on the interaction strength that leads to these contact counts.
However, given the contact matrix, determining the complete 3D organization of
the whole chromatin polymer is an inverse problem. In the present work, a novel
Inverse Brownian Dynamics (IBD) method based on a coarse grained bead-spring
chain model has been proposed to compute the optimal interaction strengths
between different segments of chromatin such that the experimentally measured
contact count probability constraints are satisfied. Applying this method to
the {\alpha}-globin gene locus in two different cell types, we predict the 3D
organizations corresponding to active and repressed states of chromatin at the
locus. We show that the average distance between any two segments of the region
has a broad distribution and cannot be computed as a simple inverse relation
based on the contact probability alone. The results presented for multiple
normalization methods suggest that all measurable quantities may crucially
depend on the nature of normalization. We argue that by experimentally
measuring predicted quantities, one may infer the appropriate form of
normalization.

non-fully-sequential algorithm that achieves such asymptotic optimality. In

process is split into a small number of batches and (ii) the round complexity

privacy-enhancing solutions that require privacy-sensitive information about
individuals and limit their application to the suppression of single and
pre-defined attributes. Consequently, they do not take into account attributes
that are not considered in the training. In this work, we present Negative Face
Recognition (NFR), a novel face recognition approach that enhances the
soft-biometric privacy on the template-level by representing face templates in
a complementary (negative) domain. While ordinary templates characterize facial
properties of an individual, negative templates describe facial properties that
does not exist for this individual. This suppresses privacy-sensitive
information from stored templates. Experiments are conducted on two publicly
available datasets captured under controlled and uncontrolled scenarios on
three privacy-sensitive attributes. The experiments demonstrate that our
proposed approach reaches higher suppression rates than previous work, while
maintaining higher recognition performances as well. Unlike previous works, our
approach does not require privacy-sensitive labels and offers a more
comprehensive privacy-protection not limited to pre-defined attributes.

Abrikosov result. The dynamics of trapped vortices are also explored, which
differs from the case of rigid-body rotation due to the absence of a global
laboratory reference frame.

Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools

security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on

security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security
orchestration into three main areas: unification, orchestration, and
automation. We have also identified the core components of a security
orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration
based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of
security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy,

small-sized, easy to interpret. Traditionally, a greedy approach has been used
to build the trees, yielding a very fast training process; however, controlling
sparsity (a proxy for interpretability) is challenging. In recent studies,
optimal decision trees, where all decisions are optimized simultaneously, have
shown a better learning performance, especially when oblique cuts are
implemented. In this paper, we propose a continuous optimization approach to
build sparse optimal classification trees, based on oblique cuts, with the aim
of using fewer predictor variables in the cuts as well as along the whole tree.
Both types of sparsity, namely local and global, are modeled by means of
regularizations with polyhedral norms. The computational experience reported
supports the usefulness of our methodology. In all our data sets, local and
global sparsity can be improved without harming classification accuracy. Unlike
greedy approaches, our ability to easily trade in some of our classification
accuracy for a gain in global sparsity is shown.

learn models that try to predict the type of cancer of the patient, given their
set of medical activity records.
  We explored different algorithms based on neural network architectures using
long short term deep neural networks, and random forests. Since there is a
growing need to provide decision-makers understandings about the logic of
predictions of black boxes, we also explored different techniques that provide
interpretations for these classifiers. In one of the techniques, we intercepted
some hidden layers of these neural networks and used autoencoders in order to
learn what is the representation of the input in the hidden layers. In another,
we investigated an interpretable model locally around the random forest's
prediction.
  Results show learning an interpretable model locally around the model's
prediction leads to a higher understanding of why the algorithm is making some
decision. Use of local and linear model helps identify the features used in
prediction of a specific instance or data point. We see certain distinct
features used for predictions that provide useful insights about the type of
cancer, along with features that do not generalize well. In addition, the
structured deep learning approach using autoencoders provided meaningful
prediction insights, which resulted in the identification of nonlinear clusters

mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications
(URLLC). Although many researches have been conducted to tackle this issue, few
of them have considered the impact of bursty URLLC. The bursty characteristic
of URLLC traffic may significantly increase the difficulty of RAN slicing on
the aspect of ensuring a ultra-low packet blocking probability. To reduce the
packet blocking probability, we re-visit the structure of physical resource
blocks (PRBs) orchestrated for bursty URLLC traffic in the time-frequency plane
based on our theoretical results. Meanwhile, we formulate the problem of
slicing a RAN enabling coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmissions for
multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC service multiplexing as a multi-timescale
optimization problem. The goal of this problem is to maximize multicast eMBB
and bursty URLLC slice utilities, subject to physical resource constraints. To
mitigate this thorny multi-timescale problem, we transform it into multiple
single timescale problems by exploring the fundamental principle of a sample
average approximation (SAA) technique. Next, an iterative algorithm with
provable performance guarantees is developed to obtain solutions to these
single timescale problems and aggregate the obtained solutions into those of
the multi-timescale problem. We also design a prototype for the CoMP-enabled
RAN slicing system incorporating with multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC traffic
and compare the proposed iterative algorithm with the state-of-the-art
algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Some of
them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an
exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may
provide a better fit to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the
data in China (01/20/2020--02/24/2020), and indeed find that the growth closely
follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The
exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed
infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying
small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from
the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases,
negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections,
particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of
the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort.
Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the
growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei
province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we
rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps
as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an
approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3,
2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$. Further, by analyzing the
kinetics of the mortality in log-log scale, we obtains a rough estimate that
near March 3, the death rate of COVID-19 would be about $4.7\%\thicksim 5.0\%$
for Hubei province and $0.7\%\thicksim1.0\%$ for the region outside Hubei. We
emphasize that our predictions may be quantitatively unreliable, since the data
analysis is purely empirical and various assumptions are used.

density models. Our aim is to provide insight into these parameters by
exploring and explaining the differences between simulations and observations
of synchrotron intensity. At low radio frequencies HII regions become opaque
due to free-free absorption. Using these HII regions we can measure the
synchrotron intensity over a part of the LOS through the Galaxy. The measured
intensity per unit path length, i.e. the emissitivity, for HII regions at
different distances, will allow probing variation in synchrotron emission in
the third dimension of distance. Using a number of existing GMF models in
conjunction with the Galactic CR modeling code GALPROP we can simulate these
synchrotron emissivities. We present an updated catalog of low-frequency
absorption measurements of HII regions compiled from the literature. We report
a simulated emissivity that shows a compatible trend for HII regions that are
near to the observer. And we observe a systematically increasing synchrotron
emissivity for HII regions that are far from the observer, which is not
compatible with simulated values. Current GMF and CR density models cannot
explain low-frequency absorption measurements. One possibility is that
distances to all HII regions at the kinematic 'far' distance are wrong, though
this is unlikely as it ignores all evidence in the literature. However, a
detection bias due to the nature of this tracer requires us to keep in mind
that certain sources may be missed in an observation. The other possibilities
are an enhanced emissivity in the outer Galaxy or a diminished emissivity in
the inner Galaxy.

operator intertwining the Laplacians acts as a sum of overlapping ""local""

  We prove and explore a complementary positive statement: if an operator
intertwining two appropriate realisations of the Laplacian on a pair of domains
preserves disjoint supports, then under additional assumptions on it generally
far weaker than unitarity, the domains are congruent. We show this in
particular for the Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin Laplacians on spaces of

testing which cutpoint yields the best discrimination, for example the Youden

To address these concerns, the cutpointr package offers robust methods for
estimating optimal cutpoints and the out-of-sample performance. The robust
methods include bootstrapping and smoothing based on kernel estimation,
generalized additive models, smoothing splines, and local regression. These
methods can be applied to a wide range of binary-classification and cost-based
metrics. cutpointr also provides mechanisms to utilize user-defined metrics and
estimation methods. The package has capabilities for parallelization of the
bootstrapping, including reproducible random number generation. Furthermore, it
is pipe-friendly, for example for compatibility with functions from tidyverse.
Various functions for plotting receiver operating characteristic curves,
precision recall graphs, bootstrap results and other representations of the

TDLIF measurements were used to evaluate light-transport properties in a
strongly magnetized optically thick argon plasma under different pressure
conditions. Therefore, a coupled system of rate balance equations were
constructed to describe laser pumping of individual magnetic sub-levels of
$\mathrm{2p_8}$ state through frequency separated sub-transitions originating
from $\mathrm{1s_4}$ magnetic sub-levels.
  The density distribution of $\mathrm{2p_8}$ multiplet was described by
balancing laser pumping with losses including radiative decay, transfer of
excitation between the neighboring multiplets driven by neutral collisions and
quenching due to electron and neutral collisions. Resulting $\mathrm{2p_8}$
magnetic sub-level densities were then used to model polarization dependent
fluorescence, consider self-absorption, which could be directly compared with
measured polarization resolved TDLIF measurements. This enables to obtain
unique solutions for the $\mathrm{1s_4}$ and $\mathrm{1s_5}$ magnetic sub-level
densities which were in good agreement with the densities obtained by laser
absorption measurements. It is shown that LIF measurements in magnetized plasma
conditions have strong pressure dependence that should be corrected consider

first images of the surroundings of the supermassive compact object M87* at the
center of the galaxy M87. Aims. We want to develop a simple analytic disk model
for the accretion flow of M87*. Compared to general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models, it has the advantage of being independent
of the turbulent character of the flow, and controlled by only few
easy-to-interpret, physically meaningful parameters. We want to use this model
to predict the image of M87* assuming that it is either a Kerr black hole, or
an alternative compact object. Methods. We compute the synchrotron emission
from the disk model and propagate the resulting light rays to the far-away
observer by means of relativistic ray tracing. Such computations are performed
assuming different spacetimes (Kerr, Minkowski, non-rotating ultracompact star,
rotating boson star or Lamy spinning wormhole). We perform numerical fits of
these models to the EHT data. Results. We discuss the highly-lensed features of
Kerr images and show that they are intrinsically linked to the accretion-flow
properties, and not only to gravitation. This fact is illustrated by the notion
of secondary ring that we introduce. Our model of spinning Kerr black hole
predicts mass and orientation consistent with the EHT interpretation. The
non-Kerr images result in similar quality of the numerical fits and may appear
very similar to Kerr images, once blurred to the EHT resolution. This implies
that a strong test of the Kerr spacetime may be out of reach with the current
data. We notice that future developments of the EHT could alter this situation.
Conclusions. Our results show the importance of studying alternatives to the
Kerr spacetime in order to be able to test the Kerr paradigm unambiguously.

secret is distributed among a number of parties where some subsets of the
parties are able to recover the secret while some subsets are unable to recover
the secret. In the standard $((k,n))$ quantum threshold secret sharing scheme,
any subset of $k$ or more parties out of the total $n$ parties can recover the
secret while other subsets have no information about the secret. But recovery
of the secret incurs a communication cost of at least $k$ qudits for every
qudit in the secret. Recently, a class of communication efficient QSS schemes
were proposed which can improve this communication cost to $\frac{d}{d-k+1}$ by
contacting $d\geq k$ parties where $d$ is fixed prior to the distribution of
shares. In this paper, we propose a more general class of $((k,n))$ quantum
secret sharing schemes with low communication complexity. Our schemes are
universal in the sense that the combiner can contact any number of parties to
recover the secret with communication efficiency i.e. any $d$ in the range
$k\leq d\leq n$ can be chosen by the combiner. This is the first such class of
universal communication efficient quantum threshold schemes.

exploration of QCD phase diagram is possible with the upcoming experimental
facilities such as Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR) and Nuclotron-based Ion
Collider fAcility (NICA), at finite baryon density and moderate temperature,
the inclusion of finite chemical potential is essential to study the hot
QCD/QGP medium. Therefore, the aim is to develop a formalism to study the
energy-loss of heavy quarks moving in the interacting collisional hot QCD
medium having small but a finite quark chemical potential. To do so, the
extended effective fugacity quasi-particle model has been employed
\cite{chandra_quasi1, chandra_quasi2, Mitra:2017sjo} while considering the
effective kinetic theory approach using the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)
collisional kernel. Finally, the momentum dependence of the energy-loss for the
charm and bottom quark has been investigated at different values of collisions
frequency and chemical potential. It is observed that as compared to charm
quark, bottom quark loses less energy at a particular momentum, collisional
frequency and chemical potential. Also, the energy-loss is seen to decrease
with increasing chemical potential.

equations for probability measures, which extends the concept of analytical
solutions to random fields. A stochastic solution of an equation is such a
non-singular probability measure, according to which the random variable is
almost surely a solution to the equation. The general concept is applied for
continuum theories, where the concept of symmetry breaking is extended to
probability measures. The concept is practicable and predictive for non-local

correlated and frustrated quantum systems. The energy eigenstates are found by
stochastic minimization of the variational function for the energy eigenstates
which allows direct optimization of particular energy state without knowledge
of the lower energy states. This approach combined with numerous tensor network
or artificial neural network ansatz wavefunctions then allows further insight
into quantum phases and phase transitions in various strongly correlated models
by considering properties of these systems beyond the ground state properties.
Also, the method is in general applicable to any dimension and has no sign
instability. An example that we consider is the square lattice J1-J2
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The model is one of the most studied models
in frustrated quantum magnetism since it is closely related to the
disappearance of the antiferromagnetic order in the high-Tc superconducting
materials and there is still no agreement about the properties of the system in
the highly frustrated regime near J2/J1 = 0.5. For J1-J2 model we write the
variational ansatz in terms of the two site correlators and in the valence bond
basis and calculate lowest energy eigenstates in the highly frustrated regime
near J2/J1 = 0.5 where the system has a paramagnetic phase. We find that our
results are in good agreement with previously obtained results which confirms

computation that involve longitudinal polarizations of the massive electroweak
vector bosons. These kernels are used to construct a shower algorithm that
includes all possible collinear final-state electroweak branchings, including
those induced by the Yang-Mills triple vector boson coupling and all Higgs
couplings, as well as vector boson emissions from the initial state. We
incorporate a treatment of features particular to the electroweak theory, such
as the effects of bosonic interference and recoiler effects, as well as a
preliminary description of the overlap between electroweak branchings and
resonance decays. Some qualifying results on electroweak branching spectra at
high energies, as well as effects on LHC physics are presented. Possible future
improvements are discussed, including treatment of soft and spin effects, as
well as issues unique to the electroweak sector.

the features during training. Our main motivation is to update the model in a
small content during the training process with replacing less descriptive
features to new ones from a large pool. The main benefit is coming from the
fact that opposite to the common practice we do not start training a new model
from the scratch, but can keep the already learned weights. This procedure
allows the scan of a large feature pool which together with keeping the
complexity of the model leads to an increase of the model accuracy within the
same training time. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated in several
classic machine learning scenarios including linear regression and neural
network-based training. As a specific analysis towards signal processing, we
have successfully tested our approach on the database MNIST for digit
classification considering single pixel and pixel-pairs intensities as possible
features.

measurements of rho Oph A that, together with the radio light curves and the
temporal variation of the equivalent width of the HeI line (lambda=5015

way children learn open-ended repertoires of skills. Such agents need to create

Recent approaches have considered goal spaces that were either fixed and
hand-defined or learned using generative models of states. This limited agents
to sample goals within the distribution of known effects. We argue that the
ability to imagine out-of-distribution goals is key to enable creative
discoveries and open-ended learning. Children do so by leveraging the
compositionality of language as a tool to imagine descriptions of outcomes they
never experienced before, targeting them as goals during play. We introduce
IMAGINE, an intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning architecture
that models this ability. Such imaginative agents, like children, benefit from
the guidance of a social peer who provides language descriptions. To take
advantage of goal imagination, agents must be able to leverage these
descriptions to interpret their imagined out-of-distribution goals. This
generalization is made possible by modularity: a decomposition between learned
goal-achievement reward function and policy relying on deep sets, gated
attention and object-centered representations. We introduce the Playground
environment and study how this form of goal imagination improves generalization
and exploration over agents lacking this capacity. In addition, we identify the
properties of goal imagination that enable these results and study the impacts
of modularity and social interactions.

relative to a control sample of non-interacting galaxies which are $\pm 0.2$
dex in stellar mass and $\pm 1$ in $T$-type. Starbursts are mainly early-type
($T\lesssim 5$), massive spiral galaxies ($M_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$)
that are not necessarily interacting. For a given stellar mass bin, starbursts
are characterised by lower gas depletion times, similar gas fractions, and
larger central stellar mass concentrations than non-starburst galaxies. The
global distributions of gas fraction and gas depletion time are not
statistically different for interacting and non-interacting galaxies. However,
in the case of currently merging galaxies, the median gas depletion time is a
factor of $0.4 \pm 0.2$ that of control sample galaxies, and their SF rates are
a factor of $1.9 \pm 0.5$ enhanced, even though the median gas fraction is
similar. Starbursts present long-lasting SF in the circumnuclear regions that
causes an enhancement of the central stellar density at $z\approx0$ in both
interacting and non-interacting systems. Starbursts have low gas depletion
timescales, yet similar gas fractions as normal main-sequence galaxies. Galaxy
mergers cause a moderate enhancement of the SF efficiency (Abridged).

temporal degrees of freedom in ultrafast (few-cycle) vortices are coupled. This
coupling manifests itself with different effects in different parts of the
vortex, as has been shown for the ring surrounding the vortex where the pulse
energy is maximum, and also in the immediate vicinity of the vortex center. In
may applications, however, the ring of maximum energy is not of primary
interest, but that where the pulse peak intensity is maximum, which is
particularly true in nonlinear optics applications such as the experiments with
ultrafast vortices exciting high harmonics and attosecond pulses carrying also
OAM. This article describes the effects of the OAM-temporal coupling at the
ring of maximum pulse peak intensity, which does not always coincide with the
ring of maximum pulse energy. We find that there exists an upper bound to the
magnitude of the topological charge that an ultrafast vortex with prescribed
pulse shape at its most intense ring can carry, and vice versa, a lower bound
to the duration of the pulse at the most intense ring for a given magnitude of
the topological charge. These bounds imply that with a given laser source
spectrum, the duration of the synthesized ultrafast vortex increases with the
magnitude of the topological charge. Explicit analytical expressions of
ultrafast vortices containing these OAM-temporal couplings are given that can
be of interest in a variety of applications, particularly in the study of their

suggest a time series model for global horizontal irradiation for which it is
easy to generate an arbitrary number of scenarios and thus allows for
multivariate probabilistic forecasts for arbitrary time horizons. In contrast
to many simplified models that have been considered in the literature so far it
features several important stylized facts. Sharp time dependent lower and upper
bounds of global horizontal irradiations are estimated that improve the often

copulas like Gumbel and BB1 copulas are used that allow for the important
feature of so-called tail dependence. Evaluation methods like the continuous
ranked probability score (CRPS), the energy score (ES) and the variogram score
(VS) are used to compare the power of the model for multivariate probabilistic
forecasting with other models used in the literature showing that our model
outperforms other models in many respects.

machines are each given a local $d$-dimensional vector $x_v \in \mathbb{R}^d$,
and must cooperate to estimate the mean of their inputs $\mu = \frac 1n\sum_{v
= 1}^n x_v$, while minimizing total communication cost.
  DME is a fundamental construct in distributed machine learning, and there has
been considerable work on variants of this problem, especially in the context
of distributed variance reduction for stochastic gradients in parallel SGD.
Previous work typically assumes an upper bound on the norm of the input
vectors, and achieves an error bound in terms of this norm. However, in many
real applications, the input vectors are concentrated around the correct output
$\mu$, but $\mu$ itself has large norm. In such cases, previous output error
bounds perform poorly.
  In this paper, we show that output error bounds need not depend on input
norm. We provide a method of quantization which allows distributed mean
estimation to be performed with solution quality dependent only on the distance
between inputs, not on input norm, and show an analogous result for distributed
variance reduction. The technique is based on a new connection with lattice
theory. We also provide lower bounds showing that the communication to error
trade-off of our algorithms is asymptotically optimal.
  As the lattices achieving optimal bounds under $\ell_2$-norm can be
computationally impractical, we also present an extension which leverages
easy-to-use cubic lattices, and is loose only up to a logarithmic factor in
$d$. We show experimentally that our method yields practical improvements for
common applications, relative to prior approaches.

flybys. Here we create a diverse range of representative planetary systems with
different orbital scales and planets' masses and examine encounters between
them in a typical open cluster. We first explore the close-in multi-super earth
systems $\lesssim0.1$ au. They are resistant to flybys in that only ones inside
a few au can destabilise a planet or break the resonance between such planets.
But these systems may capture giant planets onto wide orbits from the intruding
star during distant flybys. If so, the original close-in small planets' orbits
may be tilted together through Kozai--Lidov mechanism, forming a ``cold''
system that is significantly inclined against the equator of the central host.
Moving to the intermediately-placed planets around solar-like stars, we find
that the planets' mass gradient governs the systems' long-term evolution
post-encounter: more massive planets have better chances to survive. Also, a
system's angular momentum deficit, a quantity describing how eccentric/inclined
the orbits are, measured immediately after the encounter, closely relates to
the longevity of the systems -- whether or not and when the systems turn
unstable in the ensuing evolution millions of years post-encounter. We compare
the orbits of the surviving planets in the unstable systems through (1) the
immediate consequence of the stellar fly or (2) internal interplanetary
scattering long post-encounter and find that those for the former are
systematically colder. Finally, we show that massive wide-orbit multi-planet
systems like that of HR 8799 can be easily disrupted and encounters at a few
hundreds of au suffice.

many clinical trials in various areas in medicine. In some cases, the outcome
can be observed only on an ordinal or dichotomous scale. Then the success of
two therapies is assessed by comparing the outcome of two randomly selected
patients from the two therapy groups by 'better', 'equal' or 'worse'. These
outcomes can be described by the probabilities $p^-=P(X<Y)$, $p_0=P(X=Y)$, and
$p^+ =P(X~>~Y)$. For a clinician, however, these quantities are less intuitive.
Therefore, Noether (1987) introduced the quantity $\lambda=p^+ / p^-$ assuming
continuous distributions. The same quantity was used by Pocock et al. (2012)
and by Wang and Pocock (2016) also for general non-normal outcomes and has been
called 'win-ratio' $\lambda_{WR}$. Unlike Noether (1987), Wang and Pocock
(2016) explicitly allowed for ties in the data. It is the aim of this
manuscript to investigate the properties of $\lambda_{WR}$ in case of ties. It
turns out that it has the strange property of becoming larger if the data are
observed less accurately, i.e. include more ties. Thus, in case of ties, the
win-ratio looses its appealing property to describe and quantify an intuitive
and well interpretable treatment effect. Therefore, a slight modification of
$\lambda_{WR} = \theta / (1-\theta)$ is suggested, namely the so-called
'success-odds' where $\theta=p^+ + \frac12 p_0$ is called a success of a
therapy if $\theta>\frac12$. In the case of no ties, $\lambda_{SO}$ is
identical to $\lambda_{WR}$. A test for the hypothesis $\lambda_{SO}=1$ and
range preserving confidence intervals for $\lambda_{SO}$ are derived. By two
counterexamples it is demonstrated that generalizations of both the win-ratio
and the success-odds to more than two treatments or to stratified designs are
not straightforward and need more detailed considerations.

allows to point out crossovers between l- and (l+1)-terms. Coming from high
temperatures where the l=0-term is dominant and going to 0 K, l-eigenvalues

femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. On an ultrafast sub-picosecond time scale
at room temperature, a low frequency and long-lifetime shear phonon mode was
observed at 0.39 THz, which was previously reported in the form of a
characteristic phonon only in the low temperature Td-MoTe2 phase. Unlike the
other optical phonon modes, the shear phonon mode was found to strongly couple
with photoexcited carriers. Moreover, the amplitude of the shear mode
surprisingly decreased with increasing excitation density, a phenomenon which
can be attributed to be a consequence of the lattice temperature rising after
excitation. These results provide useful physical information on ultrafast
lattice symmetry switching between the normal semimetal 1T' and the lattice
inversion symmetry breaking Type-II Weyl semimetal Td phases.

  arXiv:2002.02226",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using molecular dynamics we study the dependence of the friction force on the
sliding speed when an elastic slab (block) is sliding on a rigid substrate with
a ${\rm sin} (q_0 x)$ surface height profile. The friction force is nearly
velocity independent due to phonon emission at the closing and opening crack
tips, where rapid atomic snap-in and -out events occur during sliding. The
rapid events result from lattice trapping and are closely related to the
velocity gap and hysteresis effects observed in model studies of crack
propagation in solids. This indicates that the friction force is dominated by
processes occurring at the edges of the contact area, which is confirmed by
calculations showing that the friction force is independent of the normal
force. The friction force increases drastically when the sliding velocity
approaches the solid transverse sound velocity, as expected from the theory of
cracks.

are commonly treated as likelihood-free, as their forward map has to be
numerically approximated by an ODE solver. This, however, is not a fundamental
constraint but just a lack of functionality in classic ODE solvers, which do
not return a likelihood but a point estimate. To address this shortcoming, we
employ Gaussian ODE filtering (a probabilistic numerical method for ODEs) to
construct a local Gaussian approximation to the likelihood. This approximation
yields tractable estimators for the gradient and Hessian of the
(log-)likelihood. Insertion of these estimators into existing gradient-based
optimization and sampling methods engenders new solvers for ODE inverse
problems. We demonstrate that these methods outperform standard likelihood-free
approaches on three benchmark-systems.

frictionless contact of an axisymmetric punch and an isotropic, linear-elastic
layer are reducible to Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. We
solved them numerically and used the Remez algorithm to obtain piecewise
polynomial approximations of the load - indentation relation for samples that
are either in frictionless contact with the rigid substrate or bonded to it.
Their relative error due to approximation is negligible and uniformly spread.
Combining the numerical approximations with asymptotic solutions for very thin

problems, especially in cases where a model's success hinges upon its ability

defined by integrating over posterior distributions. These quantities are
frequently intractable, motivating the use of Monte Carlo methods. Despite
substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian processes to large training sets,
methods for accurately generating draws from their posterior distributions
still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We identify a
decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to scalable
sampling by separating out the prior from the data. Building off of this
factorization, we propose an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast
posterior sampling, which seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to afford
scalability both during training and at test time. In a series of experiments
designed to test competing sampling schemes' statistical properties and
practical ramifications, we demonstrate how decoupled sample paths accurately
represent Gaussian process posteriors at a fraction of the usual cost.

without the need for sparse factors or techniques based on knowledge
compilation that are commonly utilized. This is significant as it permits a
direct implementation of the improved variable elimination algorithm using
tensors and their operations, leading to extremely efficient implementations
especially when learning model parameters. Moreover, the proposed technique
does not require knowledge of the specific functional dependencies, only that
they exist, so can be used when learning these dependencies. We illustrate the
efficacy of our proposed algorithm by compiling Bayesian network queries into
tensor graphs and then learning their parameters from labeled data using a
standard tool for tensor computation.

Experimental results obtained over a 20 km fibre-optic link indicate that the
UKF can ensure very low excess noise even at low pilot powers. The measurements
exhibited low variance and high stability in excess noise over a wide range of
pilot signal to noise ratios. This may enable CV-QKD systems with low

sample invariant distributions of molecular dynamics systems that exhibit a
time-scale separation between the microscopic (fast) dynamics, and the
macroscopic (slow) dynamics of some low-dimensional set of reaction
coordinates. The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in the
presence of metastability by allowing larger proposal moves at the macroscopic
level, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied. Only when the
macroscopic proposal is accepted, the full microscopic state is reconstructed
from the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected to a second
accept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact that most
proposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational cost,
while microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted. We
analytically show convergence and discuss the rate of convergence of the
proposed algorithm, and numerically illustrate its efficiency on a number of
standard molecular test cases. We also investigate the effect of the choice of

cytotoxic killer cells of the human body to eliminate pathogen-infected or
tumorigenic cells (i.e. target cells). Once a NK or T cell has identified a
target cell, they form a tight contact zone, the immunological synapse (IS).
One then observes repolarization of the cell involving the rotation of the
microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton and a movement of the microtubule organizing
center (MTOC) to a position that is just underneath the plasma membrane at the
IS. Concomitantly a massive relocation of organelles attached to MTs is
observed, including the Golgi apparatus, lytic granules and mitochondria. Since
the mechanism of this relocation is still elusive we devise a theoretical model
for the molecular motor driven motion of the MT cytoskeleton confined between
membrane and nucleus. We analyze scenarios currently discussed in the
literature, the cortical sliding and the capture-shrinkage mechanisms, and
compare quantitative predictions about the spatio-temporal evolution of MTOC
position and MT cytoskeleton morphology with experiments. The model predicts
the experimentally observed biphasic nature of the process due to an interplay
between MT cytoskeleton geometry and motor forces and confirms the dominance of
the capture-shrinkage over the cortical sliding mechanism when MTOC and IS are
initially diametrically opposed. We also find that the two mechanisms act
synergistically, reducing the resources necessary for repositioning. The
localization of dyneins in the pSMAC facilitates their interaction with the
MTs. Our model also opens a way to infer details of the dynein distribution
from the experimentally observed features of the MT cytoskeleton dynamics. In a
subsequent publication, we will address the issue of general initial
configurations and situations in which the T cell established two immunological
synapses.

show two anomalies at about 290 K (T$_r$) and 720 K (T$_C$). The later anomaly
is most likely due to antiferroelectric to paraelectric transition as hinted by
piezoelectric current and polarization-electric field loop measurements at room

Cubic to orthorhombic structural transition is observed at about 10 GPa in high

changes. An expansion about 30 % along $a$-axis and 15 % contraction along

and large increase in full width half maximum (FWHM) of 640 cm$^{-1}$ Raman

stored in a database-like manner. QRAMs have to be fast, resource efficient and
fault-tolerant. The latter is often influenced by access speeds, because
shorter times introduce less exposure of the stored information to noise. The
total execution time of an algorithm depends on the QRAM access time which
includes: 1) address translation time, and 2) effective query time. The bucket
brigade QRAMs were proposed to achieve faster addressing at the cost of
exponentially many ancillae. We illustrate a systematic method to significantly
reduce the effective query time by using Clifford+T gate parallelism. The
method does not introduce any ancillae qubits. Our parallelisation method is
compatible with the surface code quantum error correction. We show that
parallelisation is a result of advantageous Toffoli gate decomposition in terms
of Clifford+T gates, and after addresses have been translated, we achieve
theoretical $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parallelism for the effective queries. We conclude
that, in theory: 1) fault-tolerant bucket brigade quantum RAM queries can be
performed approximately with the speed of classical RAM; 2) the exponentially
many ancillae from the bucket brigade addressing scheme are a trade-off cost
for achieving exponential query speedup compared to quantum read-only memories
whose queries are sequential by design. The methods to compile, parallelise and
analyse the presented QRAM circuits were implemented in software which is

can scale quickly and cheaply to thousands of parallel functions. Existing
serverless platforms isolate functions in ephemeral, stateless containers,
preventing them from directly sharing memory. This forces users to duplicate
and serialise data repeatedly, adding unnecessary performance and resource
costs. We believe that a new lightweight isolation approach is needed, which
supports sharing memory directly between functions and reduces resource
overheads.
  We introduce Faaslets, a new isolation abstraction for high-performance
serverless computing. Faaslets isolate the memory of executed functions using
software-fault isolation (SFI), as provided by WebAssembly, while allowing
memory regions to be shared between functions in the same address space.
Faaslets can thus avoid expensive data movement when functions are co-located
on the same machine. Our runtime for Faaslets, Faasm, isolates other resources,
e.g. CPU and network, using standard Linux cgroups, and provides a low-level
POSIX host interface for networking, file system access and dynamic loading. To
reduce initialisation times, Faasm restores Faaslets from already-initialised
snapshots. We compare Faasm to a standard container-based platform and show
that, when training a machine learning model, it achieves a 2x speed-up with
10x less memory; for serving machine learning inference, Faasm doubles the
throughput and reduces tail latency by 90%.

highly obscured counterpart of powerful FRII-HERGs/BLRGs. Therefore, at least
two hypothesis can be invoked to explain the FRII-LERGs nature: (i) they are
evolving from classical FRIIs because of the depletion of accreting cold gas in
the nuclear region, while the extended radio emission is the heritage of a past
efficiently accreting activity; (ii) they are an intrinsically distinct class
of objects with respect to classical FRIs/FRIIs. Surprisingly, in this
direction a correlation between accretion rates and environmental richness is
found in our sample. The richer the environment, the more inefficient is the
accretion. In this framework, the FRII-LERGs are intermediate between FRIs and

approach called crowdsourced collective ER, which leverages the relationships

Specifically, it iteratively asks human workers to label picked entity pairs
and propagates the labeling information to their neighbors in distance. During
this process, we address the problems of candidate entity pruning,
probabilistic propagation, optimal question selection and error-tolerant truth
inference. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared

Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, it greatly increases the computational costs for
image segmentation. To achieve a sound trade-off between the segmentation
performance and the speed of clustering, we come up with a Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence-based FCM algorithm by incorporating a tight wavelet frame
transform and a morphological reconstruction operation. To enhance FCM's
robustness, an observed image is first filtered by using the morphological
reconstruction. A tight wavelet frame system is employed to decompose the
observed and filtered images so as to form their feature sets. Considering
these feature sets as data of clustering, an modified FCM algorithm is
proposed, which introduces a KL divergence term in the partition matrix into
its objective function. The KL divergence term aims to make membership degrees
of each image pixel closer to those of its neighbors, which brings that the
membership partition becomes more suitable and the parameter setting of FCM
becomes simplified. On the basis of the obtained partition matrix and
prototypes, the segmented feature set is reconstructed by minimizing the
inverse process of the modified objective function. To modify abnormal features
produced in the reconstruction process, each reconstructed feature is
reassigned to the closest prototype. As a result, the segmentation accuracy of
KL divergence-based FCM is further improved. What's more, the segmented image
is reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation.
Finally, supporting experiments coping with synthetic, medical and color images
are reported. Experimental results exhibit that the proposed algorithm works
well and comes with better segmentation performance than other comparative
algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm requires less time than most of
the FCM-related algorithms.

executed on CPU or GPU. However, this emulation is typically two or three
orders of magnitude slower than a software DNN implementation running on CPU or
GPU and operating with standard floating point arithmetic instructions and
common DNN libraries. The reason is that there is no hardware support for

approach, we fit only a single factor to rescale the theoretical integrated

parallel wires. Finite Element Method (FEM) based and analytical models are
developed for both single wire Sommerfeld and Goubau lines. Starting with the
Sommerfeld type wave, we derive the analytical expression based on the
assumption that the two-wire surface wave is a superposition of the two surface
waves on the individual wires. Models are validated via measurements and a
comparison study conducted between the analytic and the FEM-based computations
for coupled Sommerfeld type lines. We then investigate the coupling between two
Goubau lines with the FEM model. The measurement and calculations show
remarkable agreement. The FEM-based and the analytical models match remarkably
well too. The results exhibit new properties of favourable effects on surface
waves propagation over multiple conductors. The short range behaviour of the
coupled wires and consequently the existence of an optimum separation of
coupled wires, is one of the most significant findings of this paper. We
comment on the relevance of our results especially in relation to applications
of high bandwidth demands and immanent cross-coupling effects.

while providing a crisp definition of interface and external boundaries. In
such techniques, an isocontour of a level set field interpolated from nodal
level set values defines a problem's geometry. If the interface is explicitly
tracked, the intersected elements are typically divided into sub-elements to
which a phase needs to be assigned. Due to loss of information in the
discretization of the level set field, certain geometrical configurations allow
for ambiguous phase assignment of sub-elements, and thus ambiguous definition
of the interface. The study presented here focuses on analyzing these
topological ambiguities in embedded geometries constructed from discretized
level set fields on hexahedral meshes. The analysis is performed on
three-dimensional problems where several intersection configurations can
significantly affect the problem's topology. This is in contrast to
two-dimensional problems where ambiguous topological features exist only in one
intersection configuration and identifying and resolving them is
straightforward. A set of rules that resolve these ambiguities for two-phase
problems is proposed, and algorithms for their implementations are provided.
The influence of these rules on the evolution of the geometry in the
optimization process is investigated with linear elastic topology optimization
problems. These problems are solved by an explicit level set topology
optimization framework that uses the extended finite element method to predict
physical responses. This study shows that the choice of a rule to resolve
topological features can result in drastically different final geometries.
However, for the problems studied in this paper, the performances of the
optimized design do not differ.

adsorbed molecules, often of biological significance. However, the relation
between raw acoustic response (frequency shift $\Delta f$ and dissipation
factor $\Delta D$) and mechanical properties of the macromolecules still needs
to be deciphered, particularly in the case of suspended discrete particles. We
study the QCM response of suspended liposomes tethered to the resonator wall by
double stranded DNA, with the other end attached to surface-adsorbed
neutravidin through a biotin linker. Liposome radius and dsDNA contour length
are comparable to the wave penetration depth ($\delta\sim 100\ \mathrm{nm}$).
Simulations, based on the immersed boundary method and an elastic network model
for the liposome-DNA complex, are in good agreement with experimental results
for POPC liposomes. We find that the added stress at the resonator surface,
i.e. the impedance Z sensed by QCM, is dominated by the flow-induced liposome
surface-stress, which propagates towards the resonator by viscous forces. QCM
signals are extremely sensitive to the liposome's height distribution P(y)
which depends on the actual number and mechanical properties of the tethers, in
addition to the usual local attractive/repulsive chemical forces. Our approach
helps in deciphering the role of hydrodynamics in acoustic sensing and
revealing the role of parameters hitherto largely unexplored. A practical
consequence would be the design of improved biosensors and detection schemes.

within a polycrystalline material from Bragg edge strain images. This technique
offers the possibility of a nondestructive analysis of strain fields with a
high spatial resolution. A finite element approach is used to reconstruct the
strain using the least square method constrained by the conditions of
equilibrium. The procedure is developed and verified by validating for a
cantilevered beam problem. It is subsequently demonstrated by reconstructing
the strain from experimental data for a ring-and-plug sample, measured at the
spallation neutron source RADEN at J-PARC in Japan. The reconstruction is
validated by comparison with conventional constant wavelength strain
measurements on the KOWARI diffractometer at ANSTO in Australia. It is also
shown that the addition of a simple Tikhonov regularization can improve the
reconstruction.

handling the massive expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and
services. However, energy consumption of a MEC network depends on volatile
tasks that induces risk for energy demand estimations. As an energy supplier, a
microgrid can facilitate seamless energy supply. However, the risk associated
with energy supply is also increased due to unpredictable energy generation
from renewable and non-renewable sources. Especially, the risk of energy
shortfall is involved with uncertainties in both energy consumption and
generation. In this paper, we study a risk-aware energy scheduling problem for
a microgrid-powered MEC network. First, we formulate an optimization problem
considering the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measurement for both energy
consumption and generation, where the objective is to minimize the expected
residual of scheduled energy for the MEC networks and we show this problem is
an NP-hard problem. Second, we analyze our formulated problem using a
multi-agent stochastic game that ensures the joint policy Nash equilibrium, and
show the convergence of the proposed model. Third, we derive the solution by
applying a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based asynchronous
advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm with shared neural networks. This method
mitigates the curse of dimensionality of the state space and chooses the best
policy among the agents for the proposed problem. Finally, the experimental
results establish a significant performance gain by considering CVaR for high
