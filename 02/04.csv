opinion collection, while it is still posing many challenges as a passive data
source, such as structurelessness, quantifiability, and representativeness.
Social media data with geotags provide new opportunities to unveil the
geographic locations of users expressing their opinions. This paper aims to
answer two questions: 1) whether quantifiable measurement of public opinion can
be obtained from social media and 2) whether it can produce better or
complementary measures compared to opinion polls. This research proposes a
novel approach to measure the relative opinion of Twitter users towards public
issues in order to accommodate more complex opinion structures and take
advantage of the geography pertaining to the public issues. To ensure that this
new measure is technically feasible, a modeling framework is developed
including building a training dataset by adopting a state-of-the-art approach
and devising a new deep learning method called Opinion-Oriented Word Embedding.
With a case study of the tweets selected for the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, we demonstrate the predictive superiority of our relative opinion
approach and we show how it can aid visual analytics and support opinion
predictions. Although the relative opinion measure is proved to be more robust
compared to polling, our study also suggests that the former can advantageously
complement the later in opinion prediction.

In this work, we employ first-principles density-functional theory calculations
to explore the directional dependence of electronic properties such as carrier
effective mass and mobility in tetrahex-C. Tetrahex-C demonstrates strong
anisotropicity in effective mass of charge carrier and therefore its mobility
(electric conductance) exhibits a strong orientation preference. More
interesting, we find that such unique anisotropic carrier effective mass and
mobility can be controlled by simple uniaxial strain. The orientation
dependence of effective mass can be dramatically rotated by 90 degrees through
applying uniaxial tensile strain beyond ~ 7% (11%) in the armchair direction
for the hole (electron). As a result, the intrinsic carrier mobility in
tetrahex-C is significantly enhanced. The results are useful for potential
electronic and mechanical applications in tetrahex-C.

preferentially surviving strong kicks; (2) a halo origin, with P{orb}
shortening through dynamical interactions in globular clusters (GCs). For the

Learning (RL). In particular, we use it to establish the first-known
convergence rate of the V-trace algorithm for off-policy TD-learning. Moreover,
we also use it to study TD-learning in the on-policy setting, and recover the
existing state-of-the-art results for $Q$-learning. Importantly, our
construction results in only a logarithmic dependence of the convergence bound

and even topological phase transitions in quantum as well as classical systems.
In this work, von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies are studied
numerically for classical lattice models in a square geometry. A cut is made
from the center of the square to the midpoint of one of its edges, say the
right edge. The entanglement entropies measure the entanglement between the
left and right halves of the system. As in the strip geometry, von Neumann and
Renyi entanglement entropies diverge logarithmically at the transition point
while they display a jump for first-order phase transitions. The analysis is
extended to a classical model of non-overlapping finite hard rods deposited on
a square lattice for which Monte Carlo simulations have shown that, when the
hard rods span over 7 or more lattice sites, a nematic phase appears in the
phase diagram between two disordered phases. A new Corner Transfer Matrix
Renormalization Group algorithm (CTMRG) is introduced to study this model. No
logarithmic divergence of entanglement entropies is observed at the phase
transitions in the CTMRG calculation discussed here. We therefore infer that
the transitions neither can belong to the Ising universality class, as
previously assumed in the literature, nor be discontinuous.

membranes based in nanoporous materials have been suggested in recent years.
One of the materials suggested is MoS$_2$, and classical Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulation is one of the most powerful tools to explore these
nanomaterials. However, distinct Force Fields employed in MD simulations are
parameterized based on distinct experimental quantities. In this paper, we
compare two models of salt that were build based on distinct properties of
water-salt mixtures. One model fits the hydration free energy and lattice
properties, the second fits the crystal density and the density and the
dielectric constant of water and salt mixtures. To compare the models, MD
simulations for salty water flow through two nanopores sizes were used -- one
pore big enough to accommodate hydrated ions, and one smaller in which the ion
has to dehydrate to enter, and two rigid water models from the TIP4P family --
the TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/$\epsilon$. Our results indicate that the water
permeability and salt rejection by the membrane are more influenced by the salt
model than by the water model, especially for the narrow pore. In fact,
completely distinct mechanisms were observed, and they are related to the
characteristics employed in the ion model parameterization. The results show
that not only the water model can influence the outcomes, but the ion model

studies focused on movement of oxygen ions at high temperatures (500 {\deg}C

and ionic conductivity. In this study, we demonstrate room temperature charge
redistribution in a CeO2 thin film as a result of phase transformation in a
localized region by mechanical deformation. Mechanical indentation of the CeO2
thin film at room temperature results in irreversible deformation.
Conductive-tip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) analysis shows increased current
passing through the locally deformed area of the CeO2 thin film. Electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis equipped with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) suggests that the increase in current contrast in the deformed

the fundamental reason behind the increased amount of Ce3+ ions in the deformed
area, based on the atomic scale computational works performed by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Plastic deformation induces a phase transformation of cubic
fluorite CeO2 into a newly formed T-CeO2 structure. This phase transformation
occurs mainly by oxygen ions moving closer to cerium ions to release mechanical
energy absorbed in the CeO2 thin film, followed by charge redistribution from
the initial CeO2 to the newly created T-CeO2 structure.

firing-rate scale monotonically with odorant intensity, and that the receptor
sensitivities range widely across odorants and receptor neurons hence leading
to highly distributed representations of the stimuli. The mathematical
implementation of the phenomenological postulates allows for inferring explicit

created to extract information from data available in the experimental
literature. The values of the free parameters of the model are estimated by an
info-geometric Bayesian maximum-likelihood inference which keeps into account
the prior distribution of the parameters. The eventual goodness of fit is
quantified by means of a distribution-independent test.

application fields to track or capture motions of kinematic chains, such as
human limbs, exoskeletons or robotic actuators. A major challenge is the
presence of magnetic disturbances that result in unreliable magnetometer
readings. Recent research revealed that this problem can be overcome by
exploitation of kinematic constraints. While typically each segment of the
kinematic chain is equipped with an IMU, a novel approach called sparse
inertial motion tracking aims at infering the complete motion states from
measurements of a reduced set of sensors. In the present contribution, we
combine the magnetometer-free and the sparse approach for real-time motion
tracking of double-hinge joint systems with non-parallel joint axes. Analyzing
the observability of the system, we find a condition which assures that the
relative orientations between all segments are uniquely determined by a
kinematic constraint, which contains only the gyroscope readings. Furthermore,
we propose a moving-horizon estimator and validate it in a simulation study of
three movements with different degrees of excitation. The results of this study
confirm all theoretical conjectures and demonstrate that magnetometer-free
sparse inertial real-time motion tracking is feasible under precise and simple
excitation conditions.

the bonding network to two periodic dimensions, creating a layer of the cleaved

4,626 of which have a maximum Miller index of 1. To characterize the likelihood
of cleavage and the thermodynamic stability of the cleaved surfaces, we create
monolayers of these surfaces and calculate the work of cleavage and the

choice for BCI systems. To discover the underlying and specific features of

their limited performance when the number of mental tasks for classification is

two Saturn-mass planets in eccentric orbits with periods of 41.38 and 532.02
days. Aims. We reanalyze the orbital configuration and dynamics of the GJ 1148
multi-planetary system based on new precise radial velocity (RV) measurements
taken with CARMENES. Methods. We combined new and archival precise Doppler
measurements from CARMENES with those available from HIRES for GJ 1148 and
modeled these data with a self-consistent dynamical model. We studied the
orbital dynamics of the system using the secular theory and direct N-body
integrations. The prospects of potentially habitable moons around GJ 1148 b
were examined. Results. The refined dynamical analyses show that the GJ 1148
system is long-term stable in a large phase-space of orbital parameters with an
orbital configuration suggesting apsidal alignment, but not in any particular
high-order mean-motion resonant commensurability. GJ 1148 b orbits inside the
optimistic habitable zone (HZ). We find only a narrow stability region around
the planet where exomoons can exist. However, in this stable region exomoons
exhibit quick orbital decay due to tidal interaction with the planet.
Conclusions. The GJ 1148 planetary system is a very rare M-dwarf planetary
system consisting of a pair of gas giants, the inner of which resides in the
HZ. We conclude that habitable exomoons around GJ 1148 b are very unlikely to
exist.

started in 1997, resembles a blackbody that cooled from $\sim1200$K in 1998
August to $\sim180$K in 2016 July. The dust mass, assuming amorphous carbon,
was $\sim5\times10^{-10}$M$_\odot$ in 1998 August, and we estimate that the
total dust mass was $\sim2\times10^{-5}$M$_\odot$ by $\sim2016$. The appearance
of a near infrared excess in 2008 suggests a new episode of (or renewed) mass
loss began then. We infer lower limits on the bolometric luminosity of the
embedded star from that of the dust shell, which rose to $\sim16000$L$_\odot$
before declining to $\sim3000$L$_\odot$. There is evidence for weak 6-7$\mu$m
absorption, which we attribute to hydrogenated amorphous carbon formed in
material ejected by Sakurai's Object during a mass ejection phase that preceded
the 1997 event. We detect small hydrocarbon and other molecules in the spectra,
and trace the column densities in hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and acetylene

to 3.3% in the ultra low-power setting, which might be crucial for many use
cases. Binary neural networks (BNNs), a resource efficient variant of neural
networks (NNs), can tolerate a certain percentage of errors without a loss in
accuracy and demand lower resources in computation and storage. The bit error
tolerance (BET) in BNNs can be achieved by flipping the weight signs during
training, as proposed by Hirtzlin et al., but their method has a significant
drawback, especially for fully connected neural networks (FCNN): The FCNNs
overfit to the error rate used in training, which leads to low accuracy under
lower error rates. In addition, the underlying principles of BET are not
investigated. In this work, we improve the training for BET of BNNs and aim to
explain this property. We propose straight-through gradient approximation to
improve the weight-sign-flip training, by which BNNs adapt less to the bit
error rates. To explain the achieved robustness, we define a metric that aims
to measure BET without fault injection. We evaluate the metric and find that it
correlates with accuracy over error rate for all FCNNs tested. Finally, we
explore the influence of a novel regularizer that optimizes with respect to
this metric, with the aim of providing a configurable trade-off in accuracy and

when the codimension $m\le 2$. In other words we obtain a relative version of
isoperimetric inequalities for minimal submanifolds proved recently by Brendle

affirmative answer to an open problem proposed by Choe in \cite{Choe2005}, Open

influence of a set of variables onto a dependent variable given an experimental
dataset. In neuroscience and cognitive psychology, Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs) -including linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson GLM- is
the regression model of choice to study the factors that drive participant's
choices, reaction times and neural activations. These methods are however
limited as they only capture linear contributions of each regressors. Here, we
introduce an extension of GLMs called Generalized Unrestricted Models (GUMs),
which allows to infer a much richer set of contributions of the regressors to
the dependent variable, including possible interactions between the regressors.
In a GUM, each regressor is passed through a linear or nonlinear function, and
the contribution of the different resulting transformed regressors can be
summed or multiplied to generate a predictor for the dependent variable. We
propose a Bayesian treatment of these models in which we endow functions with
Gaussian Process priors, and we present two methods to compute a posterior over
the functions given a dataset: the Laplace method and a sparse variational
approach, which scales better for large dataset. For each method, we assess the
quality of the model estimation and we detail how the hyperparameters (defining
for example the expected smoothness of the function) can be fitted. Finally, we
illustrate the power of the method on a behavioral dataset where subjects
reported the average perceived orientation of a series of gratings. The method
allows to recover the mapping of the grating angle onto perceptual evidence for
each subject, as well as the impact of the grating based on its position.
Overall, GUMs provides a very rich and flexible framework to run nonlinear

  Heterogeneity with Flexibility and Interpretability",,,,,"econ.EM cs.LG stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete choice models (DCMs) require a priori knowledge of the utility
functions, especially how tastes vary across individuals. Utility
misspecification may lead to biased estimates, inaccurate interpretations and
limited predictability. In this paper, we utilize a neural network to learn
taste representation. Our formulation consists of two modules: a neural network
(TasteNet) that learns taste parameters (e.g., time coefficient) as flexible
functions of individual characteristics; and a multinomial logit (MNL) model
with utility functions defined with expert knowledge. Taste parameters learned
by the neural network are fed into the choice model and link the two modules.
  Our approach extends the L-MNL model (Sifringer et al., 2020) by allowing the
neural network to learn the interactions between individual characteristics and
alternative attributes. Moreover, we formalize and strengthen the
interpretability condition - requiring realistic estimates of behavior
indicators (e.g., value-of-time, elasticity) at the disaggregated level, which
is crucial for a model to be suitable for scenario analysis and policy
decisions. Through a unique network architecture and parameter transformation,
we incorporate prior knowledge and guide the neural network to output realistic
behavior indicators at the disaggregated level. We show that TasteNet-MNL
reaches the ground-truth model's predictability and recovers the nonlinear
taste functions on synthetic data. Its estimated value-of-time and choice
elasticities at the individual level are close to the ground truth. On a
publicly available Swissmetro dataset, TasteNet-MNL outperforms benchmarking
MNLs and Mixed Logit model's predictability. It learns a broader spectrum of
taste variations within the population and suggests a higher average
value-of-time.

to hot, nondegenerate plasma conditions, including the challenging crossover
regime between the two. The small-angle approximation characteristic of
Fokker-Planck collision theories is mitigated to good effect by the
construction of accurate effective Coulomb logarithms based on mean-force
scattering, which allows the theory to remain accurate even at low

Electron-electron collisions are treated on equal footing as electron-ion
collisions. Their accurate treatment is found to be essential for hydrogen, and
is expected to be important to other low-Z elements. We find that
electron-electron scattering remains influential to the value of the thermal
conductivity down to temperatures somewhat below the Fermi energy. The accuracy
of the theory seems to falter only for the behavior of the thermal conductivity
at very low temperatures due to a subtle interplay between the Pauli exclusion
principle and the small-angle approximation as they pertain to
electron-electron scattering. Even there, the model is in fair agreement with

MeV-1 GeV range at high spectral resolution. Aims. We model the transport of
GLE-energy solar protons through the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) using
a 3D approach, to assess the effect of the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) and
drifts associated to the gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral. The
latter are influenced by the IMF polarity. We derive 1 AU observables and
compare the simulation results with data from PAMELA. Methods. We use a 3D test
particle model including a HCS. Monoenergetic populations are studied first to
obtain a qualitative picture of propagation patterns and numbers of crossings
of the 1 AU sphere. Simulations for power law injection are used to derive
intensity profiles and fluence spectra at 1 AU. A simulation for a specific
event, GLE 71, is used to compare with PAMELA data. Results. Spatial patterns
of 1 AU crossings and the average number of crossings are strongly influenced
by 3D effects, with significant differences between periods of A+ and A-
polarities. The decay time constant of 1 AU intensity profiles varies depending
on the polarity and position of the observer, and it is not a simple function
of the mean free path as in 1D models. Energy dependent leakage from the
injection flux tube is particularly important for GLE energy particles, in many
cases resulting in a roll-over in the fluence spectrum.

Multiple hybrid offshore wind and battery system designs are investigated to
examine the impact of locating the battery offshore versus locating it onshore.
For the examined systems, we explore different battery usable state-of-charge
(SOC) windows, and corresponding dispatch of the battery to maximize energy-
and capacity-market revenues. The impacts of variability of offshore wind
output along with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using
publicly available data from 2010 to 2013. Locating the battery onshore
resulted in higher revenues. For 2013, results highlight that without accurate
battery representations, models can overestimate battery revenues by up to
155%, resulting primarily from degradation-related costs. Using advanced
algorithms, net revenue can be increased by 29%. Results also indicate that
wider useable SOC windows could lead to higher net revenues from the energy
market, due to higher arbitrage opportunities that compensate for any
additional degradation-tied costs in higher DODs. The added value of a MWh of
energy storage varies from $2 to $3.5 per MWh of wind energy, which leads to a
breakeven cost range of $50-$95 per kWh for the battery systems studied. As
such, energy- and capacity-market revenues were found to be insufficient in
recovering the investment costs of current battery systems for the applications
considered in this analysis.

is typically biased towards the expectations of their target audience. Such
content often polarizes users, who are repeatedly primed to specific (extreme)
content, usually reflecting hard party lines on political and socio-economic
topics. Though this polarization has been extensively studied with respect to
content, it is still unknown how it associates with the online tracking
experienced by browsing users, especially when they exhibit certain demographic
characteristics. For example, it is unclear how such websites enable the
ad-ecosystem to track users based on their gender or age. In this paper, we
take a first step to shed light and measure such potential differences in
tracking imposed on users when visiting specific party-line's websites. For
this, we design and deploy a methodology to systematically probe such websites
and measure differences in user tracking. This methodology allows us to create
user personas with specific attributes like gender and age and automate their
browsing behavior in a consistent and repeatable manner. Thus, we
systematically study how personas are being tracked by these websites and their
third parties, especially if they exhibit particular demographic properties.
Overall, we test 9 personas on 556 hyper-partisan websites and find that
right-leaning websites tend to track users more intensely than left-leaning,
depending on user demographics, using both cookies and cookie synchronization
methods and leading to more costly delivered ads.

its performance with a segmented aperture. The gray-scale apodization is
numerically optimized to yield a better sensitivity to faint companions
assuming an aperture shape similar to the LUVOIR-B concept. Using wavefront
sensing and control over a one-sided dark hole, we achieve a raw contrast of

grain boundary and plays an important role to unveil the behavior of

distribution (GBED), we can produce more durable and efficient materials that
will further improve productivity and reduce loss. The lack of robust GB
structure-property relationships still remains one of the biggest obstacles
towards developing true bottom-up models for the behavior of polycrystalline
materials. Progress has been slow because of the inherent complexity associated
with the structure of interfaces and the vast five-dimensional configurational
space in which they reside. Estimating the GBED is challenging from a
statistical perspective because there are not direct measurements on the grain
boundary energy. We only have indirect information in the form of an
unidentifiable homogeneous set of linear equations. In this paper, we propose a
new statistical model to determine the GBED from the microstructures of
polycrystalline materials. We apply spline-based regression with constraints to
successfully recover the GB energy surface. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Gibbs

fail because they reason about which hypothesis might be correct, and not

restricting pesticide use to the situations that best require it. However, the
efficacy of a PMN to control pests may depend on its spatial density and
space/time sampling balance. Furthermore the best trade-off between the
monitoring effort and the impact of the PMN information may be pest dependent.
We developed a generic simulation model that links PMN information to treatment
decisions and pest dynamics. We derived the number of treatments, the epidemic
extension and the global gross margin for different families of pests. For
soil-borne pathogens and weeds, we found that increasing the spatial density of
a PMN significantly decreased the number of treatments (up to 67\%), with an
only marginal increase in infection. Considering past observations had a
second-order effect (up to a 13\% decrease). For the spatial scale of our
study, the PMN information had practically no influence in the case of insects.
The next step is to go beyond PMN analysis to design and chose among
sustainable management strategies at the landscape scale.

appealing solution concept that for Production-Inventory games (PI-games)

to operate at minimum cost but it does not take into account the cost reduction
induced by essential players over their followers (fans). Thus, it may be seen
as an altruistic allocation for essential players what can be criticized. The
aim this paper is two-fold: to study the structure and complexity of the core
of PI-games and to introduce new core allocations for PI-games improving the
weaknesses of the Owen point. Regarding the first goal, we advance further on
the analysis of PI-games and we analyze its core structure and algorithmic
complexity. Specifically, we prove that the number of extreme points of the
core of PI-games is exponential on the number of players. On the other hand, we
propose and characterize a new core-allocation, the Omega point, which
compensates the essential players for their role on reducing the costs of their
fans. Moreover, we define another solution concept, the Quid Pro Quo set
(QPQ-set) of allocations, which is based on the Owen and Omega points. Among
all the allocations in this set, we emphasize what we call the Solomonic QPQ

Telescope (EHT) have opened a new era of black hole research. One of the next
issues is to take polarization images around the central black hole (BH). Since
radio emission is produced by synchrotron process, polarization properties
should vividly reflect the magnetic field structure at the jet base and thus
provide good information regarding the magnetic mechanism of jet formation.
With this kept in mind we perform general relativistic (GR) radiative transfer
calculations of polarized light based on the GR magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulation data of accretion flow and outflow in M87, to obtain their linear
and circular polarization images in the horizon-scale. We found that the linear
polarization components from the jet base and inner accretion flow should
experience Faraday rotation when passing through magnetized plasmas around the
BH, thus sensitively depending on the BH spin. Through the comparison with
intensity image at 1.3mm by EHT and the polarized degree and the rotation
measure (RM) at 1.3mm with the Submillimeter Array, the model with the spin
parameter of a=0.9M_BH (with M_BH being the BH mass) is favored over other
models with a=0.5M_BH or 0.99M_BH, though we need further systematic studies
for confirmation. We also find in low-temperature models clear ring-like image
in the circular polarization map, which arises because of Faraday conversion of
the linearly polarized synchrotron emission and is thus indicative of magnetic
field. This occurs only when the emission region is threaded with well-ordered
magnetic fields and hence no clear images are expected in high-temperature disk
models, in which disk emission is appreciable. We will be able to elucidate the
field configuration through the comparison between the simulated polarization
images and future polarimetry with EHT and other VLBI observations.

moderate to powerful AGN classification. We find the predicted column densities
is on average an order of magnitude higher than the calculated column densities

of $3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ M$_\odot$ (90th-percentile confidence region) as
measured from its gravitational wave signal. This mass is significantly
different from the Milky Way (MW) population of binary neutron stars (BNSs)
that are expected to merge in a Hubble time and from that of the first BNS
merger, GW170817. Here we explore the expected electromagnetic signatures of
such a system. We make several astrophysically motivated assumptions to further
constrain the parameters of GW190425. By simply assuming that both components
were NSs, we reduce the possible component masses significantly, finding $m_1 =
1.85^{+0.27}_{-0.19}$ M$_\odot$ and $m_2 = 1.47^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ M$_\odot$.
However if the GW190425 progenitor system was a NS-black hole merger, we find
best-fitting parameters $m_1 = 2.19^{+0.21}_{-0.17}$ M$_\odot$ and $m_2 =
1.26^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ M$_\odot$. For a well-motivated BNS system where the
lighter NS has a mass similar to the mass of non-recycled NSs in MW BNS
systems, we find $m_1 = 2.03^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ M$_\odot$ and $m_2 = 1.35 \pm
0.09$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to only 7% mass uncertainties. For all
scenarios, we expect a prompt collapse of the resulting remnant to a black
hole. Examining detailed models with component masses similar to our
best-fitting results, we find the electromagnetic counterpart to GW190425 is
expected to be significantly redder and fainter than that of GW170817. We find
that almost all reported observations used to search for an electromagnetic
counterpart for GW190425 were too shallow to detect the expected counterpart.
If the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration promptly provides the chirp mass, the
astronomical community can adapt their observations to improve the likelihood
of detecting a counterpart for similarly ""high-mass"" BNS systems. (abridged)

relations followed by the bulk of the AGN population. We report in our
WISE/SDSS-selected Hyperluminous (WISSH) $z=2-4$ broad-line quasar sample, the
discovery of a dependence between the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity ($L_{\rm
2-10}$) and the blueshifted velocity of the CIV emission line ($v_{\rm CIV}$)
indicative of accretion disc winds. In particular, sources with fastest winds
($v_{\rm CIV}\gtrsim 3000~\rm km s^{-1}$) possess $\sim$0.5-1 dex lower $L_{\rm

found on $L_{\rm UV}$, $L_{\rm MIR}$, $L_{\rm bol}$, photon index and
absorption column density. We interpret these findings in the context of
accretion disc wind models. Both magnetohydrodynamic and line-driven models can
qualitatively explain the reported relations as a consequence of X-ray
shielding from the inner wind regions. In case of line-driven winds, the launch
of fast winds is favoured by a reduced X-ray emission, and we speculate that
these winds may play a role in directly limiting the coronal hard X-ray
production.

the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). We then selected those quasars whose
line emission is spatially resolved and performed a kinematic analysis on ALMA
observations. We estimated the dynamical mass of the systems by modeling the
gas kinematics with a rotating disc taking into account geometrical and
instrumental effects. Our dynamical mass estimates, combined with $M_{BH}$
obtained from literature and our own new ${\rm CIV}\lambda1550$ observations,
have allowed us to investigate the $ M_{BH}/M_{dyn}$ in the early Universe.
Overall we obtained a sample of $10$ quasars at $z\sim2-7$ in which line
emission is detected with high S/N ($> 5-10$) and the gas kinematics is
spatially resolved and dominated by ordered rotation. The estimated dynamical
masses place $6$ out of $10$ quasars above the local relation yielding to a
$M_{BH}/M_{dyn}$ ratios $\sim10\times$ higher than those estimated in low-$z$
galaxies. On the other hand, we found that $4$ quasars at $z\sim 4-6$ have
dynamical-to-BH mass ratios consistent with what is observed in early-type
galaxies in the local Universe.

We do this via three methods of analysis, investigating: the merger fraction of
AGN, the AGN fraction of merging systems and the AGN fraction of galaxies with
close companions. In each case, we find an increased abundance of AGN within
merging systems relative to control samples of inactive or isolated galaxies
(by up to a factor of $\approx 3$ depending on the analysis method used),
confirming that mergers are enhancing BH accretion rates for at least a subset
of the galaxy population. The greatest excess of AGN triggered via a merger are
found in lower mass ($M_* \sim 10^{10}$~\Msol) gas rich ($f_{\mathrm{gas}} >
0.2$) central galaxies with lower mass BHs ($M_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim
10^{7}$~\Msol) at lower redshifts ($z<1$). We find no enhancement of AGN
triggered via mergers in more massive galaxies ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{11}$~\Msol).
The enhancement of AGN is not uniform throughout the phases of a merger, and
instead peaks within the early \emph{remnants} of merging systems (typically
lagging $\approx 300$~Myr post-coalescence of the two galaxies at $z=0.5$). We
argue that neither major ($M_{\mathrm{*,1}} / M_{\mathrm{*,2}} \geq
\frac{1}{4}$) nor minor mergers ($\frac{1}{10} < M_{\mathrm{*,1}} /
M_{\mathrm{*,2}} < \frac{1}{4}$) are statistically relevant for enhancing BH
masses globally. Whilst at all redshifts the galaxies experiencing a merger
have accretion rates that are on average 2--3 times that of isolated galaxies,
the majority of mass that is accreted onto BHs occurs outside the periods of a
merger. We compute that on average no more than 15\% of a BHs final day mass
comes from the enhanced accretion rates triggered via a merger

identical, collisionless particles have remained elusive for decades. In
particular, a reason why mass density profiles like the Navarro-Frenk-White or
the Einasto profile are good fits to simulation- and observation-based dark
matter halos has not been found. Given the class of three dimensional,
spherically symmetric power-law probability density distributions to locate
individual particles in the ensemble mentioned above, we derive the
constraining equation for the power-law index for the most and least likely
joint ensemble configurations. We find that any dark matter halo can be
partitioned into three regions: a core, an intermediate part, and an outskirts
part up to boundary radius $r_\mathrm{max}$. The power-law index of the core is
determined by the mean radius of the particle distribution within the core. The
intermediate region becomes isothermal in the limit of infinitely many
particles. The slope of the mass density profile far from the centre is
determined by the choice of $r_\mathrm{max}$ with respect to the outmost halo
particle, such that two typical limiting cases arise that explain the
$r^{-3}$-slope for galaxy-cluster outskirts and the $r^{-4}$-slope for galactic
outskirts. Hence, we succeed in deriving the mass density profiles of common
fitting functions from a general viewpoint. These results also allow to find a
simple explanation for the cusp-core-problem and to separate the halo
description from its dynamics.

part of the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE).
While this galaxy is detected both in line and continuum emission in ALMA Band
7, it is completely dark in UV/optical filters and only presents a marginal
detection in the UltraVISTA Ks band. We discuss the nature of the observed ALMA
line, i.e. whether the emission comes from [CII] at z~4.6, or from high-J CO
transitions at z~2.2. In the first case we find a [CII]-to-FIR luminosity ratio
of log(L_[CII]/L_FIR)=-2.5, consistent with the average value for local
star-forming galaxies (SFGs); in the second case, instead, the source would lie
outside of the empirical relations between L_CO and L_FIR found in the
literature. At both redshifts, we derive the star-formation rate (SFR) from the
ALMA continuum, and the stellar mass (M*) by using stellar population synthesis
models as input for LePHARE spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.
Exploiting our results, we believe that Gal-A is a Main-Sequence (MS), dusty
SFG at z=4.6 (i.e. [CII] emitter) with log(SFR/[M/yr])~1.4 and log(M*/M)~9.7.
This work underlines the crucial role of the ALPINE survey in making a census
of this class of objects, in order to unveil their contribution to the global
star-formation rate density (SFRD) of the Universe at the end of the
Reionisation epoch.

continuum luminosity to the total infrared luminosity (L$_{\rm IR}$) after
constraining the dust spectral energy distribution by stacking a photometric
sample similar to ALPINE in ancillary single-dish far-infrared data. We found
that our continuum detections have a median L$_{\rm IR}$ of 4.4$\times 10^{11}$

pointings. They are at lower redshift than the ALPINE targets, with a mean
photometric redshift of 2.5$\pm$0.2. We measured the 850 $\mu$m number counts
between 0.35 and 3.5 mJy, improving the current interferometric constraints in
this flux density range. We found a slope break in the number counts around 3
mJy with a shallower slope below this value. More than 40 % of the cosmic
infrared background is emitted by sources brighter than 0.35 mJy. Finally, we
detected the [CII] line in 75 of our targets. Their median [CII] luminosity is
4.8$\times$10$^8$ L$_\odot$ and their median full width at half maximum is 252

recently motivated studies of various Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models. Within
these models, different classes of BH solutions are possible, depending on the
non-minimal coupling function $f(\phi)$, between the scalar field and the
Maxwell invariant. Here we consider the class wherein both the (bald)
electrovacuum Reissner-Nordstr\""om (RN) BH and new scalarised BHs co-exist, and
the former are never unstable against scalar perturbations. In particular we
examine the model, within this subclass, with a quartic coupling function:
$f(\Phi) = 1+\alpha \Phi ^4$. The domain of existence of the scalarised BHs,
for fixed $\alpha$, is composed of two branches. The first branch (cold
scalarised BHs) is continuously connected to the extremal RN BH. The second
branch (hot scalarised BHs) connects to the first one at the minimum value of
the charge to mass ratio and it includes overcharged BHs. We then assess the
perturbative stability of the scalarised solutions, focusing on spherical
perturbations. On the one hand, cold scalarised BHs are shown to be unstable by
explicitly computing growing modes. The instability is quenched at both
endpoints of the first branch. On the other hand, hot scalarised BHs are shown
to be stable by using the S-deformation method. Thus, in the spherical sector
this model possesses two stable BH local ground states (RN and hot scalarised).
We point out that the branch structure of BHs in this model parallels the one
of BHs in five dimensional vacuum gravity, with [Myer-Perry BHs, fat rings,
thin rings] playing the role of [RN, cold scalarised, hot scalarised] BHs.

lensing is known to be suboptimal for surveys that are currently operating and
will continue to become less and less efficient as instrumental noise
decreases. While foregrounds can in principle be mitigated by observing in more
frequency bands, progress in delensing hinges entirely on algorithmic advances.
We demonstrate here a new inference method that solves this problem by sampling
the exact Bayesian posterior of any desired cosmological parameters, of the
gravitational lensing potential, and of the delensed CMB maps, given lensed
temperature and polarization data. We validate the method using simulated CMB
data with non-white noise and masking on up to 650\,deg$^2$ patches of sky. A
unique strength of this approach is the ability to jointly estimate
cosmological parameters which control both the primordial CMB and the lensing
potential, which we demonstrate here for the first time by sampling both the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and the amplitude of the lensing potential,
$A_\phi$. The method allows us to perform the most precise check to-date of

of growing importance. This entropy of entanglement is conventionally computed
relative to Cauchy hypersurfaces where it is possible via a partial tracing to
associate a reduced density matrix to the spacelike region of interest. In
recent years Sorkin has proposed an alternative, manifestly covariant,
formulation of entropy in terms of the spacetime two-point correlation
function. This formulation, developed for a Gaussian scalar field theory, is
explicitly spacetime in nature and evades some of the possible non-covariance
issues faced by the conventional formulation. In this paper we take the first
steps towards extending Sorkin's entropy to non-Gaussian theories where Wick's
theorem no longer holds and one would expect higher correlators to contribute.
We consider quartic perturbations away from the Gaussian case and find that to
first order in perturbation theory, the entropy formula derived by Sorkin
continues to hold but with the two-point correlators replaced by their
perturbation-corrected counterparts. We then show that our results continue to
hold for arbitrary perturbations (of both bosonic and fermionic theories). This
is a non-trivial and, to our knowledge, novel result. Furthermore we also
derive closed-form formulas of the entanglement entropy for arbitrary
perturbations at first and second order. Our work also suggests avenues for
further extensions to generic interacting theories.

of the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early Times (ALPINE) with

with ALMA, as a tracer of the systemic velocity of the galaxies, and we find
that 90% of the selected objects have Lya-[CII] velocity offsets in the range 0
< Dv_Lya-[CII] < 400 km/s, in line with the few measurements available so far
in the early Universe, and significantly smaller than those observed at lower
z. We observe ISM-[CII] offsets in the range -500 < Dv_ISM-[CII] < 0 km/s, in
line with values at all redshifts. We find significant anticorrelations between
Dv_Lya-[CII] and the Lya rest-frame equivalent width EW0(Lya) (or equivalently,
the Lya escape fraction f_esc(Lya)). According to available models for the
radiative transfer of Lya photons, the escape of Lya photons would be favored
in galaxies with high outflow velocities, in agreement with our observations.
The uniform shell model would also predict that the Lya escape in galaxies with
slow outflows (0 < v_out < 300 km/s) is mainly determined by the neutral
hydrogen column density (NHI), while the alternative model by Steidel+10 would
favor a combination of NHI and covering fraction as driver of the Lya escape.
We suggest that the observed increase in Lya escape that is observed between
z~2 and z~6 is not due to a higher incidence of fast outflows at high redshift,
but rather to a decrease in average NHI along the line of sight, or
alternatively, a decrease in HI covering fraction. [abridged]

and clusters of galaxies (GCs). The relaxed, spiral-type CFs were initially
thought to be isobaric, but a significant, $10\%$--$20\%$ jump in the thermal
pressure $P_t$ was reported when deprojected CFs were stacked, interpreted as
missing $P_t$ below the CFs (i.e. at smaller radii $r$) due to a
locally-enhanced nonthermal pressure $P_{nt}$. We report a significant
($\sim4.3\sigma$) deprojected jump in $P_t$ across a single sharp CF in the
Centaurus cluster. Additional seven CFs are deprojected in the GCs A2029,
A2142, A2204, and Centaurus, all found to be consistent (stacked:
$\sim1.9\sigma$) with similar pressure jumps. Combining our sample with high
quality deprojected CFs from the literature indicates pressure jumps at
significance levels ranging between $2.7\sigma$ and $5.0\sigma$, depending on
assumptions. Our nominal results are consistent with $P_{nt}\simeq
(0.1\mbox{--}0.3)P_t$ just below the CF. We test different deprojection and
analysis methods to confirm that our results are robust, and show that without
careful deprojection, an opposite pressure trend may incorrectly be inferred.
Analysing all available deprojected data, we also find: (i) a nearly constant
CF contrast $q$ of density and temperature within each GC, monotonically
increasing with the GC mass $M_{200}$ as $q\propto M_{200}^{0.23\pm0.04}$; (ii)
hydrostatic mass discontinuities indicating fast bulk tangential flows below
all deprojected CFs, with a mean Mach number $\sim0.76$; and (iii) the newly
deprojected CFs are consistent (stacked: $\sim2.9\sigma$) with a
$1.25^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ metallicity drop across the CF. These findings suggest
that GCs quite generally harbor extended spiral flows.

growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs), as determined from the most
up-to-date observations of z>=5 quasars. This includes their accretion rates
and growth history, their host galaxies, and the large-scale environments that
enabled their emergence less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The
available multi-wavelength data show that these SMBHs are consistent with
Eddington-limited, radiatively efficient accretion that had to proceed almost
continuously since very early epochs. ALMA observations of the hosts' ISM
reveal gas-rich, well developed galaxies, with a wide range of SFRs that may
exceed ~1000 M_sol/yr. Moreover, ALMA uncovers a high fraction of companion,
interacting galaxies, separated by <100 kpc (projected). This supports the idea
that the first generation of high-mass, luminous SMBHs grew in over-dense
environments, and that major mergers may be important drivers for rapid SMBH
and host galaxy growth. Current X-ray surveys cannot access the lower-mass,
supposedly more abundant counterparts of these rare z>5 massive quasars, which
should be able to elucidate the earliest stages of BH formation and growth.
Such lower-mass nuclear BHs will be the prime targets of the deepest surveys
planned for the next generation of facilities, such as the upcoming Athena
mission and the future Lynx mission concept.

of SNe in the same galaxy as any random pair of galaxies, with the exception of
the SN light-curve stretch. We show at $2.8\sigma$ significance that at least

of the celestial OPE. We compute the first subleading correction to the OPE by
analysing the four graviton scattering amplitude directly in Mellin space. The
subleading term can be written as a linear combination of BMS descendants with
the OPE coefficients determined by BMS algebra and the coefficient of the
leading term in the OPE. This can be done by defining a suitable BMS primary
state. We find that among the descendants, which appear at the first subleading

sensitive only to the difference between the squared masses, and not to the
individual masses, of neutrinos. In this work, we show that the lensing of
neutrinos induced by a gravitational source substantially modifies this
standard picture and it gives rise to a novel contribution through which the
oscillation probabilities also depend on the individual neutrino masses. A
gravitating mass located between a source and a detector deflects the neutrinos
in their journey, and at a detection point, neutrinos arriving through
different paths can lead to the phenomenon of interference. The flavour
transition probabilities computed in the presence of such interference depend
on the individual masses of neutrinos whenever there is a non-zero path
difference between the interfering neutrinos. We demonstrate this explicitly by
considering an example of weak lensing induced by a Schwarzschild mass. Through
the simplest two flavour case, we show that the oscillation probability in the
presence of lensing is sensitive to the sign of $\Delta m^2 = m_2^2 -m_1^2$,
for non-maximal mixing between two neutrinos, unlike in the case of standard
vacuum oscillation in flat spacetime. Further, the probability itself
oscillates with respect to the path difference and the frequency of such
oscillations depends on the absolute mass scale $m_1$ or $m_2$. We also give
results for realistic three flavour case and discuss various implications of
gravitationally modified neutrino oscillations and means of observing them.

exhibit a transition, taking place at the end of 2012, from an X-ray active
state to a radio pulsar state. The X-ray emission based on archival XMM-Newton
observations is highly variable, showing rapid variations (10 s) from a high
X-ray luminosity mode to a low mode and back. A flaring mode has also been
observed. X-ray pulsations have been detected during the high mode only. In
this work we present two possible interpretations for the rapid swings between
the high and low modes. In the first scenario, this phenomenon can be explained
by a rapid oscillation between a propeller state and a radio-ejection pulsar
state, during which the pulsar wind prevents matter from falling onto the
neutron star surface. In the second scenario, a radio pulsar is always active,
the intra-binary shock is located just outside the light cylinder in the high
mode, while it expands during the low mode. At variance with other transitional
pulsars, J12270 shows two instances of the low mode: a low-soft and low-hard
mode. Performing an X-ray spectral analysis, we show that the harder component,
present in the low-hard spectra, is probably related to the tail of the flare
emission. This supports the understanding that the flare mechanism is
independent of the high-to-low mode transitions.

has been shown to trace the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxies in the nearby
Universe and up to $z \sim 2$. Whether this is also the case at higher redshift
and in the early Universe remains debated. The ALPINE survey, which targeted
118 star-forming galaxies at $4.4 < z< 5.9$, provides a new opportunity to
examine this question with the first statistical dataset. Using the ALPINE data
and earlier measurements from the literature we examine the relation between
the [CII] luminosity and the SFR over the entire redshift range from $z \sim
4-8$. ALPINE galaxies, which are both detected in [CII] and dust continuum,
show a good agreement with the local L([CII])-SFR relation. Galaxies undetected
in the continuum with ALMA are found to be over-luminous in [CII], when the UV
SFR is used. After accounting for dust-obscured star formation, by an amount
SFR(IR)$\approx$SFR(UV) on average, which results from two different stacking
methods and SED fitting, the ALPINE galaxies show an L([CII])-SFR relation
comparable to the local one. When [CII] non-detections are taken into account,
the slope may be marginally steeper at high-z, although this is still somewhat
uncertain. When compared in a homogeneous manner, the $z>6 $ [CII] measurements
(detections and upper limits) do not behave very differently from the $z \sim
4-6$ data. We find a weak dependence of L([CII])/SFR on the Lyman-alpha
equivalent width. Finally, we find that the ratio L([CII])/LIR $\sim (1-3)
\times 10^{-3}$ for the ALPINE sources, comparable to that of ""normal"" galaxies
at lower redshift. Our analysis, which includes the largest sample ($\sim 150$
galaxies) of [CII] measurements at $z>4$ available so far, suggests no or
little evolution of the L([CII])-SFR relation over the last 13 Gyr of cosmic

core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its
detonation are followed with an increased resolution compared to the rest of
the star treating the propagation of the detonation wave more accurately. This
significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields from the

carbon-oxygen core with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped
to three dimensions. We ensured the stability of the white dwarf with a
relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started.
Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS.
An ignition mechanism of the carbon detonation was observed, which received
little attention before. In this ""scissors mechanism"", the impact the helium
detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite to its
ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible
in a carbon enriched transition region between the core and shell. The
detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive to details of the core-shell
transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell mixing
taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition
mechanism differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the
synthetic observables are not significant. Though they do not fit observations
better than previous simulations, they illustrate the need for
multi-dimensional simulations.

enumeration by the number of descents to give a combinatorial interpretation of
certain polynomials related to Stirling numbers.
  Quasi-Stirling permutations, which can be viewed as labeled noncrossing
matchings, were introduced by Archer et al. as a natural extension of Stirling
permutations. Janson's correspondence between Stirling permutations and labeled
increasing plane trees extends to a bijection between quasi-Stirling
permutations and the same set of trees without the increasing restriction.
  Archer et al. posed the problem of enumerating quasi-Stirling permutations by
the number of descents, and conjectured that there are $(n+1)^{n-1}$ such
permutations of size $n$ having the maximum number of descents. In this paper
we prove their conjecture, and we give the generating function for
quasi-Stirling permutations by the number of descents, expressed as a
compositional inverse of the generating function of Eulerian polynomials. We
also find the analogue for quasi-Stirling permutations of the main result from
Gessel and Stanley's paper. We prove that the distribution of descents on these
permutations is asymptotically normal, and that the roots of the corresponding
quasi-Stirling polynomials are all real, in analogy to B\'ona's results for
Stirling permutations.
  Finally, we generalize our results to a one-parameter family of permutations
that extends $k$-Stirling permutations, and we refine them by also keeping
track of the number of ascents and the number of plateaus.

expensive, cannot be updated quickly and hence for large datasets such as the
LSST cannot be applied. Previous work has been done to develop alternative
unsupervised feature extraction algorithms for light curves, but the cost of
doing so still remains high. In this work, we propose an end-to-end algorithm
that automatically learns the representation of light curves that allows an
accurate automatic classification. We study a series of deep learning
architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks and test them in automated
classification scenarios. Our method uses minimal data preprocessing, can be
updated with a low computational cost for new observations and light curves,
and can scale up to massive datasets. We transform each light curve into an
input matrix representation whose elements are the differences in time and
magnitude, and the outputs are classification probabilities. We test our method
in three surveys: OGLE-III, Gaia and WISE. We obtain accuracies of about $95\%$
in the main classes and $75\%$ in the majority of subclasses. We compare our
results with the Random Forest classifier and obtain competitive accuracies
while being faster and scalable. The analysis shows that the computational
complexity of our approach grows up linearly with the light curve size, while
the traditional approach cost grows as $N\log{(N)}$.

objectives \citep[first sentence of page 1]{cook2018introduction}. This
description is true with the additional caveat that the efficiency gains
obtained by envelope methodology are mitigated by model selection volatility to
an unknown degree. The bulk of the current envelope methodology literature does
not account for this added variance that arises from the uncertainty in model
selection. Recent strides to account for model selection volatility have been
made on two fronts: 1) development of a weighted envelope estimator, in the
context of multivariate regression, to account for this variability directly;
2) development of a model selection criterion that facilitates consistent
estimation of the correct envelope model for more general settings. In this
paper, we unify these two directions and provide weighted envelope estimators
that directly account for the variability associated with model selection and
are appropriate for general multivariate estimation settings for vector valued
parameters. Our weighted estimation technique provides practitioners with
robust and useful variance reduction in finite samples. Theoretical
justification is given for our estimators and validity of a nonparametric
bootstrap procedure for estimating their asymptotic variance are established.
Simulation studies and a real data analysis support our claims and demonstrate
the advantage of our weighted envelope estimator when model selection
variability is present.

renewed interest in zero-sum games within machine learning and optimization.
Adversarial learning and generative adversarial network approaches are touted

below the main sequence, we find an average high mass slope (alpha) of the
resolved main sequence curves to be ~ -0.4. The scatter of this slope is higher
among the lower mass star forming galaxies and those above the main sequence
compared to quenched galaxies, due to lack of an evolved bulge. Our findings
agree well with an inside-out quenching of star-formation. We find that the

lower stellar mass surface densities compared to star forming galaxies, which

  Wasserstein Distance",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Minimum distance estimation (MDE) gained recent attention as a formulation of
(implicit) generative modeling. It considers minimizing, over model parameters,
a statistical distance between the empirical data distribution and the model.
This formulation lends itself well to theoretical analysis, but typical results
are hindered by the curse of dimensionality. To overcome this and devise a
scalable finite-sample statistical MDE theory, we adopt the framework of smooth
1-Wasserstein distance (SWD) $\mathsf{W}_1^{(\sigma)}$. The SWD was recently
shown to preserve the metric and topological structure of classic Wasserstein
distances, while enjoying dimension-free empirical convergence rates. In this
work, we conduct a thorough statistical study of the minimum smooth Wasserstein
estimators (MSWEs), first proving the estimator's measurability and asymptotic
consistency. We then characterize the limit distribution of the optimal model
parameters and their associated minimal SWD. These results imply an
$O(n^{-1/2})$ generalization bound for generative modeling based on MSWE, which
holds in arbitrary dimension. Our main technical tool is a novel
high-dimensional limit distribution result for empirical
$\mathsf{W}_1^{(\sigma)}$. The characterization of a nondegenerate limit stands
in sharp contrast with the classic empirical 1-Wasserstein distance, for which
a similar result is known only in the one-dimensional case. The validity of our
theory is supported by empirical results, posing the SWD as a potent tool for
learning and inference in high dimensions.

measuring discrepancy between probability distributions. As these applications
inherently rely on approximating distributions from samples, we consider
empirical approximation under two popular $f$-divergences: the total variation
(TV) distance and the $\chi^2$-divergence. To circumvent the sensitivity of
these divergences to support mismatch, the framework of Gaussian smoothing is
adopted. We study the limit distributions of
$\sqrt{n}\delta_{\mathsf{TV}}(P_n\ast\mathcal{N},P\ast\mathcal{N})$ and
$n\chi^2(P_n\ast\mathcal{N}\|P\ast\mathcal{N})$, where $P_n$ is the empirical
measure based on $n$ independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
observations from $P$,
$\mathcal{N}_\sigma:=\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2\mathrm{I}_d)$, and $\ast$ stands
for convolution. In arbitrary dimension, the limit distributions are
characterized in terms of Gaussian process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with covariance
operator that depends on $P$ and the isotropic Gaussian density of parameter
$\sigma$. This, in turn, implies optimality of the $n^{-1/2}$ expected value
convergence rates recently derived for

obtained $^{56}$Ni distributions for different core-collapse supernovae
(CC-SNe), showing that the $^{56}$Ni distribution of stripped envelope CC-SNe
(SE-SNe: types IIb, Ib, and Ic) is highly incompatible with that of hydrogen
rich type II SNe (SNe-II). This motivates questions on differences in
progenitors, explosion mechanisms, and $^{56}$Ni estimation methods. Here, we
re-estimate the nucleosynthetic yields of $^{56}$Ni for a well-observed and
well-defined sample of SE-SNe in a uniform manner. This allows us to
investigate whether the observed SN-II--SE-SN $^{56}$Ni separation is due to
real differences between these SN types, or because of systematic errors in the
estimation methods. We compiled a sample of well observed SE-SNe and measured
$^{56}$Ni masses through three different methods proposed in the literature.
Arnett's rule -as previously shown - gives $^{56}$Ni masses for SE-SNe that are
considerably higher than SNe-II. While for the distributions calculated using
both the Khatami&Kasen prescription and Tail $^{56}$Ni masses are offset to
lower values than `Arnett values', their $^{56}$Ni distributions are still
statistically higher than that of SNe II. Our results are strongly driven by a
lack of SE-SN with low $^{56}$Ni masses (that are in addition strictly lower
limits). The lowest SE-SN $^{56}$Ni mass in our sample is of 0.015M$_\odot$,
below which are more than 25$\%$ of SNe II. We conclude that there exists real,
intrinsic differences in the mass of synthesised radioactive material between
SNe II and SE-SNe . Any proposed current or future CCSN progenitor scenario and
explosion mechanism must be able to explain why and how such differences arise,
or outline a yet to be fully explored bias in current SN samples.

extrapolation method is usually used to analyse the data. This method is based
on the observation that the change in Gibbs free energy associated with
unfolding, $\Delta_rG$, is often found to be a linear function of the
denaturant concentration, $D$. The free energy change of unfolding in the
absence of denaturant, $\Delta_rG_0$, is estimated by extrapolation from this
linear relationship. Data analysis is generally done by nonlinear least-squares
regression to obtain estimates of the parameters as well as confidence
intervals. We have compared different methods for calculating confidence
intervals of the parameters and found that a simple method based on linear
theory gives as good, if not better, results than more advanced methods. We
have also compared three different parameterizations of the linear
extrapolation method and show that one of the forms, $\Delta_rG(D) =
\Delta_rG_0 - mD$, is problematic since the value of $\Delta_rG_0$ and that of
the $m$-value are correlated in the nonlinear least-squares analysis. Parameter
correlation can in some cases cause problems in the estimation of
confidence-intervals and -regions and should be avoided when possible. Two
alternative parameterizations, $\Delta_rG(D) = -m(D-D_{50})$ and $\Delta_rG(D)
= \Delta_rG_0(1-D/D_{50})$, where $D_{50}$ is the midpoint of the transition

model most of the theoretical tools to develop control laws break down. In
these settings, machine learning controllers become attractive: Controllers
that can learn and adapt to complex systems, developing control laws where the
engineer cannot. This article focuses on utilizing machine learning controllers
in practical applications, specifically using deep reinforcement learning in
motion control systems for an autonomous underwater vehicle with six
degrees-of-freedom. Two methods are considered: end-to-end learning, where the
vehicle is left entirely alone to explore the solution space in its search for
an optimal policy, and PID assisted learning, where the DRL controller is
essentially split into three separate parts, each controlling its own actuator.

way for testing what is known as the ""no-hair"" theorem, stating that isolated

arbitrarily test the no-hair theorem for deviations from the Kerr result with
no prior theoretical knowledge or motivation. In this paper, we present such a
new general, stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat black hole

Kerr black hole), extending the previous work of Johannsen. In this new metric,
five free non-linear functions parameterically deviate from the Kerr result,
allowing one to effectively transform to many alternative black hole solutions
present in the literature. We then derive analytic expressions for the
Keplerian and epicyclic frequencies, the orbital energy and angular momentum,
and the location of the innermost stable orbit of circular equatorial particle
orbits. We also compute the image of the photon rings in the new spacetime,
which correspond to the boundary of the black hole shadow image taken by the
Event Horizon Telescope. We finally compare each quantity for the Kerr result
against various parameterizations of the metric, finding that, especially for
highly rotating black holes, the two solutions disagree significantly. Such a
metric parameterization allows one to perform the no-hair tests in a
model-independent way, and finally map constraints to specific alternative

We propose SuperDTI to learn the nonlinear relationship between
diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) and the corresponding tensor-derived
quantitative maps as well as the fiber tractography. Super DTI bypasses the
tensor fitting procedure, which is well known to be highly susceptible to noise
and motion in DWIs. The network is trained and tested using datasets from Human
Connectome Project and patients with ischemic stroke. SuperDTI is compared
against the state-of-the-art methods for diffusion map reconstruction and fiber
tracking. Results: Using training and testing data both from the same protocol
and scanner, SuperDTI is shown to generate fractional anisotropy and mean
diffusivity maps, as well as fiber tractography, from as few as six raw DWIs.
The method achieves a quantification error of less than 5% in all regions of
interest in white matter and gray matter structures. We also demonstrate that
the trained neural network is robust to noise and motion in the testing data,
and the network trained using healthy volunteer data can be directly applied to
stroke patient data without compromising the lesion detectability. Conclusion:
This paper demonstrates the feasibility of superfast diffusion tensor imaging
and fiber tractography using deep learning with as few as six DWIs directly,
bypassing tensor fitting. Such a significant reduction in scan time may allow
the inclusion of DTI into the clinical routine for many potential applications.

determine whether the X-ray emission from each system is more likely a single

point source systems. We examine each point source's spectra via a Monte Carlo
method that probabilistically identifies the likely origin of each photon. When
doing so, we find that (i) the secondary X-ray point sources in 2 of the
systems have $L_{\mathrm{X}}<10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, such that we cannot rule
out a non-AGN origin, (ii) one source has a secondary with
$L_{\mathrm{X}}>10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ but a spectrum that is too soft to
definitively preclude being X-ray emitting diffuse gas that was photoionized by
the primary AGN, and (iii) one system (SDSS J1126+2944) is a dual AGN.

of blurry membrane fragments as cell interior, which leads to merging of two
adjacent neuron sections into one via the blurry membrane region. Human
annotators can easily avoid such errors by implicitly performing gap
completion, taking into account the continuity of membranes.
  Drawing inspiration from these human strategies, we formulate the
segmentation task as an edge labeling problem on a graph with local topological

continuity, i.e. the absence of gaps. The cost function of the ILP is the
pixel-wise deviation of the segmentation from a priori membrane probabilities
derived from the data.
  Based on membrane probability maps obtained using random forest classifiers

segmentation accuracy compared to a variety of standard segmentation
approaches. Our method successfully performs gap completion and leads to fewer

address the problem of vanishing gradients, we also put forward gated GRNNs

experiments involving both synthetic and real datasets, time-gated GRNNs are
shown to improve upon GRNNs in problems with long term dependencies, while node

preserving differential privacy (DP) for the iterative clustering algorithms
has been extensively studied in the interactive settings. However, existing
interactive differentially private clustering algorithms suffer from a
non-convergence problem, i.e., these algorithms may not terminate without a

this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel differentially private
clustering framework in the interactive settings which controls the orientation
of the movement of the centroids over the iterations to ensure the convergence
by injecting DP noise in a selected area. We prove that, in the expected case,

because they will be rewarded if they do so. Consumers are encouraged to share
their data needs because the market will solve the discovery and integration

  We consider internal markets that operate within organizations to bring down
data silos, as well as external markets that operate across organizations to
increase the value of data for everybody. We outline a research agenda that
revolves around two problems. The problem of market design, or how to design
rules that lead to the outcomes we want, and the systems problem, how to
implement the market and enforce the rules. Treating data as a first-class

management becomes a critical challenge. With the proliferation of aerial IoT
devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), interference characteristics

networks. In this paper, we consider 3D topology IoT networks with a mixture of
aerial and terrestrial links, with low-cost cross-dipole antennas at ground
nodes and omni-directional antennas at aerial nodes. Considering a
massive-access communication scenario, we first derive the statistics of the
channel gain at IoT receivers in closed form while taking into account the
radiation patterns of both ground and aerial nodes. These are then used to
calculate the ergodic achievable rate as a function of the height of the aerial
receiver. We propose an interference mitigation scheme that utilizes 3D antenna
radiation pattern with different dipole antenna settings. Our results show that
using the proposed scheme, the ergodic achievable rate improves as the height
of aerial receivers increases. In addition, the ratio between the ground and
aerial receivers that maximizes the peak rate also increases with the aerial
IoT receiver height.

dynamic diversity emerges, but never a chaotic behavior as earlier studies had
reported. The procedure by which the dynamics of the PPG signal is determined
consists of contrasting the dynamics of a PPG signal with well-known
dynamics---named reference signals in this study---, mostly present in physical
systems, such as periodic, quasi-periodic, aperiodic, chaotic or random
dynamics. For this purpose, this paper provides two methods of analysis based
on Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures. The former uses a Convolutional

the CNN model identifies the dynamics present in the PPG signal at different
timescales, assigning, according to a classification process, an occurrence
probability to each of them. The latter uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. With each of the
signals, whether reference signals or PPG signals, the RNN model infers an
evolution function (nonlinear regression model) based on training data, and
considers its predictive capability over a relatively short time horizon.

atmospheric composition and indications of the presence of clouds and hazes.
Spectral retrieval is the leading technique for interpretation of transmission
spectra and is employed by several teams using a variety of forward models and
parameter estimation algorithms. However, different model suites have mostly
been used in isolation and so it is unknown whether the results from each are
comparable. As we approach the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope we
anticipate advances in wavelength coverage, precision, and resolution of
transit spectroscopic data, so it is important that the tools that will be used
to interpret these information rich spectra are validated. To this end, we
present an inter-model comparison of three retrieval suites: TauREx, NEMESIS
and CHIMERA. We demonstrate that the forward model spectra are in good
agreement (residual deviations on the order of 20 - 40 ppm), and discuss the
results of cross retrievals between the three tools. Generally, the constraints
from the cross retrievals are consistent with each other and with input values
to within 1 sigma However, for high precision scenarios with error envelopes of
order 30 ppm, subtle differences in the simulated spectra result in
discrepancies between the different retrieval suites, and inaccuracies in
retrieved values of several sigma. This can be considered analogous to
substantial systematic/astrophysical noise in a real observation, or
errors/omissions in a forward model such as molecular linelist incompleteness

information channels such as social networks let people share news that do not
necessarily be trust worthy. Sometimes, these sources of information produce
fake news deliberately with doubtful purposes and the consumers of that
information share it to other users thinking that the information is accurate.
This transmission of information represents an issue in our society, as can
influence negatively the opinion of people about certain figures, groups or
ideas. Hence, it is desirable to design a system that is able to detect and
classify information as fake and categorize a source of information as trust
worthy or not. Current systems experiment difficulties performing this task, as
it is complicated to design an automatic procedure that can classify this
information independent on the context. In this work, we propose a mechanism to
detect fake news through a classifier based on weighted causal graphs. These
graphs are specific hybrid models that are built through causal relations
retrieved from texts and consider the uncertainty of causal relations. We take
advantage of this representation to use the probability distributions of this
graph and built a fake news classifier based on the entropy and KL divergence
of learned and new information. We believe that the problem of fake news is
accurately tackled by this model due to its hybrid nature between a symbolic
and quantitative methodology. We describe the methodology of this classifier
and add empirical evidence of the usefulness of our proposed approach in the
form of synthetic experiments and a real experiment involving lung cancer.

quasilocal conserved quantities reads the linear dependence of non-quasilocal

from the stellar rotational modulations of Kepler data and (2) from the
brightness enhancements during the exoplanet transits caused by existence of
large star spots. As a result of the comparison, number of spots, spot
locations, and the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulations
is largely different from those of in-transit spots. We confirm that although
only two light curve minima appear per rotation, there are clearly many spots
present on the star. We find that the observed differential intensity changes
are sometimes consistent with the spot pattern detected by transits, but they
sometimes do not match with each other. Although the temporal evolution derived
from the rotational modulation differs from those of in-transit spots to a
certain degree, the emergence/decay rates of in-transit spots are within an
order of magnitude of those derived for sunspots as well as our previous
research based only on rotational modulations. This supports a hypothesis that
the emergence/decay of sunspots and extremely-large star spots on solar-type
stars occur through the same underlying processes.

has attracted growing attention over the past few years. Existing approaches
using multiple instance learning easily fall into local optima, because such
mechanism tends to learn from the most discriminative object in an image for
each category. Therefore, these methods suffer from missing object instances
which degrade the performance of WSOD. To address this problem, this paper
introduces an end-to-end object instance mining (OIM) framework for weakly
supervised object detection. OIM attempts to detect all possible object
instances existing in each image by introducing information propagation on the
spatial and appearance graphs, without any additional annotations. During the
iterative learning process, the less discriminative object instances from the
same class can be gradually detected and utilized for training. In addition, we
design an object instance reweighted loss to learn larger portion of each
object instance to further improve the performance. The experimental results on
two publicly available databases, VOC 2007 and 2012, demonstrate the efficacy
of proposed approach.

QAOA, a parametric quantum circuit and a classical optimizer iterates in a

of QAOA improves with increasing number of stages (depth) in the quantum

the classical optimizer increasing the number of optimization loop iterations.
We note a correlation among parameters of the lower-depth and the higher-depth

predict the gate parameters close to the optimal values. As a result, the
optimization loop converges in a fewer number of iterations. We choose graph

limited transmission capacity serving RES often leads to network congestion
since they are located in remote favorable locations. As a result, when poorly
scheduled, the intermittent nature of RES may result in high curtailments of
the free resource. Currently, grid operators utilize a static network when
performing day-ahead scheduling and ignore transmission flexibility. This paper
explores the possibility of utilizing network reconfiguration as a corrective
action to reduce the transmission congestion and thereby the reduction of RES
curtailments in day-ahead scheduling. To facilitate the RES integration in the
grid, a stochastic N-1 security-constrained unit-commitment with corrective
network reconfiguration (SSCUC-CNR) is modelled. SSCUC-CNR model is studied on
a modified IEEE 24-bus system with RES. The simulation results demonstrate that
CNR not only leads to a lower cost solution by reducing network congestion but
also facilitates RES integration by reducing congestion-induced curtailments in
high penetration cases. Emission studies demonstrate that more green generators
are committed resulting in reduced carbon emissions when CNR is implemented.

degenerate for small time steps. Numerical experiments suggest that only
first-order accuracy is achieved, at least for the pressure, in this aforesaid

second-order accuracy, and the numerical implementation, in fact, becomes
simpler. Therefore, although the pressure can be viewed as a Lagrange

proposed under semi-supervised learning framework, in which the underlying

linear systems arising from evolutionary partial differential equations, in
which the preconditioned matrix is proven to be diagonalizable and to have
identity-plus-low-rank decomposition in the case of the heat equation. In this
paper, we generalize the block circulant preconditioner by introducing a small
parameter $\epsilon>0$ into the top-right block of the block circulant
preconditioner. The implementation of the generalized preconditioner requires
the same computational complexity as that of the block circulant
one.Theoretically, we prove that (i) the generalization preserves the
diagonalizability and the identity-plus-low-rank decomposition; (ii) all
eigenvalues of the new preconditioned matrix are clustered at 1 for
sufficiently small $\epsilon$; (iii) GMRES method for the preconditioned system
has a linear convergence rate independent of size of the linear system when
$\epsilon$ is taken to be smaller than or comparable to square root of
time-step size. Numerical results are reported to confirm the efficiency of the
proposed preconditioner and to show that the generalization improves the

computational demands have been increasing significantly. Reliability analysis
for these systems when failure probabilities are small is significantly
challenging, requiring a large number of costly simulations. To address this

Adaptive Kriging (REAK). An extension of the Central Limit Theorem based on
Lindeberg condition is adopted here to derive the distribution of the number of
design samples with wrong sign estimate and subsequently determine the maximum
error rate for failure probability estimates. This error rate enables optimal
establishment of effective sampling regions at each stage of an adaptive scheme
for strategic generation of design samples. Moreover, it facilitates setting a
target accuracy for failure probability estimation, which is used as stopping
criterion for reliability analysis. These capabilities together can
significantly reduce the number of calls to sophisticated, computationally
demanding models. The application of REAK for four examples with varying extent
of nonlinearity and dimension is presented. Results indicate that REAK is able
to reduce the computational demand by as high as 50% compared to
state-of-the-art methods of Adaptive Kriging with Monte Carlo Simulation

density can appear in the Weyl anomaly. The Pontryagin density in the Weyl
anomaly is consistent, but it has a peculiar feature that the parent
three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor can violate CP only
(semi-)locally. In this paper, we study the supersymmetric completion of the
Pontryagin density in the Weyl anomaly, where the central charge $c$
effectively becomes a complex number. The supersymmetry suggests that it
accompanies the graviphoton $\theta$ term associated with the R-symmetry
gauging in the Weyl anomaly. It also accompanies new CP-violating terms in the
R-current anomaly. While there are no conclusive perturbative examples of
CP-violating super Weyl anomaly, we construct explicit supersymmetric dilaton
effective action which generates these anomalies.

multi-parameter Bayesian frameworks, such knowledge is incorporated as a prior.
On the other hand, various model parameters can have different learning rates
in real-world problems, especially with skewed data. Two often-faced challenges
in Operation Management and Management Science applications are the absence of
informative priors, and the inability to control parameter learning rates. In
this study, we propose a hierarchical Empirical Bayes approach that addresses
both challenges, and that can generalize to any Bayesian framework. Our method
learns empirical meta-priors from the data itself and uses them to decouple the
learning rates of first-order and second-order features (or any other given
feature grouping) in a Generalized Linear Model. As the first-order features
are likely to have a more pronounced effect on the outcome, focusing on
learning first-order weights first is likely to improve performance and
convergence time. Our Empirical Bayes method clamps features in each group
together and uses the deployed model's observed data to empirically compute a
hierarchical prior in hindsight. We report theoretical results for the
unbiasedness, strong consistency, and optimal frequentist cumulative regret
properties of our meta-prior variance estimator. We apply our method to a
standard supervised learning optimization problem, as well as an online
combinatorial optimization problem in a contextual bandit setting implemented
in an Amazon production system. Both during simulations and live experiments,
our method shows marked improvements, especially in cases of small traffic. Our
findings are promising, as optimizing over sparse data is often a challenge.

abnormal activity detection, which utilizes both abnormal and normal videos in
learning abnormalities with the help of multiple instance learning by providing
the data with video-level information. In the absence of temporal-annotations,
such a model is prone to give a false alarm while detecting the abnormalities.
For this reason, in this paper, we focus on the task of minimizing the false

while generated data are negative. This positive-negative classification
criterion was kept fixed all through the learning process of the discriminator
without considering the gradually improved quality of generated data, even if
they could be more realistic than real data at times. In contrast, it is more
reasonable to treat the generated data as unlabeled, which could be positive or
negative according to their quality. The discriminator is thus a classifier for
this positive and unlabeled classification problem, and we derive a new
Positive-Unlabeled GAN (PUGAN). We theoretically discuss the global optimality

right-handed Standard Model fermions transform non-trivially. We find that
cosmological constraints on this scenario are qualitatively much more severe
than on other well-studied cases of a new $U(1)$ gauge group, because the dark
photon couples to chiral fermions. In particular, the dark photon of
$U(1)_{T3R}$ is always produced and equilibrates in the early Universe, no
matter how small the gauge coupling, unless the symmetry-breaking scale is
extremely large. This occurs because, no matter how the weak the coupling, the
Goldstone mode (equivalently, the longitudinal polarization) does not decouple.
As a result, even the limit of an extremely light and weakly-coupled dark
photon of $U(1)_{T3R}$ is effectively ruled out by cosmological constraints,
unless the symmetry-breaking scale is extremely large. We also discuss the
possibility of ameliorating Hubble tension in this model.

reports showed that package managers have been abused by attackers to
distribute malware, posing significant security risks to developers and
end-users. For example, eslint-scope, a package with millions of weekly

understand the security gaps and the misplaced trust that make recent supply
chain attacks possible, we propose a comparative framework to qualitatively

languages. Based on qualitative assessment, we apply well-known program
analysis techniques such as metadata, static, and dynamic analysis to study
registry abuse. Our initial efforts found 339 new malicious packages that we
reported to the registries for removal. The package manager maintainers
confirmed 278 (82%) from the 339 reported packages where three of them had more

to help expedite the removal of these packages from infected victims. We
outline the challenges of tailoring program analysis tools to interpreted

This work reports an atomistically-validated, mesoscopic model for heptane
based on a many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) method. In this
model, each heptane molecule is coarse-grained in one mDPD bead and the mDPD
model parameters are calibrated with a rigorous approach using reference data,
including experimental measurements and/or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
Results show that this mDPD model accurately predicts the bulk pressure-density
relation of heptane and surface tension. Notice that our approach can be used
to calibrate the mDPD model for other hydrocarbons as well, though heptane is
chosen as a representative source fluid for its abundance in source rocks.
Further, our timing test indicates that the mDPD model is three orders of
magnitude faster than its MD counterpart for simulations of bulk heptane in
equivalent volumes. Overall, this work serves as a key prerequisite for the
development of accurate and efficient mesoscale models for the flow of
hydrocarbons confined in mesoporous rock formations.

However, one can easily attack such strategies by placing chosen frames at the

partner in PSR-BH binary systems, which provide the best laboratory for testing
the time delay predictions, we study here the RTD up to third PPN order in

generalization of the RTD formulas applicable to the experimentally viable
\textit{finite} distance lens scales, while\ terms higher than the zeroth order
are shown to contain the effect of $\xi$. We shall also relate RTD to the
observable image magnification factor determined by $\beta/\theta_{E}$, where
$\beta$ is the angular separation between the source and the observer and
$\theta_{E}$ is the ""Einstein angle"" determined by an ""effective"" non-aligned
static lens equivalent to the original aligned spinning lens. Numerical
estimates for two typical binary lens systems show $\mu$sec level delay at the
zeroth order consistent with predictions in the literature. However, the string
effect at higher orders is too tiny to be measurable even in the far future

cyclotron-maser instability. For Io (the most active moon) related DAMs, the
energetic electrons are sourced from Io volcanic activities, and quickly
trapped by neighboring Jovian magnetic field. To properly interpret the
physical processes behind DAMs, it is important to precisely locate the source
field lines from which DAMs are emitted. Following the work by Hess et al.
[2008, 2010], we develop a method to locate the source region as well as the
associated field lines for any given DAM emission recorded in a radio dynamic
spectrum by, e.g., Wind/WAVES or STEREO/WAVES. The field lines are calculated
by the state-of-art analytical model, called JRM09 [Connerney et al., 2018]. By
using this method, we may also derive the emission cone angle and the energy of
associated electrons. If multiple radio instruments at different perspectives
saw the same DAM event, the evolution of its source region and associated field
lines is able to be revealed. We apply the method to an Io-DAM event, and find
that the method is valid and reliable. Some physical processes behind the DAM

databases support the LIKE operator to allow searching with a particular
wildcard predicate (e.g., LIKE 'Sub%', which matches all strings starting with
'Sub'). Due to the large size of text data, executing such queries in the most
optimal way is quite critical for database performance. While building the most
efficient execution plan for a LIKE query, the query optimizer requires the
selectivity estimate for the flexible pattern-based query predicate. Recently,
SPH algorithm is proposed which employs a sequence pattern-based histogram
structure to estimate the selectivity of LIKE queries. A drawback of the SPH
approach is that it often overestimates the selectivity of queries. In order to
alleviate the overestimation problem, in this paper, we propose a novel
sequence pattern type, called positional sequence patterns. The proposed
patterns differentiate between sequence item pairs that appear next to each
other in all pattern occurrences from those that may have other items between
them. Besides, we employ redundant pattern elimination based on pattern
information content during histogram construction. Finally, we propose a
partitioning-based matching scheme during the selectivity estimation. The
experimental results on a real dataset from DBLP show that the proposed

the hard cores can occupy sites of the triangular lattice, and nearest-neighbor
repulsion following from overlapping shells is assumed. The capillary force is
represented by the second- or the fifth neighbor attraction in model I or II,
respectively. Ground states with fixed chemical potential $\mu$ or with fixed

isotherms, compressibility and specific heat are calculated by Monte Carlo

phases found in model I. These additional phases, however, are stable only at

ensemble, these 6 phases and interfaces between them appear in model II for
large intervals of c, and the number of possible patterns is much larger than

from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To
this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to
measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden
representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information
computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual
information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is
indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the
isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many
existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be
efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation
methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its
correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised
learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a
graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as
inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes
exceeds the performance of supervised ones.

provides reliable responses leading to high accuracy and information
throughput. But achieving high accuracy typically requires a relatively long
time window of one second or more. Various methods were proposed to improve
sub-second response accuracy through subject-specific training and calibration.
Substantial performance improvements were achieved with tedious calibration and
subject-specific training; resulting in the user's discomfort. So, we propose a
training-free method by combining spatial-filtering and temporal alignment
(CSTA) to recognize SSVEP responses in sub-second response time. CSTA exploits
linear correlation and non-linear similarity between steady-state responses and
stimulus templates with complementary fusion to achieve desirable performance
improvements. We evaluated the performance of CSTA in terms of accuracy and
Information Transfer Rate (ITR) in comparison with both training-based and
training-free methods using two SSVEP data-sets. We observed that CSTA achieves
the maximum mean accuracy of 97.43$\pm$2.26 % and 85.71$\pm$13.41 % with
four-class and forty-class SSVEP data-sets respectively in sub-second response
time in offline analysis. CSTA yields significantly higher mean performance
(p<0.001) than the training-free method on both data-sets. Compared with
training-based methods, CSTA shows 29.33$\pm$19.65 % higher mean accuracy with
statistically significant differences in time window less than 0.5 s. In longer
time windows, CSTA exhibits either better or comparable performance though not
statistically significantly better than training-based methods. We show that
the proposed method brings advantages of subject-independent SSVEP
classification without requiring training while enabling high target
recognition performance in sub-second response time.

  Space","22 pages, 7 tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The traditional concept of space in geography is based on the notion of
distance. Where there is a spatial analysis, there is a distance measurement.
However, the precondition for effective distance-based space is that the
geographical systems have characteristic scales. For a scale-free geographical
system, the spatial structure cannot be validly described with pure distance,
and thus the distance-based space is ineffective for geographical modelling. In
the real geographical world, scale-free patterns and processes are everywhere.
We need new notion of geographical space. Using the ideas from fractals and
scaling relations, I propose a dimension-based concept of space for scale-free
geographical analysis. If a geographical phenomenon bears characteristic
scales, we can model it using distance measurement; if a geographical
phenomenon has no characteristic scale, we will describe it using fractal
dimension, which is based on the scaling relations between distance variable
and the corresponding measurements. In short, geographical space fall into two
types: scaleful space and scale-free space. This study shows a new way of
spatial modeling and quantitative analyses for the geographical systems without
characteristic scale.

Current approaches based on the tracking by detection paradigm either require
some sort of domain knowledge or supervision to associate data correctly into

approach based on visual features and minimum cost lifted multicuts. Our method
is based on straight-forward spatio-temporal cues that can be extracted from
neighboring frames in an image sequences without superivison. Clustering based
on these cues enables us to learn the required appearance invariances for the
tracking task at hand and train an autoencoder to generate suitable latent
representation. Thus, the resulting latent representations can serve as robust
appearance cues for tracking even over large temporal distances where no
reliable spatio-temporal features could be extracted. We show that, despite
being trained without using the provided annotations, our model provides
competitive results on the challenging MOT Benchmark for pedestrian tracking.

identified in Helioseimsic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI) maps of flows near the solar surface. So far this has not been
done with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) ground-based
observations, which have different noise properties.
  Aims: We utilize 17 years of GONG++ data, to identify and characterize solar
Rossby waves using ring-diagram helioseismology. We compare directly with HMI
ring-diagram analysis.
  Methods: Maps of the radial vorticity are obtained for flows within the top 2
Mm of the surface for 17 years of GONG++. The data is corrected for systematic
effects including the annual periodicity related to the $B_0$ angle. We then
compute the Fourier components of the radial vorticity of the flows in the
co-rotating frame. We perform the same analysis on the HMI data that overlap in
time.
  Results: We find that the solar Rossby waves have measurable amplitudes in
the GONG++ sectoral power spectra for azimuthal orders between $m=3$ and
$m=15$. The measured mode characteristics (frequencies, lifetimes and
amplitudes) from GONG++ are consistent with the HMI measurements in the overlap
period from 2010 to 2018 for $m\le9$. For higher-$m$ modes the amplitudes and
frequencies agree within two sigmas. The signal-to-noise ratio of modes in
GONG++ power spectra is comparable to HMI for $8\le m\le11$, but is lower by a
factor of two for other modes.
  Conclusions: The GONG++ data provide a long and uniform data set to study
solar global-scale Rossby waves from 2001.

lobe and drags the heavier species along with it. Assuming solar abundances, OI
and CII particles accelerated by tidal forces to velocities up to 50 km/s
should produce the absorption due to Doppler resonance mechanism at the level
of 6-10%, consistent with the observations. Since the 2D geometry does not take
into account the Coriolis force in the planet reference frame, the question
remained to which extent the spiraling of the escaping planetary material and
its actually achieved velocity may influence the conclusions made on the basis
of 2D modeling. In the present paper we apply for the first time in the study
of HD209458b a global 3D hydrodynamic multi-fluid model that self-consistently
describes the formation and expansion of the escaping planetary wind, affected

The modeling results confirm our previous findings that the velocity and
density of the planetary flow are sufficiently high to produce the absorption
in HI, OI, and CII resonant lines at the level close to the in-transit observed

the physics behind the experimental observation. Like other models, the outcome
of the AMPT model depends on the initial parameters. Therefore, one needs to
choose suitable initial parameters before using the model. Lund string
fragmentation function has been used to create quark-antiquarks pairs in the
AMPT model. The Lund string fragmentation parameters determine the yields and
transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra of particles produced in nucleus-nucleus
collisions. The values of Lund string fragmentation parameters were determined
by fitting the charged particle yield and $p_{T}$ spectra measured in the
experiment. In this paper, we have shown the yield of strange quarks carrying
hadrons, e.g. $\phi$ mesons, are more sensitive to Lund string fragmentation
parameters compared to non-strange pions. Using $\phi$ meson spectra measured
at RHIC, we have obtained new sets of Lund parameters for Au+Au collisions at

$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 11.5 GeV, the underlying mechanism for particle
production is different compared to top RHIC energies. We have also predicted

(equivalently, for all) finite $2$-dimensional CW-complexes $X$ and $Y$, with
$\pi_1(X) \cong G$ and $\pi_1(Y) \cong H$, so that their universal covers

this relation is coarser than the quasi-isometry relation. We point out that
finitely presented groups which are $1$-ended and semistable at infinity are
classified, up to proper $2$-equivalence, by their fundamental pro-group, and
we study the behaviour of this relation with respect to some of the main
constructions in combinatorial group theory. A (finer) similar equivalence
relation may also be considered for groups of type $F_n, n \geq 3$, which
captures more of the large-scale topology of the group. Finally, we pay special
attention to the class of those groups $G$ which admit a finite $2$-dimensional
CW-complex $X$ with $\pi_1(X) \cong G$ and whose universal cover
$\widetilde{X}$ has the proper homotopy type of a $3$-manifold. We show that if

${\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}$ or ${\mathbb F}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}$ (here,

with a quantum gas at finite temperature. By working in the canonical ensemble
of a single impurity, we show that the impurity spectral response is directly
connected to the finite-temperature equation of state (free energy) of the
impurity. We consider two different response protocols: ""injection"", where the
impurity is introduced into the medium from an initially non-interacting state;
and ""ejection"", where the impurity is ejected from an initially interacting
state with the medium. We show that there is a simple mapping between injection
and ejection spectra, which is connected to the detailed balance condition in
thermal equilibrium. To illustrate the power of our approach, we specialize to
the case of the Fermi polaron, corresponding to an impurity atom that is
immersed in a non-interacting Fermi gas. For a mobile impurity with a mass
equal to the fermion mass, we employ a finite-temperature variational approach
to obtain the impurity spectral response. We find a striking non-monotonic
dependence on temperature in the impurity free energy, the contact, and the
radio-frequency spectra. For the case of an infinitely heavy Fermi polaron, we
derive exact results for the finite-temperature free energy, thus generalizing
Fumi's theorem to arbitrary temperature. We also determine the exact dynamics
of the contact after a quench of the impurity-fermion interactions. Finally, we
show that the injection and ejection spectra obtained from the variational
approach compare well with the exact spectra, thus demonstrating the accuracy
of our approximate method.

state bleaching and charge-induced trion absorption features, as well as
exciton quenching are observed depending on applied voltage and modulation
frequency. Through correlation of the modulated mobile carrier density and the
optical response of the nanotubes, we find that charge transport in mixed SWCNT
networks depends strongly on the diameter and thus bandgap of the individual
species. Mobile charges are preferentially transported by small bandgap SWCNTs
especially at low gate voltages, whereas large bandgap species only start to
participate at higher carrier concentrations. Our results demonstrate the
excellent suitability of modulation spectroscopy to investigate charge
transport in nanotube network transistors and highlight the importance of SWCNT
network composition for their performance.

bit of information that can be exchanged upon contact according to the rules of
AND and OR logic gates in a circuit. Motile AND particles become non-motile
upon contact with a non-motile particle. Conversely, motile OR particles remain
motile upon collision with their non-motile counterparts. AND particles that
have become non-motile additionally ""reawaken"", i.e., recover their motility,
at a fixed rate $\mu$, as in the SIS (Susceptible, Infected, Susceptible) model
of epidemic spreading, where an infected agent can become healthy again, but
keeps no memory of the recent infection, hence it is susceptible to a renewed
infection. For $\mu=0$, both AND and OR particles relax irreversibly to
absorbing states of all non-motile or all motile particles, respectively. The
relaxation kinetics is, however, faster for OR particles that remain active
throughout the process. At finite $\mu$, the AND dynamics is controlled by the
interplay between reawakening and collision rates. The system evolves to a
state of all motile particles (an absorbing state in the language of absorbing
phase transitions) for $\mu>\mu_c$ and to a mixed state with coexisting motile
and non-motile particles (an active state in the language of absorbing phase
transitions) for $\mu<\mu_c$. The final state exhibits a rich structure
controlled by motility-induced aggregation. Our work can be relevant to
biochemical signaling in motile bacteria, the spreading of epidemics and of

perform a discovery task based on example solutions, or \emph{human

scanning, where a demonstration involves an expert adaptively searching for a
satisfactory view of internal organs, vessels or tissue and potential anomalies
while maintaining optimal contact between the probe and surface tissue. Such
problems are often solved by inferring notional \emph{rewards} that, when
optimised for, result in a plan that mimics demonstrations. A pivotal
assumption, that plans with higher reward should be exponentially more likely,
leads to the de facto approach for reward inference in robotics. While this
approach of maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning leads to a general
and elegant formulation, it struggles to cope with frequently encountered
sub-optimal demonstrations. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach
to cope with the class of problems where sub-optimal demonstrations occur
frequently. We hypothesise that, in tasks which require discovery, successive
states of any demonstration are progressively more likely to be associated with
a higher reward. We formalise this \emph{temporal ranking} approach and show
that it improves upon maximum-entropy approaches to perform reward inference
for autonomous ultrasound scanning, a novel application of learning from

of electron density in the plasmasphere region of the magnetosphere. Therefore
the identification and characterisation of whistlers are important tasks to
monitor the plasmasphere in real-time and to build large databases of events to
be used for statistical studies. The current state of the art in detecting

learning-based model capable of automatically detecting whistlers in the data
provided by the VLF receivers. The approach is to use a combination of image
classification and localisation on the spectrogram data generated by the VLF
receivers to identify and localise each whistler. The data at hand has around
2300 events identified by AWD at SANAE and Marion and will be used as training,

output through summation, akin to a linear regression function, however, with
non-linear components and unity weights. Although the RTM has solved non-linear
regression problems with competitive accuracy, the resolution of the output is
proportional to the number of clauses employed. This means that computation
cost increases with resolution. To reduce this problem, we here introduce
integer weighted RTM clauses. Our integer weighted clause is a compact
representation of multiple clauses that capture the same sub-pattern-N
repeating clauses are turned into one, with an integer weight N. This reduces
computation cost N times, and increases interpretability through a sparser
representation. We further introduce a novel learning scheme that allows us to
simultaneously learn both the clauses and their weights, taking advantage of
so-called stochastic searching on the line. We evaluate the potential of the
integer weighted RTM empirically using six artificial datasets. The results
show that the integer weighted RTM is able to acquire on par or better accuracy

recently, since many machine learning algorithms were found vulnerable to
malicious attacks. This paper studies adversarial attacks to scale-free
networks to test their robustness in terms of statistical measures. In addition
to the well-known random link rewiring (RLR) attack, two heuristic attacks are
formulated and simulated: degree-addition-based link rewiring (DALR) and
degree-interval-based link rewiring (DILR). These three strategies are applied
to attack a number of strong scale-free networks of various sizes generated
from the Barab\'asi-Albert model. It is found that both DALR and DILR are more
effective than RLR, in the sense that rewiring a smaller number of links can
succeed in the same attack. However, DILR is as concealed as RLR in the sense
that they both are constructed by introducing a relatively small number of
changes on several typical structural properties such as average shortest
path-length, average clustering coefficient, and average diagonal distance. The

clues about the physical properties of cometary and interplanetary dust
particles. Identifying these properties will lead to a better understanding of
the formation and evolution of the Solar System. Aims: We present a numerical
solution for the radiative and conductive heat transport in a random
particulate medium enclosed by an arbitrarily shaped surface. The method will
be applied to study thermal properties of cometary dust particles. Methods: The
recently introduced incoherent Monte Carlo radiative transfer method developed
for scattering, absorption, and propagation of electromagnetic waves in dense
discrete random media is extended for radiative heat transfer and thermal
emission. The solution is coupled with the conductive Fourier transport
equation that is solved with the finite-element method. Results: The proposed
method allows the synoptic analysis of light scattering and thermal emission by
large cometary dust particles consisting of submicrometer-sized grains. In
particular, we show that these particles can sustain significant temperature
gradients resulting in the superheating factor phase function observed for the
coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

expression of the surface, which can be simply defined by a set of scattered
nodes. It does not require expressions for the surface normal vectors and for
the curvature of the surface neither, which are approximated using formulas
derived in the paper. An additional advantage is that it is a local method and,
hence, the matrix that approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator is sparse,
which translates into good scalability properties. The convergence, accuracy
and other computational characteristics of the method are studied numerically.
The performance is shown by solving two reaction-diffusion partial differential
equations on surfaces; the Turing model for pattern formation, and the
Schaeffer's model for electrical cardiac tissue behavior.

been mainly focused on Age of Information (AoI) optimizations. In this paper, a
status-aware predictive wireless interface design, networking and
implementation are presented which aim to minimize the status recovery error of
a wireless networked system by leveraging online status model predictions. Two
critical issues of predictive status update are addressed: practicality and
usefulness. Link-level experiments on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) testbed
are conducted and test results show that the proposed design can significantly
reduce the number of wireless transmissions while maintaining a low status
recovery error. A Status-aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning neTworking

transmit decisions of devices in an ad hoc network based on their individual
statuses. System-level simulations of a multi dense platooning scenario are
carried out on a road traffic simulator. Results show that the proposed schemes
can greatly improve the platooning control performance in terms of the minimum
safe distance between successive vehicles, in comparison with the AoI-optimized
status-unaware and communication latency-optimized schemes---this demonstrates
the usefulness of our proposed status update schemes in a real-world

minimax optimization to foil gradient-based adversarial attacks. Our minimax
classifier is the discriminator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) that
plays a minimax game with the GAN generator. In addition, our GAN generator
projects all points onto a manifold that is different from the original
manifold since the original manifold might be the cause of adversarial attacks.

challenge because inhomogeneous media scatter both incoming photons for
focusing and outgoing photons for observation. Various approaches, utilizing
non-linear fluorescence or ultrasound, have been reported to address this
difficulty. However, implementation of these methods is complicated and highly
expensive, as ultrafast laser systems or photo-acoustic equipment must be
employed. Here, we demonstrate a wavefront shaping technique to achieve
non-invasive focusing (NiF) inside scattering media using only a linear
fluorescent signal. Contrast and mean of incoherent speckles, produced by the
linear fluorescence, are utilized as feedback signals to optimize the input
wavefront. While increasing speckle contrast makes the focus tighter, and
increasing the speckle mean enhances the intensity, fine-tuning the
contribution of these two factors in our two-step optimization is essential. An
optimal wavefront is found to achieve simultaneously both a micrometer focal
spot size (down to 20 um diameter) and high intensity (more than a 100-fold
enhancement) inside the scattering media. Our method promises a new route in
life science towards focusing, imaging or manipulating deep into biological

energy flux flows from large to small length scales, composing a cascade of
energy. A universal characteristic of turbulent flows is the existence of a
range of scales where the energy flux is scale-invariant: this interval of
scales is often referred to as inertial region. This property is fundamental
as, for instance, in turbulence of classical fluids it characterizes the
behavior of statistical features such as spectra and structure functions. Here
we show that also in decaying quantum turbulence generated in trapped
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), intervals of momentum space where the energy
flux is constant can be identified. Indeed, we present a procedure to measure
the energy flux using both the energy spectrum and the continuity equation. A
range of scales where the flux is constant is then determined employing two
distinct protocols and in the same range, the momentum distribution measured is
consistent with previous work. The successful identification of a region with
constant flux in turbulent BECs is a manifestation of the universal character
of turbulence in these quantum systems. These measurements pave the way for
studies of energy conservation and dissipation in trapped atomic superfluids,
and also analogies with the related processes that take place in ordinary

experiments have shown that partition function zeros are not just a theoretical
concept. They can also be determined experimentally by measuring fluctuations
of thermodynamic observables in systems of finite size. Motivated by this
progress, we investigate here the partition function zeros for the Curie-Weiss
model of spontaneous magnetization using our recently established cumulant
method. Specifically, we extract the leading Fisher and Lee-Yang zeros of the
Curie-Weiss model from the fluctuations of the energy and the magnetization in
systems of finite size. We develop a finite-size scaling analysis of the
partition function zeros, which is valid for mean-field models, and which
allows us to extract both the critical values of the control parameters and the
critical exponents, even for small systems that are away from criticality. We
also show that the Lee-Yang zeros carry important information about the rare
magnetic fluctuations as they allow us to predict many essential features of
the large-deviation statistics of the magnetization. This finding may
constitute a profound connection between Lee-Yang theory and large-deviation

two O7.5 III-II(f) stars, is the most emblematic eclipsing O-star binary in the
very young and rich open cluster NGC6231. Its properties render the system an
interesting target for studying tidally induced apsidal motion. Measuring the
rate of apsidal motion in such a binary system gives insight into the internal
structure and evolutionary state of the stars composing it. A large set of
optical spectra was used to reconstruct the spectra of the individual binary
components and establish their radial velocities using a disentangling code.
Radial velocities measured over seven decades were used to establish the rate
of apsidal motion. We furthermore analysed the reconstructed spectra with the
CMFGEN model atmosphere code to determine stellar and wind properties of the
system. Optical photometry was analysed with the Nightfall binary star code. A
complete photometric and radial velocity model was constructed in PHOEBE 2 to
determine robust uncertainties. We find a rate of apsidal motion of
$(1.843^{+0.064}_{-0.083})\deg$ yr$^{-1}$. The photometric data indicate an
orbital inclination of $(67.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1})\deg$ and Roche-lobe filling
factors of both stars of about 0.86. Absolute masses of
$29.5^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$M$_\odot$ and mean stellar radii of
$15.07^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$R$_\odot$ are derived for both stars. We infer an
observational value for the internal structure constant of both stars of
$0.0010\pm0.0001$. Our in-depth analysis of the massive binary HD152248 and the
redetermination of its fundamental parameters can serve as a basis for the
construction of stellar evolution models to determine theoretical rates of
apsidal motion to be compared with the observational one. In addition, the
system hosts two twin stars, which offers a unique opportunity to obtain direct
insight into the internal structure of the stars.

Observations suggest the presence of nGauss primordial magnetic fields at the

signature of the stochastic primordial magnetic fields up to a few nGauss.
Specifically, the presence of nGauss primordial magnetic fields changes the BB
power spectrum at all scales. At large scales, the tensor modes contribute to
the B-mode spectrum, while non-vanishing vector modes contribute at small
scales. We show that the B-mode of CMB carry a distinct signature of the
primordial magnetic fields. To validate our prediction, we use BICEP2 and
POLARBEAR data and find that B-mode observations from the experiments are
consistent with non-zero primordial fields. We also use the BICEP2 observations

the B-mode polarization of the CMB with primordial magnetic fields and

unsupervised image generation. Several works have extended GANs to image
inpainting by conditioning the generation with parts of the image to be
reconstructed. Despite their success, these methods have limitations in
settings where only a small subset of the image pixels is known beforehand. In
this paper we investigate the effectiveness of conditioning GANs when very few
pixel values are provided. We propose a modelling framework which results in
adding an explicit cost term to the GAN objective function to enforce
pixel-wise conditioning. We investigate the influence of this regularization
term on the quality of the generated images and the fulfillment of the given
pixel constraints. Using the recent PacGAN technique, we ensure that we keep
diversity in the generated samples. Conducted experiments on FashionMNIST show
that the regularization term effectively controls the trade-off between quality
of the generated images and the conditioning. Experimental evaluation on the
CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets evidences that our method achieves accurate
results both visually and quantitatively in term of Fr\'echet Inception
Distance, while still enforcing the pixel conditioning. We also evaluate our
method on a texture image generation task using fully-convolutional networks.

anisotropic stress of the PMFs can act as a source of the super-horizon

method that takes advantage of the properties of PCE, the sparsity-of-effects
principle, and powerful sparse regression solvers to approximate computer
models with many input parameters, relying on only few model evaluations.
Within the last decade, a large number of algorithms for the computation of
sparse PCE have been published in the applied math and engineering literature.
We present an extensive review of the existing methods and develop a framework
for classifying the algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct a unique benchmark on a
selection of methods to identify which approaches work best in practical
applications. Comparing their accuracy on several benchmark models of varying
dimensionality and complexity, we find that the choice of sparse regression
solver and sampling scheme for the computation of a sparse PCE surrogate can
make a significant difference, of up to several orders of magnitude in the
resulting mean-squared error. Different methods seem to be superior in
different regimes of model dimensionality and experimental design size.

discontinuity at the edge of its cool core. It was discovered in the Chandra
X-ray image by Werner and collaborators, who considered a possibility of it
being a boundary of an AGN-inflated bubble located outside the core, but
discounted this possibility because it required much too powerful an AGN
outburst. Using low-frequency (72-240 MHz) radio data from MWA GLEAM and GMRT,
we found that the X-ray structure is, in fact, a giant cavity in the X-ray gas
filled with diffuse radio emission with an extraordinarily steep radio
spectrum. It thus appears to be a very aged fossil of the most powerful AGN
outburst seen in any galaxy cluster ($pV\sim 5\times 10^{61}$ erg for this
cavity). There is no apparent diametrically opposite counterpart either in
X-ray or in the radio. It may have aged out of the observable radio band
because of the cluster asymmetry. At present, the central AGN exhibits only a
weak radio source, so it should have been much more powerful in the past to
have produced such a bubble. The AGN is currently starved of accreting cool gas
because the gas density peak is displaced by core sloshing. The sloshing itself
could have been set off by this extraordinary explosion if it had occurred in
an asymmetric gas core. This dinosaur may be an early example of a new class of
sources to be uncovered by low-frequency surveys of galaxy clusters.

science have emancipated themselves from the sciences a long time ago, they
often have appeared, in the public eye, to question rather than to seek to
bolster the authority of the sciences. How has this situation come about, and
what does it tell us about the world we live in today? What insight is sought

historians--Eduard Dijksterhuis, Thomas Kuhn and Martin Klein--in their
Atlantic crossings. Their answers to debates on the constitution of the early
modern scientific revolution or the novelty of the work of Max Planck will

that were obtained in different environments via a two-stream deep network. By
internally augmenting the target image, the network considers the two-stream
with the three input images and reflects the additional augmented pair in the
training. As a result, the training process of the deep network is regularized
and the network becomes robust for the variance of aerial images. Furthermore,
we introduce an ensemble method that is based on the bidirectional network,
which is motivated by the isomorphic nature of the geometric transformation. We
obtain two global transformation parameters without any additional network or
parameters, which alleviate asymmetric matching results and enable significant
improvement in performance by fusing two outcomes. For the experiment, we adopt
aerial images from Google Earth and the International Society for
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). To quantitatively assess our result,
we apply the probability of correct keypoints (PCK) metric, which measures the
degree of matching. The qualitative and quantitative results show the sizable
gap of performance compared to the conventional methods for matching the aerial
images. All code and our trained model, as well as the dataset are available

heating assembly at their intersection. The transparent part allows for optical
OH* chemiluminescence measurements serving as a basis for numerical validation.
For a comprehensive numerical evaluation the effect of heat loss on different
hydrogen/air chemical reaction mechanisms is reviewed in a preparatory
one-dimensional flame study. The subsequent numerical investigation focuses on
the application of the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) as a turbulence-chemistry
interaction model in the realm of wall anchoring turbulent flames. All
simulations are based on the Reynolds time-averaged formulation of the
Navier-Stokes equations and feature axisymmetric domains. The influence of
different two-equation turbulence models and EDC modeling constants are
discussed. Since wall heat transfer is responsible for ignition as well as
quenching of the flame front, a special focus is put on boundary layer
resolving near-wall treatment. A qualitative comparison between simulations and
experiment is performed for multiple operating conditions. These are selected
to display the influence of equivalence ratio, bulk Reynolds number and unburnt
mixture temperature. While the choice of RANS-based turbulence model has a
distinguishable impact, EDC modeling coefficients exhibit a more significant
influence on flame shape and length. It is only surpassed by the impact of
correct diffusion treatment on reacting lean hydrogen/air mixtures. To depict
this behavior as accurately as possible, full multicomponent diffusion
treatment using the Maxwell-Stefan equation is applied.

optically/thermally stimulated luminescence (OSL or TL) or long persistent

make a survey of 10 cores to estimate their lifetime scales and depletion
profiles in detail. After L183, in Serpens, we present the second cloud of the
series, L1512 in Auriga. To constrain the lifetime scale, we perform chemical
modeling of the deuteration profiles across L1512 based on dust extinction
measurements from near-infrared observations and non-local thermal equilibrium
radiative transfer with multiple line observations of N2H+, N2D+, DCO+, C18O,
and 13CO, plus H2D+ (1$_{10}$--1$_{11}$). We find a peak density of
1.1$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and a central temperature of 7.5$\pm$1 K, which are
respectively higher and lower compared with previous dust emission studies. The
depletion factors of N2H+ and N2D+ are 27$^{+17}_{-13}$ and 4$^{+2}_{-1}$ in
L1512, intermediate between the two other more advanced and denser starless
core cases, L183 and L1544. These factors also indicate a similar freeze-out of
N2 in L1512, compared to the two others despite a peak density one to two
orders of magnitude lower. Retrieving CO and N2 abundance profiles with the
chemical model, we find that CO has a depletion factor of $\sim$430-870 and the
N2 profile is similar to that of CO unlike towards L183. Therefore, L1512 has
probably been living long enough so that N2 chemistry has reached steady state.
N2H+ modeling remains compulsory to assess the precise physical conditions in
the center of cold starless cores, rather than dust emission. L1512 is
presumably older than 1.4 Myr. Therefore, the dominating core formation
mechanism should be ambipolar diffusion for this source.

drug carriers and controlled drug delivery. Understanding the drug release
kinetics and corresponding transport mechanisms of nanoparticles (NPs) in a
thermoresponsive hydrogel network is the key to the successful design of a
smart drug delivery system. We construct a mesoscopic model of rigid NPs
entrapped in a hydrogel network in an aqueous solution, where the hydrogel
network is formed by cross-linked semiflexible polymers of PNIPAM. By varying
the environmental temperature crossing the lower critical solution temperature
of PNIPAM we can significantly change the hydrogel network characteristics. We
systematically investigate how the matrix porosity and the nanoparticle size
affect the NPs' transport kinetics at different temperatures. Quantitative
results on the mean-squared displacement and the van Hove displacement
distributions of NPs show that all NPs entrapped in the smart hydrogels undergo
subdiffusion at both low and high temperatures. For a coil state, the
subdiffusive exponent and the diffusion coefficient of NPs increase due to the
increased kinetic energy and the decreased confinement on NPs, while the
transport of NPs in the hydrogels can be also enhanced by decreasing the matrix
porosity and NPs' size. However, when the solution temperature is increased
above the critical temperature, the hydrogel network collapses following the
coil-to-globule transition, with the NPs tightly trapped in some local regions
inside the hydrogels. Consequently, the NP diffusion coefficient can be reduced
by two orders of magnitude, or the diffusion processes can even be completely
stopped. These findings provide new insights for designing controlled drug
release from stimuli-responsive hydrogels, including autonomously switch on/off
drug release to respond to the changes of the local environment.

alkylthiols, namely CH$_3$, NH$_2$ or COOH is studied in solvents of varying
degrees of repulsion-dispersion and electrostatic interactions ranging from
strongly polar SPC/E water to modified hybrid water models, where the
Lennard-Jones contribution to the potential energy is enhanced relative to
SPC/E to completely non-polar, decane. The effects due to solvent
reorganization around the nanoparticle as a function of the ligand and solvent
chemistry are monitored using the nanoparticle-solvent pair correlation
functions and tetrahedral order parameter. The solvent penetration inside the
ligand shell is maximum for decane, indicating better solute-solvent
interaction in decane compared to other solvents. The COOH end group
functionalized nanoparticle breaks the tetrahedral structure of water molecules
more as compared to other nanoparticles used in this study. The ligand
reorganization and its effect on solvation are monitored using radial density
profiles (RDPs), radius of gyration ($R_g$) and ligand asymmetry parameter
($\langle \Delta \rangle$). RDP and $R_g$ values show significant stretching of
ligands in decane than in model waters, which is also consistent with $\langle
\Delta \rangle$. The ligand shell anisotropy for all nanoparticles is maximum
in SPC/E water and minimum in decane. The isotropic potential of mean force
($V_{PMF}(r)$) between two identical end group functionalized nanoparticles
have been calculated in vacuum, SPC/E water and H3.00 modified hybrid water,
which consistently shows attractive well depth. Distance-dependent fluctuation
driven anisotropy has also been examined. The implications for self-assembly of
passivated gold nanoparticles from aqueous dispersions as well as the

distribution describes the measured parallaxes and proper motions better than a
single Maxwellian with probability of 99.3 and 95.0 per cent respectively. The
bimodal Maxwellian distribution has three parameters: fraction of low-velocity
pulsars and distribution parameters $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ for low and
high-velocity modes. For a complete sample, these parameters are as follows:
$42_{-15}^{+17}$ per cent, $\sigma_1=128_{-18}^{+22}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_2
= 298\pm 28$ km s$^{-1}$. For younger pulsars, which are assumed to represent
the natal kick, these parameters are as follows: $20_{-10}^{+11}$ per cent,
$\sigma_1=56_{-15}^{+25}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_2=336\pm 45$ km s$^{-1}$. In
the young population, $5\pm 3$ per cent of pulsars has velocities less than 60
km s$^{-1}$. We perform multiple Monte Carlo tests for the method taking into

result, cloud computing was introduced to address the need for datacentres for

supporting and managing crowdsensing and real-time data increased, and cloud
servers could no longer keep up with the large volumes of incoming data. This
demand brought rise to fog computing. It became an extension to the cloud and
allowed resources to be allocated around the network effectively. Its
integration to IoT reduced the strain towards the cloud servers. However,
issues in high power consumption at the end device and data management
constraints surfaced. This paper proposes two approaches to alleviate these

applications. We created an IoT-based sensing framework that used an urban

resource reallocation, we created a network configuration. We tested this
configuration against IoT frameworks that use the default fog and cloud setups.
The results improved the framework's end device power consumption and server

computer experiments, which are usually used to study deterministic functions,
for example, a solution to a given system of partial differential equations.
This work investigates applying Gaussian process modeling to a deterministic
function from prediction and uncertainty quantification perspectives, where the
Gaussian process model is misspecified. Specifically, we consider the case
where the underlying function is fixed and from a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space generated by some kernel function, and the same kernel function is used
in the Gaussian process modeling as the correlation function for prediction and
uncertainty quantification. While upper bounds and the optimal convergence rate
of prediction in the Gaussian process modeling have been extensively studied in
the literature, a comprehensive exploration of convergence rates and
theoretical study of uncertainty quantification is lacking. We prove that, if
one uses maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the variance in Gaussian
process modeling, under different choices of the regularization parameter
value, the predictor is not optimal and/or the confidence interval is not
reliable. In particular, lower bounds of the prediction error under different
choices of the regularization parameter value are obtained. The results
indicate that, if one directly applies Gaussian process modeling to a fixed
function, the reliability of the confidence interval and the optimality of the
predictor cannot be achieved at the same time.

problem in various applications, such as autonomous driving and socially aware
robots. Such forecasting is challenging due to human-human and human-object
interactions and future uncertainties caused by human randomness. Generative
model-based methods handle future uncertainties by sampling a latent variable.
However, few studies explored the generation of the latent variable. In this
work, we propose the Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo Oracle (TPPO), which is a
generative model-based trajectory predictor. The first pseudo oracle is
pedestrians' moving directions, and the second one is the latent variable
estimated from ground truth trajectories. A social attention module is used to
aggregate neighbors' interactions based on the correlation between pedestrians'
moving directions and future trajectories. This correlation is inspired by the
fact that pedestrians' future trajectories are often influenced by pedestrians
in front. A latent variable predictor is proposed to estimate latent variable
distributions from observed and ground-truth trajectories. Moreover, the gap
between these two distributions is minimized during training. Therefore, the
latent variable predictor can estimate the latent variable from observed
trajectories to approximate that estimated from ground-truth trajectories. We
compare the performance of TPPO with related methods on several public
datasets. Results demonstrate that TPPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods
with low average and final displacement errors. The ablation study shows that
the prediction performance will not dramatically decrease as sampling times
decline during tests.

worked at the time. Interval orders play an important role in many areas of
pure and applied mathematics, graph theory, computer science and engineering.
Special cases of interval order are the semiorder and linear order. All of
these notions are especially important in the study of linear-interval and
linear-semiorder dimension of a binary relation. This kind of dimension, which
we call {\it hybric order dimension}, gives a common generalization of linear
order and interval order (semiorder) dimension and is arguably the most
important measure of ordered set complexity. In this paper, we give three main
results of the theory of hybric order dimension. More precicely, we obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions for a binary relation to have an interval
order (resp. linear-interval order, linear-simiorder) extension as well as a
realizer of interval orders (resp. linear-interval orders, linear-simiorders).
We also obtain a characterization of the interval order (resp. linear-interval
order, linear-simiorder) dimension. Since the hybric order dimension of a
binary relation is less than its (linear) order dimension, these results will
be able to improve known results in graph theory and computer science by
finding more efficient algorithms.

(FM)-Defense to detect and purify adversarial examples in an interpretable and
efficient manner. The intuition is that the classification result of a normal
image is generally resistant to non-significant intrinsic feature changes,
e.g., varying thickness of handwritten digits. In contrast, adversarial
examples are sensitive to such changes since the perturbation lacks
transferability. To enable manipulation of features, a combo-variational
autoencoder is applied to learn disentangled latent codes that reveal semantic
features. The resistance to classification change over the morphs, derived by
varying and reconstructing latent codes, is used to detect suspicious inputs.
Further, combo-VAE is enhanced to purify the adversarial examples with good
quality by considering both class-shared and class-unique features. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of detection and the quality of
purified instance. Our experiments on three datasets show that FM-Defense can
detect nearly $100\%$ of adversarial examples produced by different
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. It achieves more than $99\%$ overall
purification accuracy on the suspicious instances that close the manifold of

explain the transition of highly energetic neutrinos propagating in matter to
tachyonic states. In this work, we determine the possible mechanisms that lead
neutrinos into a superluminal realm based on the assumption that
ultrarelativistic neutrinos travelling in matter lose part of their energy with
the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation. The obtained photons, in turn, can
create neutrino antineutrino pairs, one or both of which can be superluminal.
We also prove that pair creation may occur with neutrino flavour oscillation
provided that only one of them is a space-like particle. This suggests that
mass oscillation and superluminal behaviour could be related phenomena.
Finally, using the generalised Lorentz transformations, we formulate the
Lagrangian of the kinematically allowed scattering processes. The structure of
this Lagrangian is consistent with the formalism of the Standard Model. Based
on this Lagrangian, at least one of the particles forming the pair must always
be subluminal. The possibility that the pair creation process is mediated by a

neural network with data augmentation is proposed. In order to study the highly
nonlinear relationship between key design variables and centrifugal pump
external characteristic values (head and power), the neural network model (NN)
is built in comparison with the quadratic response surface model (RSF), the
radial basis Gaussian response surface model (RBF), and the Kriging model
(KRG). The numerical model validation experiment of another type of single
stage centrifugal pump showed that numerical model based on CFD is quite
accurate and fair. All of prediction models are trained by 60 samples under the
different combination of three key variables in design range respectively. The
accuracy of the head and power based on the four predictions models are
analyzed comparing with the CFD simulation values. The results show that the
neural network model has better performance in all external characteristic
values comparing with other three surrogate models. Finally, a neural network
model based on data augmentation (NNDA) is proposed for the reason that
simulation cost is too high and data is scarce in mechanical simulation field
especially in CFD problems. The model with data augmentation can triple the
data by interpolation at each sample point of different attributes. It shows
that the performance of neural network model with data augmentation is better
than former neural network model. Therefore, the prediction ability of NN is
enhanced without more simulation costs. With data augmentation it can be a
better prediction model used in solving the optimization problems of multistage
pump for next optimization and generalized to finite element analysis
optimization problems in future.

two-dimensional implicit interfaces in the level-set method. Our approach is
based on fitting feed-forward neural networks to synthetic data sets
constructed from circular interfaces immersed in uniform grids of various
resolutions. These multilayer perceptrons process the level-set values from
mesh points next to the free boundary and output the dimensionless curvature at
their closest locations on the interface. Accuracy analyses involving irregular
interfaces, in both uniform and adaptive grids, show that our models are
competitive with traditional numerical schemes in the $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. In
particular, our neural networks approximate curvature with comparable precision
in coarse resolutions, when the interface features steep curvature regions, and
when the number of iterations to reinitialize the level-set function is small.
Although the conventional numerical approach is more robust than our framework,
our results have unveiled the potential of machine learning for dealing with
computational tasks where the level-set method is known to experience
difficulties. We also establish that an application-dependent map of local
resolutions to neural models can be devised to estimate mean curvature more
effectively than a universal neural network.

often difficult to computationally model complicated anatomical structures,
noise sources, and the response of real world imaging systems. Hence, simulated
image data will generally possess physical and statistical differences from the
experimental image data they seek to emulate. Within the context of machine
learning, these differences between the sets of two images is referred to as
domain shift. In this study, we propose and investigate the use of an
adversarial domain adaptation method to mitigate the deleterious effects of
domain shift between simulated and experimental image data for deep
learning-based numerical observers (DL-NOs) that are trained on simulated

initially be trained on computer-simulated image data and subsequently adapted
for use with experimental image data, without the need for any labeled

considered. The success of this strategy as a function of the degree of domain

cultivation systems open up the opportunities for parallelization and rapid
data generation. In contrast to microfluidics with continuous flow, sessile
droplet approaches enhance the flexibility for fluid manipulation with usually
less operational effort. Generating biologically favorable conditions and
promoting cell growth in a droplet, however, is particularly challenging due to
mass transfer limitations, which has to be solved by implementing an effective
mixing technique. Here, capillary waves induced by vertical oscillation are
used to mix inside a sessile droplet micro-bioreactor (MBR) system avoiding
additional moving parts inside the fluid. Depending on the excitation
frequency, different patterns are formed on the oscillating liquid surface,
which are described by a model of a vibrated sessile droplet. Analyzing mixing
times and oxygen transport into the liquid, a strong dependency of mass
transfer on the oscillation parameters, especially the excitation frequency, is
demonstrated. Oscillations at distinct capillary wave resonant frequencies lead
to rapid homogenization with mixing times of 2 s and volumetric liquid-phase
mass transfer coefficients of more than 340 h-1. This shows that the mass
transfer in a droplet MBR can be specifically controlled via capillary waves,
what is subsequently demonstrated for cultivations of Escherichia coli BL21
cells. Therefore, the presented MBR in combination with vertical oscillation
mixing for intensified mass transfer is a promising tool for highly parallel
cultivation and data generation.

We present here a full solution avoiding those problems. The complete set of
Fock states is obtained, together with the corresponding explicit wavefunction
and their inner product integrals free from any divergence problem and the
Lorentz symmetry fully maintained without additional constraints imposed. By a
simple choice of the pseudo-unitary representation of the underlying symmetry
group, motivated from the perspective of the Minkowski spacetime as a
representation for the Lorentz group, we obtain the natural non-unitary Fock
space picture commonly considered though not formulated and presented in the
careful details given here. From a direct derivation of the appropriate basis
state wavefunctions of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of
the Lorentz symmetry, the relation between the latter and the Fock state
wavefunctions is also explicitly shown. Moreover, the full picture including
the states with non-positive norm may give consistent physics picture as a
version of Lorentz covariant quantum mechanics. Probability interpretation for
the usual von Neumann measurements is not a problem as all wavefunctions
restricted to a definite value for the `time' variable are just like those of
the usual time independent quantum mechanics. A further understanding from a
perspective of the dynamics from the symplectic geometry of the phase space is

for the limit of large particle number for most normal systems. In this case,
Tsallis entropy can be expanded as a function of energy and particle number
fluctuation, and thus the power-law forms of the generalized Gibbs distribution
and grand canonical distribution can be derived. These new distribution
functions can be applied to derive the free energy and grand thermodynamic
potential in nonextensive thermodynamics. In order to establish appropriate
nonextensive thermodynamic formalism, the dual thermodynamic interpretations
are necessary for thermodynamic relations and thermodynamic quantities. By
using a new technique of parameter transformation, the single-particle
distribution can be deduced from the power-law Gibbs distribution. This
technique produces a link between the statistical ensemble and the
quasi-independent system with two kinds of nonextensive parameter having quite
different physical explanations. Furthermore, the technique is used to
construct nonextensive quantum statistics and effectively to avoid the
factorization difficulty in the power-law grand canonical distribution.

confirmations are still needed to understand and identify interactions between
the two systems or conflict events. Eye movements are among the most direct
markers of the individual attentive load and may serve as an important proxy of
information. In this work we propose a computational method, within a modified
visual version of the well-known Stroop test, for the identification of
different tasks and potential conflicts events between the two systems through
the collection and processing of data related to eye movements. A statistical
analysis shows that the selected variables can characterize the variation of
attentive load within different scenarios. Moreover, we show that Machine
Learning techniques allow to distinguish between different tasks with a good
classification accuracy and to investigate more in depth the gaze dynamics.

scientists due to its noticeable features such as low power consumption and
small size. Many papers have been published in the literature about the
utilization of this technology for de-signing many QCA circuits and for
presenting logic gates in an optimal structure. The T flip-flop, which is an
essential part of digital designs, can be used to design synchronous and
asynchronous counters. This paper presents a novel T flip-flop structure in an
optimal form. The presented novel gate was used to design an N-bit binary
synchronous counter. The QCADesigner software was used to verify the designed
circuits and to present the simulation results, while the QCAPro tool was used
for the power analysis. The proposed design required minimal power and showed
good improvements over previous designs.
