opportunities that quantum simulators can offer. Here, we propose an analog
simulator for discrete 2D quantum chemistry models based on cold atoms in
optical lattices. We first analyze how to simulate simple models, like the
discrete versions of H and H$_2^+$, using a single fermionic atom. We then show
that a single bosonic atom can mediate an effective Coulomb repulsion between
two fermions, leading to the analog of molecular Hydrogen in two dimensions. We
extend this approach to larger systems by introducing as many mediating atoms
as fermions, and derive the effective repulsion law. In all cases, we analyze
how the continuous limit is approached for increasing optical lattice sizes.

developed rapidly from its infancy to a useful tool for practitioners. However,
models with more than a handful of parameters still generally remain a
challenge for the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) based inference. To
advance the possibilities for performing likelihood-free inference in higher
dimensional parameter spaces, we introduce an extension of the popular Bayesian
optimisation based approach to approximate discrepancy functions in a
probabilistic manner which lends itself to an efficient exploration of the
parameter space. Our approach achieves computational scalability for higher
dimensional parameter spaces by using separate acquisition functions and
discrepancies for each parameter. The efficient additive acquisition structure
is combined with exponentiated loss -likelihood to provide a
misspecification-robust characterisation of the marginal posterior distribution
for all model parameters. The method successfully performs computationally
efficient inference in a 100-dimensional space on canonical examples and
compares favourably to existing modularised ABC methods. We further illustrate
the potential of this approach by fitting a bacterial transmission dynamics
model to a real data set, which provides biologically coherent results on
strain competition in a 30-dimensional parameter space.

an open-source library that supports all DSP steps to map/demap an N-subcarrier

with a neutron star-neutron star merger with chirp mass of
$1.44\pm0.02M_\odot.$ This value falls in the $ambiguous$ interval as from the
GW signal alone we can not rule out the presence of a black hole in the binary.
In this case, the system would host a neutron star and a very light stellar
black hole, with mass close to the maximum value for neutron stars, filling the
$mass$ $gap$. No electromagnetic counterpart is firmly associated with this
event, due to the poorly informative sky localisation and larger distance,
compared to GW/GRB170817. We construct here kilonova light curve models for
GW190425, for both double neutron star and black hole-neutron star systems,
considering two equations of state consistent with current constraints from the
signals of GW170817/GW190425 and the NICER results, including black hole spin
effects and assuming a new formula for the mass of the ejecta. The putative
presence of a light black hole in GW190425 would have produced a brighter
kilonova emission compared to the double neutron star case, letting us to
distinguish the nature of the companion to the neutron star. Concerning
candidate counterparts of GW190425, classified later on as supernovae, our
models could have discarded two transients detected in their early $r$-band
evolution. Combining the chirp mass and luminosity distance information from
the GW signal with a library of kilonova light curves helps identifying the
electromagnetic counterpart early on. We remark that the release in low latency
of the chirp mass in this interval of $ambiguous$ values appears to be vital
for successful electromagnetic follow-ups.

phenomena of relaxation and vibration. Theoretical progress in the area of slow
relaxation dynamics of liquid and glassy systems and in the area of vibrational
spectra of glasses and liquids is reviewed. After laying down a generic
modelling framework to connect vibration and relaxation, the physics of metal
alloys is considered where the emergence of power-law exponents has been
identified both in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) as well as in
density correlations. Also, theoretical frameworks which connect the VDOS to
the relaxation behaviour and mechanical viscoelastic response in metallic

to the case of molecular glass formers where the emergence of
stretched-exponential relaxation in dielectric relaxation can be put in
quantitative relation with the VDOS by means of memory-function approaches.
Further connections between relaxation and vibration are provided by the study
of phonon linewidths in liquids and glasses, where a natural starting point is
given by hydrodynamic theories. Finally, an agenda of outstanding issues
including the appearance of compressed exponential relaxation in the
intermediate scattering function of experimental and simulated systems (metal

role of an indicator of stability of physical systems. It was observed that,
comparing states of the same system, the lower is the value of the CE, the more
stable is the state. In this work we investigate the behaviour of the
differential configuration entropy (DCE) , that is appropriate for systems with
continuous degrees of freedom, in a new context. We consider quasi-states of
quarkonium (a vector meson made of a heavy quark anti-quark pair) inside a
plasma at finite density. It is known that the density increases the
dissociation effect for quasi-particles inside a plasma. So, increasing the
density of a thermal medium corresponds to reducing the stability of the
quasi-particles. In order to investigate how this situation is translated in
the Configutation Entropy context, we use a recently developed holographic
AdS/QCD model for heavy vector mesons. The quasi-normal modes describing the
quasi-states are obtained and the corresponding DCE is calculated. We find, for
bottomonium and charmonium $1 S$ quasi-states, that the DCE increases with the
quark density, or quark chemical potential, of the medium. This result shows
that the DCE works again as an indicator of stability, represented in this case
by the dissociation effect associated with the density.

methodologies have been historically distinct. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
are used to model a priori causal assumptions and inform variable selection
strategies for causal questions. Although tools originally designed for
prediction are finding applications in causal inference, the counterpart has
remained largely unexplored. The aim of this theoretical and simulation-based
study is to assess the potential benefit of using DAGs in clinical risk
prediction modeling.
  Methods and Findings: We explore how incorporating knowledge about the
underlying causal structure can provide insights about the transportability of
diagnostic clinical risk prediction models to different settings. A
single-predictor model in the causal direction is likely to have better
transportability than one in the anticausal direction. We further probe whether
causal knowledge can be used to improve predictor selection. We empirically
show that the Markov Blanket, the set of variables including the parents,
children, and parents of the children of the outcome node in a DAG, is the
optimal set of predictors for that outcome.
  Conclusions: Our findings challenge the generally accepted notion that a
change in the distribution of the predictors does not affect diagnostic
clinical risk prediction model calibration if the predictors are properly
included in the model. Furthermore, using DAGs to identify Markov Blanket
variables may be a useful, efficient strategy to select predictors in clinical
risk prediction models if strong knowledge of the underlying causal structure
exists or can be learned.

types of drivers. (3) Very often, authors associate the disturbance of the
magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere system caused by a complex driver (by a

excitation energy over large distances due to dipole-dipole interactions. Here,
we explore to what extent thermal motion of entire monomers can guide or
enhance this excitation transport. The motion induces changes of aggregate
geometry and hence modifies exciton states. Under certain conditions,
excitation energy can thus be transported by the aggregate adiabatically,
following a certain exciton eigenstate. While such transport is always slower
than direct migration through dipole-dipole interactions, we show that
transport through motion can yield higher transport efficiencies in the
presence of on-site energy disorder than the static counterpart. For this we
consider two simple models of molecular motion: (i) longitudinal vibrations of
the monomers along the aggregation direction within their inter-molecular
binding potential and (ii) torsional motion of planar monomers in a plane
orthogonal to the aggregation direction. The parameters and potential shapes
used are relevant to dye-molecule aggregates. We employ a quantum-classical
method, in which molecules move through simplified classical molecular
dynamics, while the excitation transport is treated quantum mechanically using
Schr\""odinger's equation. For both models we find parameter regimes in which
the motion enhances excitation transport, however these are more realistic for
the torsional scenario, due to the limited motional range in a typical Morse
type inter-molecular potential. We finally show that the transport enhancement
can be linked to adiabatic quantum dynamics. This transport enhancement through
adiabatic motion appears a useful resource to combat exciton trapping by
disorder.

say, by means of a classification rule $g:\mathbb{R}^q\to \mathcal{Y}$ with
minimum probability of error $\mathbb{P}\{Y\neq g(X) \}$. However, in a wide
variety of situations, the task targeted may be more ambitious, consisting in
sorting all the possible label values $y$ that may be assigned to $X$ by
decreasing order of the posterior probability $\eta_y(X)=\mathbb{P}\{Y=y \mid X
\}$. This article is devoted to the analysis of this statistical learning
problem, halfway between multiclass classification and posterior probability
estimation (regression) and referred to as label ranking here. We highlight the
fact that it can be viewed as a specific variant of ranking median regression
(RMR), where, rather than observing a random permutation $\Sigma$ assigned to
the input vector $X$ and drawn from a Bradley-Terry-Luce-Plackett model with
conditional preference vector $(\eta_1(X),\; \ldots,\; \eta_K(X))$, the sole
information available for training a label ranking rule is the label $Y$ ranked
on top, namely $\Sigma^{-1}(1)$. Inspired by recent results in RMR, we prove
that under appropriate noise conditions, the One-Versus-One (OVO) approach to
multiclassification yields, as a by-product, an optimal ranking of the labels
with overwhelming probability. Beyond theoretical guarantees, the relevance of
the approach to label ranking promoted in this article is supported by
experimental results.

Consequently, we demonstrate that decomposing a complex multiclass model into
an aggregation of binary models enhances robustness. This behavior is
consistent across different datasets and model architectures and can be
combined with known defense techniques such as adversarial training. Moreover,
we provide further evidence of a disconnect between standard and robust

to have finite second moments. It is well known that then the class of

interfacial shape distribution, structure factor, and autocorrelations of phase

topology and agreement with the expected power laws for dynamic scaling, in
which the characteristic length scale increases over time proportionally to
$t^{1/4}$ for surface diffusion and $t^{1/3}$ for bulk diffusion. While we
observe the expected difference in the coarsening kinetics, we find that
differences in self-similar morphology due to coarsening mechanism are
relatively small, although typically they are larger at 36% volume fraction

turned out to be point-source dominated, with faint detections or upper limits
on any extended emission. We were not able to rule out the presence of extended
X-ray emission from any of the point sources. The levels of extended emission
around the six point sources are consistent with expectations based on optical
richness, but could also be contaminated by scattered X-ray light from the
central point source or extended nonthermal emission from possible radio lobes.
We characterize the extended components of each of the well-detected cluster
sources, finding that six of the eight X-ray clusters are consistent with being
compact cool-core clusters. One of the newly identified low-luminosity X-ray
clusters may have had an X-ray-luminous AGN 20 yr prior to the recent Chandra
observations, based on the 4{\sigma} difference between its Chandra and ROSAT
fluxes.

uses $T$ source tasks with $n_1$ data per task to learn a representation in
order to reduce the sample complexity of a target task for which there is only
$n_2 (\ll n_1)$ data. Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists
a good \emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is
to understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study
the setting where this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a
fast rate of $O\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)}{n_1T} +
\frac{k}{n_2}\right)$; here, $\Phi$ is the representation function class,
$\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)$ is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the
dimension of the representation. When specialized to linear representation
functions, this rate becomes $O\left(\frac{dk}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$
where $d (\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which is a substantial
improvement over the rate without using representation learning, i.e. over the
rate of $O\left(\frac{d}{n_2}\right)$. This result bypasses the
$\Omega(\frac{1}{T})$ barrier under the i.i.d. task assumption, and can capture
the desired property that all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks can be
\emph{pooled} together for representation learning. Next, we consider the
setting where the common representation may be high-dimensional but is
capacity-constrained (say in norm); here, we again demonstrate the advantage of
representation learning in both high-dimensional linear regression and neural
network learning. Our results demonstrate representation learning can fully
utilize all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks.

obstacle to performing Pixel Response Non-Uniformity corrections. These

Over the course of LSST camera development, a number of practical fixes have
been suggested to get rid of tearing. But applying these fixes to our
16-channel Teledyne-e2v sensors leaves at best a distortion pattern at the
vertical edges of every segment. Our working hypothesis is that the origin of
the tearing is the parallel clocking itself, which moves the holes that are
present in the channel stops regions. The efficiency of these transfers depends
strongly on the details of the clocking operations, resulting in the observed
variety of distortion patterns. Removal of most of the distortion patterns can
therefore be achieved by executing a purge operation, which flattens back the
hole distribution in the channel stops, immediately before acquiring a frame. A
more effective solution is to switch all clocking operations to use a bipolar
voltage set.

data, and hypergraph clustering is the task of detecting groups of closely
related nodes in such data. Graph clustering has been studied extensively, and
there are numerous methods for detecting small, localized clusters without
having to explore an entire input graph. However, there are only a few
specialized approaches for localized clustering in hypergraphs. Here we present
a framework for local hypergraph clustering based on minimizing localized ratio
cut objectives. Our framework takes an input set of reference nodes in a
hypergraph and solves a sequence of hypergraph minimum $s$-$t$ cut problems in
order to identify a nearby well-connected cluster of nodes that overlaps
substantially with the input set.
  Our methods extend graph-based techniques but are significantly more general
and have new output quality guarantees. First, our methods can minimize new
generalized notions of hypergraph cuts, which depend on specific configurations
of nodes within each hyperedge, rather than just on the number of cut
hyperedges. Second, our framework has several attractive theoretical properties
in terms of output cluster quality. Most importantly, our algorithm is
strongly-local, meaning that its runtime depends only on the size of the input
set, and does not need to explore the entire hypergraph to find good local
clusters. We use our methodology to effectively identify clusters in
hypergraphs of real-world data with millions of nodes, millions of hyperedges,
and large average hyperedge size with runtimes ranging between a few seconds
and a few minutes.

understanding of 3He-rich SEPs is the difficulty resolving the source regions
of these commonly occurring events. Since their discovery, there has been
strong evidence that 3He-rich SEP production is associated with flares on the
Sun. Anomalous abundances of 3He-rich SEPs have been attributed to a unique
acceleration mechanism that must routinely operate at flare sites. Flares
associated with 3He-rich SEPs have been often observed in jet-like forms
indicating an acceleration in magnetic reconnection involving field lines open
to interplanetary space. Owing to a fleet of spacecraft around the Sun,
providing a greatly improved resolution of solar imaging observations, 3He-rich
SEP sources are now explored in unprecedented detail. This paper outlines the

(RIS) in wireless communications has attracted many researchers in recent
years. RIS has a certain degree of control over the scattering and reflection
characteristics of the electromagnetic waves, compared to the conventional
communications in which the received signal is degraded due to the
uncontrollable scattering of the transmitted signal and its interaction with
the objects in propagating medium. Further, in RIS assisted communications, the
phases of the multiple incoming signals can be controlled to enable
constructive addition of multiple signals from different channel paths to
improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). On the other hand, Non-Orthogonal Multiple
Access (NOMA) provides massive connectivity and low latency. The power domain
variant NOMA uses superposition coded symbols with different powers for
different user symbols. In this paper, a novel RIS assisted downlink NOMA
system is proposed by combining the merits of both RIS and NOMA to improve the
reliability of the system. Analytical expressions are derived for the Bit Error
Rate (BER) performance of the proposed RIS assisted power domain NOMA system.
The BER performance of the proposed system is analyzed using the numerical
simulation results. It is observed that the proposed system has better
performance than the conventional NOMA system.

chosen at random from a given distribution, and decides whether to purchase an
item from that set based on a choice model. The goal of the platform is to
maximize the engagement of the shopper defined as the probability of purchase.
This problem gives rise to a less-studied variation of submodular maximization
in which we are asked to choose an $\textit{ordering}$ of a set of elements to
maximize a linear combination of different submodular functions.
  First, using a reduction to maximizing submodular functions over matroids, we
give an optimal $\left(1-1/e\right)$-approximation for this problem. We then
consider a variant in which the platform cares not only about user engagement,
but also about diversification across various groups of users, that is,
guaranteeing a certain probability of purchase in each group. We characterize
the polytope of feasible solutions and give a bi-criteria
$((1-1/e)^2,(1-1/e)^2)$-approximation for this problem by rounding an
approximate solution of a linear programming relaxation. For rounding, we rely
on our reduction and the particular rounding techniques for matroid polytopes.
For the special case in which underlying submodular functions are coverage
functions -- which is practically relevant in online retail -- we propose an
alternative LP relaxation and a simpler randomized rounding for the problem.
This approach yields to an optimal bi-criteria $(1-1/e,1-1/e)$-approximation

correlation clustering objective is related to higher-order notions of
normalized cut and modularity in hypergraphs. It is further amenable to
approximation algorithms via hyperedge expansion techniques.
  Our parameterized bipartite correlation clustering objective generalizes
standard unweighted bipartite correlation clustering, as well as bicluster
deletion. For a certain choice of parameters it is also related to our
hypergraph objective. Although in general it is NP-hard, we highlight a
parameter regime for the bipartite objective where the problem reduces to the
bipartite matching problem and thus can be solved in polynomial time. For other

minimum number of edges to partition a bipartite graph into disjoint
bi-cliques.

$O(\log k)$ samples from $p$, and it was recently shown that the same

naive approach to this problem under local differential privacy would require
$\tilde O(k^2)$ samples.

have, on average, higher ejecta velocities (as seen in nearly every optical

an alternative scenario, for which tidal shocks are exerted by the MW to
DM-free dSphs after a first infall of their gas-rich progenitors, and for which
theoretical calculations have been verified by pure N-body simulations. Whether
or not the dSphs are on their first infall cannot be resolved on the sole basis
of their star formation history. In fact, gas removal may cause complex
gravitational instabilities and near-pericenter passages can give rise to tidal
disruptive processes. Advanced precision with the Gaia satellite in determining
both their past orbital motions and the MW velocity curve is, however,
providing crucial results.
  First, tidal shocks explain why DM-free dSphs are found preferentially near
their pericenter, where they are in a destructive process, while their chance
to be long-lived satellites is associated with a very low probability P~ 2
10^-7, which is at odds with the current DM-dominated dSph scenario. Second,
most dSph binding energies are consistent with a first infall. Third, the MW
tidal shocks that predict the observed dSph velocity dispersions are themselves
predicted in amplitude by the most accurate MW velocity curve. Fourth, tidal
shocks accurately predict the forces or accelerations exerted at half-light
radius of dSphs, including the MW and the Magellanic System gravitational
attractions.
  The above is suggestive of dSphs that are DM-free and tidally shocked near
their pericenters, which may provoke a significant quake in our understanding

that a NSM polluted the surfaces of stars in M15 long after the cluster

decrease in the first dredge-up as stars turn on to the RGB. We present
Keck/DEIMOS abundances of Ba in 66 stars along the entire RGB and the top of

neutron star merger, it would have had a very short delay time. Alternatively,

explore and provide direct observational evidence for this process in the Milky
Way disc, by quantifying the probability that orbit-similarity among stars
implies indistinguishable metallicity. We define the orbit similarity among
stars through their distance in action-angle space, $\Delta (J,\theta)$, and
their abundance similarity simply by $\Delta$[Fe/H]. Analyzing a sample of main
sequence stars from Gaia DR2 and LAMOST, we find an excess of pairs with the
same metallicity ($\Delta\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<0.1$) that extends to remarkably large
separations in $\Delta (J,\theta)$ that correspond to nearly 1 kpc distances.
We assess the significance of this effect through a mock sample, drawn from a
smooth and phase-mixed orbit distribution. Through grouping such star pairs
into associations with a friend-of-friends algorithm linked by $\Delta
(J,\theta)$, we find 100s of mono-abundance groups with $\ge 3$ (to $\gtrsim

the outermost caustic located at ~1.4r_200m corresponding to the ""splashback""

the edge of the virialized material which has completed at least two

environments where the halos of the two galaxies overlap. However, the second
caustic is less affected by the presence of a companion, and is a more useful
definition for the boundary of the Milky Way halo. Curiously, the stellar
distribution also has a clearly defined caustic, which, in most cases,
coincides with the second caustic of the dark matter. This can be identified in
both radial density and radial velocity profiles, and should be measurable in
future observational programmes. Finally, we show that the second caustic can

star-formation in 281 star-forming galaxies from the KMOS3D survey at 0.7 < z <
2.7. Sizes are derived by fitting 2D exponential disk models, with bootstrap
errors averaging 20%. H${\alpha}$ sizes are a median (mean) of 1.19 (1.26)
times larger than those of the stellar continuum, which due to radial dust
gradients places an upper limit on the growth in stellar size via star
formation, with just 43% intrinsic scatter. At fixed continuum size the
H${\alpha}$ size shows no residual trend with stellar mass, star formation
rate, redshift or morphology. The only significant residual trend is with the
excess obscuration of H${\alpha}$ by dust, at fixed continuum obscuration. The
scatter in continuum size at fixed stellar mass is likely driven by the scatter
in halo spin parameters. The stability of the ratio of H${\alpha}$ size to
continuum size demonstrates a high degree of stability in halo spin and in the
transfer of angular momentum to the disk over a wide range of physical
conditions and cosmic time. This may require local regulation by feedback
processes. The implication of our results, as we demonstrate using a toy model,
is that our upper limit on star-formation driven growth is sufficient only to
evolve star-forming galaxies approximately along the observed size-mass
relation, consistent with the size growth of galaxies at constant cumulative
co-moving number density. To explain the observed evolution of the size-mass
relation of star-forming disk galaxies other processes, such as the
preferential quenching of compact galaxies or galaxy mergers, may be required.

cascade by which their correlation length grows due to the conservation of
magnetic helicity in classical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). At high
energies above approximately $10$ MeV, however, classical MHD is necessarily
extended to chiral MHD and then the conserved quantity is
$\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle + 2 \langle\mu_5\rangle / \lambda$ with
$\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle$ being the mean magnetic helicity and
$\langle\mu_5\rangle$ being the mean chiral chemical potential of charged
fermions. Here, $\lambda$ is a (phenomenological) chiral feedback parameter. In
this paper, we study the evolution of the chiral MHD system with the initial
condition of nonzero $\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle$ and vanishing $\mu_5$. We
present analytic derivations for the time evolution of
$\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle$ and $\langle\mu_5\rangle$ that we compare to a
series of laminar and turbulent three-dimensional direct numerical simulations.
We find that the late-time evolution of $\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle$ depends on
the magnetic and kinetic Reynolds numbers ${\rm Re}_{_\mathrm{M}}$ and ${\rm
Re}_{_\mathrm{K}}$. For a high ${\rm Re}_{_\mathrm{M}}$ and ${\rm
Re}_{_\mathrm{K}}$ where turbulence occurs, $\langle\mathcal{H}\rangle$
eventually evolves in the same way as in classical ideal MHD where the inverse
correlation length of the helical magnetic field scales with time $t$ as
$k_\mathrm{p} \propto t^{-2/3}$. For a low Reynolds numbers where the velocity
field is negligible, the scaling is changed to $k_\mathrm{p} \propto
t^{-1/2}\mathrm{ln}\left(t/t_\mathrm{log}\right)$. After being rapidly
generated, $\langle\mu_5\rangle$ always decays together with $k_\mathrm{p}$,
i.e. $\langle\mu_5\rangle \approx k_\mathrm{p}$, with a time evolution that
depends on whether the system is in the limit of low or high Reynolds numbers.

hole populations at present day. This is supported by dynamical simulations of
cluster evolution, which have unveiled the spatial distribution and mass
spectrum of black holes in clusters across cosmic age. However, black hole
populations of young, high metallicity clusters remain unconstrained. Black
holes hosted by these clusters mass segregate early in their evolutionary
history, forming central subsystems of hundreds to thousands of black holes. We
argue that after supernova feedback has subsided ($\gtrsim 50\,{\rm Myr}$), the
host cluster can accumulate gas from its dense surroundings, from which the
black hole subsystem accretes at highly enhanced rates. The collective
accretion luminosity can be substantial and provides a novel observational
constraint for young massive clusters. We test this hypothesis by performing 3D
hydrodynamic simulations where we embed discretized potentials, representing
our black holes, within the potential of a massive cluster. This system moves
supersonically with respect to a gaseous medium from which it accretes. We
study the accretion of this black hole subsystem for different subsystem
populations and determine the integrated accretion luminosity of the black hole
subsystem. We apply our results to the young massive clusters of the Antennae
Galaxies and find that a typical subsystem accretion luminosity should be in
excess of $\approx 10^{40}\,{\rm ergs\,\,s^{-1}}$. We argue that no strong
candidates of this luminous signal have been observed and constrain the
subsystem population of a typical cluster in the Antennae Galaxies to
$\lesssim10-2\times10^2$ $10\,M_\odot$ black holes, given that feedback doesn't
significantly impede accretion and that the gas remains optically thin.

detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance

kinematically colder (radial velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=4.9\pm0.8 \, {\rm

the presence of two populations, we are unable to robustly estimate the slope

from different instruments and observational techniques. In this work we focus
on the benchmark test of coupling four of the physical modules: fluid dynamics,
radiation, turbulence and surface/soil. To test the OASIS platform, we produced
3D simulations of the Venus climate and its atmospheric circulation and study
how the modeled atmosphere changes with various cloud covers, atmospheric heat
capacity, and surface friction. 3D simulations of Venus are challenging because
they require long integration times with a computationally expensive radiative
transfer code. By comparing OASIS results with observational data, we verify
that the new model is able to successfully simulate Venus. With simulated
spectra produced directly from the 3D simulations, we explore the capabilities
of future missions, like LUVOIR, to observe Venus analogs located at a distance

massive progenitors, the lack of a uniformly analyzed statistical sample has so
far prevented a detailed view of the progenitor mass distribution. Here we
present and analyze the pre-explosion mass distribution of hydrogen-poor SLSN
progenitors as determined from uniformly modelled light curves of 62 events. We
construct the distribution by summing the ejecta mass posteriors of each event,
using magnetar light curve models presented in our previous works (and using a
nominal neutron star remnant mass). The resulting distribution spans $3.6-40$
M$_{\odot}$, with a sharp decline at lower masses, and is best fit by a broken
power law described by ${\rm d}N/{\rm dlog}M \propto M^{-0.41 \pm 0.06}$ at
$3.6-8.6$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\propto M^{-1.26 \pm 0.06}$ at $8.6-40$ M$_{\odot}$.
We find that observational selection effects cannot account for the shape of
the distribution. Relative to Type Ib/c SNe, the SLSN mass distribution extends
to much larger masses and has a different power-law shape, likely indicating
that the formation of a magnetar allows more massive stars to explode as some
of the rotational energy accelerates the ejecta. Comparing the SLSN
distribution with predictions from single and binary star evolution models, we
find that binary models for a metallicity of $Z\lesssim 1/3$ Z$_{\odot}$ are
best able to reproduce its broad shape, in agreement with the preference of
SLSNe for low metallicity environments. Finally, we uncover a correlation
between the pre-explosion mass and the magnetar initial spin period, where
SLSNe with low masses have slower spins, a trend broadly consistent with the
effects of angular momentum transport evident in models of rapidly-rotating
carbon-oxygen stars.

improving the efficiency of disaster response and rehabilitation. In
conventional data-driven frameworks which use machine learning or statistical
models, structural damage diagnosis models are often constructed using
supervised learning. The supervised learning requires historical structural
response data and corresponding damage states (i.e., labels) for each building
to learn the building-specific damage diagnosis model. However, in
post-earthquake scenarios, historical data with labels are often not available
for many buildings in the affected area. This makes it difficult to construct a
damage diagnosis model. Further, directly using the historical data from other
buildings to construct a damage diagnosis model for the target building would
lead to inaccurate results. This is because each building has unique physical
properties and thus unique data distribution. To this end, we introduce a new
framework to transfer the model learned from other buildings to diagnose
structural damage states in the target building without any labels. This
framework is based on an adversarial domain adaptation approach that extracts
domain-invariant feature representations of data from different buildings. The
feature extraction function is trained in an adversarial way, which ensures
that the extracted feature distributions are robust to changes in structures
while being predictive of the damage states. With the extracted
domain-invariant feature representations, the data distributions become
consistent across different buildings. We evaluate our framework on both
numerical simulation and field data collected from multiple building
structures, which outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

(OOPEX), to approximately compute expectation values in energy eigenstates at
finite energy density of non-integrable quantum many-body systems with
polynomial effort, whereas exact diagonalization (ED) of the Hamiltonian $H$ is
exponentially hard. The OOPEX relies on the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis, which conjectures that eigenstate expectation values of physical
observables in such systems vary smoothly with the eigenstate energy (and other
macroscopic conserved quantities, if any), and computes them through a series
generated by repeated multiplications, rather than diagonalization, of $H$ and
whose successive terms oscillate faster with the energy. The hypothesis
guarantees that only the first few terms of this series contribute appreciably.
We further show that the OOPEX, in a sense, is the most optimum algorithm based
on series expansions of $H$ as it avoids computing the many-body density of
states which plagues other similar algorithms. Then, we argue non-rigorously
that working in the Fock space of operators, rather than that of states as is
usually done, yields convergent results with computational resources that scale
polynomially with $N$. We demonstrate the polynomial scaling by applying the
OOPEX to the non-integrable Ising chain and comparing with ED and
high-temperature expansion (HTX) results. The OOPEX provides access to much
larger $N$ than ED and HTX do, which facilitates overcoming finite-size effects
that plague the other methods to extract correlation lengths in chaotic
eigenstates. In addition, access to large systems allows testing a recent
conjecture that the Renyi entropy of chaotic eigenstates has positive curvature
if the Renyi index $>1$, and we find encouraging supporting evidence.

petrophysically and geologically guided geophysical inversions. In that
framework, petrophysical and geological information is modelled with a Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). In the inversion, the GMM serves as a prior for the
geophysical model. The formulation was confined to problems in which a single
physical property model was sought, with a single geophysical dataset. In this
paper, we extend that framework to jointly invert multiple geophysical datasets
that depend on multiple physical properties. The petrophysical and geological
information is used to couple geophysical surveys that, otherwise, rely on
independent physics. This requires advancements in two areas. First, an
extension from a univariate to a multivariate analysis of the petrophysical
data, and their inclusion within the inverse problem, is necessary. Second, we
address the practical issues of simultaneously inverting data from multiple
surveys and finding a solution that acceptably reproduces each one, along with
the petrophysical and geological information. To illustrate the efficacy of our
approach and the advantages of carrying out multi-physics inversions, we invert
synthetic gravity and magnetic data associated with a kimberlite deposit. The
kimberlite pipe contains two distinct facies embedded in a host rock. Inverting
the datasets individually leads to a binary geological model: background or
kimberlite. A multi-physics inversion, with petrophysical information,
differentiates between the two main kimberlite facies of the pipe. Through this
example, we also highlight the capabilities of our framework to work with
interpretive geologic assumptions when minimal quantitative information is
available. In those cases, the dynamic updates of the Gaussian Mixture Model
allow us to perform multi-physics inversions by learning a petrophysical model.

learning with function approximation. Consider the off-policy evaluation
problem, which is to estimate the cumulative value of a new target policy from
logged history generated by unknown behavioral policies. We study a
regression-based fitted Q iteration method, and show that it is equivalent to a
model-based method that estimates a conditional mean embedding of the
transition operator. We prove that this method is information-theoretically
optimal and has nearly minimal estimation error. In particular, by leveraging
contraction property of Markov processes and martingale concentration, we
establish a finite-sample instance-dependent error upper bound and a
nearly-matching minimax lower bound. The policy evaluation error depends
sharply on a restricted $\chi^2$-divergence over the function class between the
long-term distribution of the target policy and the distribution of past data.
This restricted $\chi^2$-divergence is both instance-dependent and
function-class-dependent. It characterizes the statistical limit of off-policy
evaluation. Further, we provide an easily computable confidence bound for the
policy evaluator, which may be useful for optimistic planning and safe policy
improvement.

thus is confirmed to be a dwarf-dwarf merger. VCC848 is located in the
outskirts of the Virgo Cluster. By analyzing the stellar light distribution, we
found that VCC848 is the result of a merging between two dwarf galaxies with a
primary-to-secondary mass ratio < ~ 5 for the stellar components and < ~ 2 for
the presumed dark matter halos. The secondary progenitor galaxy has been almost
entirely disrupted. The age-mass distribution of photometrically selected star
cluster candidates in VCC848 implies that the cluster formation rate (CFR,
proportional to star formation rate) was enhanced by a factor of ~ 7 - 10
during the past 1 Gyr. The merging-induced enhancement of CFR peaked near the
galactic center a few hundred Myr ago and has started declining in the last few
tens of Myr. The current star formation activities, as traced by the youngest
clusters, mainly occur at large galactocentric distances (> ~ 1 kpc). The fact
that VCC848 is still (atomic) gas-dominated after the period of most violent
collision suggests that gas-rich dwarf galaxy merging can result in BCD-like
remnants with extended atomic gas distribution surrounding a blue compact
center, in general agreement with previous numerical simulations.

its capability to model highly correlated graph structures that exist in
real-world networks. In this paper, we present a flexible richly structured
MMSB model, \textit{Struct-MMSB}, that uses a recently developed statistical
relational learning model, hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), as a
structured prior to model complex dependencies among node attributes,
multi-relational links, and their relationship with mixed-membership

templating language that uses weighted first-order logic rules, which enhances
the model's interpretability. Further, our model is capable of learning latent
characteristics in real-world networks via meaningful latent variables encoded
as a complex combination of observed features and membership distributions. We
present an expectation-maximization based inference algorithm that learns
latent variables and parameters iteratively, a scalable stochastic variation of
the inference algorithm, and a method to learn the weights of HL-MRF structured
priors. We evaluate our model on six datasets across three different types of
networks and corresponding modeling scenarios and demonstrate that our models

$t$-designs. Unitary $t$-designs mimic the Haar-measure up to $t$-th moments.
It is known that Clifford operations can implement at most $3$-designs. In this
work, we quantify the non-Clifford resources required to break this barrier. We
find that it suffices to inject $O(t^{4}\log^{2}(t)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ many
non-Clifford gates into a polynomial-depth random Clifford circuit to obtain an
$\varepsilon$-approximate $t$-design. Strikingly, the number of non-Clifford
gates required is independent of the system size -- asymptotically, the density
of non-Clifford gates is allowed to tend to zero. We also derive novel bounds
on the convergence time of random Clifford circuits to the $t$-th moment of the
uniform distribution on the Clifford group. Our proofs exploit a recently
developed variant of Schur-Weyl duality for the Clifford group, as well as
bounds on restricted spectral gaps of averaging operators.

new insights into the connection between first and second-order methods.
Remarkably, the local convergence rate of SSCN matches the rate of stochastic
subspace descent applied to the problem of minimizing the quadratic function
$\frac12 (x-x^*)^\top \nabla^2f(x^*)(x-x^*)$, where $x^*$ is the minimizer of

entanglement via the propagation of quasi-particle pairs. However, when systems
interact with their surrounding much less has been established. Here we show
that the quasi-particle picture remains valid for open quantum systems: while
information is still spread by quasiparticles, the environment modifies their
correlation and introduces incoherent and mixing effects. For free fermions
with gain/loss dissipation we provide formulae fully describing incoherent and
quasiparticle contributions in the spreading of entropy and mutual information.
Importantly, the latter is not affected by incoherent correlations. The mutual
information is exponentially damped at short times and eventually vanishes
signalling the onset of a classical limit. The behaviour of the logarithmic
negativity is similar and this scenario is common to other dissipations. For
weak dissipation, the presence of quasiparticles underlies remarkable scaling
behaviors.

approach, inject and merge architectures were compared against a multi-modal
image captioning approach based primarily on object detection. These approaches
have been compared on the basis on state of the art sentence comparison metrics
such as BLEU, GLEU, Meteor, and Rouge on a subset of the Google Conceptual
captions dataset which contains 100k images. On the basis of this comparison,
we observed that the best model was the Inception injected encoder model. This
best approach has been deployed as a web-based system. On uploading an image,
such a system will output the best caption associated with the image.

we examine pairs and small clusters of repulsively interacting point particles
in the limit where the dynamics is dominated by the Magnus force. We find that
particles with the same Magnus force can form stable pairs, triples and higher
ordered clusters or exhibit chaotic motion. For mixtures of particles with
opposite Magnus force, particle pairs can combine to form translating dipoles.
Under an applied drive, particles with the same Magnus force translate;
however, particles with different or opposite Magnus force exhibit a
drive-dependent decoupling transition. When the particles interact with a
repulsive obstacle, they can form localized orbits with depinning or unwinding
transitions under an applied drive. We examine the interaction of these
particles with clusters or lines of obstacles, and find that the particles can
become trapped in orbits that encircle multiple obstacles. Under an ac drive,
we observe a series of ratchet effects, including ratchet reversals, for
particles interacting with a line of obstacles due to the formation of
commensurate orbits. Finally, in assemblies of particles with mixed Magnus
forces of the same sign, we find that the particles with the largest Magnus
force become localized in the center of the cluster, while for mixtures with
opposite Magnus forces, the motion is dominated by transient local pairs or
clusters, where the translating pairs can be regarded as a form of active
matter.

local updates, locally trained models will be pulled back towards the
synchronized anchor model rather than communicating with others. Experimental
results of training a deep neural network on CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate the

distribution solves a degenerate parabolic equation that is dealt with by
defining a multidimensional cumulant generating function associated with the

importance of being able to describe the transient dynamics of adaptation to

kinematics using a kinematic model and a MCMC fitting procedure. The disk sizes
in H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ were found to be similar, at $\sim$10-12
$\mathrm{D_{\star}}$, which is uncommon since most results for Be stars show a
larger extension in H$\alpha$ than in Br$\gamma$. We found that the inclination
angle $i$ derived from H$\alpha$ is significantly lower ($\sim$15 deg) than the
one derived from Br$\gamma$. The disk kinematics were found to be near to the
Keplerian rotation in Br$\gamma$, but not in H$\alpha$. After analyzing all our
data using a grid of HDUST models (BeAtlas), we found a common physical
description for the disk in both lines: $\Sigma_{0}$ = 0.12 g
cm\textsuperscript{-2} and $m$ = 3.0. The stellar rotational rate was found to
be very close ($\sim$96\%) to the critical value. Our analysis of multi-epoch
H$\alpha$ profiles and imaging polarimetry indicates that the disk has been
stable for at least 20 years. Compared to Br$\gamma$, the data in H$\alpha$
shows a substantially different picture that cannot fully be understood using
the current physical models of Be star disks. $\omicron$ Aquarii presents a
stable disk, but the measured $m$ is lower than the standard value in the VDD
model for steady-state. Such long-term stability can be understood in terms of
the high rotational rate for this star, the rate being a main source for the
mass injection in the disk. Our results on the stellar rotation and disk
stability are consistent with results in the literature showing that late-type
Be stars are more likely to be fast rotators and have stable disks.

quintessential importance for understanding fundamental properties of these
materials and for the design of their applications. Although there are many
methods to measure the Frank constants in the nematic phase, little is known
about the elastic constants of the chiral version of the nematic, the so-called
cholesteric liquid crystal, since the helicoidal structure of the cholesteric
renders these methods inadequate. Here we present a technique to measure the
bend modulus $K_{33}$ of cholesterics that is based on the electrically tunable
reflection of light at an oblique helicoidal $Ch_{OH}$ cholesteric structure.
$K_{33}$ is typically smaller than 0.6 pN, showing a non-monotonous temperature
dependence with a slight increase near the transition to the twist-bend phase.
$K_{33}$ depends strongly on the molecular composition. In particular, chiral
mixtures that contain the flexible dimer 1'',7''-bis(4-cyanobiphenyl-4'-yl)
heptane (CB7CB) and rod-like molecules such as pentylcyanobiphenyl (5CB) show a
$K_{33}$ value that is 5 times smaller than $K_{33}$ of pure CB7CB or of
mixtures of CB7CB with chiral dopants. Furthermore, $K_{33}$ in CB11CB doped
with a chiral agent is noticeably smaller than $K_{33}$ in a similarly doped

toward next generation networks. This technology consists of hundreds of
antennas that are capable of sending and receiving simultaneously a huge amount
of data. One of the main challenges when using this technology is the necessity
of an efficient decoding framework. The latter must guarantee both a low
complexity and a good signal detection accuracy. The Sphere Decoder (SD)
algorithm represents one of the promising decoding algorithms in terms of
detection accuracy. However, it is inefficient for dealing with large MIMO
systems due to its prohibitive complexity. To overcome this drawback, we
propose to revisit the sequential SD algorithm and implement several variants
that aim at finding appropriate trade-offs between complexity and performance.
Then, we propose an efficient high-level parallel SD scheme based on the
master/worker paradigm, which permits multiple SD instances to simultaneously
explore the search space, while mitigating the overheads from load imbalance.
The results of our parallel SD implementation outperform the state-of-the-art
by more than 5x using similar MIMO configuration systems, and show a
super-linear speedup on multicore platforms. Moreover, this paper presents a
new hybrid implementation that combines the strengths of SD and K-best
algorithms, i.e., maintaining the detection accuracy of SD, while reducing the
complexity using the K-best way of pruning search space. The hybrid approach
extends our parallel SD implementation: the master contains the SD search tree,
and the workers use the K-best algorithm to accelerate its exploration. The
resulting hybrid approach enhances the diversification gain, and therefore,
lowers the overall complexity. Our synergistic hybrid approach permits to deal
with large MIMO configurations up to 100x100, without sacrificing the accuracy

transverse reinforcement. Such memories amongst engineers have promoted this
attitude that the shear walls structures exhibit a brittle overall performance.
So the conviction that shear walls are inherently brittle still prevails
amongst engineers, and therefore, they usually prefer to choose
moment-resisting RC frames without shear walls. For getting an insight into the
nonlinear behavior of RC shear walls, we have reviewed the experiments
conducted on the RC shear walls. Besides, through using the post-earthquake
reports written after major earthquakes, we have checked and scrutinized the
seismic performance of RC frames equipped with shear walls too. Investigations
performed on the nonlinear behavior of the shear walls have demonstrated that
slender shear walls, designed to fail in flexural mode, could safely dissipate
excitations energy of the earthquakes. These studies also revealed that even
squat shear walls can be designed in a way that their behavior would be similar
to those of the slender walls. Considering these matters, designed shear walls
according to the recent codes maintain sufficient shear strength and
respectable energy dissipation capability.

trapping inside a single vortex and motility-induced diffusion across many

swimming speed, we find that it exhibits surprisingly large oscillations as
this critical swimming speed is approached. Strikingly, at even higher swimming
speeds, we find swimmers that swim perpendicular to their elongation direction
can again become trapped. To explain this complex behavior, we investigate the
underlying swimmer phase-space geometry. We identify the fixed points and
periodic orbits of the swimmer equations of motion that regulate swimmer
trapping inside a single vortex cell. For low to intermediate swimming speeds,
we find that a stable periodic orbit surrounded by invariant tori forms a
transport barrier to swimmers and can trap them inside individual vortices. For
swimming speeds approaching the maximum fluid speed, we find instead that
perpendicular swimmers can be trapped by asymptotically stable fixed points. A
bifurcation analysis of the stable periodic orbit and the fixed points explains
the complex and non-monotonic breakdown and reemergence of swimmer trapping as

demonstrate on multiple classification tasks that using a large learning rate

However, recent research has demonstrated that many of these deep learning

need for defensive techniques to detect and mitigate these attacks before they

wings, eyes). For example, if an image is classified as ""bird"", but the
extracted features are wheel, saddle and frame, the model may be under attack.
UnMask detects such attacks and defends the model by rectifying the
misclassification, re-classifying the image based on its robust features. Our
extensive evaluation shows that UnMask (1) detects up to 96.75% of attacks, and

relevance of non-locomotory movements via animal-robot interactions. Coral
snakes (genus Micrurus) and their mimics use vigorous, non-locomotory, and
arrhythmic thrashing to deter predation. There is variation across snake
species in the duration and curvature of anti-predator thrashes, and it is
unclear how these aspects of motion interact to contribute to snake survival.
In this work, soft robots composed of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures
(FREEs) are developed to emulate the anti-predator behaviors of three genera of
snake. Curvature and duration of motion are estimated for both live snakes and
robots, providing a quantitative assessment of the robots' ability to emulate
snake poses. The curvature values of the fabricated soft-robotic head,
midsection, and tail segments are found to overlap with those exhibited by live
snakes. Soft robot motion durations were less than or equal to those of snakes
for all three genera. Additionally, combinations of segments were selected to
emulate three specific snake genera with distinct anti-predatory behavior,
producing curvature values that aligned well with live snake observations.

variety of applications. Scoring rules enable the evaluation of forecast
accuracy, and comparison between forecasting methods. We propose a theoretical
framework for scoring rules for multivariate distributions, which encompasses
the existing quadratic score and multivariate continuous ranked probability
score. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to generate new scoring
rules. In some multivariate contexts, it is a forecast of a level set that is
needed, such as a density level set for anomaly detection or the level set of
the cumulative distribution as a measure of risk. This motivates consideration
of scoring functions for such level sets. For univariate distributions, it is
well-established that the continuous ranked probability score can be expressed
as the integral over a quantile score. We show that, in a similar way, scoring
rules for multivariate distributions can be decomposed to obtain scoring
functions for level sets. Using this, we present scoring functions for
different types of level set, including density level sets and level sets for
cumulative distributions. To compute the scores, we propose a simple numerical
algorithm. We perform a simulation study to support our proposals, and we use
real data to illustrate usefulness for forecast combining and CoVaR estimation.

multi-task learning estimates the parameter of all tasks, which requires l to
grow with T . Instead, our efficient meta-learning estimator allows for l to be

adiabatic evolution to the corresponding ground state at size $L$, along with

decision is to make it understandable to its stakeholders. But without a
previous grasp of what it means to say that an agent understands a model or a
decision, the explanatory strategies will lack a well-defined goal. Aside from
providing a clearer objective for XAI, focusing on understanding also allows us
to relax the factivity condition on explanation, which is impossible to fulfill
in many machine learning models, and to focus instead on the pragmatic
conditions that determine the best fit between a model and the methods and
devices deployed to understand it. After an examination of the different types
of understanding discussed in the philosophical and psychological literature, I
conclude that interpretative or approximation models not only provide the best
way to achieve the objectual understanding of a machine learning model, but are
also a necessary condition to achieve post-hoc interpretability. This
conclusion is partly based on the shortcomings of the purely functionalist
approach to post-hoc interpretability that seems to be predominant in most

introducing an explicit angular dependence for the parameters of the elastic

aims to discriminate between different audio signal types and has received
intensive attention due to its wide applications. Generally speaking, the raw

Fourier Transform and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), and information
implied in different representations can be complementary. Ensembling the
models trained on different representations can greatly boost the
classification performance, however, making inference using a large number of

goal of intelligent dialogue agents. So far, most of the past works concentrate

making one response to one utterance each round. However, in real human-human
conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for
readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end
with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to
reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but
deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this
paper, we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to
help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly. Our
method has two imaginator modules and an arbitrator module. The two imaginators
will learn the agent's and user's speaking style respectively, generate
possible utterances as the input of the arbitrator, combining with dialogue
history. And the arbitrator decides whether to wait or to make a response to
the user directly. To verify the performance and effectiveness of our method,
we prepared two dialogue datasets and compared our approach with several

average power constraint on the mobility of the UAV. The problem is cast as a
semi-Markov decision process, and it is shown that the policy exhibits a
two-scale structure, which can be efficiently optimized: in the outer decision,
upon starting a communication phase, and given its current radius, the UAV
selects a target end radius position so as to optimally balance a trade-off
between average long-term communication delay and power consumption; in the
inner decision, the UAV selects its trajectory between the start radius and the
selected end radius, so as to greedily minimize the delay and energy
consumption to serve the current request. Numerical evaluations show that,
during waiting phases, the UAV circles at some optimal radius at the most
energy efficient speed, until a new request is received. Lastly, the expected
average communication delay and power consumption of the optimal policy is

from Fe I and Fe II lines show considerable discrepancies and oxygen abundances
determined from high-excitation O I 7771-5 triplet lines are appreciably
overestimated (the problem becoming more serious towards lower Teff), which
however has not yet been widely confirmed. With an aim to clarify this issue,
we spectroscopically determined the atmospheric parameters of 148 G-K dwarfs
(Hyades cluster stars and field stars) by assuming the classical Fe I/Fe II
ionization equilibrium as usual, and determined their oxygen abundances by
applying the non-LTE spectrum fitting analysis to O I 7771-5 lines. It turned
out that the resulting parameters did not show any significant inconsistency
with those determined by other methods (for example, the mean differences in
Teff and log g from the well-determined solutions of Hyades dwarfs are mostly
<~100K and <~0.1dex). Likewise, the oxygen abundances of Hyades stars are
around [O/H]~+0.2dex (consistent with the metallicity of this cluster) without
exhibiting any systematic Teff-dependence. Accordingly, we conclude that
parameters can be spectroscopically evaluated to a sufficient precision in the
conventional manner (based on the Saha-Boltzmann equation for Fe I/Fe II) and
oxygen abundances can be reliably determined from the O I 7771-5 triplet for K
dwarfs as far as stars of Teff>~4500K are concerned. We suspect that previously
reported strongly Teff-dependent discrepancies may have stemmed mainly from
overestimation of weak-line strengths and/or improper Teff scale.

success. Yet, it is known that these vanilla GDA algorithms with constant step
size can potentially diverge even in the convex setting. In this work, we show
that for a subclass of nonconvex-nonconcave objectives satisfying a so-called
two-sided Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, the alternating gradient descent
ascent (AGDA) algorithm converges globally at a linear rate and the stochastic
AGDA achieves a sublinear rate. We further develop a variance reduced algorithm
that attains a provably faster rate than AGDA when the problem has the
finite-sum structure.

sensor networks have drawn a widespread attention from both academia and
industry. However, designing a routing protocol for underwater sensor networks
is a great challenge due to high energy consumption and large latency in the
underwater environment. This paper proposes a Q-learning-based
localization-free anypath routing (QLFR) protocol to prolong the lifetime as
well as reduce the end-to-end delay for underwater sensor networks. Aiming at
optimal routing policies, the Q-value is calculated by jointly considering the
residual energy and depth information of sensor nodes throughout the routing
process. More specifically, we define two reward functions (i.e., depth-related
and energy-related rewards) for Q-learning with the objective of reducing
latency and extending network lifetime. In addition, a new holding time
mechanism for packet forwarding is designed according to the priority of
forwarding candidate nodes. Furthermore, a mathematical analysis is presented
to analyze the performance of the proposed routing protocol. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate the superiority performance of the proposed
routing protocol in terms of the end-to-end delay and the network lifetime.

We see that the families consisting of these self-similar collapsing solutions

Hamiltonian are also expressed by functions of the same parameter. Then, the
configurations at limit points of the parameter are in relative equilibria. For
the many-vortex problem, we investigate the point-vortex system with the help

point vortices have a uniform vortex strength, we show that families of
self-similar collapsing solutions continuously depend on the Hamiltonian and
the self-similar solutions asymptotically approach relative equilibria as the

Android plays a critical role due to being the most dominant platform in the

openness, which allows vendors to adopt and customize it. Similar to other
platforms, Android maintains security by providing monthly security patches and
announcing them via the Android security bulletin. To absorb this information
successfully across the Android ecosystem, impeccable coordination by many
different vendors is required.

vendors: Samsung, LG, and Huawei. In our analysis, we focus on the metadata of
these security bulletins (e.g., timing, affected layers, severity, and CWE

find that (i) the studied vendors in the Android ecosystem have adopted
different structures for vulnerability reporting, (ii) vendors are less likely
to react with delay for CVEs with Android Git repository references, (iii)
vendors handle Qualcomm-related CVEs differently from the rest of external

(e.g. likelihood-based) approaches. This may be in part due to a relative
absence of user-friendly implementations of Bayesian survival models. In this
article we describe how the rstanarm R package can be used to fit a wide range
of Bayesian survival models. The rstanarm package facilitates Bayesian
regression modelling by providing a user-friendly interface (users specify
their model using customary R formula syntax and data frames) and using the
Stan software (a C++ library for Bayesian inference) for the back-end
estimation. The suite of models that can be estimated using rstanarm is broad
and includes generalised linear models (GLMs), generalised linear mixed models
(GLMMs), generalised additive models (GAMs) and more. In this article we focus
only on the survival modelling functionality. This includes standard parametric
(exponential, Weibull, Gompertz) and flexible parametric (spline-based) hazard
models, as well as standard parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models.
All types of censoring (left, right, interval) are allowed, as is delayed entry
(left truncation), time-varying covariates, time-varying effects, and frailty
effects. We demonstrate the functionality through worked examples. We
anticipate these implementations will increase the uptake of Bayesian survival

have shown promising performances on several benchmarks, there is still a
significant performance gap between seen slot values (i.e., values that occur
in both training set and test set) and unseen ones (values that occur in

used in DST models to handle unseen slot values, which copies slot values from
user utterance directly. In this paper, we aim to find out the factors that
influence the generalization ability of a common copy-mechanism model for DST.
Our key observations include: 1) the copy-mechanism tends to memorize values
rather than infer them from contexts, which is the primary reason for
unsatisfactory generalization performance; 2) greater diversity of slot values
in the training set increase the performance on unseen values but slightly
decrease the performance on seen values. Moreover, we propose a simple but
effective algorithm of data augmentation to train copy-mechanism models, which
augments the input dataset by copying user utterances and replacing the real
slot values with randomly generated strings. Users could use two
hyper-parameters to realize a trade-off between the performances on seen values
and unseen ones, as well as a trade-off between overall performance and
computational cost. Experimental results on three widely used datasets (WoZ

complexity in deploying DL algorithms clinically is only increasing. To address
this, we propose a DL based 3D segmentation framework that is easily
translatable across OCT devices in a label-free manner (i.e. without the need
to manually re-segment data for each device). Specifically, we developed 2 sets
of DL networks. The first (referred to as the enhancer) was able to enhance OCT
image quality from 3 OCT devices, and harmonized image-characteristics across
these devices. The second performed 3D segmentation of 6 important ONH tissue
layers. We found that the use of the enhancer was critical for our segmentation
network to achieve device independency. In other words, our 3D segmentation
network trained on any of 3 devices successfully segmented ONH tissue layers
from the other two devices with high performance (Dice coefficients > 0.92).
With such an approach, we could automatically segment images from new OCT
devices without ever needing manual segmentation data from such devices.

the parameter estimation for drift parameter in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

we prove the strong consistency and the asympotic normality, and obtain the

deterministic population covariance matrices. With $n$ independent samples of
$(\mathbf C_1^{1/2}\mathbf x,\mathbf C_2^{1/2}\mathbf y)$, we study the sample
correlation between these two vectors using canonical correlation analysis. We
denote by $S_{xx}$ and $S_{yy}$ the sample covariance matrices for $\mathbf
C_1^{1/2}\mathbf x$ and $\mathbf C_2^{1/2}\mathbf y$, respectively, and
$S_{xy}$ the sample cross-covariance matrix. Then the sample canonical
correlation coefficients are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the sample
canonical correlation matrix $\cal C_{XY}:=S_{xx}^{-1}S_{xy}S_{yy}^{-1}S_{yx}$.
Under the high-dimensional setting with ${p}/{n}\to c_1 \in (0, 1)$ and
${q}/{n}\to c_2 \in (0, 1-c_1)$ as $n\to \infty$, we prove that the largest
eigenvalue of $\mathcal C_{XY}$ converges to the Tracy-Widom distribution as
long as we have $\lim_{s \rightarrow \infty}s^4 [\mathbb{P}(\vert x_{ij} \vert

[16], which established the Tracy-Widom limit of the largest eigenvalue of
$\mathcal C_{XY}$ under the assumption that all moments are finite. Our proof
is based on a linearization method, which reduces the problem to the study of a
$(p+q+2n)\times (p+q+2n)$ random matrix $H$. In particular, we shall prove an
optimal local law on its inverse $G:=H^{-1}$, i.e the resolvent. This local law
is the main tool for both the proof of the Tracy-Widom law in this paper, and

algorithm for nonlinear switched systems subject to minimum dwell time
constraints (MTC). While MTC are required for most physical systems due to
stability, power and mechanical restrictions, MPC optimization problems with
MTC are challenging to solve. To efficiently solve such problems, the on-line
MPC optimization problem is decomposed into a sequence of simpler problems,
which include two nonlinear programs (NLP) and a rounding step, as typically
done in mixed-integer optimal control (MIOC). Unlike the classical approach
that embeds MTC in a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with combinatorial
constraints in the rounding step, our proposal is to embed the MTC in one of
the NLPs using move blocking. Such a formulation can speedup on-line
computations by employing recent move blocking algorithms for NLP problems and
by using a simple sum-up-rounding (SUR) method for the rounding step. An
explicit upper bound of the integer approximation error for the rounding step
is given. In addition, a combined shrinking and receding horizon strategy is
developed to satisfy closed-loop MTC. Recursive feasibility is proven using a
$l$-step control invariant ($l$-CI) set, where $l$ is the minimum dwell time
step length. An algorithm to compute $l$-CI sets for switched linear systems
off-line is also presented. Numerical studies show significant speed-up and
comparable control performance of the proposed MPC algorithm against the
classical approach, though at the cost of sub-optimal solutions.

atomic dipoles as well as for driving laser pulses of arbitrary strength,
includes the far-field coupling between the dipoles, which prevails in dilute
ensembles, and effectively incorporates atomic motion via a disorder average.
We show that collective decay processes -- which were ignored in previous
treatments employing the electrostatic form of dipolar interactions -- play a
key role in the emergence of MQC signals.

that physically relocalizes a light source to reproduce the lighting condition
from single reference image for a same scene, which may suffer from
fine-grained changes during twice observations. ALR is of great importance for
fine-grained visual inspection and change detection, because some phenomena or
minute changes can only be clearly observed under particular lighting
conditions. Therefore, effective ALR should be able to online navigate a light
source toward the target pose, which is challenging due to the complexity and
diversity of real-world lighting and imaging processes. To this end, we propose
to use the simple parallel lighting as an analogy model and based on Lambertian
law to compose an instant navigation ball for this purpose. We theoretically
prove the feasibility, i.e., equivalence and convergence, of this ALR approach
for realistic near point light source and small near surface light source.
Besides, we also theoretically prove the invariance of our ALR approach to the
ambiguity of normal and lighting decomposition. The effectiveness and
superiority of the proposed approach have been verified by both extensive
quantitative experiments and challenging real-world tasks on fine-grained
change detection of cultural heritages. We also validate the generality of our

where passengers may reserve (book-ahead) a ride in advance of their trip.
Reservations give platforms precise information that describes the start time
and location of anticipated future trips; in turn, platforms can use this
information to adjust the availability and spatial distribution of the driver
supply. In this article, we propose a framework for modeling/analyzing
reservations in time-varying stochastic ridesourcing systems. We consider that
the driver supply is distributed over a network of geographic regions and that
book-ahead rides have reach time priority over non-reserved rides. First, we
propose a state-dependent admission control policy that assigns drivers to
passengers; this policy ensures that the reach time service requirement would
be attained for book-ahead rides. Second, given the admission control policy
and reservations information in each region, we predict the ``target"" number of
drivers that is required (in the future) to probabilistically guarantee the
reach time service requirement for stochastic non-reserved rides. Third, we
propose a reactive dispatching/rebalancing mechanism that determines the
adjustments to the driver supply that are needed to maintain the targets across
regions. For a specific reach time quality of service, simulation results using
data from Lyft rides in Manhattan exhibit how the number of idle drivers
decreases with the fraction of book-ahead rides. We also observe that the
non-stationary demand (ride request) rate varies significantly across time;
this rapid variation further illustrates that time-dependent models are needed
for operational analysis of ridesourcing systems.

of sequence of the constituent functional groups on aggregate conformation is
also studied by considering random and block sequences along the polymer
backbone.Our results suggest that block binary copolymers form large spherical
aggregates with effective shielding of hydrophobic groups by charged groups.In
contrast, random binary copolymers tend to form more bundle-like structures
with exposed hydrophobic groups.The strong aggregation of binary polymers is
driven primarily by attractive interactions between hydrophobic
groups.However,replacing some of the hydrophobic groups with overall charge
neutral polar groups weakens the aggregate considerably, leading to increased
conformational fluctuations and formation of loose-packed,open
aggregates,particularly in case of random ternary polymers.Interaction energy
calculations strongly suggest that the role of inclusion of polar groups is
two-fold: (1)to reduce possible strong local concentration of hydrophobic
groups and smear the hydrophobicity along the polymer backbone to increase the
solubility of the polymers (2)to compensate the loss of attractive hydrophobic
interactions by forming attractive electrostatic interactions with charged
groups and contribute to aggregation formation,albeit weak.Given that most of
the naturally occurring AM peptides have contributions from all the three
functional groups,this study elucidates the functionally tuneable role of
inclusion of polar groups in the way AM agents interact with each other in

average of the function over a ball is equal to its value at the center. This
fact naturally raises the question on whether this is a characterizing feature
of balls, namely whether a set for which all harmonic functions satisfy the
mean value property is necessarily a ball.
  This question was investigated by several authors, and was finally elegantly,
completely and positively settled by \""Ulk\""u Kuran, with an artful use of
elementary techniques.
  This classical problem has been recently fleshed out by Giovanni Cupini,
Nicola Fusco, Ermanno Lanconelli and Xiao Zhong who proved a quantitative
stability result for the mean value formula, showing that a suitable ""mean
value gap"" (measuring the normalized difference between the average of harmonic
functions on a given set and their pointwise value) is bounded from below by
the Lebesgue measure of the ""gap"" between the set and the ball (and,
consequently, by the Fraenkel asymmetry of the set). That is, if a domain
""almost"" satisfies the mean value property, then it must be necessarily close
to a ball.
  Here we investigate the nonlocal counterparts of these results. In particular
we will prove a classification result and a stability result, establishing
that: if fractional harmonic functions enjoy a suitable exterior average
property for a given domain, then the domain is necessarily a ball, a suitable
""nonlocal mean value gap"" is bounded from below by an appropriate measure of
the difference between the set and the ball. Differently from the classical
case, some of our arguments rely on purely nonlocal properties, with no
classical counterpart, such as the fact that ""all functions are locally
fractional harmonic up to a small error"".

significantly reduce the communication traffic on the worker. We theoretically

computing field as a fundamental component of urban management system. The most
challenging part of predicting crowd flow is to measure the complicated
spatial-temporal dependencies. A prevalent solution employed in current methods
is to divide and conquer the spatial and temporal information by various
architectures (e.g., CNN/GCN, LSTM). However, this strategy has two
disadvantages: (1) the sophisticated dependencies are also divided and
therefore partially isolated; (2) the spatial-temporal features are transformed
into latent representations when passing through different architectures,
making it hard to interpret the predicted crowd flow. To address these issues,
we propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (STSAN) with an ST
encoding gate that calculates the entire spatial-temporal representation with
positional and time encodings and therefore avoids dividing the dependencies.
Furthermore, we develop a Multi-aspect attention mechanism that applies scaled
dot-product attention over spatial-temporal information and measures the
attention weights that explicitly indicate the dependencies. Experimental
results on traffic and mobile data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces
inflow and outflow RMSE by 16% and 8% on the Taxi-NYC dataset compared to the

how to identify the azimuthal index associated with the conventional LG beam

be formed, due to the periodic variation of the absorption spectrum. Then,
asymmetrical Laguerre-Gaussian beams are used to extend the selective spatial
transparency mechanism to asymmetric spatially-structured windows, allowing for
optical manipulation of spatial modes at arbitrary positions. Moreover, we
investigate the influence of the asymmetric parameter on the features of the

the complementary information from multimodal data. However, in clinical
practice, we often encounter the problem of missing imaging modalities. We
tackle this challenge and propose a novel multimodal segmentation framework
which is robust to the absence of imaging modalities. Our network uses feature
disentanglement to decompose the input modalities into the modality-specific
appearance code, which uniquely sticks to each modality, and the
modality-invariant content code, which absorbs multimodal information for the
segmentation task. With enhanced modality-invariance, the disentangled content
code from each modality is fused into a shared representation which gains
robustness to missing data. The fusion is achieved via a learning-based
strategy to gate the contribution of different modalities at different
locations. We validate our method on the important yet challenging multimodal
brain tumor segmentation task with the BRATS challenge dataset. With
competitive performance to the state-of-the-art approaches for full modality,
our method achieves outstanding robustness under various missing modality(ies)
situations, significantly exceeding the state-of-the-art method by over 16% in

surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body
out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a
challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against
depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like
boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood.
Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth
obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study
discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to
stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait
and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to
understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third
of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more
likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent
in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot
roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing
speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved
high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching
snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.

and age resolution. It reveals that star formation has proceeded in sharp
bursts separated by periods of low-level or quiescent activity. The SFH was
derived through colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting of two extremely deep
Hubble Space Telescope CMDs, sampling the centre and one core radius. The
attained age resolution allowed us to single out a major star formation episode
at early times, a second strong burst $4.6\pm0.4$ Gyr ago and recent
intermittent episodes $\sim2-0.2$ Gyr ago. Detailed testing with mock stellar
populations was used to estimate the duration of the main bursts and study the
occurrence of low-level star formation between them. The SFHs in both regions
show common features, with activity at the same epochs and similar
age-metallicity relationship. However, clear indications of a spatial gradient
were also found, with mean age increasing with radius and star formation
episodes being more prolonged in the centre. While some galaxy evolution models
predict bursty SFHs in dwarf galaxies and thus a secular origin of the observed
SFH cannot be excluded in Fornax, other evidence points to possible mergers or
interactions as the cause of its bursty SFH. In particular, we calculated the
Fornax orbit relative to the closest dwarfs and the Milky Way and observed a
correspondence between the main intermediate-age and young events and
peri-passages of Fornax around the Milky Way, possibly indicating
tidally-induced star formation.

has promised to deliver room temperature structures at near-atomic resolution,
there have been significant experimental hurdles in collecting data of
sufficient quality and quantity to achieve this goal. This paper describes two
ways to modify the conventional methodology which significantly ease the
experimental challenges, at the cost of additional computational complexity in
the reconstruction procedure. Both these methods involve the use of holographic

Control (MPC) provides an opportunity to exploit the surplus of data reliably,

strategy, for instance, execution from a human operator. The objective of this
work is to improve upon this unknown, safe but suboptimal policy by learning a
new controller that retains safety and stability. Learning how to be safe is
achieved directly from data and from a knowledge of the system constraints. The
proposed algorithm alternatively learns the terminal cost and updates the MPC
parameters according to a stability metric. The terminal cost is constructed as
a Lyapunov function neural network with the aim of recovering or extending the
stable region of the initial demonstrator using a short prediction horizon.
Theorems that characterize the stability and performance of the learned MPC in
the bearing of model uncertainties and sub-optimality due to function

demonstrated on non-linear continuous control tasks with soft constraints. The

flows with non-resonant n-tuple Hopf singularity. The analysis is involved with
CW complex bifurcations of flow-invariant Clifford hypertori, where we refer to
these toral manifolds by toral CW complexes. We observe from primary to
tertiary flow-invariant toral CW complex bifurcations for one-parametric
systems associated with two most generic cases. In a particular case, a
tertiary toral CW complex bifurcates from and resides outside a secondary toral
CW complex. When the parameter varies, the secondary internal toral CW complex
collapses with the origin. However, the tertiary external toral CW complex
continues to live even after the secondary internal toral manifold disappears.
Our analysis starts with a flow-invariant primary cell-decomposition of the
state space. Each open cell admits a secondary cell-decomposition via a smooth
flow-invariant foliation. Each leaf of the foliations is a minimal
flow-invariant realization of the state space configuration for all Eulerian
flows with n-tuple Hopf singularities. Permissible leaf-vector field preserving
transformations are introduced via a Lie algebra structure for nonlinear vector
fields on the leaf-manifold. Complete parametric leaf-normal form
classification is provided for singular leaf-flows. Leaf-bifurcation analysis
of leaf-normal forms are performed for three most leaf-generic cases associated
with one to three unfolding bifurcation-parameters. Leaf-bifurcation varieties
are derived. Leaf-bifurcations provides a venue for cell-bifurcation control of
invariant toral CW complexes. The results are implemented and verified using
Maple for practical bifurcation control of such parametric nonlinear
oscillators.

a paradigm shift in the performance and behavior of certain algorithms,
achieving previously unattainable results. Machine learning (kernel
classification) has become ubiquitous as the forefront method for pattern
recognition and has been shown to have numerous societal applications. While
not yet fault-tolerant, Quantum computing is an entirely new method of
computation due to its exploitation of quantum phenomena such as superposition
and entanglement. While current machine learning classifiers like the Support
Vector Machine are seeing gradual improvements in performance, there are still
severe limitations on the efficiency and scalability of such algorithms due to
a limited feature space which makes the kernel functions computationally
expensive to estimate. By integrating quantum circuits into traditional ML, we
may solve this problem through the use of quantum feature space, a technique
that improves existing Machine Learning algorithms through the use of
parallelization and the reduction of the storage space from exponential to
linear. This research expands on this concept of the Hilbert space and applies
it for classical machine learning by implementing the quantum-enhanced version
of the K nearest neighbors algorithm. This paper first understands the
mathematical intuition for the implementation of quantum feature space and
successfully simulates quantum properties and algorithms like Fidelity and
Grover's Algorithm via the Qiskit python library and the IBM Quantum Experience
platform. The primary experiment of this research is to build a noisy
variational quantum circuit KNN (QKNN) which mimics the classification methods
of a traditional KNN classifier. The QKNN utilizes the distance metric of
Hamming Distance and is able to outperform the existing KNN on a 10-dimensional

however, not much attention has been paid to attention mechanisms, an emerging
neural network primitive that enables neural networks to retrieve most relevant
information from a knowledge-base, external memory, or past states. The
attention mechanism is widely adopted by many state-of-the-art neural networks
for computer vision, natural language processing, and machine translation, and
accounts for a large portion of total execution time. We observe today's
practice of implementing this mechanism using matrix-vector multiplication is
suboptimal as the attention mechanism is semantically a content-based search
where a large portion of computations ends up not being used. Based on this
observation, we design and architect A3, which accelerates attention mechanisms
in neural networks with algorithmic approximation and hardware specialization.
Our proposed accelerator achieves multiple orders of magnitude improvement in
energy efficiency (performance/watt) as well as substantial speedup over the

various prediction tasks, such as computer vision and medical image analysis.
Their great predictive power requires extensive computation, which encourages
model owners to host the prediction service in a cloud platform. Recent
researches focus on the privacy of the query and results, but they do not
provide model privacy against the model-hosting server and may leak partial
information about the results. Some of them further require frequent
interactions with the querier or heavy computation overheads, which discourages
querier from using the prediction service. This paper proposes a new scheme for
privacy-preserving neural network prediction in the outsourced setting, i.e.,
the server cannot learn the query, (intermediate) results, and the model.
Similar to SecureML (S&P'17), a representative work that provides model
privacy, we leverage two non-colluding servers with secret sharing and triplet
generation to minimize the usage of heavyweight cryptography. Further, we adopt
asynchronous computation to improve the throughput, and design garbled circuits
for the non-polynomial activation function to keep the same accuracy as the
underlying network (instead of approximating it). Our experiments on MNIST

decreasing interpretability, and potentially leading to reduced precision. Here
we develop a novel continuous-time multi-state model that can be regarded as an

inference is carried out by regarding the capture-recapture data as
realisations from a continuous-time hidden Markov model, which allows the

we use a long-term survey of bottlenose dolphins where capture occasion are not

charge can be stable or unstable depending on its geometry. When the
electrodynamic body is perturbed from a state of rest, it starts to perform
fast oscillations, irrespective of the frequency of the perturbation. This
nonlinear oscillation is the result of the feedback interaction between
Coulombian and radiative fields. The resulting spontaneous symmetry breaking of
the Lorentz group implies that the principle of inertia only holds on average
and suggests that the default state of matter is not necessarily uniform
motion, but self-oscillation as well. We propose that the excitability of
electrodynamic bodies under external perturbations, which leads to limit cycle
oscillations, is at the basis of the wave particle duality and its related
quantum effects.

  Learning","7 pages,3 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial Label Learning (PLL) aims to train a classifier when each training
instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is
correct but is not accessible during the training phase. The common strategy
dealing with such ambiguous labeling information is to disambiguate the
candidate label sets. Nonetheless, existing methods ignore the disambiguation
difficulty of instances and adopt the single-trend training mechanism. The
former would lead to the vulnerability of models to the false positive labels
and the latter may arouse error accumulation problem. To remedy these two
drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel approach termed ""Network Cooperation
with Progressive Disambiguation"" (NCPD) for PLL. Specifically, we devise a
progressive disambiguation strategy of which the disambiguation operations are
performed on simple instances firstly and then gradually on more complicated
ones. Therefore, the negative impacts brought by the false positive labels of
complicated instances can be effectively mitigated as the disambiguation
ability of the model has been strengthened via learning from the simple
instances. Moreover, by employing artificial neural networks as the backbone,
we utilize a network cooperation mechanism which trains two networks
collaboratively by letting them interact with each other. As two networks have
different disambiguation ability, such interaction is beneficial for both
networks to reduce their respective disambiguation errors, and thus is much
better than the existing algorithms with single-trend training process.
Extensive experimental results on various benchmark and practical datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our NCPD to other state-of-the-art PLL methods.

critical interval depends on the material parameters. For the stochastic

in linear regime show that as the Universe evolves, matter density
perturbations grow and reach a maximum value at a certain redshift after which
these perturbations start decreasing towards a finite positive value at the

also found representing that matter perturbations could experience either
overdense and underdense regions during the dynamical evolution of the

perturbations grow much faster than the linear one and diverges at a critical
redshift. However, the formation of collapsed structures is delayed as compared

decouple a class of popular pretext tasks into a combination of view data

(original view) through the same tasks on the augmented views. SSL-MV focuses
on VDA while abandons VLC, empirically uncovering that it is VDA rather than
generally considered VLC that dominates the performance of such SSL.
Additionally, thanks to replacing VLC with VDA tasks, SSL-MV also enables an
integrated inference combining the predictions from the augmented views,

quantum eigenvalue problem into smaller subdomains that are referred to as
elements. These elements could be the building blocks for quantum structures of
interest. Each of the elements is projected onto a functional space represented
by a reduced order model, which leads to a quantum Hamiltonian equation in the
functional space for each element. The basis functions in this study is
generated from proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). To construct a POD model
for a large domain, these projected elements are combined together, and the
interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is applied to stabilize the
numerical solution and to achieve the interface continuity. The POD is able to
optimize the basis functions (or POD modes) specifically tailored to the
geometry and parametric variations of the problem and can therefore
substantially reduce the degree of freedom (DoF) needed to solve the
Schr\""odinger equation. The proposed multi-element POD model (or QEM) is
demonstrated in several quantum-well structures with a focus on understanding
how to achieve accurate prediction of WFs with a small numerical DoF. It has

Film-Bulk-Acoustic-Resonators (FBARs), to achieve a wideband and low-loss
frequency response. As the resonance frequency of FBARs is set by their
thickness, the integration of multiple FBARs, to form filters, can only be
attained through the adoption of frequency tuning fabrication steps, such as
mass loading or trimming. However, as the ability to reliably control these
steps significantly decays for thinner FBARs, manufacturing FBARs-based
filters, addressing the needs of emerging IoT and 5G high-frequency
applications, is becoming more and more challenging. Consequently, there is a
quest for new acoustic resonant components, simultaneously exhibiting high kt2
and a lithographic frequency tunability. In this work, a novel class of AlN
resonators is presented. These radio-frequency devices, labelled as
Two-Dimensional-Resonant-Rods (2DRRs), exploit, for the first time, the
unconventional acoustic behavior exhibited by a forest of locally resonant
rods, built in the body of a profiled AlN layer that is sandwiched between a
bottom un-patterned metal plate and a top metallic grating. 2DRRs exhibit
unexplored modal features that make them able to achieve high kt2, a
significant lithographic frequency tunability and a relaxed lithographic
resolution, while relying on an optimal AlN crystalline orientation. The
operation of 2DRRs is discussed, in this work, by means of analytical and
finite-element (FE) investigations. The measured performance of the first
fabricated 2DRR, showing a kt2 in excess of 7.4%, are also reported.
