physical understanding and still is a promising tool for the investigation of
new physics. Molecules offer transitions which allow tests that are not
possible in atomic systems. However, usually precision spectroscopy of
molecules is challenging due to the lack of cycling transitions for state
preparation and state detection. For molecular ions, this obstacle can be
overcome by quantum logic spectroscopy, where dissipation for state preparation
and detection is provided by a co-trapped atomic ion exploiting the shared
eigenstates of motion. Here, we propose a full quantum logic spectroscopy
scheme for molecular oxygen ions and theoretically investigate the feasibility
of quantum logic assisted state detection and preparation. Furthermore, we
provide coupling rates for a direct single-photon quadrupole excitation of a
vibrational overtone transition that can serve as a sensitive transition for
tests of a possible variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.

account the fluctuations of the direction of the large-scale component of the
wall friction. This effect is found to be significant. It explains the large
sensitivity of the fluctuations of longitudinal and spanwise velocities to
variations in the Reynolds number in comparison with the sensitivity of the
mean velocity, the Reynolds stress, and the wall-normal velocity fluctuations.
The analysis shows that the variation of the longitudinal velocity fluctuations
with the Reynolds number is dominated by the variation of the amplitude and
wall-normal-scale modulation of the universal mean velocity profile by the
outer, large-scale, Reynolds-number-dependent motions. The variation of
spanwise velocity fluctuations is dominated by the fluctuations of the
direction of the large-scale component of the wall friction. The Reynolds
number dependence of the other second moments is not dominated by these
mechanisms because the mean wall-normal velocity and the mean spanwise velocity
are zero. Explicit relationships between the differences in the second moments
of velocity in any two high-Reynolds-number near-wall flows were derived. The
comparisons gave a satisfactory agreement for the root-mean square of the
wall-parallel velocity components in the range of the distances from the wall
where modulation by large-scale motions dominates. Relationships between the
differences of the constants of the logarithmic law, the shape of the mean
velocity profile, and the differences of the second moments of velocity caused
by the differences in large-scale motions were derived and estimated
quantitatively.

energy dependent; this is in contrast with the the normal state, where the
relevant time scale is the mean free time $\tau_e$, independent of energy. The
energy dependence introduces a novel energy scale $\varepsilon_*$, which in
disordered superconductors ($\tau_e \Delta\ll 1$, with $\Delta$ the gap) is
given by $\varepsilon_* = \sqrt{\Delta/\tau_e}$. From the diffusive behavior of

$\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow$; their relative energies depend strongly on the
Coulomb interaction, magnetic field, and interlayer bias. We treat interactions
at the Hartree-Fock level, including the effects of metallic gates, layer
separation, spatial extent of the $p_z$ orbitals, all Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure
tight-binding parameters, and pressure. We obtain the ground state as function
of the applied magnetic field, bias, and pressure. The gates, layer separation
and extent of the $p_z$ orbitals weaken the Coulomb interaction at different
length scales; these effects distort the phase diagram but do not change its
topology. However, previously-predicted continuous transitions become
discontinuous when all tight-binding parameters are included nonperturbatively.
We find that pressure increases the importance of the noninteracting scale with
respect to the Coulomb energy, which drives phase transitions to occur at lower
fields. This brings two orbitally polarized states not yet predicted or

building block for more complex operations. That is why a lot of effort has
been put into finding sorting algorithms that sort large sets as fast as
possible. But the more sophisticated and complex the algorithms become, the
less efficient they are for small sets of items due to large constant factors.
We aim to determine if there is a faster way than insertion sort to sort small
sets of items to provide a more efficient base case sorter. We looked at
sorting networks, at how they can improve the speed of sorting few elements,
and how to implement them in an efficient manner by using conditional moves.
Since sorting networks need to be implemented explicitly for each set size,
providing networks for larger sizes becomes less efficient due to increased
code sizes. To also enable the sorting of slightly larger base cases, we
adapted sample sort to Register Sample Sort, to break down those larger sets
into sizes that can in turn be sorted by sorting networks. From our experiments
we found that when sorting only small sets, the sorting networks outperform
insertion sort by a factor of at least 1.76 for any array size between six and
sixteen, and by a factor of 2.72 on average across all machines and array
sizes. When integrating sorting networks as a base case sorter into Quicksort,
we achieved far less performance improvements, which is probably due to the
networks having a larger code size and cluttering the L1 instruction cache. But
for x86 machines with a larger L1 instruction cache of 64 KiB or more, we
obtained speedups of 12.7% when using sorting networks as a base case sorter in
std::sort. In conclusion, the desired improvement in speed could only be
achieved under special circumstances, but the results clearly show the
potential of using conditional moves in the field of sorting algorithms.

variety of new inference methods for reconstructing the detailed evolutionary
history of various cancers. This brings the need of designing efficient
procedures for comparing rooted trees representing the evolution of mutations
in tumor phylogenies. Bernardini et al. [CPM 2019] recently introduced a notion
of the rearrangement distance for fully-labelled trees motivated by this
necessity. This notion originates from two operations: one that permutes the
labels of the nodes, the other that affects the topology of the tree. Each
operation alone defines a distance that can be computed in polynomial time,
while the actual rearrangement distance, that combines the two, was proven to
be NP-hard.
  We answer two open question left unanswered by the previous work. First, what
is the complexity of computing the permutation distance? Second, is there a
constant-factor approximation algorithm for estimating the rearrangement
distance between two arbitrary trees? We answer the first one by showing, via a
two-way reduction, that calculating the permutation distance between two trees
on $n$ nodes is equivalent, up to polylogarithmic factors, to finding the
largest cardinality matching in a sparse bipartite graph. In particular, by
plugging in the algorithm of Liu and Sidford [ArXiv 2020], we obtain an
$O(n^{4/3+o(1)})$ time algorithm for computing the permutation distance between
two trees on $n$ nodes. Then we answer the second question positively, and
design a linear-time constant-factor approximation algorithm that does not need
any assumption on the trees.

tension (HT), which is the difference between values of the present Hubble
constant, measured by observation of the universe at redshift $z \lesssim 1$,
and by observations of a distant universe with CMB fluctuations originated at
$z \sim 1100$. In this paper we suggest, that this discrepancy may be explained
by deviation of the cosmological expansion from a standard Lambda-CDM %simple
Friedman model of a flat universe, during the period after recombination at $z
\lesssim 1100$, due to action of additional variable component of a dark energy
of different origin.. We suppose, that a dark matter (DM) has a common origin
with a variable component of a dark energy (DEV). DE presently may have two
components, one of which is the Einstein constant $\Lambda$, and another,
smaller component DEV ($\Lambda_V$) comes from the remnants of a scalar fields
responsible for inflation. Due to common origin and interconnections the
densities of DEV and DM are supposed to be connected, and remain almost
constant during, at least, the time after recombination, when we may
approximate $\rho_{DM}=\alpha \rho_{DEV}$. This part of the dark energy in not
connected with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, but is defined by existence
of scalar fields with a variable density. Taking into account the influence of
DEV on the universe expansion we find the value of $\alpha$ which could remove
the HT problem. In order to maintain the almost constant DEV/DM energy density
ratio during the time interval at $z<1100$, we suggest an existence of a wide
mass DM particle distribution.

$n- \bar n$ transition which is not induced by direct mass mixing
$\epsilon_{n\bar n}$ but is mediated instead by the neutron mixings with the
hypothetical states of mirror neutron $n'$ and mirror antineutron $\bar{n}'$.
The latter can be as large as $\epsilon_{nn'}, \epsilon_{n\bar{n}'} \sim
10^{-15}$ eV or so, without contradicting present experimental limits and
nuclear stability bounds. The probabilities of $n-n'$ and $n-\bar{n}'$
transitions, $P_{nn'}$ and $P_{n\bar{n}'}$, depend on environmental conditions
in mirror sector, and they can be resonantly amplified by applying the magnetic
field of the proper value. This opens up a possibility of $n-\bar n$ transition
with the probability $P_{n\bar n} \simeq P_{nn'} P_{n\bar{n}'}$ which can reach
the values $\sim 10^{-8} $ or even larger. For finding this effect in real
experiments, the magnetic field should not be suppressed but properly varied.
These mixings can be induced by new physics at the scale of few TeV which may
also originate a new low scale co-baryogenesis mechanism between ordinary and

activities are one of the major water challenges in the contamination legacy.
Triclosan is an emerging contaminant, commonly used as antibacterial agent in
personal care products. Triclosan is stable, lipophilic and it is proved to
have ecotoxicologic effects in organics. This induces great concern since its
elimination in wastewater treatment plants is not efficient and its by-products
(e.g. methyl-triclosan, 2,4-dichlorophenol or 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) are even
more hazardous to several environmental compartments. This work provides
understanding of two different electrochemical reactors for the degradation of
triclosan and its derivative by-products in effluent. A batch reactor and a
flow reactor (mimicking a secondary settling tank in a wastewater treatment
plant) were tested with two different working anodes: Ti/MMO and Nb/BDD. The
degradation efficiency and kinetics were evaluated to find the best combination
of current density, electrodes and set-up design. For both reactors the best
electrode combination was achieved with Ti/MMO as anode. The batch reactor at 7
mA/cm2 during 4 h attained degradation rates below the detection limit for
triclosan and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and, 94% and 43% for 2,4-dichlorophenol and
methyl triclosan, respectively. The flow reactor obtained, in approximately 1
h, degradation efficiencies between 41% and 87% for the four contaminants. This
study suggests an alternative technology for emerging organic contaminants
degradation, since the combination of a low current density with the flow and
matrix induced disturbance increases and speeds up the compounds elimination in
a real environmental matrix.

drawback in the application of RNN-based policies is the difficulty in
providing formal guarantees on the satisfaction of behavioral specifications,
e.g. safety and/or reachability. By integrating techniques from formal methods

finite-state controller (FSC) from an RNN, which, when composed with a
finite-state system model, is amenable to existing formal verification tools.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative modification to the so-called quantized
bottleneck insertion technique to create an FSC as a randomized policy with
memory. For the cases in which the resulting FSC fails to satisfy the
specification, verification generates diagnostic information. We utilize this
information to either adjust the amount of memory in the extracted FSC or
perform focused retraining of the RNN. While generally applicable, we detail
the resulting iterative procedure in the context of policy synthesis for
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which is known to be
notoriously hard. The numerical experiments show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional POMDP synthesis methods by 3 orders of magnitude within

for biologically inspired learning rules for RSNNs to improve our understanding
of brain computation and the efficiency of artificial intelligence. Several
spiking models and learning rules have been proposed, but it remains a
challenge to design RSNNs whose learning relies on biologically plausible
mechanisms and are capable of solving complex temporal tasks. In this paper, we
derive a learning rule, local to the synapse, from a simple mathematical
principle, the maximization of the likelihood for the network to solve a
specific task. We propose a novel target-based learning scheme in which the
learning rule derived from likelihood maximization is used to mimic a specific
spiking pattern that encodes the solution to complex temporal tasks. This
method makes the learning extremely rapid and precise, outperforming state of

locality in time and space, allows learning after very few presentations of the

  Properties of Ultrathin FeRh Films Capped with Heavy Transition Metal Ta","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thin FeRh film was extensively studied recently, and an emergent substrate-
and capping-dependent interfacial ferromagnetism (FM) was widely observed in
experiments. However, the voltage modulation of this interfacial ferromagnetism
is barely studied, which would have profound applications in antiferromagnetic
(AFM) FeRh-based magnetoelectric-random access memory (MeRAM). Using ab initio
techniques, we comparatively study the interfacial ferromagnetic properties and
magnetoelectric responses of ultrathin FeRh films capped by heavy transition
metal Ta. We find that Ta capping reverses the phase stability of ultrathin
FeRh film below 1.5 nm and gigantically stabilizes the ferromagnetic phase and
interfacial ferromagnetism. Besides, small magnetic moment of 2.2 $\mu_B$ for
neighboring Fe atoms, regardless of magnetic configurations and film thickness,
is induced by Ta capping. Compared with FeRh/MgO bilayers, magnetic
anisotropies (in-plane for AFM, perpendicular for FM and interfacial-FM
reconstructed trilayers) and magnetoelectric responses of these trilayers are
enhanced. Furthermore, the VCMA behavior in FM phase is changed from
$\vee$-shaped to linear. These findings demonstrate the manipulation of
magnetic ordering of FeRh films with heavy metal capping and electric field and
can promote the application of FeRh alloy in magnetic memory and
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

multi-grating solutions with three or more gratings that can be designed to

the number density and the governing power law parameter of an ensemble of

model for the histogram of amplitudes from speckle regions, and the parameters
track the underlying conditions. These results are also tested in a more
general model of rat liver scans in normal vs. abnormal conditions, and the

classical Burr distribution may be useful in the quantification of scattering
of ultrasound from soft vascularized tissues.

differences in the echoes produced by different classes of reflectors or
scatterers. Matched filters can be created for different types of scatterers,
whereby the maximum output indicates a match and color schemes can be used to
indicate the class of scatterer responsible for echoes, providing a visual
interpretation of the results. However, within the theory of weak scattering
from a variety of shapes, small changes in the size of the inhomogeneous
objects will create shifts in the scattering transfer function. In this paper,
we determine the shift in center frequency, along with time and frequency
domain characteristics of echoes and argue for a general power law transfer
function to capture the major characteristics of scattering types. With this
general approach, the H-scan matched filters can be set to elicit more fine
grain shifts in scattering types, commensurate with more subtle changes in
tissue morphology. Compensation for frequency dependent attenuation is helpful
for avoiding beam softening effects with increasing depths. Examples from
phantoms and normal and pathological tissues are provided to demonstrate that

tool for exploring quantum chaos and also recently, there has been a classical
analogue. Studies have been limited to closed systems. In this work, we probe
an open classical many-body system, more specifically, a spatially extended
driven dissipative chain of coupled Duffing oscillators using the classical
OTOC to investigate the spread and growth (decay) of an initially localized
perturbation in the chain. Correspondingly, we find three distinct types of
dynamical behavior, namely the sustained chaos, transient chaos and non-chaotic
region, as clearly exhibited by different geometrical shapes in the heat map of
OTOC. To quantify such differences, we look at instantaneous speed (IS), finite
time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) and velocity dependent Lyapunov exponents (VDLE)
extracted from OTOC. Introduction of these quantities turn out to be
instrumental in diagnosing and demarcating different regimes of dynamical
behavior. To gain control over open nonlinear systems, it is important to look
at the variation of these quantities with respect to parameters. As we tune
drive, dissipation and coupling, FTLE and IS exhibit transition between
sustained chaos and non-chaotic regimeswith intermediate transient chaos
regimes and highly intermittent sustained chaos points. In the limit of zero
nonlinearity, we present exact analytical results for the driven dissipative
harmonic system and we find that our analytical results can very well describe
the non-chaotic regime as well as the late time behavior in the transient
regime of the Duffing chain. We believe, this analysis is an important step
forward towards understanding nonlinear dynamics, chaos and spatio-temporal

However, literature shows that perception is not a purely passive compression
mechanism, and that actions play an important role in the formulation of
abstract representations. We propose to study perception for these embodied
agents, under the mathematical formalism of group theory in order to make the
link between perception and action. In particular, we consider the commutative
properties of continuous action sequences with respect to sensory information
perceived by such an embodied agent. We introduce the Sensory Commutativity
Probability (SCP) criterion which measures how much an agent's degree of
freedom affects the environment in embodied scenarios. We show how to compute
this criterion in different environments, including realistic robotic setups.
We empirically illustrate how SCP and the commutative properties of action

in unpaired image-to-image translation. We show that although the current

the style or the content, they fail to transfer both at the same time. We
propose a new generator network to address this issue and show that the
resulting network strikes a better balance between style and content.
  There are no well-defined or agreed-upon evaluation metrics for unpaired
image-to-image translation. So far, the success of image translation models has
been based on subjective, qualitative visual comparison on a limited number of
images. To address this problem, we propose a new framework for the
quantitative evaluation of image-to-illustration models, where both content and
style are taken into account using separate classifiers. In this new evaluation
framework, our proposed model performs better than the current state-of-the-art

approach where a context module is coevolved with a skill module. The context
module recognizes the variation and modulates the skill module so that the
entire system performs well in unseen situations. The approach is evaluated in
a challenging version of the Flappy Bird game where the effects of the actions
vary over time. The Context+Skill approach leads to significantly more robust
behavior in environments with previously unseen effects. Such a principled
generalization ability is essential in deploying autonomous agents in real

two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy in a combined theory-experiment

enormous capacity trending to billions of parameters. Current execution methods
demand brute-force resources such as HBM devices and high speed
interconnectivity for data parallelism. In this paper, we introduce a new
relay-style execution technique called L2L (layer-to-layer) where at any given
moment, the device memory is primarily populated only with the executing
layer(s)'s footprint. The model resides in the DRAM memory attached to either a
CPU or an FPGA as an entity we call eager param-server (EPS). To overcome the
bandwidth issues of shuttling parameters to and from EPS, the model is executed
a layer at a time across many micro-batches instead of the conventional method
of minibatches over whole model. L2L is implemented using 16GB V100 devices for
BERT-Large running it with a device batch size of up to 256. Our results show
45% reduction in memory and 40% increase in the throughput compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline. L2L is also able to fit models up to 50 Billion
parameters on a machine with a single 16GB V100 and 512GB CPU memory and
without requiring any model partitioning. L2L scales to arbitrary depth
allowing researchers to develop on affordable devices which is a big step
toward democratizing AI. By running the optimizer in the host EPS, we show a
new form of mixed precision for faster throughput and convergence. In addition,
the EPS enables dynamic neural architecture approaches by varying layers across
iterations. Finally, we also propose and demonstrate a constant memory
variation of L2L and we propose future enhancements. This work has been
performed on GPUs first, but also targeted towards all high TFLOPS/Watt

perturbs the solar system's plane, and stellar encounters act to increase the

find that cluster effects can alter the mean plane of the solar system by
$\lesssim1\deg$, and are thus insufficient to explain the $\psi\approx6\deg$

excite the orbital dispersion of the cold classical Kuiper belt, and show that
while stellar flybys may grow the cold belt's inclination by the observed

astronomy has opened an avenue for probing the fundamental properties of
gravity in strong and dynamical field, and in particular, high energy regime.
In this work, we test the parity conservation of gravity with gravitational
waves. If the parity symmetry is broken, the left- and right-handed modes of
gravitational waves would follow different equations of motion, dubbed as
birefringence. We perform full Bayesian inference by comparing the
state-of-the-art waveform with parity violation with the compact binary
coalescence data released by LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We do not find any
violations of general relativity, thus constrain the lower bound of the
parity-violating energy scale to be $0.09$ GeV through the velocity
birefringence of gravitational waves. This provides the most stringent
experimental test of gravitational parity symmetry up to date. We also find
third generation gravitational-wave detectors can enhance this bound to
$\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ GeV if there is still no violation, comparable to the
current LHC energy scale in particle physics, which indicates
gravitational-wave astronomy can usher in a new era of testing the ultraviolet

in a setup representative of LISA, and in this paper it is operated in the
long-arm interferometer configuration. The testbed is fitted with a flat-top
beam generator to simulate the beam received by a LISA spacecraft. We
demonstrate a reduction of TTL coupling between this flat-top beam and a
Gaussian reference beam via introducing two- and four-lens imaging systems. TTL
coupling factors below $\pm 25\,\mu$m/rad for beam tilts within $\pm
300\,\mu$rad are obtained by careful optimization of the system. Moreover we
show that the additional TTL coupling due to lateral alignment errors of
elements of the imaging system can be compensated by introducing lateral shifts
of the detector, and vice versa. These findings help validate the suitability
of this noise-reduction technique for the LISA long-arm interferometer.

While plant densities on the ecosystem-wide scale are typically low, a spatial
self-organisation principle leads to the occurrence of alternating patches of
high biomass and patches of bare soil. Nevertheless, intraspecific competition
dynamics other than competition for water over long spatial scales are commonly
ignored in mathematical models for vegetation patterns. In this chapter, I
address the impact of local intraspecific competition on a modelling framework
for banded vegetation patterns. Firstly, I show that in the context of a
single-species model, neglecting local intraspecific competition leads to an
overestimation of a patterned ecosystem's resilience to increases in aridity.
Secondly, in the context of a multispecies model, I argue that local
intraspecific competition is a key element in the successful capture of species
coexistence in model solutions representing a vegetation pattern. For both
models, a detailed bifurcation analysis is presented to analyse the onset,
existence and stability of patterns. Besides the strengths of local
intraspecific competition, also the the difference between two species has a
significant impact on the bifurcation structure, providing crucial insights
into the complex ecosystem dynamics. Predictions on future ecosystem dynamics
presented in this chapter, especially on pattern onset and pattern stability,
can aid the development of conservation programs.

for convex problems, the theory is considerably less developed in the context
of deep learning where the problem is non-convex and the gradient noise might
exhibit a heavy-tailed behavior, as empirically observed in recent studies. In
this study, we consider a \emph{continuous-time} variant of SGDm, known as the
underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD), and investigate its asymptotic properties
under heavy-tailed perturbations. Supported by recent studies from statistical
physics, we argue both theoretically and empirically that the heavy-tails of
such perturbations can result in a bias even when the step-size is small, in
the sense that \emph{the optima of stationary distribution} of the dynamics
might not match \emph{the optima of the cost function to be optimized}. As a
remedy, we develop a novel framework, which we coin as \emph{fractional} ULD
(FULD), and prove that FULD targets the so-called Gibbs distribution, whose
optima exactly match the optima of the original cost. We observe that the Euler
discretization of FULD has noteworthy algorithmic similarities with
\emph{natural gradient} methods and \emph{gradient clipping}, bringing a new
perspective on understanding their role in deep learning. We support our theory

one-dimensional edges of such two-dimensional materials as well as to control
the edge-plane ratio. Edges typically exhibit properties that are unique and
distinctly different from those of planes and bulk. Thus, controlling them
allows to design principally new materials with synthetic edge-plane-bulk

to study such metamaterials experimentally in a precise and systematic way has
not yet been developed. Here we report a facile and controllable anisotropic
wet etching method that allows scalable fabrication of TMD metamaterials with

exclusively zigzag-terminated. This results in hexagonal nanostructures of
predefined order and complexity, including few nanometer thin nanoribbons and
nanojunctions. The method thus enables future studies of a broad range of TMD

not follows any alpha-stable distribution, including the Gaussian, perhaps

for $\kappa \in (8/3,4)$) on an independent $\sqrt{\kappa}$-Liouville quantum
gravity (LQG) surface and explores the CLE in a natural Markovian way, the
quantum surfaces (e.g., corresponding to the interior of the CLE loops) that
are cut out form a Poisson point process of quantum disks. This construction
allows us to make direct links between CLE on LQG, asymmetric
$(4/\kappa)$-stable processes, and labeled branching trees. The ratio between
positive and negative jump intensities of these processes turns out to be
$-\cos (4 \pi / \kappa)$, which can be interpreted as a ""density"" of CLE loops
in the CLE on LQG setting. Positive jumps correspond to the discovery of a CLE
loop (where the LQG length of the loop is given by the jump size) and negative
jumps correspond to the moments where the discovery process splits the
remaining to be discovered domain into two pieces.
  Some consequences are the following: (i) It provides a construction of a CLE
on LQG as a patchwork/welding of quantum disks. (ii) It allows to construct the
""natural quantum measure"" that lives in a CLE carpet. (iii) It enables us to
derive some new properties and formulas for SLE processes and CLE themselves
(without LQG) such as the exact distribution of the trunk of the general
asymmetric SLE$_\kappa(\kappa-6)$ processes.
  The present work deals directly with structures in the continuum and makes no
reference to discrete models, but our calculations match those for scaling
limits of O(N) models on planar maps with large faces and CLE on LQG. Indeed,
our L\'evy-tree descriptions are exactly the ones that appear in the study of
the large-scale limit of peeling of discrete decorated planar maps such as in

  For validation, we first use synthetically generated airways and vessels

directly evaluate the accuracy of CNR in comparison with traditional methods.
Then, in-vivo validation is performed by analyzing the association between the
percentage of the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1\%) and
the value of the Pi10 parameter, two well-known measures of lung function and
airway disease, for airways. For vessels, we assess the correlation between our

quantum Lifshitz model in one and two spatial dimensions. In 1+1 dimensions we
employ a correlator approach to obtain analytic results for both open and
periodic biharmonic chains. In 2+1 dimensions we use a replica method and
consider spherical and toroidal spatial manifolds. In all cases, the universal
finite part of the logarithmic negativity vanishes for mixed states defined on
two disjoint components. For mixed states defined on adjacent components, we
find a non-trivial logarithmic negativity reminiscent of two-dimensional
conformal field theories. As a byproduct of our calculations, we obtain exact
results for the odd entanglement entropy in 2+1 dimensions.

given labelled examples of other classes. This setting is similar to
semi-supervised learning, but significantly harder because there are no
labelled examples for the new classes. The challenge, then, is to leverage the
information contained in the labelled images in order to learn a
general-purpose clustering model and use the latter to identify the new classes
in the unlabelled data. In this work we address this problem by combining three
ideas: (1) we suggest that the common approach of bootstrapping an image
representation using the labeled data only introduces an unwanted bias, and
that this can be avoided by using self-supervised learning to train the
representation from scratch on the union of labelled and unlabelled data; (2)
we use rank statistics to transfer the model's knowledge of the labelled
classes to the problem of clustering the unlabelled images; and, (3) we train
the data representation by optimizing a joint objective function on the
labelled and unlabelled subsets of the data, improving both the supervised
classification of the labelled data, and the clustering of the unlabelled data.
We evaluate our approach on standard classification benchmarks and outperform
current methods for novel category discovery by a significant margin.

Bartlett","Self-Distillation Amplifies Regularization in Hilbert Space",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge distillation introduced in the deep learning context is a method to
transfer knowledge from one architecture to another. In particular, when the
architectures are identical, this is called self-distillation. The idea is to
feed in predictions of the trained model as new target values for retraining
(and iterate this loop possibly a few times). It has been empirically observed
that the self-distilled model often achieves higher accuracy on held out data.
Why this happens, however, has been a mystery: the self-distillation dynamics
does not receive any new information about the task and solely evolves by
looping over training. To the best of our knowledge, there is no rigorous
understanding of this phenomenon. This work provides the first theoretical
analysis of self-distillation. We focus on fitting a nonlinear function to
training data, where the model space is Hilbert space and fitting is subject to
$\ell_2$ regularization in this function space. We show that self-distillation
iterations modify regularization by progressively limiting the number of basis
functions that can be used to represent the solution. This implies (as we also
verify empirically) that while a few rounds of self-distillation may reduce
over-fitting, further rounds may lead to under-fitting and thus worse
performance.

  citation",,"10.1007/JHEP09(2020)193",,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Three-dimensional Coulomb branches have a prominent role in the study of
moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories with $8$ supercharges in
$3,4,5$, and $6$ dimensions. Inspired by simply laced $3$d $\mathcal{N}=4$
supersymmetric quiver gauge theories, we consider Coulomb branches constructed
from non-simply laced quivers with edge multiplicity $k$ and no flavor nodes.
In a computation of the Coulomb branch as the space of dressed monopole
operators, a center-of-mass $U(1)$ symmetry needs to be ungauged. Typically,
for a simply laced theory, all choices of the ungauged $U(1)$ (i.e. all choices
of ungauging schemes) are equivalent and the Coulomb branch is unique. In this
note, we study various ungauging schemes and their effect on the resulting
Coulomb branch variety. It is shown that, for a non-simply laced quiver,
inequivalent ungauging schemes exist which correspond to inequivalent Coulomb
branch varieties. Ungauging on any of the long nodes of a non-simply laced
quiver yields the same Coulomb branch $\mathcal{C}$. For choices of ungauging
the $U(1)$ on a short node of rank higher than $1$, the GNO dual magnetic
lattice deforms such that it no longer corresponds to a Lie group, and
therefore, the monopole formula yields a non-valid Coulomb branch. However, if
the ungauging is performed on a short node of rank $1$, the one-dimensional
magnetic lattice is rescaled conformally along its single direction and the
corresponding Coulomb branch is an orbifold of the form
$\mathcal{C}/\mathbb{Z}_k$. Ungauging schemes of $3$d Coulomb branches provide
a particularly interesting and intuitive description of a subset of actions on
the nilpotent orbits studied by Kostant and Brylinski arXiv:math/9204227. The
ungauging scheme analysis is carried out for minimally unbalanced $C_n$, affine
$F_4$, affine $G_2$, and twisted affine $D_4^{(3)}$ quivers, respectively.

its near-infrared spectrum using cloudless Sonora atmospheric models, and (2)
its luminosity and the white dwarf's age ($7.3_{-1.6}^{+2.8}$ Gyr) using Sonora
evolutionary models. The two methods give consistent temperatures and radii,
but atmospheric models infer a lower surface gravity and therefore an
unphysically young age. Assuming evolutionary model parameters ($T_{\rm

$R=0.789^{+0.011}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$), we find cloudless model atmospheres
have brighter Y- and J-band fluxes than the data, suggesting condensate clouds
have not fully dispersed around 1300 K. The W2 flux (4.6 $\mu$m) of COCONUTS-1B
is fainter than models, suggesting non-equilibrium mixing of CO. To investigate
the gravity dependence of the L/T transition, we compile all 60 known L6-T6
benchmarks and derive a homogeneous set of temperatures, surface gravities, and
masses. As is well-known, young, low-gravity late-L dwarfs have significantly
fainter, redder near-infrared photometry and $\approx200-300$ K cooler
temperatures than old, high-gravity objects. Our sample now reveals such
gravity dependence becomes weaker for T dwarfs, with young objects having
comparable near-infrared photometry and $\approx100$ K cooler temperatures
compared to old objects. Finally, we find that young objects have a larger
amplitude J-band brightening than old objects, and also brighten at H band as
they cross the L/T transition.

and determine their extent and power through the construction of stacked
annuli. We find outflows are most powerful in central regions and extend out to
$\sim$1R$_{e}$, with declining mass outflow rates and loading factors as a
function of radius. The stacking of spaxels over key galaxy quantities reveals
outflow detections in regions of high $\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ ($\gtrsim$0.01
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and $\Sigma_{M_{*}}$ ($\gtrsim$10$^{7}$
M$_{\odot}$kpc$^{-2}$) along the resolved main sequence. Clear correlations
with $\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ suggest it is the main regulator of outflows, with a
critical threshold of $\sim$0.01 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ needed to
escape the weight of the disk and launch them. Furthermore, measurements of the
H$\delta$ and D$_{n}$4000 indices reveal virtually identical star formation
histories between galaxies with outflows and those without. Finally, through
stacking of HI 21 cm observations for a subset of our sample, we find outflow
galaxies show reduced HI gas fractions at central velocities compared to their

massively parallel, matrix-free Krylov subspace methods to calculate dynamical

functions agree at high temperatures with dynamical mean field solutions, while
at low temperatures finite-size corrections are quantitatively reproduced by
the exactly solvable dynamics of near extremal black holes. Motivated by these
results, we develop a novel finite-size rescaling procedure for analyzing the
growth of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). We verify that this procedure
accurately determines the Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda$, across a wide range in
temperatures, including in the regime where $\lambda$ approaches the universal
bound, $\lambda = 2\pi/\beta$.

Here, via high-resolution $N$-body simulations of star-planet systems perturbed

change the cross section for planet transfers. Therefore, in environments with
high binary fractions, floating planets are expected to be relatively common,
while in environments with low binary fractions, where the cross sections of
planet ejection and transfer are comparable, the rate of planet exchanges
between two stars will be comparable to the rate of production of free-floating

shape is statistically different in the halo compared to the core for ~40% of
our galaxies. Similarly to object-by-object based studies and a recent resolved
study using lensing, we find a correlation between the peak velocity shift and
the width of the Lya line both at the interstellar and circum-galactic scales.
While there is a lack of correlation between the spectral properties and the
spatial scale lengths of our LAHs, we find a correlation between the width of
the line in the LAH and the halo flux fraction. Interestingly, UV bright
galaxies show broader, more redshifted and less asymmetric Lya lines in their
haloes. The most significant correlation found is for the FWHM of the line and
the UV continuum slope of the galaxy, suggesting that the redder galaxies have
broader Lya lines. The generally broad and red line shapes found in the halo
component suggests that the Lya haloes are powered either by scattering
processes through an outflowing medium, fluorescent emission from outflowing
cold clumps of gas, or a mix of both. Considering the large diversity of the
Lya line profiles observed in our sample and the lack of strong correlation,
the interpretation of our results is still broadly open and underlines the need
for realistic spatially resolved models of the LAHs.

expensive for large volumes, the physics of HeII reionization is often
approximated by a uniform UV background model that does not capture the
patchiness of reionization. We have devised a model that implements the effects
of HeII reionization using semi-analytic calculations of the thermal state of
intergalactic gas-- a way to bypass a full radiative transfer simulation while
still realizing the physics of HeII reionization that affects observables such
as the Lyman alpha forest. Here we present a publicly-available code that
flexibly models inhomogeneous HeII reionization in simulations at a negligible
computational cost. Because many of the parameters of HeII reionization are
uncertain, our model is customizable from a set of free parameters. We show
results from this code in MP-Gadget, where this model is implemented. We
demonstrate the resulting temperature evolution and temperature-density
relation of intergalactic gas-- consistent with recent measurements and
previous radiative transfer simulations. We show that the impact of HeII
reionization gives rise to subtle signatures in the one-dimensional statistics
of the Lyman alpha forest at the level of several per cent, in agreement with
previous findings. The flexible nature of these simulations are ideal for
studies of HeII reionization and future observations of the HeII Lyman alpha

entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation should follow the Page curve,
increasing from zero until near the halfway point of the evaporation, and then
decreasing back to zero. The general argument for the Page curve is based on
the assumption that the quantum state of the black hole plus radiation during
the evaporation process is typical. In this paper, we show that the Page curve
can result from a simple dynamical input in the evolution of the black hole,
based on a recently proposed signature of quantum chaos, without resorting to
typicality. Our argument is based on what we refer to as the ""operator gas""
approach, which allows one to understand the evolution of the microstate of the
black hole from generic features of the Heisenberg evolution of operators. One
key feature which leads to the Page curve is the possibility of dynamical
processes where operators in the ""gas"" can ""jump"" outside the black hole, which
we refer to as void formation processes. Such processes are initially
exponentially suppressed, but dominate after a certain time scale, which can be
used as a dynamical definition of the Page time. In the Hayden-Preskill
protocol for young and old black holes, we show that void formation is also
responsible for the transfer of information from the black hole to the
radiation. We conjecture that void formation may provide a microscopic
explanation for the recent semi-classical prescription of including islands in
the calculation of the entanglement entropy of the radiation.

that either explicitly including the $e_g$ orbitals, or going beyond the
rotationally invariant Coulomb interaction within the $t_{2g}$ sector, causes a

low-lying non-Kramers doublet carrying quadrupolar and octupolar moments and an
excited triplet which supports magnetic dipole moments, bolstering our previous

require screening mechanisms to ensure consistency with Solar System tests. One
widely-studied mechanism -- the chameleon -- can lead to violations of the
equivalence principle (EP), as screened and unscreened objects fall
differently. If the stars are screened but the surrounding dark matter is not,
this leads to asymmetry between leading and trailing streams. We provide
analytic estimates of the magnitude of this effect for realistic Galactic mass
distributions. Using a restricted N-body code, we simulate 4 satellites with a
range of masses and orbits, together with a variety of strengths of the fifth
force and screening levels of the Milky Way and satellite. The ratio of the
cumulative number function of stars in the leading and trailing stream as a
function of longitude from the satellite is computable from simulations,
measurable from the stellar data and can provide a direct test. We forecast
constraints for streams at large Galactocentric distances, using the specific
example case of Hu-Sawicki gravity. Streams with apocentres between 100 and 200
kpc provide attainable constraints at the level of $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-7}$. Still
more stringent constraints at the level of $10^{-7.5}$ or even $10^{-8}$ are
plausible provided the environmental screening of the satellite is accounted
for. These would be among the tightest astrophysical constraints to date. We
note further signatures of chameleon gravity: (i) the trailing stellar stream
may become detached from the dark matter progenitor if all the stars are lost,
(ii) in the extreme fifth force regime, striations in the stellar trailing tail
may develop, (iii) if the satellite is fully screened, its orbital frequency is
lower than that of the associated dark matter, which is preferentially
liberated into the leading tidal tail.

confirmed experimentally. These new Dirac points dubbed ``gullies'' emerge from
the interplay between strong electric field and trigonal warping. In this work
we first characterize the properties of new emergent Dirac points and show that
the electric field can be used to tune the distance between gullies in the

transitions and higher-order singularity of ``monkey saddle'' type. Following
the characterization of the band structure, we consider the spectrum of Landau
levels and structure of their wave functions. In the limit of strong electric
fields when gullies are well separated in momentum space, they give rise to
triply degenerate Landau levels. In the second part of this work, we
investigate how degeneracy between three gully Landau levels is lifted in
presence of interactions. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation we show that
the symmetry breaking state interpolates between fully gully polarized state
that breaks $C_3$ symmetry at high displacement field, and the gully symmetric
state when the electric field is decreased. The discontinuous transition
between these two states is driven by enhanced inter-gully tunneling and
exchange. We conclude by outlining specific experimental predictions for the
existence of such a symmetry-breaking state.

current photoionisation models substantially over-predict [SIII] lines
intensity, while broadly reproducing other observed optical line ratios. We
discuss how to nonetheless make use of the information provided by [SIII] lines
by setting a prior on the ionisation parameter. Following this approach, we
derive spatially-resolved maps and radial profiles of metallicity and
ionisation parameter. The metallicity radial profiles are comparable with
previous works, with metallicity declining toward the outer parts and a
flattening in the central regions, in agreement with infall models of galaxy
formation, that predict that spiral discs build up through accretion of
material, which leads to an inside-out growth. On the other hand, ionisation
parameter radial profiles are flat for low-mass galaxies, while their slope
becomes positive as galaxy mass increases. However, the ionisation parameter
maps we obtain are clumpy, especially for low-mass galaxies. Ionisation
parameter is tightly correlated with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width
[EW(H$\alpha$)], following a nearly universal relation, which we attribute to
the change of the spectral shape of ionising sources due to ageing of HII
regions. We derive a positive correlation between ionisation parameter and
metallicity at fixed EW(H$\alpha$), in disagreement with previous theoretical

allowing for structures such as autoregressive departures from any pre-existing

uncertainty of our projections (beyond the stringent assumptions necessary for
the subsequent causal inferences). To tackle this problem we provide a

simulation, generating a distribution of plausible counterfactual trajectories

that the input matrices can be pre-computed dissimilarity measures obtained
from any kind of available data (e.g. node attributes or edge structure). As
the model inputs are distance measures, we do not need to assume the existence
of any underlying feature space. Main challenge is that metric constraints

respected if, for example, the coefficients of the linear combination are
allowed to be negative. Both positive and sub-additive constraints are linear
inequalities, but the computational complexity of imposing them scales as
O(D3), where D is the size of the input matrices (i.e. the size of the data

literature, in particular, aims to provide precise and quick answers to
questions raised about a system under study. In this paper, we present
ACCORDION (Automated Clustering Conditional On Relating Data of Interactions tO
a Network), a novel tool and a methodology to enable efficient answering of
biological questions by automatically assembling new, or expanding existing
models using published literature. Our approach integrates information
extraction and clustering with simulation and formal analysis to allow for an
automated iterative process that includes assembling, testing and selecting the
most relevant models, given a set of desired system properties. We applied our
methodology to a model of the circuitry that con-trols T cell differentiation.
To evaluate our approach, we compare the model that we obtained, using our
automated model extension approach, with the previously published manually
extended T cell differentiation model. Besides demonstrating automated and
rapid reconstruction of a model that was previously built manually, ACCORDION
can assemble multiple models that satisfy desired properties. As such, it
replaces large number of tedious or even imprac-tical manual experiments and
guides alternative hypotheses and interventions in biological systems.

risen considerably in recent years. A framework is envisioned to enforce
efficient last mile delivery in urban environments by leveraging a network of
ride-sharing vehicles, where Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) drop packages on
said vehicles which then cover the majority of the distance to finally be
picked up by another UAS for delivery. This approach presents many engineering
challenges, including the safe rendezvous of both agents: the UAS and the
human-operated ground vehicle. In this paper, we introduce a framework to
minimize the risk of failure, while allowing for optimal usage of the
controlled agent. We formulate a compact fast planner to drive a UAS to a
passive ground vehicle with inexact behavior, while providing intuitive and
meaningful procedures to guarantee safety with minimal sacrifice of optimality.
The resulting algorithm is shown to be fast and implementable in real-time via
numerical tests.

the AGN population in the field. We performed an analysis of the properties of
these objects, including their demography, morphology, and IR luminosity.
Focusing on the population of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 0.4$, we also aim
to study the environments of AGN and non-AGN galaxies at that redshift. We make
use of the multiwavelength catalog of objects in the field compiled by the
OTELO survey, unique in terms of minimum line flux and equivalent width. The
OTELO pseudo-spectra allow the identification of emission lines and the
spectral classification of the sources. We obtained a sample of 72 AGNs in the
field of OTELO, selected with four different methods in the optical, X-rays,
and mid-infrared bands. We find that using X-rays is the most efficient way to
select AGNs. An analysis was performed on the AGN population of OTELO in order
to characterize its members. At $z \sim 0.4$, we find that up to 26\% of our
H$\alpha$ emitters are AGNs. At that redshift, AGNs are found in identical
environments to non-AGNs, although they represent the most clustered group when
compared to passive and star-forming galaxies. The majority of our AGNs at any
redshift were classified as late-type galaxies, including a 16\% proportion of
irregulars. Another 16\% of AGNs show signs of interactions or mergers.
Regarding the infrared luminosity, we are able to recover all the luminous
infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the field of OTELO up to $z\sim 1.6$. We find that
the proportion of LIRGs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) is higher
among the AGN population, and that ULIRGs show a higher fraction of AGNs than
LIRGs.

of SU Aurigae and several FU~Orionis-type stars. Dynamic protostellar disks
featuring ejections of gaseous clumps and quiescent protoplanetary disks
experiencing a close encounter with an intruder star were modeled using the
numerical hydrodynamics code FEOSAD. Both the gas and dust dynamics were taken
into account, including dust growth and mutual friction between the gas and
dust components. Only plane-of-the-disk encounters were considered. Ejected
clumps produce a unique type of tail that is characterized by a bow-shock
shape. Such tails originate from the supersonic motion of ejected clumps
through the dense envelope that often surrounds young gravitationally unstable
protostellar disks. The ejected clumps either sit at the head of the tail-like
structure or disperse if their mass is insufficient to withstand the head wind
of the envelope. On the other hand, close encounters with quiescent
protoplanetary disks produce three types of the tail-like structure; we define
these as pre-collisional, post-collisional, and spiral tails. These tails can
in principle be distinguished from one another by particular features of the
gas and dust flow in and around them. We find that the brown-dwarf-mass
intruders do not capture circumintruder disks during the encounter, while the
subsolar-mass intruders can acquire appreciable circumintruder disks with
elevated dust-to-gas ratios, which can ease their observational detection.
However, this is true only for prograde collisions; the retrograde intruders
fail to collect appreciable amounts of gas or dust from the disk of the target.
The predicted mass of dust in the model tail-like structures is higher than
what was inferred for similar structures in SU~Aur, FU~Ori, and Z~CMa, making
their observational detection feasible. Abridged.

optical signal. The Holevo limit exceeds substantially the standard Shannon
limit when the power spectral density of noise acquired in the course of
propagation is small compared to the energy of a single photon at the carrier
frequency per unit time-bandwidth area. General results are illustrated with a
discussion of efficient communication strategies in the photon-starved regime.

polycephalum, has been proven efficient on finding appropriate and efficient
solutions in hard to solve complex mathematical problems. The plasmodium of P.
polycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational
example. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a
variety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work,
this interesting behaviour is mimicked by a robust unconventional computational
model, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and Learning Automata.
Namely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning
capabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling
appropriately the aforementioned biological substrate and, thus, capturing its
computational capabilities. CAs are very efficient in modelling biological
systems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating
essential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of
simple components, interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after
combining CAs with learning capabilities, should be appropriate for modelling
the behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities and
computational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed
towards the experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic
Gates, while trying to find minimal paths in properly configured mazes with
food sources. The presented simulation results for various Logic Gates are
found in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the
corresponding experimental results, proving the efficacy of this unconventional
bio-inspired model and providing useful insights for its enhanced usage in
various computing applications.

presence detection through deep learning. Using WiFi signal as an example, we
demonstrate that the channel state information (CSI) obtained at the receiver
contains rich information about the propagation environment. Through judicious
pre-processing of the estimated CSI followed by deep learning, reliable
presence detection can be achieved. Several challenges in passive RF sensing
are addressed. With presence detection, how to collect training data with human
presence can have a significant impact on the performance. This is in contrast
to activity detection when a specific motion pattern is of interest. A second
challenge is that RF signals are complex-valued. Handling complex-valued input
in deep learning requires careful data representation and network architecture
design. Finally, human presence affects CSI variation along multiple
dimensions; such variation, however, is often masked by system impediments such
as timing or frequency offset. Addressing these challenges, the proposed
learning system uses pre-processing to preserve human motion induced channel
variation while insulating against other impairments. A convolutional neural
network (CNN) properly trained with both magnitude and phase information is
then designed to achieve reliable presence detection. Extensive experiments are
conducted. Using off-the-shelf WiFi devices, the proposed deep learning based
RF sensing achieves near perfect presence detection during multiple extended
periods of test and exhibits superior performance compared with leading edge
passive infrared sensors. Comparison with existing RF based human presence
detection also demonstrates its robustness in performance, especially when
deployed in a completely new environment.

Online ahead of print","10.1113/JP279793",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is widely supposed that following unilateral brain injury, there arises an
asymmetry in inter-hemispheric inhibition which has an adverse influence upon
motor control. I argue that this 'inter-hemispheric imbalance' model arises
from a fundamental misunderstanding of the roles played by inter-hemispheric
(callosal) projections in mammalian brains. Drawing upon a large body of
empirical data, derived largely from animal models, and associated theoretical
modeling, it is demonstrated that inter-hemispheric projections perform
contrast enhancing and integrative functions via mechanisms such as
surround/lateral inhibition. The principal functional unit of callosal
influence comprises a facilitatory centre and a depressing peripheral zone,
that together shape the influence of converging inputs to pyramidal neurons.
Inter-hemispheric inhibition is an instance of a more general feature of
mammalian neural systems, whereby inhibitory interneurons act not simply to
prevent over-excitation but to sculpt the output of specific circuits. The
narrowing of the excitatory focus that occurs through crossed surround
inhibition is a highly conserved motif of transcallosal interactions in
mammalian sensory and motor cortices. A case is presented that the notion of
'inter-hemispheric imbalance' has been sustained, and clinical interventions
derived from this model promoted, by erroneous assumptions concerning that
revealed by investigative techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). The alternative perspective promoted by the present analysis, also
permits the basis of positive (e.g. post stroke) associations between the
structural integrity of transcallosal projections and motor capability to be
better understood.

emitted by quasi-circular binaries, eccentric binaries may also produce
detectable signals in the near future with ground- and space-based detectors.
We here explore how tests of general relativity scale with the orbital
eccentricity of the source during the inspiral of compact objects up to $e \sim
0.8$. We use a new, 3rd post-Newtonian-accurate, eccentric waveform model for
the inspiral of compact objects, which is fast enough for Bayesian parameter
estimation and model selection, and highly accurate for modeling moderately
eccentric inspirals. We derive and incorporate the eccentric corrections to
this model induced in Brans-Dicke theory and in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity at leading post-Newtonian order, which suggest a straightforward
eccentric extension of the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism. We explore
the upper limits that could be set on the coupling parameters of these modified
theories through both a confidence-interval- and Bayes-factor-based approach,
using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo and a trans-dimensional, reversible-jump,
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method. We find projected constraints with signals
from sources with $e \sim 0.4$ that are one order of magnitude stronger than
that those obtained with quasi-circular binaries in advanced LIGO. In
particular, eccentric gravitational waves detected at design sensitivity should
be able to constrain the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega \gtrsim 3300$
and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha^{1/2} \lesssim 0.5 \;
{\rm{km}}$ at 90% confidence. Although the projected constraint on $\omega$ is
weaker than other current constraints, the projected constraint on
$\alpha^{1/2}$ is 10 times stronger than the current gravitational wave bound.

objective Bayes methods is the concept of random imaginary observations. Under
this setup, the expected-posterior prior (EPP) offers several advantages, among

establish compatibility of priors among models. In this paper, we study the
power-expected posterior prior as a generalization to the EPP in objective
Bayesian model selection under normal linear models. We prove that it can be
represented as a mixture of $g$-prior, like a wide range of prior distributions
under normal linear models, and thus posterior distributions and Bayes factors

Comparisons with other mixtures of $g$-prior are made and emphasis is given in
the posterior distribution of g and its effect on Bayesian model selection and

goods. However, it is difficult to gauge whether those goods are resold, or are

subsidize the adoption of mobile phones in one of the poorest countries in the

select rural areas. We analyze the program using 5.3 billion transaction
records from the dominant mobile phone network. Transaction records reveal
where and how much subsidized handsets were ultimately used, and indicators of
resale. Some subsidized handsets drifted from the rural areas where they were
allocated to urban centers, but the subsidized handsets were used as much as
handsets purchased at retail prices, suggesting they were valued. Recipients
are similar to those who paid for phones, but are highly connected to each
other. We then simulate welfare effects using a network demand system that
accounts for how each person's adoption affects the rest of the network.
Spillovers are substantial: 73-76% of the operator revenue generated by the

technique for surveying hard-to-reach communities that takes advantage of
community members' social networks to reach potential participants. As a
network-based sampling method, RDS is faced with the fundamental problem of
sampling from population networks where features such as homophily (the
tendency for individuals with similar traits to share social ties) and
differential activity (the ratio of the average number of connections by
attribute) are sensitive to the choice of a sampling method. Though not clearly
described in the RDS literature, many simple methods exist to generate
simulated RDS data, with specific levels of network features, where the focus
is on estimating simple estimands. However, the accuracy of these methods in
their abilities to consistently recover those targeted network features remains
unclear. This is also motivated by recent findings that some population network
parameters (e.g.~homophily) cannot be consistently estimated from the RDS data
alone \citep{Crawford17}.
  In this paper, we conduct a simulation study to assess the accuracy of
existing RDS simulation methods, in terms of their abilities to generate RDS
samples with the desired levels of two network parameters: homophily and
differential activity. The results show that (1) homophily cannot be
consistently estimated from simulated RDS samples and (2) differential activity
estimates are more precise when groups, defined by traits, are equally active
and equally represented in the population. We use this approach to mimic
features of the Engage Study, an RDS sample of gay, bisexual and other men who
have sex with men in Montreal.

challenging to program. Traditionally, developers rely on hardware description
languages like Verilog or VHDL to specify the hardware behavior at the
register-transfer level. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) raises the level of
abstraction, but still requires FPGA design knowledge. Programmers usually
write pragma-annotated C/C++ programs to define the hardware architecture of an
application. However, each hardware vendor extends its own C dialect using its
own vendor-specific set of pragmas. This prevents portability across different
vendors. Furthermore, pragmas are not first-class citizens in the language.
This makes it hard to use them in a modular way or design proper abstractions.
In this paper, we present AnyHLS, an approach to synthesize FPGA designs in a
modular and abstract way. AnyHLS is able to raise the abstraction level of
existing HLS tools by resorting to programming language features such as types
and higher-order functions as follows: It relies on partial evaluation to
specialize and to optimize the user application based on a library of
abstractions. Then, vendor-specific HLS code is generated for Intel and Xilinx
FPGAs. Portability is obtained by avoiding any vendor-specific pragmas at the

for the domain of image processing is introduced as a case study, and its

initial operation period of the CPS is attack-free and learn the plant model.
Then, we compare the expected output found via the identifier with the real one
coming through the feedback link. Any difference greater than a threshold is
deemed to be an anomaly. To compensate, once the IDS flags a change in the
loop, we restart the system identification to find the new transfer function.
With the estimation of the new transfer function at hand, a new controller is
designed to keep the system stable. To test the idea, we took a DC motor as the
plant and employed ARX identifier. MATLAB Simulink environment was used to test
the proposed intrusion detection and compensation framework. We applied a set
of deception attacks to the forward channel in our experiments. The obtained
results prove that our detection strategy works well and timely reacts to

a substantial amount of time and effort. It has been estimated that software

these reasons, a long standing goal within the research community is to
(partially) automate software testing. While several techniques and tools have
been proposed to automatically generate test methods, recent work has
criticized the quality and usefulness of the assert statements they generate.
Therefore, we employ a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based approach called
Atlas(AuTomatic Learning of Assert Statements) to automatically generate
meaningful assert statements for test methods. Given a test method and a focal
method (i.e.,the main method under test), Atlas can predict a meaningful assert
statement to assess the correctness of the focal method. We applied Atlas to
thousands of test methods from GitHub projects and it was able to predict the
exact assert statement manually written by developers in 31% of the cases when
only considering the top-1 predicted assert. When considering the top-5
predicted assert statements, Atlas is able to predict exact matches in 50% of
the cases. These promising results hint to the potential usefulness ofour
approach as (i) a complement to automatic test case generation techniques, and
(ii) a code completion support for developers, whocan benefit from the
recommended assert statements while writing test code.

sequential modeling approaches, aiming to address the problem of capturing
time-varying temporal dependency patterns. To this end, we propose a different
formulation of HMMs, whereby the dependence on past frames is dynamically
inferred from the data. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical extension by
postulating an additional latent variable layer; therein, the (time-varying)
temporal dependence patterns are treated as latent variables over which
inference is performed. We leverage solid arguments from the Variational Bayes
framework and derive a tractable inference algorithm based on the
forward-backward algorithm. As we experimentally show, our approach can model
highly complex sequential data and can effectively handle data with missing

the sample size $n$. Extending the one-dimensional result of Heinrich and Kahn
\cite{HK2015}, we show that the minimax rate of estimating the mixing

achieved by an estimator computable in time $O(nd^2+n^{5/4})$. Furthermore, we

that a high frequency signal requires more samples to reconstruct. We
empirically show that a high frequency function is more difficult to

galaxies. Across the stellar mass range 10$^{9}<$M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}<$10$^{11}$,
we practically find no passive ($\gtrsim$2$\sigma$ below the star-forming main
sequence) disk galaxies with HI reservoirs comparable to those typical of
star-forming systems. Even including HI non detections at their upper limits,
passive disks typically have $\geq$0.5 dex less HI than their active
counterparts. We show that previous claims are due to the use of
aperture-corrected SFR estimates from the MPA/JHU SDSS DR7 catalog, which do
not provide a fair representation of the global SFR of HI-rich galaxies with
extended star-forming disks. Our findings confirm that the bulk of the passive

proven to be a useful constraint, both theoretically--to prove convergence and
optimality guarantees--and empirically--as an inductive bias. Deep metric
learning architectures that respect the triangle inequality rely, almost
exclusively, on Euclidean distance in the latent space. Though effective, this
fails to model two broad classes of subadditive distances, common in graphs and
reinforcement learning: asymmetric metrics, and metrics that cannot be embedded

architectures that are guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality. We prove
our architectures universally approximate norm-induced metrics on

performance of a learning algorithm is evaluated by the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) of losses rather than the expected loss. We devise
algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent for this framework. While
existing studies of CVaR optimization require direct access to the underlying
distribution, our algorithms make a weaker assumption that only i.i.d.\ samples
are given. For convex and Lipschitz loss functions, we show that our algorithm
has $O(1/\sqrt{n})$-convergence to the optimal CVaR, where $n$ is the number of
samples. For nonconvex and smooth loss functions, we show a generalization
bound on CVaR. By conducting numerical experiments on various machine learning
tasks, we demonstrate that our algorithms effectively minimize CVaR compared
with other baseline algorithms.

radial symmetry, a Schr\""odinger-type equation with a nonlocal,
convolution-type nonlinearity: $iu_t+\Delta u +\left(|x|^{-(d-2)} \ast |u|^{p}
\right) |u|^{p-2}u = 0, x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. First, we consider the
$L^2$-critical case in dimensions d=3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and obtain that a generic
blow-up has a self-similar structure and exhibits not only the square root
blowup rate but also the log-log correction (via asymptotic analysis and
functional fitting). In this setting we also study blow-up profiles and show
that generic blow-up solutions converge to the rescaled $Q$, a ground state
solution of the elliptic equation $-\Delta Q+Q- \left(|x|^{-(d-2)} \ast |Q|^p
\right) |Q|^{p-2} Q =0$.
  We also consider the $L^2$-supercritical case in dimensions d=3,4. We derive
the profile equation for the self-similar blow-up and establish the existence
and local uniqueness of its solutions. As in the NLS $L^2$-supercritical
regime, the profile equation exhibits branches of non-oscillating, polynomially
decaying (multi-bump) solutions. A numerical scheme of putting constraints into
solving the corresponding ODE is applied during the process of finding the
multi-bump solutions. Direct numerical simulation of solutions to the
generalized Hartree equation by the dynamic rescaling method indicates that the
$Q_{1,0}$ is the profile for the stable blow-up. In this supercritical case, we
obtain the blow-up rate without any correction. This blow-up happens at the
focusing level $10^{-5}$, and thus, numerically observable (unlike the
$L^2$-critical case).
  In summary, we find that the results are similar to the behavior of stable
blowup dynamics in the corresponding NLS settings. Consequently, one may expect
that the form of the nonlinearity in the Schr\""odinger-type equations is not
essential in stable blow-up.

often conducted in the time-frequency (T-F) domain because spatial filtering
can be efficiently implemented in the T-F domain. In such a case, ordinary

However, the estimated spectrogram is often inconsistent, and its amplitude and
phase may change when the spectrogram is converted back to the time-domain.
That is, the objective function does not evaluate the enhanced time-domain
signal properly. To address this problem, we propose to use an objective
function defined on the reconstructed time-domain signal. Specifically, speech
enhancement is conducted by multi-channel Wiener filtering in the T-F domain,

estimating a time-frequency~(T-F) mask which enhances a speech signal. One
popular DNN structure for that is a recurrent neural network~(RNN) owing to its
capability of effectively modelling time-sequential data like speech. In
particular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is often used to alleviate the
vanishing/exploding gradient problem which makes the training of an RNN

of mitigating the difficulty of training, which requires more computational

capability to dramatically improve the experimental precision for W and Z-boson
masses and couplings. This would enable indirect probes of physics beyond the
Standard Model at multi-TeV scales. For this purpose, one must complement the
experimental measurements with equally precise calculations for the theoretical
predictions of these quantities within the Standard Model, including three-loop
electroweak corrections. This article reports on the calculation of a subset of
these corrections, stemming from diagrams with three closed fermion loops to
the following quantities: the prediction of the W-boson mass from the Fermi
constant, the effective weak mixing angle, and partial and total widths of the
Z boson. The numerical size of these corrections is relatively modest, but
non-negligible compared to the precision targets of future colliders. In
passing, an error is identified in previous results for the two-loop
corrections to the Z width, with a small yet non-zero numerical impact.

tasks in environmental sound analysis. Considering that sound events and scenes

sound events and acoustic scenes based on multitask learning (MTL), in which
the knowledge of sound events and scenes can help in estimating them mutually.
The conventional MTL-based methods utilize one-hot scene labels to train the
relationship between sound events and scenes; thus, the conventional methods
cannot model the extent to which sound events and scenes are related. However,
in the real environment, common sound events may occur in some acoustic scenes;
on the other hand, some sound events occur only in a limited acoustic scene. In
this paper, we thus propose a new method for SED based on MTL of SED and ASC
using the soft labels of acoustic scenes, which enable us to model the extent
to which sound events and scenes are related. Experiments conducted using TUT
Sound Events 2016/2017 and TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 datasets show that the

one, in which the helix consists of a tiny helix structure, and makes up a

using the so-called zeta function regularization method. We find that the

simplified but practically relevant scenario of two co-channel cells with
asymmetric interference, i.e., only the user in one cell receives the strong
interference from the BS in the other cell. To mitigate such interference, we
propose a new cooperative NOMA scheme, where the interfered user's serving BS
sends a superposed signal comprising both the desired message and the
co-channel user's message (shared by the interfering BS). The co-channel user's
signal is aimed to add constructively with the interfering BS's signal at the
interfered user's receiver so that the combined interference with enhanced
power can be effectively decoded and cancelled. This thus leads to a new
problem on how to optimally allocate the transmit power for the two superposed
messages. We provide the closed-form solution to this problem and investigate
the conditions under which the performance of the proposed scheme is superior
over the existing schemes.

of rotation curves associated with spherically symmetric configurations. The
values for the post-Newtonian parameters, which help us to classify the
different metric theories of gravity, are tightly constrained mainly by solar
system experiments [47,48]. However, in recent years, metric theories
characterized by screening mechanisms [4,10,22,25] have become popular, due to
the fact that they lead to the possibility of modifications in larger scales
than the solar system while retaining the success of GR on it, allowing for
violations of the constraints of the Post-Newtonian parameters. In such a
context, we consider here two kinds of solutions for field equations: (i)
Vacuum solutions and (ii) in the presence of a politropic distribution of
matter. For the case (i) we find that the post-Newtonian corrections do not
lead to modifications significant enough to be considered an alternative to the
dark matter hypothesis. In the case (ii) we find that for a wide range of
values for the PPN parameters {\gamma}, {\beta}, {\xi}, {\alpha}_3 , {\zeta}_1
and {\zeta}_2 , the need for dark matter is unavoidable, in order to find flat
rotation curves. It is only for theories in which {\zeta}_3>0 that some
resemblance of flat rotation curves is found. The latter suggests, at least for
the models considered, that these are the only theories capable of replacing
dark matter as a possible explanation for the dynamics of galaxies.

same input features for sound event detection and direction-of-arrival
estimation, and train the two tasks jointly or in a two-stage transfer-learning
manner. We propose a two-step approach that decouples the learning of the sound
event detection and directional-of-arrival estimation systems. In the first
step, we detect the sound events and estimate the directions-of-arrival
separately to optimize the performance of each system. In the second step, we
train a deep neural network to match the two output sequences of the event
detector and the direction-of-arrival estimator. This modular and hierarchical
approach allows the flexibility in the system design, and increase the
performance of the whole sound event localization and detection system. The
experimental results using the DCASE 2019 sound event localization and
detection dataset show an improved performance compared to the previous
state-of-the-art solutions.

generalizes to test data requiring substantially deeper chaining than seen

well to two hand-authored rulebases, and to rulebases paraphrased into more
natural language. These findings are significant as it suggests a new role for
transformers, namely as limited ""soft theorem provers"" operating over explicit

explainability, correctability, and counterfactual reasoning in

information staleness, calling for timely content refreshing. However, content
refreshing consumes additional transmission resources and may degrade the delay
performance of mobile systems. In this work, we propose a freshness-aware
refreshing scheme to balance the service delay and content freshness measured
by Age of Information (AoI). Specifically, the cached content items will be
refreshed to the up-to-date version upon user requests if the AoI exceeds a
certain threshold (named as refreshing window). The average AoI and service
delay are derived in closed forms approximately, which reveals an AoI-delay
tradeoff relationship with respect to the refreshing window. In addition, the
refreshing window is optimized to minimize the average delay while meeting the
AoI requirements, and the results indicate to set a smaller refreshing window
for the popular content items. Extensive simulations are conducted on the
OMNeT++ platform to validate the analytical results. The results indicate that
the proposed scheme can restrain frequent refreshing as the request arrival
rate increases, whereby the average delay can be reduced by around 80% while
maintaining the AoI below one second in heavily-loaded scenarios.

require processing of heterogeneous data streams from different sources

(CEP) systems have evolved from the classical rule-based CEP systems, by
integrating high-level knowledge representation and RDF stream processing using
both the data stream and background static knowledge. Additionally, CEP
approaches lack the capability to semantically interpret and analyze data,
which Semantic CEP (SCEP) attempts to address. SCEP has several limitations;
one of them is related to their high processing time. This paper provides a
conceptual model and an implementation of an infrastructure for distributed
SCEP, where each SCEP operator can process part of the data and send it to
other SCEP operators in order to achieves some answer. We show that by
splitting the RDF stream processing and the background knowledge using the

resulting energy leakage could be determined and corrected. We evaluated the
effectiveness of the correction on various electron energies and incidence

different. When Mn sits on O, it retains 2.4 $\mu_B$ spin moment, close to its

moment decreases. Using the atom projected density of states, we find Mn on O

scenarios where the clock is subject to environmental noise as it transits
through the interferometer. In particular, we develop a generalized formulation
of interferometric visibility affected by noise on the clock. We find that, for
small noise and small proper time difference between the arms, the noise
further reduces the visibility, while in more general situations it can either
increase or reduce the visibility. As an example, we investigate the effect of
a thermal environment constituted by a single field mode and show that the
visibility drops further as the temperature is increased. Additionally, by
considering noise models based on standard quantum channels, we show that
interferometric visibility can increase or decrease depending on the type of

of the effect of noise on the visibility -- particularly in the case of a

monolithic Stochastic Reward Net (SRN) is proposed to evaluate the delivery
delay and the average number of transmissions under epidemic routing by
considering skewed location visiting preferences. This model is not scalable
enough, in terms of the number of nodes and frequently visited locations. In
order to achieve higher scalability, the folding technique is applied to the
monolithic model, and an approximate folded SRN is proposed to evaluate
performance of epidemic routing. Discrete-event simulation is used to validate
the proposed models. Both SRN models show high accuracy in predicting the
performance of epidemic routing. We also propose an Ordinary Differential

Obtained results show that the folded model is more accurate than the ODE
model. Moreover, it is proved that the number of transmissions by the time of
delivery follows uniform distribution, in a general class of networks, where

the coupling to a vortex beam, and the design of a focusing grating. In the

levels of M2.1 and M2.6 at an interval of $\approx$54 min. The active region
exhibited striking moving magnetic features (MMFs) along with sunspot rotation.
Non-linear force free field (NLFFF) modelling of the active region corona
reveals a magnetic flux rope along the polarity inversion line in the trailing
sunspot group which is observationally manifested by the co-spatial structures
of an active region filament and a hot channel identified in the 304 and 94
\AA\ images, respectively, from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The
active region underwent a prolonged phase of flux enhancement followed by a
relatively shorter period of flux cancellation prior to the onset of the flare
which led to the build up and activation of the flux rope. Extreme ultra-violet
(EUV) images reveal localised and structured pre-flare emission, from the
region of MMFs, adjacent to the location of the main flare. Our analysis
reveals strong, localised regions of photospheric currents of opposite
polarities at the precursor location, thereby making the region susceptible to
small-scale magnetic reconnection. Precursor reconnection activity from this
location most likely induced a slipping reconnetion towards the northern leg of
the hot channel which led to the destabilization of the flux rope. The
application of magnetic virial theorem suggests that there was an overall
growth of magnetic free energy in the active region during the prolonged
pre-flare phase which decayed rapidly after the hot channel eruption and its
successful transformation into a halo coronal mass ejection (CME).

its large shape variability and unclear boundaries. Although the applications
of fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown groundbreaking
results, limited studies have focused on the performance of generalization. In
this study, we introduce a CNN for liver segmentation on abdominal computed

To improve the generalization performance, we initially propose an auto-context
algorithm in a single CNN. The proposed auto-context neural network exploits an
effective high-level residual estimation to obtain the shape prior. Identical
dual paths are effectively trained to represent mutual complementary features
for an accurate posterior analysis of a liver. Further, we extend our network
by employing a self-supervised contour scheme. We trained sparse contour
features by penalizing the ground-truth contour to focus more contour
attentions on the failures. The experimental results show that the proposed
network results in better accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art
networks by reducing 10.31% of the Hausdorff distance. We used 180 abdominal CT
images for training and validation. Two-fold cross-validation is presented for
a comparison with the state-of-the-art neural networks. Novel multiple N-fold
cross-validations are conducted to verify the performance of generalization.
The proposed network showed the best generalization performance among the
networks. Additionally, we present a series of ablation experiments that
comprehensively support the importance of the underlying concepts.

Since input event rate could overshoot the system's capabilities and results in
violating a defined latency bound, load shedding is used to drop a portion of
the input event streams. The crucial question here is how many and which events
to drop so the defined latency bound is maintained and the degradation in the
quality of results is minimized. In stream processing domain, different load
shedding strategies have been proposed but they mainly depend on the importance
of individual tuples (events). However, as complex event processing systems
perform pattern detection, the importance of events is also influenced by other
events in the same pattern. In this paper, we propose a load shedding framework
called eSPICE for complex event processing systems. eSPICE depends on building
a probabilistic model that learns about the importance of events in a window.
The position of an event in a window and its type are used as features to build
the model. Further, we provide algorithms to decide when to start dropping
events and how many events to drop. Moreover, we extensively evaluate the
performance of eSPICE on two real-world datasets.

number of antennas at a base station (BS) is constrained by the space and cost
factors, which limits the throughput gain promised by theoretical analysis.
This paper thus studies the feasibility of adopting the intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) to further improve the beamforming gain of the uplink
communications in a massive MIMO system. Under such a novel system, the central
question lies in whether the IRS is able to enhance the network throughput as
expected, if the channel estimation overhead is taken into account. In this
paper, we first show that the favorable propagation property for the
conventional massive MIMO system without IRS, i.e., the channels of arbitrary
two users are orthogonal, no longer holds for the IRS-assisted massive MIMO
system, due to its special channel property that each IRS element reflects the
signals from all the users to the BS via the same channel. As a result, the
maximal-ratio combining (MRC) receive beamforming strategy leads to strong
inter-user interference and thus even lower user rates than those of the
massive MIMO system without IRS. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel
strategy for zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming design at the BS and reflection
coefficients design at the IRS to efficiently null the inter-user interference.
Under our proposed strategy, it is rigorously shown that even if the channel
estimation overhead is considered, the IRS-assisted massive MIMO system can
always achieve higher throughput compared to its counterpart without IRS,
despite the fact that the favorable propagation property no longer holds.

Higgs oscillations with time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) has the advantage over optical measurements that a momentum-resolved
analysis of the condensate dynamic is possible. In this paper, we investigate
the time-resolved spectral function measured in ARPES for different quench
protocols. We find that analyzing amplitude oscillations of the ARPES intensity
in the whole Brillouin zone allows to understand how the condensate dynamic
contributes to the emerging of collective Higgs oscillations. Furthermore, by
evaluating the phase of these oscillations the symmetry deformation dynamic of
the condensate can be revealed, which gives insight about the ground state
symmetry of the system. With such an analysis, time-resolved ARPES experiments
might be used in future as a powerful tool in the field of Higgs spectroscopy.

convenient and diffused means to transfer files, especially when no Internet
connection is available. However, USB flash drives are also one of the most
common attack vectors used to gain unauthorized access to host devices. For
instance, it is possible to replace a USB drive so that when the USB key is
connected, it would install passwords stealing tools, root-kit software, and
other disrupting malware. In such a way, an attacker can steal sensitive
information via the USB-connected devices, as well as inject any kind of
malicious software into the host.
  To thwart the above-cited raising threats, we propose MAGNETO, an efficient,
non-interactive, and privacy-preserving framework to verify the authenticity of
a USB flash drive, rooted in the analysis of its unintentional magnetic
emissions. We show that the magnetic emissions radiated during boot operations
on a specific host are unique for each device, and sufficient to uniquely
fingerprint both the brand and the model of the USB flash drive, or the
specific USB device, depending on the used equipment. Our investigation on 59
different USB flash drives---belonging to 17 brands, including the top brands
purchased on Amazon in mid-2019---, reveals a minimum classification accuracy
of 98.2% in the identification of both brand and model, accompanied by a
negligible time and computational overhead. MAGNETO can also identify the
specific USB Flash drive, with a minimum classification accuracy of 91.2%.
Overall, MAGNETO proves that unintentional magnetic emissions can be considered
as a viable and reliable means to fingerprint read-only USB flash drives.
Finally, future research directions in this domain are also discussed.

We show that our technique reconstructs the strange attractors of synthetic and

is orders of magnitude higher than that is achievable by commercially available
mobile processors. To mitigate this compute power constraint, display-ready
POHs shall be generated on a nearby server and sent to the HMHD in compressed
form over a wireless link. This paper discusses design of a feasible HMHD-based
augmented reality system, focusing on compression requirements and per-pixel
rate-distortion trade-off for transmission of display-ready POH from the server
to HMHD. Since the decoder in the HMHD needs to operate on low power, only
coding methods that have low-power decoder implementation are considered.
Effects of 2D phase unwrapping and flat quantization on compression performance
are also reported. We next propose a versatile PCM-POH codec with progressive
quantization that can adapt to SLM-dynamic-range and available bitrate, and
features per-pixel rate-distortion control to achieve acceptable POH quality at
target rates of 60-200 Mbit/s that can be reliably achieved by current wireless
technologies. Our results demonstrate feasibility of realizing a low-power,
quality-ensured, multi-user, interactive HMHD augmented reality system with
commercially available components using the proposed adaptive compression of
display-ready POH with light-weight decoding.

infeasible within accessible simulation times. Although several extensions to
the conventional Monte Carlo scheme have been developed, that enable the
treatment of such systems, these extensions often entail substantial
computational cost or rely on the harmonic approximation. In this work we
propose an exact method called Funnel Hopping Monte Carlo (FHMC) that is

minima which are then used to propose high quality Monte Carlo moves that

detection can be difficult because the vortex cores are localized at positions
where the local density is very low. We address here this problem by performing
numerical simulations of a dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) in a pancake
confinement at $T=0$ K and study the effect of quantized vorticity on the
phases that can be realized depending upon the ratio between dipolar and
short-range interaction. By increasing this ratio the system undergoes a
spontaneous density modulation in the form of an ordered arrangement of
multi-atom ""droplets"". This modulated phase can be either a ""supersolid"" (SS)
or a ""normal solid"" (NS). In the SS state droplets are immersed in a background
of low-density superfluid and the system has a finite global superfluid
fraction resulting in non-classical rotational inertia. In the NS state no such
superfluid background is present and the global superfluid fraction vanishes.
We propose here a protocol to create vortices in modulated phases of dipolar
BEC by ""freezing"" into such phases a vortex-hosting superfluid (SF) state. The
resulting system, depending upon the interactions strengths, can be either a SS
or a NS To discriminate between these two possible outcome of a ""freezing""
experiment, we show that upon releasing of the radial harmonic confinement, the
expanding vortex-hosting SS shows tell-tale quantum interference effects which
display the symmetry of the vortex lattice of the originating SF, as opposed to
the behavior of the NS which shows instead a ballistic radial expansion of the
individual droplets. Such markedly different behavior might be used to prove
the supersolid character of rotating dipolar condensates.

amplitude of the single-photon contribution for general quantum states.
Addressing this question requires the knowledge of additional observables. We
derive an effective second-order correlation function, strongly connected to
the Mandel-$Q$ parameter and given in terms of both the second-order
correlation and the average photon number, that provides a lower bound on the
single-to-multi-photon projection ratio. Using both observables individually
allows for lower and upper bounds for the single-photon projection. Comparing
the tightness of our bounds with those in the literature, we find that relative
bounds may be better described using the average photon number, while absolute
bounds for low excitation states are tighter using the vacuum projection. Our

cathode (cylindrical gridded wire), placed at the center of the device. The
plasma potential profiles obtained from the simulated results indicate the
formation of multiple potential well structures inside the cathode grid
depending upon the applied cathode potential (from $-1$ to $-5~kV$). The ion
density at the core region of the device is found to be of the order of
$10^{16}~m^{-3}$, which closely resembles the experimental observations.
Spatial variation of Ion Energy Distribution Function (IEDF) has been measured
in order to observe the characteristics of ions at different cathode voltages.
Finally, the simulated results are compared and found to be in good agreement
with the experimental profiles. The present analysis can serve as a reference
guide to optimize the technological parameters of the discharge process in IECF
devices.

way to reduce the fuel consumption and thereby reduce both the operating cost
and the environmental impact. One way of doing so is by using information about
the upcoming driving conditions, known as look-ahead information, in order to
coast with a gear engaged or to use freewheeling. Controllers using such
techniques today mainly exist for vehicles in highway driving. This paper
therefore targets how such control can be applied to vehicles with more
variations in their velocity, such as distribution vehicles. The driving
mission of such a vehicle is here formulated as an optimal control problem. The
control variables are the tractive force, the braking force, and a Boolean
variable representing closed or open powertrain. The problem is solved by a
Model Predictive Controller, which at each iteration solves a Mixed Integer
Quadratic Program. The fuel consumption is compared for four different control
policies: a benchmark following the reference of the driving cycle, look-ahead
control without freewheeling, freewheeling with the engine idling, and
freewheeling with the engine turned off. Simulations on a driving cycle
typically used for testing distribution vehicles show the potential of saving
10%, 16%, and 20\% respectively for the control policies compared with the
benchmark, in all cases without increasing the trip time.

immediately be initiated to reduce the possible negative effects caused by
process deviations. Existing work in online conformance checking only allows
for obtaining approximations of non-conformity, e.g., overestimating the actual

Carlo, namely energy and variance minimization, prompted by the interest in the
robust and accurate estimate of electronic excited states. For two
prototypical, challenging molecules, we readily reach the accuracy of the best
available reference excitation energies using energy minimization in a
state-specific or state-average fashion for states of different or equal
symmetry, respectively. On the other hand, in variance minimization, where the
use of suitable functionals is expected to target specific states regardless of
the symmetry, we encounter severe problems for a variety of wave functions: as
the variance converges, the energy drifts away from that of the selected state.
This unexpected behavior is sometimes observed even when the target is the
ground state, and generally prevents the robust estimate of total and
excitation energies. We analyze this problem using a very simple wave function
and infer that the optimization finds little or no barrier to escape from a
local minimum or local plateau, eventually converging to the unique
lowest-variance state instead of the target state. While the loss of the state
of interest can be delayed and possibly avoided by reducing the statistical
error of the gradient, for the full optimization of realistic wave functions,
variance minimization with current functionals appears to be an impractical

We report on results of an exploratory study with AVAR and seven expert users.
In it, participants wore a Microsoft HoloLens device and used a Bluetooth
keyboard to program a visualization script for a given dataset. To support our
analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users' interactions, and
(iii) collected data of participants' impressions. Our prototype confirms that
agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when
programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and
participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median >=
1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data
transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the
immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive
toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.

trajectories of heterogeneous road agents (pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles)

multiple plausible paths in complex interactions with other agents in varying

variations of the future trajectories using a set of stochastic latent

predict multiple realistic trajectories in the future. Through experiments on

which is, however, a suboptimal two-step integration of discrete and neural

advantage of being able to flexibly integrate a richer set of features.
However, either discrete or neural features are used alone in previous TRF LMs.
This paper develops a mixed-feature TRF LM and demonstrates its advantage in
integrating discrete and neural features. Various LMs are trained over PTB and
Google one-billion-word datasets, and evaluated in N-best list rescoring
experiments for speech recognition. Among all single LMs (i.e. without model
interpolation), the mixed-feature TRF LMs perform the best, improving over both
discrete TRF LMs and neural TRF LMs alone, and also being significantly better
than LSTM LMs. Compared to interpolating two separately trained models with

LMs matches the best interpolated model, and with simplified one-step training
process and reduced training time.

paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach that automatically and
robustly filters point clouds by removing noise and preserving their sharp

to relate the ground-truth position with a displacement vector. The trained
neural network can automatically generate a set of clean points from a noisy

(KGs) is a fundamental yet challenging task. Recently, a promising approach to
this problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector
space such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query.
However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which
is problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of
its answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a
single point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use
conjunctions ($\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\exists$). Handling
queries with logical disjunctions ($\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we
propose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary
queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\exists$ operators in massive and
incomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes
(i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a
set of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally
represented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that
handling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to
the number of KG entities. However, we show that by transforming queries into a
Disjunctive Normal Form, query2box is capable of handling arbitrary logical
queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\exists$ in a scalable manner. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of query2box on three large KGs and show that query2box
achieves up to 25% relative improvement over the state of the art.

discrimination in the objective of maximizing its long-run average revenue. We
consider a general model of patient customers with changing valuations.
Arriving customers wait for a random but bounded length of time and purchase
the product when its price falls below their valuation, which varies following
a stochastic process. We show the optimality of a class of cyclic strategies
and obtain an algorithm that yields them. When the pace of intertemporal
pricing is constrained to be comparable to the upper bound on customers
patience levels, we have a good control on the cycle length and on the
structure of the optimizing cyclic policies. The results also hold for forward
looking strategic customers as well as under an alternative objective of
maximizing infinite horizon discounted revenue.
  We cast our results in a general framework of optimizing the long-run average
revenue for a class of revenue functions that we denote {\it weakly coupled},
in which the revenue per period depends on a finite number of neighboring
prices. We analyze in detail the case of Markovian valuations where we can

forward a methodology to infer networks of influence between different news

influence to be significantly topic-dependent, with the same news sources
acting as agenda-setters (i.e., central nodes) with respect to certain topics
and as followers (i.e., peripheral nodes) with respect to others. At the same
time, we find that the influence networks associated with most topics exhibit
small world properties, which we find to play a significant role towards the
overall diversity of sentiment expressed about the topic by the news sources in
the network. In particular, we find clustering and density of influence
networks to act as competing forces in this respect, with the former increasing

symmetries of the data set. We describe various category structures on such

and morphism formations. We also describe a data structure, based on coloured
directed graphs, which is convenient to encode the mentioned enrichment. We
show that persistent homology preserves only some aspects of these landscapes
of enriched data sets however not all. In other words persistent homology is
not a functor on the entire category of enriched data sets. Nevertheless we
show that persistent homology is functorial locally. We use the concept of
equivariant operators to capture some of the information missed by persistent

detailed manner in which they fragment into prestellar cores is not yet well

state of several star-forming filaments in the X-shape Nebula region of the
California MC, in an effort to shed some light on this issue. We used
multi-wavelength far-infrared images from Herschel and the getsources and
getfilaments extraction methods to identify dense cores and filaments and
derive their basic properties. We also used a map of $\rm ^{13}CO (2-1)$
emission from SMT 10m submillimeter telescope to constrain the dynamical state
of the filaments. We identified 10 filaments, as well as 57 dense cores. Two
star-forming filaments (# 8 and # 10) stand out in that they harbor
quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with a typical projected core spacing of
$\sim$0.15 pc. These two filaments have thermally supercritical line masses and
are not static. Filament~8 exhibits a prominent transverse velocity gradient,
suggesting that it is accreting gas from the parent cloud gas reservoir. In
both cases, the observed (projected) core spacing is similar to the filament
width and significantly shorter than the canonical separation of $\sim \,$4
times the filament width predicted by classical cylinder fragmentation theory.
We suggest that continuous accretion of gas onto the two star-forming
filaments, as well as geometrical bending of the filaments, may account for the
observed core spacing. Our findings suggest that the characteristic
fragmentation lengthscale of molecular filaments is quite sensitive to external
perturbations from the parent cloud, such as gravitational accretion of ambient
material.

relies on an accurate understanding of the differential electron capture

dominated by resonances due to local atomic multiplet states with core holes.
Coulomb scattering between electrons couple the discrete atomic states, via
Auger-Meitner decay, to final states with free electrons. The atomic multiplets
are above the auto-ionisation energy, such that the delta functions
representing these discrete levels turn into a superposition of Lorentzian,
Mahan- and Fano-like line-shapes. We present an \textit{ab initio} method to
calculate nuclear decay modifications due to such processes. It includes states
with multiple correlated holes in local atomic orbitals interacting with
unbound Auger-Meitner electrons. A strong energy-dependent, asymmetric
broadening of the resonances in good agreement with recent experiments is
found. We present a detailed analysis of the mechanisms determining the final
spectral line-shape and discuss both the Fano interference between different
resonances, as well as the energy dependence of the Auger-Meitner Coulomb

identify a surprising security weakness of skip connections in this paper. Use
of skip connections allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, in ResNet-like (with skip connections) neural networks,
gradients can backpropagate through either skip connections or residual
modules. We find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather
than the residual modules according to a decay factor, allows one to craft
adversarial examples with high transferability. Our method is termed Skip

state-of-the-art DNNs including ResNets, DenseNets, Inceptions,
Inception-ResNet, Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) and robustly trained

transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, SGM can be
easily combined with existing black-box attack techniques, and obtain high
improvements over state-of-the-art transferability methods. Our findings not

bispectrum to boost our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), and
therefore early generation of stars and galaxies. In this paper we look at the
impact of foregrounds and instrumental effects on the 21cm bispectrum and our
ability to measure it. Unlike the power spectrum for which (in the absence of
instrumental effects) there is a window clear of smooth-spectrum foregrounds in
which the 21cm power spectrum may be detectable, there is no such ""EoR window""
for the bispectrum. Instead, on smaller scales EoR structure modulates that of
the foregrounds (FG) to alter the EoR+FG bispectrum from that of the
foregrounds in a complex manner. On larger scales the EoR structures are
completely swamped by those of the foregrounds, and the EoR+FG bispectrum is
entirely dominated by that of the foregrounds. It is therefore unlikely that
the bispectrum will be useful in cases where we are observationally restricted
to using foreground avoidance techniques. We also find that there is potential
for instrumental effects to seriously corrupt the bispectrum, possibly even
rendering the bispectrum useless for parameter estimation. On larger scales,
foreground removal using GMCA is found to recover the EoR bispectrum to a
reasonable level of accuracy (even better than the power spectrum for certain
configurations). Further studies are necessary to understand the error and/or
bias associated with foreground removal before the 21cm bispectrum can be
practically applied in analysis of future data.

vertex of $G$ corresponds to one path on the grid and two vertices of $G$ are
adjacent if and only if the corresponding paths share a grid edge, then this
graph is called EPG and the representation is called EPG representation. A
$k$-bend EPG representation is an EPG representation in which each path has at
most $k$ bends. The class of all graphs that have a $k$-bend EPG representation
is denoted by $B_k$. $B_\ell^m$ is the class of all graphs that have a
monotonic $\ell$-bend EPG representation, i.e. an $\ell$-bend EPG
representation, where each path is ascending in both columns and rows.
  It is trivial that $B^m_k\subseteq B_k$ for all $k$. Moreover, it is known
that $B^m_k\subsetneqq B_k$, for $k=1$. By investigating the $B_k$-membership
and the $B^m_k$-membership of complete bipartite graphs we prove that the
inclusion is also proper for $k\in \{2,3,5\}$ and for $k\geqslant 7$. In
particular, we derive necessary conditions for this membership that have to be
fulfilled by $m$, $n$ and $k$, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of vertices on
the two partition classes of the bipartite graph. We conjecture that $B_{k}^{m}
\subsetneqq B_{k}$ holds also for $k\in \{4,6\}$.
  Furthermore, we show that $B_k \not\subseteq B_{2k-9}^m$ holds for all
$k\geqslant 5$. This implies that restricting the shape of the paths can lead
to a significant increase of the number of bends needed in an EPG
representation. So far no bounds on the amount of that increase were known. We
prove that $B_1 \subseteq B_3^m$ holds, providing the first result of this

  Under Uncertainty","28 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables",,"10.1002/rnc.5197",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In real-world problems, uncertainties (e.g., errors in the measurement,
precision errors) often lead to poor performance of numerical algorithms when
not explicitly taken into account. This is also the case for control problems,
where optimal solutions can degrade in quality or even become infeasible. Thus,
there is the need to design methods that can handle uncertainty. In this work,
we consider nonlinear multi-objective optimal control problems with uncertainty
on the initial conditions, and in particular their incorporation into a
feedback loop via model predictive control (MPC). In multi-objective optimal
control, an optimal compromise between multiple conflicting criteria has to be
found. For such problems, not much has been reported in terms of uncertainties.
To address this problem class, we design an offline/online framework to compute
an approximation of efficient control strategies. This approach is closely
related to explicit MPC for nonlinear systems, where the potentially expensive
optimization problem is solved in an offline phase in order to enable fast
solutions in the online phase. In order to reduce the numerical cost of the
offline phase, we exploit symmetries in the control problems. Furthermore, in
order to ensure optimality of the solutions, we include an additional online
optimization step, which is considerably cheaper than the original
multi-objective optimization problem. We test our framework on a car
maneuvering problem where safety and speed are the objectives. The
multi-objective framework allows for online adaptations of the desired
objective. Alternatively, an automatic scalarizing procedure yields very
efficient feedback controls. Our results show that the method is capable of
designing driving strategies that deal better with uncertainties in the initial
conditions, which translates into potentially safer and faster driving
strategies.

Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) technique which is highly robust to
hydrodynamic model uncertainties. Here we present a comprehensive study showing
the utility of this approach to describe the fate of floating material in a
coastal tidal embayment. An example is given from Moreton Bay, a semi-enclosed
subtropical embayment with high morphologic, ecological and economic
significance to Southeast Queensland, Australia. Transport barriers visualised
by the LCS create pathways and barriers for material transport in the

demonstration of the significant role of islands in partitioning the transport
of material and mixing within the embayment. The distribution of the debris
sources along the shoreline are explained by the relative location of the LCS

dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields on a cross-linked ladder, and show
evidence of topological order throughout the full parameter space. In
particular, we show how a magnetic flux is spontaneously generated through the
ladder due to an Aharonov-Bohm instability, giving rise to topological order
even in the absence of a plaquette term. Moreover, the latter coexists here
with a symmetry-protected topological phase in the matter sector, that displays
fractionalised gauge-matter edge states, and intertwines with it by a
flux-threading phenomenon. Finally, we unveil the robustness of these features
through a gauge frustration mechanism, akin to geometric frustration in spin
liquids, allowing topological order to survive to arbitrarily large quantum
fluctuations. In particular, we show how, at finite chemical potential,
topological solitons are created in the gauge field configuration, which bound
to fermions forming $\mathbb{Z}_2$ deconfined quasi-particles. The simplicity

with the nerve pulse. Rather, one finds that heat production is biphasic, and a
heat release during the first phase of the action potential is followed by the
reabsorption of a similar amount of heat during the second phase. We review the
long history the measurement of heat production in nerves and provide a new
analysis of these findings focusing on the thermodynamics of adiabatic and
isentropic processes. We begin by considering adiabatic oscillations in gases,
waves in layers, oscillations of springs and the reversible (or irreversible)
charging and discharging of capacitors. We then apply these ideas to the heat
signature of nerve pulses. Finally, we compare the temperature changes expected
from the Hodgkin-Huxley model and the soliton theory for nerves. We demonstrate
that heat production in nerves cannot be explained as an irreversible charging
and discharging of a membrane capacitor as it is proposed in the Hodgkin-Huxley
model. Instead, we conclude that it is consistent with an adiabatic pulse.
However, if the nerve pulse is adiabatic, completely different physics is
required to explain its features. Membrane processes must then be reversible
and resemble the oscillation of springs more than resembling ""a burning fuse of
gunpowder"" (quote A. L. Hodgkin). Theories acknowledging the adiabatic nature
of the nerve pulse have recently been discussed by various authors. It forms
the central core of the soliton model, which considers the nerve pulse as a
localized sound pulse.

investigate the effects of dichotomization of spatially-referenced continuous
outcome variables on geostatistical inference. Although this issue has been
extensively studied in other fields, dichotomization is still a common practice
in epidemiological studies. Furthermore, the effects of this practice in the
context of prevalence mapping have not been fully understood. Here, we
demonstrate how spatial correlation affects the loss of information due to
dichotomization, how linear geostatistical models can be used to map disease
prevalence and thus avoid dichotomization, and finally, how dichotomization
affects our predictive inference on prevalence. To pursue these objectives, we
develop a metric, based on the composite likelihood, which can be used to
quantify the potential loss of information after dichotomization without
requiring the fitting of Binomial geostatistical models. Through a simulation
study and two applications on disease mapping in Africa, we show that, as
thresholds used for dichotomization move further away from the mean of the
underlying process, the performance of binomial geostatistical models
deteriorates substantially. We also find that dichotomization can lead to the
loss of fine scale features of disease prevalence and increased uncertainty in
the parameter estimates, especially in the presence of a large noise to signal
ratio. These findings strongly support the conclusions from previous studies
that dichotomization should be always avoided whenever feasible.

  Utterances","Submitted to Odyssey 2020",,,,"cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speaker recognition systems based on deep speaker embeddings have achieved
significant performance in controlled conditions according to the results
obtained for early NIST SRE (Speaker Recognition Evaluation) datasets. From the
practical point of view, taking into account the increased interest in virtual
assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, AppleSiri, etc.), speaker
verification on short utterances in uncontrolled noisy environment conditions
is one of the most challenging and highly demanded tasks. This paper presents
approaches aimed to achieve two goals: a) improve the quality of far-field
speaker verification systems in the presence of environmental noise,
reverberation and b) reduce the system qualitydegradation for short utterances.
For these purposes, we considered deep neural network architectures based on
TDNN (TimeDelay Neural Network) and ResNet (Residual Neural Network) blocks. We
experimented with state-of-the-art embedding extractors and their training
procedures. Obtained results confirm that ResNet architectures outperform the
standard x-vector approach in terms of speaker verification quality for both
long-duration and short-duration utterances. We also investigate the impact of
speech activity detector, different scoring models, adaptation and score
normalization techniques. The experimental results are presented for publicly
available data and verification protocols for the VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, and
VOiCES datasets.

the cross section limits for production of an additional neutral Higgs-like
scalar, assuming its invisible decays, as a function of its mass. Extracted
model-independent branching ratio and cross section limits were then

agent to repeatedly revisit all states in its environment. A self-supervised
inverse dynamics model is used to train the embeddings of the nearest neighbour

employ the framework of Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA) to
simultaneously learn many directed exploration policies with the same neural

using the same neural network for different degrees of
exploration/exploitation, transfer is demonstrated from predominantly
exploratory policies yielding effective exploitative policies. The proposed
method can be incorporated to run with modern distributed RL agents that
collect large amounts of experience from many actors running in parallel on
separate environment instances. Our method doubles the performance of the base
agent in all hard exploration in the Atari-57 suite while maintaining a very
high score across the remaining games, obtaining a median human normalised
score of 1344.0%. Notably, the proposed method is the first algorithm to
achieve non-zero rewards (with a mean score of 8,400) in the game of Pitfall!

Statisticians seem to agree on a definition in the context of parametric
statistical models --- roughly, a parameter $\theta$ in a model $\mathcal{P} =
\{P_\theta: \theta \in \Theta\}$ is identifiable if the mapping $\theta \mapsto
P_\theta$ is injective. This definition raises important questions: Are
parameters the only quantities that can be identified? Is the concept of
identification meaningful outside of parametric statistics? Does it even
require the notion of a statistical model? Partial and idiosyncratic answers to
these questions have been discussed in econometrics, biological modeling, and
in some subfields of statistics like causal inference. This paper proposes a
unifying theory of identification that incorporates existing definitions for
parametric and nonparametric models and formalizes the process of
identification analysis. The applicability of this framework is illustrated
through a series of examples and two extended case studies.

medium- to long-span bridges subject to random traffic loads. Previous studies
have focused on calculating the exact response of the vehicle or the bridge
based on an interaction force derived from the compatibility between two
systems. This process requires multiple iterations per time step per vehicle
until the compatibility is reached. When a network of vehicles is considered,
the compatibility equation turns to a system of coupled equations which
dramatically increases the complexity of the convergence process. In this
study, we simplify the problem into two sub-problems that are decoupled: (a) a
bridge subject to random Gaussian excitation, and (b) individual sensing agents
that are subject to a linear superposition of the bridge response and the road
profile roughness. The study provides sufficient evidence to confirm the
simulation approach is valid with a minimal error when the bridge span is
medium to long, and the spatio-temporal load pattern can be modeled as random
Gaussian. Quantitatively, the proposed approach is over 1,000 times more
computationally efficient when compared to the conventional approach for a 500
m long bridge, with response prediction errors below $0.1\%$.

concept of causality in the context of cognitive neuroscience and review
existing methods for inferring causal relationships from data. Causal inference
is an ambitious task that is particularly challenging in cognitive
neuroscience. We discuss two difficulties in more detail: the scarcity of
interventional data and the challenge of finding the right variables. We argue
for distributional robustness as a guiding principle to tackle these problems.
Robustness (or invariance) is a fundamental principle underlying causal
methodology. A causal model of a target variable generalises across
environments or subjects as long as these environments leave the causal
mechanisms intact. Consequently, if a candidate model does not generalise, then
either it does not consist of the target variable's causes or the underlying
variables do not represent the correct granularity of the problem. In this
sense, assessing generalisability may be useful when defining relevant
variables and can be used to partially compensate for the lack of
interventional data.

models, we show that the PCA modes are not fixed, but depend on the choice of

problem. Atmospheric pressure excursions within dust devils have been proposed
to support lifting. We verify this idea in laboratory experiments. Pressure
differences up to a few Pa are applied along particle layers of 50 to 400 $\rm
\mu m$. As samples we used glass beads of $\sim$50 $\rm \mu m$ diameter and
irregular basalt grains of $\sim$20 $\rm \mu m$ in size. The total ambient
pressure of air was set to 600 Pa. Particles are ejected at pressure
differences as low as 2.0 $\rm \pm$ 0.8 Pa. In the case of glass beads, the
ejected grains returning to the particle bed can trigger new particle ejections
as they reduce cohesion and release the tension from other grains. Therefore,
few impacting grains might be sufficient to sustain dust lifting in a dust
devil at even lower pressure differences. Particle lift requires a very thin,
$\sim$100 $\rm \mu m$, low permeability particle layer on top of supporting
ground with larger pore space. Assuming this, our experiments support the idea
that pressure excursions in Martian dust devils release grains from the ground.

movement patterns: the places they visit and how frequently they go there. In
human society, where the prevalent form of cohabitation is in cities, the
highly dynamic and diverse movement of people is fundamental to almost every
aspect of socio-economic life, including social interactions or disease
spreading, and ultimately is key to the evolution of urban infrastructure,
productivity, innovation and technology. However, despite the crucial role of
the spatio-temporal structure of movement in cities, the laws that govern the
variation of population flows to specific locations have remained elusive. Here
we show that behind the apparent complexity of movement a surprisingly simple
universal scaling relation drives the flow of individuals to any specific
location based on both frequency of visitation and distance travelled. We
derive a first principles argument stating that the number of visiting
individuals should decrease as an inverse square of the product of visitation
frequency and travel distance; or, equivalently, as a power law with exponent
$\approx \! -$2. Using large-scale data analyses, we demonstrate that
population flows obey this theoretical prediction in virtually all tested areas
across the globe, ranging from Europe and America to Asia and Africa,
regardless of the detailed geographies, cultures or levels of development. The
revealed regularity offers unprecedented possibilities for the modelling of
mobility fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolution, and it places an
important constraint on any theory of movement, spatial organisation and social
interaction in cities.

conjunctive query entailment in this DL turns out to be undecidable. We prove
that decidability of querying can be regained if global and local constraints

latter result is based on a locally-acyclic model construction, and it reduces

energy corrections into a D0 top quark mass measurement. It will serve as a
source for the PRL presenting it's final results, and will be later published
in a journal, or as a part of the author's PhD thesis. Motivation for the
present measurement arises from the recalibration of the D0 flavor-dependent
jet energy corrections. The recalibration was driven by the observation that
the corrections for D0 Run IIb differ notably from those of Run IIa. The
recalibration analysis was able to show that the Run IIb corrections should
have resembled more those of Run IIa. The recalibrated jet energy corrections
have an influence on the reconstructed top quarks through the jets that are
produced in top quark decays. Hence, a change in the flavor-dependent jet
energy corrections implies the need to revise the top mass measurement,
performed by D0 in the lepton+jets channel. The D0 top mass average is almost
completely determined by this measurement, and hence it has a direct impact on
the top mass world average. A complete revision of the D0 top mass measurement
is unlikely to occur, and hence this paper demonstrates the resulting top mass
shift using a lighter methodology.

of extremely small crystal grains of < 5 nm size. Ti atoms preferentially
adsorb at the grain boundaries of nanocrystalline graphene and form smaller and
denser islands compared to single-crystalline graphene. Surprisingly, however,
hydrogen adsorbs less to Ti on nanocrystalline graphene than to Ti on
single-crystalline graphene. In particular, hydrogen hardly chemisorbs to 1 ML
of Ti on nanocrystalline graphene. This may be attributed to strong bonds
between Ti and defects located along the grain boundaries in nanocrystalline
graphene. This mechanism might apply to other metals, as well, and therefore
our results suggest that when functionalizing graphene by metal atoms for the
purpose of hydrogen storage or other chemical reactions, it is important to
consider not only the morphology of the resulting surface, but also the
influence of graphene on the electronic states of the metal.

greatly reducing criminal activities and saving considerable resources for
businesses and customers. We address online fraud detection, which consists of
classifying incoming transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent in
real-time. Modern fraud detection systems consist of a machine learning model
and rules defined by human experts. Often, the rules performance degrades over
time due to concept drift, especially of adversarial nature. Furthermore, they
can be costly to maintain, either because they are computationally expensive or
because they send transactions for manual review. We propose ARMS, an automated
rules management system that evaluates the contribution of individual rules and
optimizes the set of active rules using heuristic search and a user-defined
loss-function. It complies with critical domain-specific requirements, such as
handling different actions (e.g., accept, alert, and decline), priorities,
blacklists, and large datasets (i.e., hundreds of rules and millions of
transactions). We use ARMS to optimize the rule-based systems of two real-world
clients. Results show that it can maintain the original systems' performance
(e.g., recall, or false-positive rate) using only a fraction of the original
rules (~ 50% in one case, and ~ 20% in the other).

virtual reality (VR) rendering, to minimize the average transmission bandwidth
with the caching capacity and the energy constraints of each mobile device, and
the maximum tolerable delay constraint of each task. The key enabler is that
because both coded data and stored data can be the data before or after
computing, the proposed scheme has numerous edge computing and caching paths
corresponding to different bandwidth requirement. We thus formulate a joint
coded caching and computing optimization problem to decide whether the mobile
devices cache the input data or the output data, which tasks to be coded cached
and which tasks to compute locally. The optimization problem is shown to be 0-1
nonconvex nonsmooth programming and can be decomposed into the computation
programming and the coded caching programming. We prove the convergence of the
computation programming problem by utilizing the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM), and a stationary point can be obtained. For the coded
cache programming, we design a low complexity algorithm to obtain an acceptable

relatively restricted in the types of stimuli they can generate. We propose the
concept of docking haptics, in which different types of haptic devices are
dynamically docked at run time. This creates a hybrid system, where the
potential feedback depends on the user's location. We show a prototype docking
haptic workspace, combining a grounded six degree-of-freedom force feedback arm
with a hand exoskeleton. We are able to create the sensation of weight on the
hand when it is within reach of the grounded device, but away from the grounded
device, hand-referenced force feedback is still available. A user study
demonstrates that users can successfully discriminate weight when using docking
haptics, but not with the exoskeleton alone. Such hybrid systems would be able
to change configuration further, for example docking two grounded devices to a

scheme that enables wireless devices to simultaneously transmit information and
harvest energy using the same time-frequency resources. In this scheme, for a
MIMO point-to-point set up, the energy transmitting device simultaneously
receives information from the energy harvesting device. Furthermore, the
self-interference (SI) at the energy harvesting device caused by the FD mode of
operation is utilized as a desired power signal to be harvested by the device.
For implementation-friendly antenna selection and MIMO precoding at both the
devices, we propose two methods: (i) a sub-optimal method based on relaxation,
and (ii) a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method, specifically,
a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-deep double Q-network (DDQN)
method. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed system under the two
implementation methods and compare it with that of the conventional time
switching-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
method.
  Findings show that the proposed system gives a significant improvement in
spectral efficiency compared to the time switching-based SWIPT. In particular,
the DRL-based method provides the highest spectral efficiency. Furthermore,
numerical results show that, for the considered system set up, the number of
antennas in each device should exceed three to mitigate self-interference to an
acceptable level.

targets given the inputs is multi-modal---standard regression approaches are
not always desirable because they provide the conditional mean. Modal
regression algorithms address this issue by instead finding the conditional

scale. Further, parametric approximators, like neural networks, facilitate
learning complex relationships between inputs and targets. In this work, we
propose a parametric modal regression algorithm. We use the implicit function
theorem to develop an objective, for learning a joint function over inputs and
targets. We empirically demonstrate on several synthetic problems that our
method (i) can learn multi-valued functions and produce the conditional modes,
(ii) scales well to high-dimensional inputs, and (iii) can even be more
effective for certain uni-modal problems, particularly for high-frequency
functions. We demonstrate that our method is competitive in a real-world modal

attention due to the advantages of high temporal resolution and low power
consumption, compared with traditional frame-based cameras. Since AER cameras
record the visual input as asynchronous discrete events, they are inherently
suitable to coordinate with the spiking neural network (SNN), which is
biologically plausible and energy-efficient on neuromorphic hardware. However,
using SNN to perform the AER object classification is still challenging, due to
the lack of effective learning algorithms for this new representation. To
tackle this issue, we propose an AER object classification model using a novel
segmented probability-maximization (SPA) learning algorithm. Technically, 1)
the SPA learning algorithm iteratively maximizes the probability of the classes
that samples belong to, in order to improve the reliability of neuron responses
and effectiveness of learning; 2) a peak detection (PD) mechanism is introduced
in SPA to locate informative time points segment by segment, based on which
information within the whole event stream can be fully utilized by the
learning. Extensive experimental results show that, compared to
state-of-the-art methods, not only our model is more effective, but also it
requires less information to reach a certain level of accuracy.

prediction of a real-valued outcome, such as a risk score or insurance premium.
In such regression settings, measuring group fairness criteria is
computationally challenging, as it requires estimating information-theoretic
divergences between conditional probability density functions. This paper
introduces fast approximations of the independence, separation and sufficiency
group fairness criteria for regression models from their (conditional) mutual
information definitions, and uses such approximations as regularisers to
enforce fairness within a regularised risk minimisation framework. Experiments
in real-world datasets indicate that in spite of its superior computational

non-canonical transformation since the initial and destination systems use
different times. Actions related to each other via such transformations yield
identical equations of motion and preserve the commutator structure. They
further preserve the time-evolution of expectation values of quantum operators
unless the vacuum state also changes under the transformation. These properties
suggest that it is of interest to investigate vacuum prescriptions that also
remain unchanged under canonical transformations. We find that initial
conditions derived via minimising the vacuum expectation value of the

argue that the invariance of the vacuum prescription obtained by minimising the

the use of harmonic and percussive source separation (HPSS) to split the audio
into harmonic audio and percussive audio, which has received popularity in the
field of music information retrieval (MIR). Although works have been done in
using HPSS as input representation for CNN model in ASC task, this paper
further investigate the possibility on leveraging the separated harmonic

harmonic audio and percussive audio in their natural form, one specialized in
extracting deep features in time biased domain and another specialized in
extracting deep features in frequency biased domain, respectively. The deep
features extracted from these 2 CNNs will then be combined using bilinear

complexity respectively in 70, 86, and 158, to be compared to 117, 144, and 197
for the aforementionned previous attack. Moreover, unlike this previous attack,
ours does not need generic Gr\""obner basis algorithms since it only requires to
solve a linear system. For a case called overdetermined, this modeling allows
us to avoid Gr\""obner basis computations by going directly to solving a linear
system. For the other case, called underdetermined, we also improve the results
from the previous attack by combining the Ourivski-Johansson modeling together
with a new modeling for a generic MinRank instance; the latter modeling allows
us to refine the analysis of MinRank's complexity given in the paper by Verbel
et al. (PQC19). Finally, since the proposed parameters of ROLLO and RQC are
completely broken by our new attack, we give examples of new parameters for
ROLLO and RQC that make them resistant to our attacks. These new parameters
show that these systems remain attractive, with a loss of only about 50\% in
terms of key size for ROLLO-I.

noise or intensity inhomogeneity, the use of its ideal value (e.g. noise-free
image) has a favorable impact on clustering. Hence, the accurate estimation of
the residual (e.g. unknown noise) between the observed image and its ideal
value is an important task. To do so, we propose an $\ell_0$
regularization-based Fuzzy $C$-Means (FCM) algorithm incorporating a
morphological reconstruction operation and a tight wavelet frame transform. To
achieve a sound trade-off between detail preservation and noise suppression,
morphological reconstruction is used to filter an observed image. By combining
the observed and filtered images, a weighted sum image is generated. Since a
tight wavelet frame system has sparse representations of an image, it is
employed to decompose the weighted sum image, thus forming its corresponding
feature set. Taking it as data for clustering, we present an improved FCM
algorithm by imposing an $\ell_0$ regularization term on the residual between
the feature set and its ideal value, which implies that the favorable
estimation of the residual is obtained and the ideal value participates in
clustering. Spatial information is also introduced into clustering since it is
naturally encountered in image segmentation. Furthermore, it makes the
estimation of the residual more reliable. To further enhance the segmentation
effects of the improved FCM algorithm, we also employ the morphological
reconstruction to smoothen the labels generated by clustering. Finally, based
on the prototypes and smoothed labels, the segmented image is reconstructed by
using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation. Experimental results
reported for synthetic, medical, and color images show that the proposed
algorithm is effective and efficient, and outperforms other algorithms.

  Utility-Aware Mobile Agent Selection","10 pages, 19 figures, IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data
  Management",,,,"eess.SP cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, the drive-by sensing paradigm has become increasingly
popular for cost-effective monitoring of urban areas. Drive-by sensing is a
form of crowdsensing wherein sensor-equipped vehicles (aka, mobile agents) are
the primary data gathering agents. Enhancing the efficacy of drive-by sensing
poses many challenges, an important one of which is to select non-dedicated
mobile agents on which a limited number of sensors are to be mounted. This
problem, which we refer to as the mobile-agent selection problem, has a
significant impact on the spatio-temporal coverage of the drive-by sensing
platforms and the resultant datasets. The challenge here is to achieve maximum
spatiotemporal coverage while taking the relative importance levels of
geographical areas into account. In this paper, we address this problem in the
context of the SCOUTS project, the goal of which is to map and analyze the
urban heat island phenomenon accurately.
  Our work makes several major technical contributions. First, we delineate a
model for representing the mobile agents selection problem. This model takes
into account the trajectories of the vehicles (public transportation buses in
our case) and the relative importance of the urban regions, and formulates it
as an optimization problem. Second, we provide two algorithms that are based
upon the utility (coverage) values of mobile agents, namely, a hotspot-based
algorithm that limits the search space to important sub-regions and a
utility-aware genetic algorithm that enables the latter algorithm to make
unbiased selections. Third, we design a highly efficient coverage redundancy
minimization algorithm that, at each step, chooses the mobile agent, which
provides maximal improvement to the spatio-temporal coverage. This paper
reports a series of experiments on a real-world dataset from Athens, GA, USA,
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

rate that last typically for about a week and can be caused by coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) or corotating interacting regions (CIRs). Fast CMEs that drive
shocks cause large FDs that often show a two-step decrease where the first step
is attributed to the shock/sheath region, while the second step is attributed
to the closed magnetic structure. Since the difference in size of shock and
sheath region is significant, and since there are observed effects that can be
related to shocks and not necessarily to the sheath region we expect that the
physical mechanisms governing the interaction with GCRs in these two regions
are different. We therefore aim to analyse interaction of GCRs with
heliospheric shocks only. We approximate the shock by a structure where the
magnetic field linearly changes with position within this structure. We assume
protons of different energy, different pitch angle and different incoming
direction. We also vary the shock parameters such as the magnetic field
strength and orientation, as well as the shock thickness. The results
demonstrate that protons with higher energies are less likely to be reflected.
Also, thicker shocks and shocks with stronger field reflect protons more
efficiently.

machine learning and algorithmic data analysis tools does not discriminate,

we define the Fair Team Formation problem in the following way: given an online

all workers are divided into two or more not overlapping classes (for examples,
men and women), we want to design an algorithm that is able to find a team with

systems. Because of modern society's reliance on autonomous systems in smart
cities, it is crucial for them to operate in a safe manner; otherwise, it is
feasible for these systems to cause considerable physical harm or even death.
Because smart cities could involve thousands of autonomous systems operating in
concert in densely populated areas, safety assurances are required. Challenges
abound to consistently manage the safety of such autonomous systems due to
their disparate developers, manufacturers, operators and users. A novel network
and a sample of associated network functions for autonomous systems is proposed
that aims to provide a baseline of safety for autonomous systems. This is
accomplished by establishing a custom-designed network for autonomous systems
that is separate from the Internet, and can handle certain functions that
enable safety through active networking. Such a network design sits at the
margins of the end-to-end principle, which is warranted considering the safety
of autonomous systems is at stake as is argued in this paper. Without a

segmentation. The proposed Global and Selective Attention Network (GSANet)
features Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) with a novel sparsemax global
attention and a novel selective attention that deploys a condensation and
diffusion mechanism to aggregate the multi-scale contextual information from
the extracted deep features. A selective attention decoder is also proposed to
process the GSA-ASPP outputs for optimizing the softmax volume. We are the
first to benchmark the performance of semantic segmentation networks with the
low-complexity feature extraction network (FXN) MobileNetEdge, that is
optimized for low latency on edge devices. We show that GSANet can result in
more accurate segmentation with MobileNetEdge, as well as with strong FXNs,
such as Xception. GSANet improves the state-of-art semantic segmentation
accuracy on both the ADE20k and the Cityscapes datasets.

Informed Neural Networks (PINN), to learning and discovery in solid mechanics.
We explain how to incorporate the momentum balance and constitutive relations
into PINN, and explore in detail the application to linear elasticity, and
illustrate its extension to nonlinear problems through an example that
showcases von~Mises elastoplasticity. While common PINN algorithms are based on
training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that
results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the
model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and
numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show
that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence
characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We
also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find
vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find
that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a
few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution
for a wide range of parameters new to the network---thus pointing to an
important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate
modeling.

components and predicting argumentative relations (i.e.,support and attack)
from text. In particular, numerous approaches have been proposed in the
literature to predict the relations holding between the arguments, and
application-specific annotated resources were built for this purpose. Despite
the fact that these resources have been created to experiment on the same task,
the definition of a single relation prediction method to be successfully
applied to a significant portion of these datasets is an open research problem
in Argument Mining. This means that none of the methods proposed in the
literature can be easily ported from one resource to another. In this paper, we
address this problem by proposing a set of dataset independent strong neural
baselines which obtain homogeneous results on all the datasets proposed in the
literature for the argumentative relation prediction task. Thus, our baselines
can be employed by the Argument Mining community to compare more effectively
how well a method performs on the argumentative relation prediction task.

  Stability Using Clustering Techniques on Replicated Runs","16 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For organizing large text corpora topic modeling provides useful tools. A
widely used method is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative
probabilistic model which models single texts in a collection of texts as
mixtures of latent topics. The assignments of words to topics rely on initial
values such that generally the outcome of LDA is not fully reproducible. In
addition, the reassignment via Gibbs Sampling is based on conditional
distributions, leading to different results in replicated runs on the same text
data. This fact is often neglected in everyday practice. We aim to improve the
reliability of LDA results. Therefore, we study the stability of LDA by
comparing assignments from replicated runs. We propose to quantify the
similarity of two generated topics by a modified Jaccard coefficient. Using
such similarities, topics can be clustered. A new pruning algorithm for
hierarchical clustering results based on the idea that two LDA runs create
pairs of similar topics is proposed. This approach leads to the new measure
S-CLOP ({\bf S}imilarity of multiple sets by {\bf C}lustering with {\bf LO}cal
{\bf P}runing) for quantifying the stability of LDA models. We discuss some
characteristics of this measure and illustrate it with an application to real
data consisting of newspaper articles from \textit{USA Today}. Our results show
that the measure S-CLOP is useful for assessing the stability of LDA models or
any other topic modeling procedure that characterize its topics by word
distributions. Based on the newly proposed measure for LDA stability, we
propose a method to increase the reliability and hence to improve the
reproducibility of empirical findings based on topic modeling. This increase in
reliability is obtained by running the LDA several times and taking as
prototype the most representative run, that is the LDA run with highest average
similarity to all other runs.

Internet will ensure that it remains a public, open platform where innovations
can thrive. While there is broad agreement that preserving the content quality
of service falls under the purview of net neutrality, the role of differential
pricing, especially the practice of \emph {zero-rating} remains controversial.
Even though some countries (India, Canada) have banned zero-rating, others have
either taken no stance or explicitly allowed it (South Africa, Kenya, U.S.). In
this paper, we model zero-rating options available between Internet service
providers (ISPs) and content providers (CPs) and use these models to better
understand the conditions under which offering zero-rated services are
preferred, and who specifically gains in utility. We develop a formulation in
which providers' incomes vary, from low-income startups to high-income
incumbents, and where their decisions to zero-rate are a variation of the
traditional prisoner's dilemma game. We find that if zero-rating is permitted,
low-income CPs often lose utility, whereas high-income CPs often gain utility.
We also study the competitiveness of the CP markets via the \emph{Herfindahl
Index}. Our findings suggest that in most cases the introduction of zero-rating
\emph{reduces} competitiveness.

atmospheric conditions. These systems are typically based on over pressurized
N2 of Ar gloveboxes that require the use of very thick gloves to operate within
the chamber or the implementation of several motorized micro-manipulators.
Here, we set up a deterministic transfer system for 2D materials within a
gloveless anaerobic chamber. Unlike other setups based on over-pressurized
gloveboxes, in our system the operator can manipulate the 2D materials within
the chamber with bare hands. This experimental setup allows us to exfoliate 2D

illustrate the potential of this system to work with air-sensitive 2D materials

Our results highlight the importance of reducing the rate of direct tunneling
between the ground state doublet so as to achieve long time coherence in
magnetic molecules. To this end, large spin and small transverse magnetic
anisotropy can reduce magnitude of the transition operator, and rigid ligands
may weaken the spin-phonon coupling in that they raise the energy of
vibrational modes and better screen the acoustic phonons.

mine residues, usually considered an environmental burden due to e.g. arsenic
content, are also secondary tungsten resources. The electrodialytic (ED)
process and deep eutectic solvents (DES) have been successfully and
independently applied for the extraction of metals fromdifferent complex
environmentalmatrices. In this study a proof of concept demonstrates that
coupling DES in a two-compartment ED set-up enhances the removal and separation
of arsenic and tungsten from Panasqueira mine secondary resources. Choline
chloride with malonic acid (1:2), and choline chloride with oxalic acid (1:1)
were the DES that in batch extracted the average maximum contents of arsenic
(16%) and tungsten (9%) from the residues. However, when ED was operated at a
current intensity of 100 mA for 4 days, the extraction yields increased 22% for
arsenic and 11% for tungsten, comparing to the tests with no current. From the
total arsenic and tungsten extracted, 82% and 77% respectively were
successfully removed from the matrix compartment, as they electromigrated to
the anolyte compartment, from where these elements can be further separated.
This achievement potentiates circular economy, as the final treated residue
could be incorporated in construction materials production, mitigating current
environmental problems in both mining and construction sectors.
