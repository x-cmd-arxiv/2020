$z_{t}$. I show that their implementation of Stock and Watson's (1998) Median
Unbiased Estimation (MUE) to determine the size of the $\lambda _{z}$ parameter
which drives this downward trend in $z_{t}$ is unsound. It cannot recover the
ratio of interest $\lambda _{z}=a_{r}\sigma _{z}/\sigma _{\tilde{y}}$ from MUE
required for the estimation of the full structural model. This failure is due
to an 'unnecessary' misspecification in Holston et al.'s (2017) formulation of
the Stage 2 model. More importantly, their implementation of MUE on this
misspecified Stage 2 model spuriously amplifies the point estimate of $\lambda
_{z}$. Using a simulation experiment, I show that their procedure generates
excessively large estimates of $\lambda _{z}$ when applied to data generated
from a model where the true $\lambda _{z}$ is equal to zero. Correcting the
misspecification in their Stage 2 model and the implementation of MUE leads to
a substantially smaller $\lambda _{z}$ estimate, and with this, a more subdued
downward trending influence of 'other factor' $z_{t}$ on the natural rate.
Moreover, the $\lambda _{z}$ point estimate is statistically highly
insignificant, suggesting that there is no role for 'other factor' $z_{t}$ in
this model. I also discuss various other estimation issues that arise in
Holston et al.'s (2017) model of the natural rate that make it unsuitable for

attain this flexibility by superimposing user signals while offering improved
spectral efficiency (SE). However, users with different numerologies have
different symbol durations. When combined with NOMA, this changes the nature of
the interference the users impose on each other. This paper investigates a
multinumerology NOMA (MN-NOMA) scheme using successive interference
cancellation (SIC) as an enabler for coexistence of users with with different
numerologies. Analytical expressions for the inter-numerology interference
(INI) experienced by each user at the receiver are derived, where mean-squared
error (MSE) is the metric used to quantify INI. Using the MSE expressions, we
analytically derive achievable rates for each user in the MN-NOMA system. These
expressions are then evaluated and used to compare the SE performance of
MN-NOMA with that of its single-numerology counterpart. The proposed scheme can
achieve the desired flexibility in supporting diverse use cases in future

results in less parameter updates. In distributed training, a larger batch size
also results in less frequent communication. However, a larger batch size can
make a generalization gap more easily. Hence, how to set a proper batch size
for SGD has recently attracted much attention. Although some methods about
setting batch size have been proposed, the batch size problem has still not
been well solved. In this paper, we first provide theory to show that a proper
batch size is related to the gap between initialization and optimum of the
model parameter. Then based on this theory, we propose a novel method, called

stagewise SGD which decreases learning rate by stage, \mbox{SEBS} can reduce
the number of parameter updates without increasing generalization error. SEBS
is suitable for \mbox{SGD}, momentum \mbox{SGD} and AdaGrad. Empirical results
on real data successfully verify the theories of \mbox{SEBS}. Furthermore,
empirical results also show that SEBS can outperform other baselines.

consists of alternating periods of pinning and rapid displacements between
neighboring particles. The latter process involves large periodic variation of
the advancing and receding contact angles due to attachment and detachment of
the contact line. Finally, upon increasing external force, the droplet center
of mass is displaced steadily but the oscillation amplitude of the receding
contact angle as well as the maximum contact angle hysteresis remain relatively
unaffected.

  Practical Privacy-Preserving Data Generation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a differentially private data generation paradigm using random
feature representations of kernel mean embeddings when comparing the
distribution of true data with that of synthetic data. We exploit the random
feature representations for two important benefits. First, we require a minimal
privacy cost for training deep generative models. This is because unlike
kernel-based distance metrics that require computing the kernel matrix on all
pairs of true and synthetic data points, we can detach the data-dependent term
from the term solely dependent on synthetic data. Hence, we need to perturb the
data-dependent term only once and then use it repeatedly during the generator
training. Second, we can obtain an analytic sensitivity of the kernel mean
embedding as the random features are norm bounded by construction. This removes
the necessity of hyper-parameter search for a clipping norm to handle the
unknown sensitivity of a generator network. We provide several variants of our
algorithm, differentially-private mean embeddings with random features
(DP-MERF) to jointly generate labels and input features for datasets such as
heterogeneous tabular data and image data. Our algorithm achieves drastically
better privacy-utility trade-offs than existing methods when tested on several
datasets.

the speed of computers, used with smart algorithms. We tackle four problems.
  The four-colour theorem states that any map whose countries are connected can
be coloured with 4 colours such that neighbouring countries have differnt
colours. It was the first result proved using computers, in 1989. We wished to
automatise further its proof. We explain the proof and provide a program which
replays the proof. It also makes it possible to obtain other results with the
same method. We give ideas to automatise the search for discharging rules.
  We also study the problems of domination in grids. The simplest one is the
one of domination. It consists in putting a stone on some cells of a grid such
that every cell has a stone, or has a neighbour with a stone. This problem was
solved in 2011, using computers to prove a formula giving the minimum number of
stones needed. We adapt this method for the first time for variants of the
domination. We solve partially two other problems and give for them lower
bounds for grids of arbitrary size.
  We also tackle the counting problem for dominating sets. How many dominating
sets are there for a given grid? We study this counting problem for the
domination and three variants. For each of these problems, we prove the
existence of asymptotic growths rates for which we give bounds.
  Finally we study polyominoes and the way they can tile rectangles. We tried
to solve a problem from 1989: is there a polyomino of odd order? It consists in
finding a polyomino which can tile a rectangle with an odd number of copies,
but cannot tile any smaller rectangle. We did not manage to solve this problem,
but we made a program to enumerate polyominoes and try to find their orders,
discarding those which cannot tile rectangles. We also give statistics on the
orders of polyominoes of size up to 18.

sub-tasks: video frame interpolation (VFI) and video super-resolution (VSR).
However, temporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution are intra-related
in this task. Two-stage methods cannot fully take advantage of the natural
property. In addition, state-of-the-art VFI or VSR networks require a large
frame-synthesis or reconstruction module for predicting high-quality video
frames, which makes the two-stage methods have large model sizes and thus be
time-consuming. To overcome the problems, we propose a one-stage space-time
video super-resolution framework, which directly synthesizes an HR slow-motion
video from an LFR, LR video. Rather than synthesizing missing LR video frames
as VFI networks do, we firstly temporally interpolate LR frame features in
missing LR video frames capturing local temporal contexts by the proposed
feature temporal interpolation network. Then, we propose a deformable ConvLSTM
to align and aggregate temporal information simultaneously for better
leveraging global temporal contexts. Finally, a deep reconstruction network is
adopted to predict HR slow-motion video frames. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves
better quantitative and qualitative performance but also is more than three
times faster than recent two-stage state-of-the-art methods, e.g., DAIN+EDVR

systems, which are studied in many areas of physics including optics,
optoelectronics, plasmonics, and condensed matter physics. In the semiclassical
regime, open systems can be described by phenomenological effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) capturing the effects of gain and loss in
terms of imaginary fields. The EPs that characterize the spectra of such
Hamiltonians (HEPs) describe the time evolution of a system without quantum
jumps. It is well known that a full quantum treatment describing more generic
dynamics must crucially take into account such quantum jumps. In a recent paper
[F. Minganti $et$ $al.$, Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{100}$, $062131$ ($2019$)], we
generalized the notion of EPs to the spectra of Liouvillian superoperators
governing open system dynamics described by Lindblad master equations.
Intriguingly, we found that in situations where a classical-to-quantum
correspondence exists, the two types of dynamics can yield different EPs. In a
recent experimental work [M. Naghiloo $et$ $al.$, Nat. Phys. $\mathbf{15}$,
$1232$ ($2019$)], it was shown that one can engineer a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian in the quantum limit by postselecting on certain quantum jump
trajectories. This raises an interesting question concerning the relation
between Hamiltonian and Lindbladian EPs, and quantum trajectories. We discuss
these connections by introducing a hybrid-Liouvillian superoperator, capable of
describing the passage from an NHH (when one postselects only those
trajectories without quantum jumps) to a true Liouvillian including quantum
jumps (without postselection). Beyond its fundamental interest, our approach
allows to intuitively relate the effects of postselection and finite-efficiency
detectors.

masses in the range $17 - 43 \, \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ below the pair-instability
supernova (PISN) gap, and $>124 \, \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ above the PISN gap. We
investigate effects of momentum kicks during black hole formation, and
calculate cosmological and magnitude limited PISN rates. We also study the
effects of high-redshift deviations in the star formation rate. We find that
momentum kicks tend to increase delay times of BHBH systems, and our magnitude
limited PISN rate estimates indicate that current deep surveys should be able
to detect such events. Lastly, we find that our cosmological merger rate
estimates change by at most $\sim 8\%$ for mild deviations of the star
formation rate in the early Universe, and by up to $\sim 40\%$ for extreme
deviations.

efficient autonomous navigation in unknown partially observable environments.
The objective is to infer a cost function that explains expert-demonstrated
navigation behavior while relying only on the observations and state-control
trajectory used by the expert. We develop a cost function representation
composed of two parts: a probabilistic occupancy encoder, with recurrent
dependence on the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined over the
occupancy features. The representation parameters are optimized by
differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy
computed from the cost encoder. Such differentiation is typically computed by
dynamic programming through the value function over the whole state space. We
observe that this is inefficient in large partially observable environments
because most states are unexplored. Instead, we rely on a closed-form
subgradient of the cost-to-go obtained only over a subset of promising states
via an efficient motion-planning algorithm such as A* or RRT. Our experiments
show that our model exceeds the accuracy of baseline IRL algorithms in robot
navigation tasks, while substantially improving the efficiency of training and
test-time inference.

  Multi-output Classification Problems","10 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes one objective function for learning semantically
coherent feature embeddings in multi-output classification problems, i.e., when
the response variables have dimension higher than one. In particular, we
consider the problems of identity retrieval and soft biometrics labelling in
visual surveillance environments, which have been attracting growing interests.
Inspired by the triplet loss [34] function, we propose a generalization that:
1) defines a metric that considers the number of agreeing labels between pairs
of elements; and 2) disregards the notion of anchor, replacing d(A1, A2) <
d(A1, B) by d(A, B) < d(C, D), for A, B, C, D distance constraints, according
to the number of agreeing labels between pairs. As the triplet loss
formulation, our proposal also privileges small distances between positive
pairs, but at the same time explicitly enforces that the distance between other
pairs corresponds directly to their similarity in terms of agreeing labels.
This yields feature embeddings with a strong correspondence between the classes
centroids and their semantic descriptions, i.e., where elements are closer to
others that share some of their labels than to elements with fully disjoint
labels membership. As practical effect, the proposed loss can be seen as
particularly suitable for performing joint coarse (soft label) + fine (ID)
inference, based on simple rules as k-neighbours, which is a novelty with
respect to previous related loss functions. Also, in opposition to its triplet
counterpart, the proposed loss is agnostic with regard to any demanding
criteria for mining learning instances (such as the semi-hard pairs). Our
experiments were carried out in five different datasets (BIODI, LFW, IJB-A,
Megaface and PETA) and validate our assumptions, showing highly promising
results.

up-to-date data. In this study, we examine the usefulness of the Facebook
Advertising platform, which offers a digital ""census"" of over two billions of
its users, in measuring potential rural-urban inequalities. We focus on Italy,
a country where about 30% of the population lives in rural areas. First, we
show that the population statistics that Facebook produces suffer from
instability across time and incomplete coverage of sparsely populated
municipalities. To overcome such limitation, we propose an alternative
methodology for estimating Facebook Ads audiences that nearly triples the
coverage of the rural municipalities from 19% to 55% and makes feasible
fine-grained sub-population analysis. Using official national census data, we
evaluate our approach and confirm known significant urban-rural divides in
terms of educational attainment and income. Extending the analysis to
Facebook-specific user ""interests"" and behaviors, we provide further insights
on the divide, for instance, finding that rural areas show a higher interest in
gambling. Notably, we find that the most predictive features of income in rural
areas differ from those for urban centres, suggesting researchers need to
consider a broader range of attributes when examining rural wellbeing. The
findings of this study illustrate the necessity of improving existing tools and
methodologies to include under-represented populations in digital demographic
studies -- the failure to do so could result in misleading observations,

focused on whether a pair density wave state (PDW) could coexist with cuprate
superconductivity (D. F. Agterberg et al., Annual Review of Condensed Matter

cuprates, to model the atomic-scale electronic structure of an eight-unit-cell
periodic, $d$-symmetry form factor, pair density wave (PDW) state coexisting
with $d$-wave superconductivity (DSC). From this PDW+DSC model, the
atomically-resolved density of Bogoliubov quasiparticle states N(r,E) is
predicted at the terminal BiO surface of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ and compared
with high-precision electronic visualization experiments using spectroscopic
imaging STM. The PDW+DSC model predictions include the intra-unit-cell
structure and periodic modulations of N(r,E), the modulations of the coherence
peak energy $\Delta_p$ (r), and the characteristics of Bogoliubov quasiparticle
interference in scattering-wavevector space (q-space). Consistency between all
these predictions and the corresponding experiments indicates that lightly
hole-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ does contain a PDW+DSC state. Moreover, in
the model the PDW+DSC state becomes unstable to a pure DSC state at a critical
hole density p*, with empirically equivalent phenomena occurring in the
experiments. All these results are consistent with a picture in which the
cuprate translational symmetry breaking state is a PDW, the observed charge
modulations are its consequence, the antinodal pseudogap is that of the PDW
state, and the cuprate critical point at p* ~ 19% occurs due to disappearance
of this PDW.

of many existing, as well as new discontinuous Galerkin methods for linear

for the linear elasticity problem consisting of four discretization variables:
strong symmetric stress tensor $\dsig$ and displacement $\du$ inside each
element, and the modifications of these two variables $\hsig$ and $\hu$ on
elementary boundaries of elements. Motivated by many relevant methods in the
literature, this formulation can be used to derive most existing discontinuous,
nonconforming and conforming Galerkin methods for linear elasticity problems
and especially to develop a number of new discontinuous Galerkin methods. Many
special cases of this four-field formulation are proved to be hybridizable and
can be reduced to some known hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin, weak Galerkin
and local discontinuous Galerkin methods by eliminating one or two of the four
fields. As certain stabilization parameter tends to zero, this four-field
formulation is proved to converge to some conforming and nonconforming mixed
methods for linear elasticity problems. Two families of inf-sup conditions, one
known as $H^1$-based and the other known as $H({\rm div})$-based, are proved to
be uniformly valid with respect to different choices of discrete spaces and
parameters. These inf-sup conditions guarantee the well-posedness of the new
proposed methods and also offer a new and unified analysis for many existing
methods in the literature as a by-product. Some numerical examples are provided

always achieves a $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + \Omega(1/k^3))$-approximation, showing
that the greedy algorithm does slightly better on undirected graphs than the
generic $(1- (1 - 1/k)^k)$ bound which also applies to directed graphs. On the
other hand, we show that substantial improvement on this bound is impossible by
presenting an example where the greedy algorithm can obtain at most a $(1- (1 -
1/k)^k + O(1/k^{0.2}))$ approximation. This result stands in contrast to the
previous work on the independent cascade model. Like the linear threshold
model, the greedy algorithm obtains a $(1-(1-1/k)^k)$-approximation on directed
graphs in the independent cascade model. However, Khanna and Lucier showed
that, in undirected graphs, the greedy algorithm performs substantially better:
a $(1-(1-1/k)^k + c)$ approximation for constant $c > 0$. Our results show
that, surprisingly, no such improvement occurs in the linear threshold model.
Finally, we show that, under the linear threshold model, the approximation
ratio $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k)$ is tight if 1) the graph is directed or 2) the

$\left(\vec{B}=B\,\hat{z},~\vec{E}=E\,\hat{y}\right)$, with $E/B<1$, in
presence of some initial number of $e^{\pm}$ pairs. We do not discuss here the
mechanism of generation of these initial pairs. The electric field accelerates
the pairs to high-energies thereby radiating high-energy synchrotron photons.
These photons interact with the magnetic field via magnetic pair production
process (MPP), i.e. $\gamma+B\rightarrow e^{+}+e^{-}$, producing additional
pairs. We here show that the motion of all the pairs around the magnetic field
lines generates a current that induces a magnetic field that shields the
initial one. For instance, for an initial number of pairs $N_{\pm,0}=10^{10}$,
an initial magnetic field of $10^{12}$ G can be reduced of a few percent. The
screening occurs in the short timescales $10^{-21}\leq t \leq 10^{-15}$ s, i.e.
before the particle acceleration timescale equals the synchrotron cooling
timescale. The present simplified model indicates the physical conditions
leading to the screening of strong magnetic fields. To assess the occurrence of
this phenomenon in specific astrophysical sources, e.g. pulsars or gamma-ray
bursts, the model can be extended to evaluate different geometries of the
electric and magnetic fields, quantum effects in overcritical fields, and
specific mechanisms for the production, distribution, and multiplicity of the
$e^{-}e^{+}$ pairs.

Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual
challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related

of the Ap stars and affect the occurrence of non-radial pulsation in some of
them are important open questions. Valuable insight can be gained into these
questions by studying some of the most extreme examples of the processes at
play. The super-slowly rotating rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star HD 166473 is
such an example. We performed the first accurate determination of its rotation
period, (3836 +/- 30)d, from the analysis of 56 measurements of the mean
magnetic field modulus <B> based on high-resolution spectra acquired between
1992 and 2019 at various observatories and with various instrumental
configurations. We complemented this analysis with the consideration of an
inhomogeneous set of 21 determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field
<B_z> spanning the same time interval. This makes HD 166473 one of only four Ap
stars with a period longer than 10 years for which magnetic field measurements
have been obtained over more than a full cycle. The variation curves of <B> and
of <B_z> are well approximated by cosine waves. The magnetic field of HD 166473
only seems to deviate slightly from axisymmetry, but it definitely involves a
considerable non-dipolar component. Among the stars with rotation periods
longer than 1000 d for which magnetic field measurements with full phase
coverage are available, HD 166473 has the strongest field. Its magnetic field
is also one of the strongest known among roAp stars. Overall, the magnetic
properties of HD 166473 do not seem fundamentally distinct from those of the
faster-rotating Ap stars. However, considering as a group the eight Ap stars
that have accuractely determined periods longer than 1000 d and whose magnetic
variations have been characterised over a full cycle suggests that the angles
between their magnetic and rotation axes tend to be systematically large.

use MHD simulations with the appropriate thermodynamical terms included to
quantify the evaporation following heating by phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves in
a coronal loop and the effect of this evaporation on the transverse density
profile. The numerical simulations were performed using the Lare2D code. We set
up a 2D loop model consisting of a field-aligned thermodynamic equilibrium and
a cross-field (background) heating profile. A continuous, sinusoidal,
high-frequency Alfv\'en wave driver was implemented. As the Alfv\'en waves
propagate along the field, they undergo phase mixing due to the cross-field
density gradient in the coronal part of the loop. We investigated the presence
of field-aligned flows, heating from the dissipation of the phase-mixed
Alfv\'en waves, and the subsequent evaporation from the lower atmosphere. We
find that phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves leads to modest heating in the shell
regions of the loop and evaporation of chromospheric material into the corona
with upflows of the order of only 5-20 m/s. Although the evaporation leads to a
mass increase in the shell regions of the loop, the effect on the density
gradient and, hence, on the phase mixing process, is insignificant. This paper
self-consistently investigates the effect of chromospheric evaporation on the

found that the effects in our particular setup (small amplitude, high frequency

However, it blocked the oxygen reduction reaction when it was premixed with the
catalyst. Proton transport was not blocked in either case. We postulate that
di-phenyl siloxane induces hydrophobicity and causes local water starvation
thereby blocking oxygen transport. Hence, the slow leaching of silicone seals
in a fuel cell could cause silicon accumulation in the electrode, which will
irreversibly degrade fuel cell performance by blocking oxygen transport to the
catalyst sites.

However, it is often time-consuming to write accurate and detailed reports.
Most existing methods try to generate the whole reports from the raw input with

0.482 CIDEr and 0.491 BLEU-4 for EEG reports for sentence-level generation,

of large molecules, such as proteins. In this paper, we analyze a model for
such binding rates that includes the fact that pairs of molecules can bind only
in certain orientations. The model considers two spherical molecules, each with
an arbitrary number of small binding sites on their surface, and the two
molecules bind if and only if their binding sites come into contact (such
molecules are often called ""patchy particles"" in the biochemistry literature).
The molecules undergo translational and rotational diffusion, and the binding
sites are allowed to diffuse on their surfaces. Mathematically, the model takes
the form of a high-dimensional, anisotropic diffusion equation with mixed
boundary conditions. We apply matched asymptotic analysis to derive the
bimolecular binding rate in the limit of small, well-separated binding sites.
The resulting binding rate formula involves a factor that depends on the
electrostatic capacitance of a certain four-dimensional region embedded in five
dimensions. We compute this factor numerically by modifying a recent kinetic
Monte Carlo algorithm. We then apply a quasi chemical formalism to obtain a
simple analytical approximation for this factor and find a binding rate formula
that includes the effects of binding site competition/saturation. We verify our
results by numerical simulation.

uninformative for one task, is likely a rich source of information for other
tasks. To leverage this insight and efficiently reuse data, we present
Generalized Hindsight: an approximate inverse reinforcement learning technique
for relabeling behaviors with the right tasks. Intuitively, given a behavior
generated under one task, Generalized Hindsight returns a different task that
the behavior is better suited for. Then, the behavior is relabeled with this
new task before being used by an off-policy RL optimizer. Compared to standard
relabeling techniques, Generalized Hindsight provides a substantially more
efficient reuse of samples, which we empirically demonstrate on a suite of

evolution at low galaxy masses, (2) slow evolution in voids, or (3) dilution of
measured abundances from infall of pristine gas. The recently discovered XMP
galaxy Leoncino, with an oxygen abundance below 3% Zsun, provides an
opportunity to explore these different scenarios. Using Hubble Space Telescope
imaging of the resolved stellar populations of Leoncino, we measure the
distance to the galaxy to be D=12.1 (+1.7/-3.4) Mpc and find that Leoncino is
located in an under-dense environment. Leoncino has a compact morphology, hosts
a population of young, massive stars, has a high gas-to-star mass ratio, and
shows signs of interaction with a galaxy nearby on the sky, UGC 5186. Similar
to nearly all XMP galaxies known in the nearby universe, Leoncino is offset
from the Luminosity-Metallicity (LZ) relation. Yet, Leoncino is consistent with
the stellar Mass-Metallicity (MZ) relation defined by Local Volume galaxies.
Thus, our results suggest that the offset from the LZ relation is due to higher
recent star formation, likely triggered by a minor interaction, while the low
oxygen abundance is consistent with the expectation that low-mass galaxies will
undergo secular evolution marked by inefficient star formation and metal-loss
via galactic winds. This is in contrast to XMP galaxies that are outliers in
both the LZ and MZ relations; in such cases, the low oxygen abundances are best
explained by dilution due to the infall of pristine gas. We also discuss why
quiescent XMP galaxies are underrepresented in current surveys.

excluded from exoplanet searches, especially those performed using the radial

consequence and despite recent efforts, our knowledge of the frequency of
planets in multiple stellar systems is still rather incomplete. On the other
hand, the lack of knowledge about the binarity at the time of the compilation
of the target samples means that our estimate of the planet frequency around
single stars could be tainted by the presence of unknown binaries, especially
if these objects have a different behavior in terms of planet occurrence. In a
previous work we investigated the binarity of the objects included in the
Uniform Detectability sample defined by Fisher and Valenti (2005), showing how
more than 20% of their targets were, in fact, not single stars. Here, we
present an update of this census, made possible mainly by the information now

fixed stellar mass in comparison to their field counterparts by a factor of 1.4

galaxy star-forming main sequence is mass and redshift dependent: the
difference between cluster and field increases towards lower stellar masses and
lower redshift. When comparing the distribution of cluster and field galaxy
SFRs to the star-forming main sequence, we find an overall shift towards lower
SFRs in the cluster population, and note the absence of a tail of high SFR
galaxies as seen in the field. Given this observed suppression in the cluster
galaxy star-forming main sequence, we explore the implications for several
scenarios such as formation time differences between cluster and field

oriented with respect to filament spines and their perpendicular, i.e., radial,
component decreases in magnitude towards the spine for many filaments. Together
with remarkably constant velocity gradients on larger scales along many
filaments, these results suggest a scenario in which gas falling onto filaments
is progressively damped and redirected to flow along these filaments.

broad-line region (BLR) absorption models. In particular, we consider the
detailed treatment of $\gamma$-$\gamma$ absorption in the radiation fields of
the BLR as a function of the location of the $\gamma$-ray emission region with
parameters inferred from observational constraints. We find that, due to the
energy range extent and its sensitivity, CTA is particularly well suited to
locate the $\gamma$-ray emitting region in $\gamma$-NLS1. In particular CTA
will be able not only to distinguish whether the $\gamma$-ray emitting region
is located inside or outside the BLR, but also where inside the BLR it may be.

expect local quantum error-correcting codes with no string-like logical

one-dimensional errors that span their lattice. The challenge remains to design
decoding algorithms that utilise the high distance of these codes. Here, we
begin the development of such algorithms by proposing an efficient decoder for
the `Fibonacci code'; a two-dimensional classical code that mimics the fractal
nature of the cubic code. Our iterative decoder finds a correction through
repeated use of minimum-weight perfect matching by exploiting symmetries of the
code. We perform numerical experiments that show our decoder is robust to
one-dimensional, correlated errors. First, using a bit-flip noise model at low
error rates, we find that our decoder demonstrates a logical failure rate that
scales super exponentially in the linear size of the lattice. In contrast, a
decoder that could not tolerate spanning errors would not achieve this rapid
decay in failure rate with increasing system size. We also find a finite
threshold using a spanning noise model that introduces string-like errors that
stretch along full rows and columns of the lattice. These results provide
direct evidence that our decoder is robust to one-dimensional, correlated
errors that span the lattice.

relations significantly deviate from the self-similar predictions, if
self-similar redshift evolution is assumed. When the redshift evolution is left
free to vary, the derived slopes are more in agreement with the self-similar

luminosity than disturbed clusters at a given mass, a difference that,
depending on the relative fraction of relaxed and disturbed clusters in the
samples (e.g. SZ vs X-ray selected), have a strong impact in the normalization
obtained in different studies. Using the core-excised cluster luminosities
reduces the scatter and brings into better agreement the $L$-$M_{tot}$ and
$L$-$T$ relations determined for different samples. $M_{tot}$-$T$,
$M_{tot}$-$Y_X$, and $M_{tot}$-$M_{gas}$ relations show little dependence on
the dynamical state of the clusters, but the normalizations of these relations
may depend on the mass range investigated. Although most of the clusters
investigated in this work reside at relatively low redshift, the fits prefer
values of $\gamma$, the parameter accounting for the redshift evolution,
different from the self-similar predictions. This suggests an evolution
($<$2$\sigma$ level, with the exception of the $M_{tot}$-$T$ relation) of the
scaling relations. For the first time, we find significant evolution
($>$3$\sigma$) of the $M_{tot}$-$T$ relation, pointing to an increase of the
kinetic-to-thermal energy ratio with redshift. This is consistent with a
scenario in which higher redshift clusters are on average more disturbed than
their lower redshift counterparts.

theories with Euclidean strings/branes and multiple times. These are known to
be plagued by pathologies like the occurrence of ghosts. On the other hand,
these theories exhibit de Sitter solutions. Our special focus lies on the
question of the coexistence of such de Sitter solutions and ghost-free brane
worlds. To this end, the world-sheet CFT description of Euclidean fundamental
strings is generalized to include also the open string/D-brane sector.
Demanding that in the ""observable"" gauge theory sector the gauge fields

found.

The model consists of a PDE in the bulk that is coupled to another PDE on the

propose a novel method, based on coupling a virtual element method [Beir\~ao da
Veiga et al., 2013] in the bulk domain to a surface finite element method
[Dziuk & Elliott, 2013] on the surface. The proposed method, which we coin the
Bulk-Surface Virtual Element Method (BSVEM) includes, as a special case, the
bulk-surface finite element method (BSFEM) on triangular meshes [Madzvamuse &
Chung, 2016]. The method exhibits second-order convergence in space, provided
the exact solution is $H^{2+1/4}$ in the bulk and $H^2$ on the surface, where
the additional $\frac{1}{4}$ is required only in the simultaneous presence of
surface curvature and non-triangular elements. Two novel techniques introduced
in our analysis are (i) an $L^2$-preserving inverse trace operator for the
analysis of boundary conditions and (ii) the Sobolev extension as a replacement
of the lifting operator [Elliott & Ranner, 2013] for sufficiently smooth exact
solutions. The generality of the polygonal mesh can be exploited to optimize
the computational time of matrix assembly. The method takes an optimised
matrix-vector form that also simplifies the known special case of BSFEM on
triangular meshes [Madzvamuse & Chung, 2016]. Three numerical examples
illustrate our findings.

complexity - an incompatibility between an elastically-favored
""micro-structure"" of uniformly spaced wrinkles and a ""macro-structure"" imparted
through the wrinkle director and dictated by confinement forces. Our theory is
borne out of experiments and simulations of floating sheets subjected to radial
stretching. By analyzing patterns of grossly radial wrinkles we find two
sharply distinct morphologies: defect-free patterns with a fixed number of
wrinkles and non-uniform spacing, and patterns of uniformly spaced wrinkles
separated by defect-rich buffer zones. We show how these morphological types
reflect distinct minima of a Ginzburg-Landau functional - a coarse-grained
version of the elastic energy, which penalizes nonuniform wrinkle spacing and
amplitude, as well as deviations of their actual director from the axis imposed
by confinement. Our results extend the effective description of wrinkle
patterns as liquid crystals (H. Aharoni et al., Nat. Commun. 8:15809, 2017),

Quantum theory does not prevent entanglement from being created and observed in

entanglement is still very limited due to decoherence effects. Recently,
entanglement has been observed among atoms from thousands to millions level in
extremely low-temperature and well-isolated systems. Here, we create
multipartite entanglement of billions of motional atoms in a quantum memory at
room temperature, and certify the genuine entanglement via $M$-separability
witness associated with photon statistics. The information contained in a
single photon is found strongly correlated with the excitation shared by the
motional atoms, which intrinsically address the large system and therefore
stimulate the multipartite entanglement. Remarkably, our heralded and quantum
memory built-in entanglement generation allows us to directly observe the
dynamic evolution of entanglement depth and further to reveal the effects of
decoherence. Our results verify the existence of genuine multipartite
entanglement among billions of motional atoms at ambient condition,
significantly extending the boundary of the accessible scale of entanglement.

spreading processes are often assumed to be exponentially distributed, which
results in Markovian (i.e., memoryless) continuous spreading dynamics. However,
this is not taking into account memory (correlation) effects and discrete
interactions that have been identified as relevant in social, transportation,

and hybrid forms of (non-)Markovian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
stochastic processes on networks. The hybrid SIR processes that we study in
this paper describe infections as discrete-time Markovian and recovery events
as continuous-time non-Markovian processes, which mimic the distribution of
cell cycles. Our results suggest that the effective-infection-rate description
of epidemic processes fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and
also general non-Markovian disease dynamics. Providing a unifying description
of general Markovian and non-Markovian disease outbreaks, we instead show that
the mean transmissibility produces the same phase diagrams independent of the
underlying inter-event-time distributions.

Tits concerning groups acting on trees introduced an
independence property $(\mathrm{P})$ as a condition to produce the first
examples of nonlinear nondiscrete locally compact simple groups, answering a
question of J. P. Serre. This property has become very important in the recent
development of the theory of totally disconnected, locally compact (t.d.l.c.)
groups, with the majority of new constructions of compactly generated simple
t.d.l.c. groups using $(\mathrm{P})$ or related ideas.
  In this paper we aim to advance the local-to-global theory of groups acting
on trees by developing a `local action' complement to classical Bass--Serre
theory. We describe, for a closed group $G$ of automorphisms of a (not
necessarily locally finite) tree $T$ something called a local action diagram: a
graph decorated with the local actions of $G$. A local action diagram plays a
role in our theory that is analogous to a graph of groups in Bass--Serre
theory. In place of the universal cover of a graph of groups, we define the
universal group of a local action diagram. In this context, the groups
$\mathbf{U}(F)$ and $\mathbf{U}(F_1, F_2)$ play analogous roles to the HNN
extension and amalgamated free product respectively in Bass--Serre theory. We
then show how to determine whether the universal group has certain properties,
such as geometric density, compact generation and simplicity, directly from the
local action diagram.
  Our theory allows us to completely describe all closed groups of
automorphisms of trees with Tits' independence property $(\mathrm{P})$: they
are precisely the universal groups of local action diagrams.

magnetic maps derived from Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) in conjunction with
so-called ""braking laws"". The use of ZDI maps has advantages over other methods
because it allows information about the magnetic field geometry to be
incorporated into the estimate. However, ZDI is known to underestimate
photospheric field strengths due to flux cancellation effects. Recently,
Lehmann et al. (2018) conducted synthetic ZDI reconstructions on a set of flux
transport simulations to help quantify the amount by which ZDI underestimates
the field strengths of relatively slowly rotating and weak activity solar-like
stars. In this paper, we evaluate how underestimated angular momentum-loss rate
estimates based on ZDI maps may be. We find that they are relatively accurate
for stars with strong magnetic fields but may be underestimated by a factor of
up to $\sim$10 for stars with weak magnetic fields. Additionally, we
re-evaluate our previous work that used ZDI maps to study the relative
contributions of different magnetic field modes to angular momentum-loss. We
previously found that the dipole component dominates spin-down for most
low-mass stars. This conclusion still holds true even in light of the work of

data processing systems. An emerging school of thought is to leverage AI-driven
""black box"" algorithms for this purpose. In this paper, we present a contrarian
view. We study the problem of autotuning the memory allocation for applications
running on modern distributed data processing systems. For this problem, we
show that an empirically-driven ""white-box"" algorithm, called RelM, that we
have developed provides a close-to-optimal tuning at a fraction of the
overheads compared to state-of-the-art AI-driven ""black box"" algorithms,
namely, Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Deep Distributed Policy Gradient (DDPG).
The main reason for RelM's superior performance is that the memory management
in modern memory-based data analytics systems is an interplay of algorithms at
multiple levels: (i) at the resource-management level across various containers
allocated by resource managers like Kubernetes and YARN, (ii) at the container
level among the OS, pods, and processes such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
(iii) at the application level for caching, aggregation, data shuffles, and
application data structures, and (iv) at the JVM level across various pools
such as the Young and Old Generation. RelM understands these interactions and
uses them in building an analytical solution to autotune the memory management
knobs. In another contribution, called GBO, we use the RelM's analytical models
to speed up Bayesian Optimization. Through an evaluation based on Apache Spark,
we showcase that RelM's recommendations are significantly better than what
commonly-used Spark deployments provide, and are close to the ones obtained by
brute-force exploration; while GBO provides optimality guarantees for a higher,
but still significantly lower compared to the state-of-the-art AI-driven

infeasible to recognize unseen phonemes. In this work, we address this problem
by adopting the idea of zero-shot learning. Our model is able to recognize
unseen phonemes in the target language without any training data. In our model,
we decompose phonemes into corresponding articulatory attributes such as vowel

distributions over articulatory attributes, and then compute phoneme

  accretion disks: albedo profiles and returning radiation","Accepted for publication in MNRAS - 18 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/staa598",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes (BHs) emit radiation peaking
in the soft X-rays when the source is in the thermal state. The emerging
photons are polarized and, for symmetry reasons, the polarization integrated
over the source is expected to be either parallel or perpendicular to the
(projected) disk symmetry axis, because of electron scattering in the disk.
However, due to General Relativity effects photon polarization vectors will
rotate with respect to their original orientation, by an amount depending on
both the BH spin and the observer's inclination. Hence, X-ray polarization
measurements may provide important information about strong gravity effects
around these sources. Along with the spectral and polarization properties of
radiation which reaches directly the observer once emitted from the disk, in
this paper we also include the contribution of returning radiation, i.e.
photons that are bent by the strong BH gravity to return again on the disk,
where they scatter until eventually escaping to infinity. A comparison between
our results and those obtained in previous works by different authors show an
overall good agreement, despite the use of different code architectures. We
finally consider the effects of absorption in the disk material by including
more realistic albedo profiles for the disk surface. Our findings in this
respect show that considering also the ionization state of the disk may deeply
modify the behavior of polarization observables.

dimensional systems, often by describing the system state by a linear
combination of spatial modes. Transport dominated phenomena, ubiquitous in
technical and scientific applications, often require a large number of linear
modes to obtain a small representation error. This difficulty, even for the
most simple transports, originates from the inappropriateness of the
decomposition structure in time dependent amplitudes of purely spatial modes.
  In this article an approach is discussed, which decomposes a flow field into
several fields of co-moving frames, where each one can be approximated by a few
modes. The method of decomposition is formulated as an optimization problem.
Different singular-value-based objective functions are discussed and connected
to former formulations. A boundary treatment is provided. The decomposition is
applied to generic cases and to a technically relevant flow configuration of
combustion physics.

is almost constant in the diffuse ISM. Aims. We test if the Radiative Torque
(RAT) theory is compatible with observational constraints on grain alignment.
Methods. We combine a numerical simulation with the radiative transfer code
POLARIS that incorporates a physical dust model and the detailed grain
alignment physics of RATs. A dust model is designed to reproduce the spectral
dependence of extinction of the ISM. From a RAMSES simulation of interstellar
turbulence, we extract a cube representative of the diffuse ISM. We
post-process the cube with POLARIS to get the grain temperature and RATs to
simulate synthetic dust polarization maps. Results. In our simulation the grain
alignment efficiency is correlated with gas pressure, but not with the RAT
intensity. Because of the low dust extinction, the magnitude of RATs varies
little, decreasing only for high column densities $N_H$. Comparing our maps
with a uniform alignment efficiency, we find no systematic difference. The
dependence of polarization fraction $p$ with $N_H$ or polarization dispersion
$S$ is similar. The drop of RATs in dense regions barely affects the
polarization pattern, the signal being dominated by the LOS and magnetic field
geometry. If a star is inserted, the polarization increases, with no specific
pattern around the star. The angle-dependence of RATs is not observed in the
maps, and is weak using a uniform magnetic field. Conclusions. RATs are
compatible with Planck data for the diffuse ISM such that both uniform
alignment and RAT alignment lead to similar observations. To further test the
predictions of RATs where an important drop of grain alignment is expected,
polarization observations of dense regions must be confronted to numerical
simulations sampling high column densities through dense clouds, with enough
statistics.

first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per
iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps.
Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional
computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most
compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely
large models but stop after a small number of iterations.
  This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large
Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models.
However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques
such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get
the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher
accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.

the number of rounds in this query model. We provide an algorithm for Set
Disjointness in this query model with round complexity that matches the round

plasmonic gold nanostars in a rhodamine 6G dye gain medium, we observe a series
of very narrow random lasing peaks with full-width at half-maximum ~ 0.8 nm. In

threshold for the dye with gold nanostars is two times lower than that for a

significant increase in the emission rate above the lasing threshold,
indicating a stimulated emission process. Our study provides a method for
generating random lasing in the nanoscale with low threshold values that can be
easily collected and guided, which promise a range of potential applications in

hardening, we analyze the \textit{large system potential} (LSP) which measures
the asymptotic ratio of the expected power in the desired channel to the
expected total interference power when both the antenna and user numbers grow.
LSP is said to hold when this ratio converges to a positive constant. The
results demonstrate that while FP is guaranteed in ray-based channels, CH may

demonstrate that LSP will not normally hold as the expected interference power
grows logarithmically for both ULAs and UPAs relative to the power in the
desired channel as the system size increases. Nevertheless, we identify some

demonstration trajectories using a global planner and extract local
observations from them, ii) we use deep imitation learning to learn a
decentralized policy that can run efficiently online, and iii) we introduce a
novel differentiable safety module to ensure collision-free operation, thereby
allowing for end-to-end policy training. Our numerical experiments demonstrate
that our policies have a 20% higher success rate than optimal reciprocal
collision avoidance, ORCA, across a wide range of robot and obstacle densities.
We demonstrate our method on an aerial swarm, executing the policy on low-end
microcontrollers in real-time.

highly realistic images, that are often indistinguishable (by humans) from real

suggesting potential for augmenting training sets with GAN-generated data.
While this scenario is of particular relevance when there are limited data

limited data. To facilitate this, we leverage existing GAN models pretrained on
large-scale datasets (like ImageNet) to introduce additional knowledge (which
may not exist within the limited data), following the concept of transfer
learning. Demonstrated by natural-image generation, we reveal that low-level
filters (those close to observations) of both the generator and discriminator
of pretrained GANs can be transferred to facilitate generation in a
perceptually-distinct target domain with limited training data. To further
adapt the transferred filters to the target domain, we propose adaptive filter
modulation (AdaFM). An extensive set of experiments is presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on generation with limited data.

vulnerable to adversarial examples. These examples make deployment of such

including CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also been
demonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers,
one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the
measurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In this
paper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end
deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introduce
an auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a
min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks.
Theoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-max
formulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, which
suppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because of
ill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network using
the proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. In
addition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deep
networks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposed
approach over other methods. We complement the theory by experiments for CS on
two different datasets and evaluate the effect of increasing perturbations on
trained networks. We find the behavior for ill-conditioned and well-conditioned

case of a 2D PF. Firstly, $2$-dispersion and $3$-dispersion problems are proven
solvable in $O(n)$ time in a 2D PF. Secondly, dynamic programming algorithms
are designed for three p-dispersion variants, proving polynomial complexities
in a 2D PF. Max-min p-dispersion is solvable in $O(pn\log n)$ time and $O(n)$
memory space. Max-Sum-Neighbor p-dispersion is proven solvable in $O(pn^2)$
time and{$O(n)$} space. Max-Sum-min p-dispersion is solvable in $O(pn^3)$ time
and $O(pn^2)$ space, this complexity holds also in 1D, proving for the first
time that Max-Sum-min p-dispersion is polynomial in 1D. Furthermore, properties
of these algorithms are discussed for an efficient implementation {and for a
practical application inside bi-objective meta-heuristics.

unbiased algorithms and fair socio-technical systems are key desired outcomes

However, these computing fields broadly also suffer from the same

the zero-point fluctuations do not allow the spins to order. The itinerant
gapless excitations inferred from the thermal transport measurements in this
system have been a hotly debated issue recently. While the presence of a finite
linear residual thermal conductivity, $\kappa_0/T \equiv \kappa/T (T

low-temperature thermal conductivity strongly depends on the cooling process of
the sample. When cooling down very slowly, a sizable $\kappa_0/T$ is observed.
In contrast, when cooling down rapidly, $\kappa_0/T$ vanishes and, in addition,
the phonon thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed. These results suggest
that possible random scatterers introduced during the cooling process are
responsible for the apparent discrepancy of the thermal conductivity data in
this organic system. The present results provide evidence that the true ground
state of EtMe$_3$Sb[Pd(dmit)$_2$]$_2$ is likely to be a quantum spin liquid
with itinerant gapless excitations.

Exclusive parallel momentum distributions for states in the neutron-deficient
nuclei $^{22}$Mg, $^{23}$Al, and $^{24}$Si populated in such direct two-neutron

reaction theory and shell-model calculations. For the well-known $^{22}$Mg and
$^{23}$Al nuclei, measurements and calculations were found to agree, supporting
the dependence of the parallel momentum distribution width on the angular
momentum composition of the shell-model two-neutron amplitudes. In $^{24}$Si, a
level at 3439(9) keV, of relevance for the important
$^{23}$Al(p,$\gamma$)$^{24}$Si astrophysical reaction rate, was confirmed to be
the $2^+_2$ state, while the $4^+_1$ state, expected to be strongly populated
in two-neutron knockout, was not observed. This puzzle is resolved by
theoretical considerations of the Thomas-Ehrman shift, which also suggest that

Then, we find that the brightening of flux occurs when the hot spot with small
area crosses the opposite side to the observer, where the brightening becomes
stronger as the area of hot spot decreases. Since this brightening happens only
when a part of hot spot crosses the opposite side to the observer, one may
constrain the neutron star geometry, i.e., the combination of an inclination
angle, angle between the rotational axis and normal vector at the center of hot
spot, and the opening angle of hot spot, if the brightening would be observed.

synthesize training data alongside some semantically meaningful variations,

into multiple sub-embeddings, and associate different confidence values for
each sub-embedding to smooth the training procedure. The sub-embeddings are
further decorrelated by regularizing variation classification loss and
variation adversarial loss on different partitions of them. Experiments show
that our method achieves top performance on general face recognition datasets

device-to-device (D2D) networks. A key characteristic of D2D networks is that
their topologies are reconfigurable to cope with network demands. For
distributed computing, resource management is challenging due to limited
network and communication resources, leading to inter-channel interference. To
overcome this, recent research has addressed the problems of wireless
scheduling, subchannel allocation, power allocation, and multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) signal design, but has not considered them jointly. In
this paper, unlike previous mobile edge computing (MEC) approaches, we propose
a joint optimization of wireless MIMO signal design and network resource
allocation to maximize energy efficiency. Given that the resulting problem is a
non-convex mixed integer program (MIP) which is prohibitive to solve at scale,
we decompose its solution into two parts: (i) a resource allocation subproblem,
which optimizes the link selection and subchannel allocations, and (ii) MIMO
signal design subproblem, which optimizes the transmit beamformer, transmit
power, and receive combiner. Simulation results using wireless edge topologies
show that our method yields substantial improvements in energy efficiency
compared with cases of no offloading and partially optimized methods and that
the efficiency scales well with the size of the network.

associated to each arrow defining the quantum metric. However, these `lattice

We use this greater freedom to give a quantum geometric interpretation of
discrete Markov processes with transition probabilities as arrow weights,
namely taking the diffusion form $\partial_+ f=(-\Delta_\theta+ q-p)f$ for the
graph Laplacian $\Delta_\theta$, potential functions $q,p$ built from the

Motivated by this new point of view, we introduce a `discrete Schroedinger
process' as $\partial_+\psi=\imath(-\Delta+V)\psi$ for the Laplacian associated
to a bimodule connection such that the discrete evolution is unitary. We solve
this explicitly for the 2-state graph, finding a 1-parameter family of such

which there is an additional source current built from $\psi$. We also discuss
our recent work on the quantum geometry of logic in `digital' form over the

patch scheme to scenarios in which the trusted simulation resolves abrupt state

simulation for problems in these scenarios requires extending the patch scheme
by capturing the shock within a novel patch, and also modifying the patch

extensions to the patch scheme, straightforward arguments derive consistency
conditions that match the usual order of accuracy for patch schemes. The new

traffic routing and management functions are needed to coordinate the launching
of sUAS from different launch sites and determine their trajectories to avoid
conflict while considering several other constraints such as expected arrival
time, minimum flight energy, and availability of communication resources.
However, as the airborne sUAS density grows in a certain area, it is difficult
to foresee the potential airspace and communications resource conflicts and
make immediate decisions to avoid them. To address this challenge, we present a
temporal and spatial routing algorithm and simulation platform for sUAS
trajectory management in a high density urban area that plans sUAS movements in
a spatial and temporal maze taking into account obstacles that are either
static or dynamic in time. The routing allows the sUAS to avoid static no-fly
areas (i.e. static obstacles) or other in-flight sUAS and areas that have
congested communication resources (i.e. dynamic obstacles). The algorithm is
evaluated using an agent-based simulation platform. The simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms other route management algorithms in
many areas, especially in processing speed and memory efficiency. Detailed
comparisons are provided for the sUAS flight time, the overall throughput,
conflict rate and communication resource utilization. The results demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm can be used to address the airspace and
communication resource utilization needs for a next generation smart city and

spatial partitioning to distribute the workload. In contrast, the real-time
streamed spatial data follows non-uniform spatial distributions that are
continuously changing over time. Distributed spatial streaming systems need to
react to the changes in the distribution of spatial data and queries. This
paper introduces SWARM, a light-weight adaptivity protocol that continuously
monitors the data and query workloads across the distributed processes of the
spatial data streaming system, and redistribute and rebalance the workloads
soon as performance bottlenecks get detected. SWARM is able to handle multiple
query-execution and data-persistence models. A distributed streaming system can
directly use SWARM to adaptively rebalance the system's workload among its
machines with minimal changes to the original code of the underlying spatial

Ti cation ratio is high, however, phase separation occurs in the film which
leads to increased mechanical loss. These results indicate that for designing
low mechanical loss mixed oxide coatings for interferometry applications it
would be beneficial to identify materials with the ability to form ternary

Existing GNNs are presented using various techniques, making direct comparison
and cross-reference more complex. Although existing studies categorize GNNs
into spatial-based and spectral-based techniques, there hasn't been a thorough
examination of their relationship. To close this gap, this study presents a
single framework that systematically incorporates most GNNs. We organize
existing GNNs into spatial and spectral domains, as well as expose the
connections within each domain. A review of spectral graph theory and
approximation theory builds a strong relationship across the spatial and
spectral domains in further investigation.

a phrase, in a processing buffer until the unit is integrated into a
higher-level structure. After being integrated, the unit is removed from the
buffer and becomes activated long-term memory. In this model, the duration each

processing buffer follows the time courses of phrases and sentences, in line
with neurophysiological data, whether the syntactic structure of a sentence is
mentally parsed using a bottom-up or top-down predictive model. This model
generates a range of testable predictions about the link between linguistic

surface. This is the first known detection of thermal disk radiation reflecting

explained qualitatively by more efficient coronal cooling due to irradiating
disk photons. The disk inner radius is consistent with being within a few times
the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) throughout the bright-hard-to-soft

remains an intriguing research challenge how local optimal points are defined
and which algorithm can converge to such points. An interesting concept is
known as the local minimax point, which strongly correlates with the
widely-known gradient descent ascent algorithm. This paper aims to provide a
comprehensive analysis of local minimax points, such as their relation with
other solution concepts and their optimality conditions. We find that local
saddle points can be regarded as a special type of local minimax points, called
uniformly local minimax points, under mild continuity assumptions. In
(non-convex) quadratic games, we show that local minimax points are (in some
sense) equivalent to global minimax points. Finally, we study the stability of
gradient algorithms near local minimax points. Although gradient algorithms can
converge to local/global minimax points in the non-degenerate case, they would
often fail in general cases. This implies the necessity of either novel
algorithms or concepts beyond saddle points and minimax points in non-convex
smooth games.

complicated goals by leveraging expert behavior, rather than dealing with the
hardships of designing a correct reward function. With the environment modeled
as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), most of the existing IL algorithms are
contingent on the availability of expert demonstrations in the same MDP as the
one in which a new imitator policy is to be learned. This is uncharacteristic
of many real-life scenarios where discrepancies between the expert and the
imitator MDPs are common, especially in the transition dynamics function.
Furthermore, obtaining expert actions may be costly or infeasible, making the
recent trend towards state-only IL (where expert demonstrations constitute only
states or observations) ever so promising. Building on recent adversarial
imitation approaches that are motivated by the idea of divergence minimization,
we present a new state-only IL algorithm in this paper. It divides the overall
optimization objective into two subproblems by introducing an indirection step
and solves the subproblems iteratively. We show that our algorithm is
particularly effective when there is a transition dynamics mismatch between the
expert and imitator MDPs, while the baseline IL methods suffer from performance
degradation. To analyze this, we construct several interesting MDPs by

basic law of the movement of microscopic particles. Wigner-Yanase skew
information, as a measure of quantum uncertainties, is used to characterize the
intrinsic features of the state and the observable. In this paper, we mainly
investigate the sum uncertainty relations for both quantum mechanical
observables and quantum channels based on skew information. We establish a new
uncertainty relation in terms of Wigner-Yanase skew information for $n$
observables, which is saturated (thus it holds as equality) for two
incompatible observables. We also present two uncertainty relations for
arbitrary finite $N$ quantum channels by using skew information. Our
uncertainty relations have tighter lower bounds than the existing ones.

Departing from mainstream approaches, the proposed methodology uses no training

(RNN) as the decoder. However, RNN is prone to diluting long-term information.
Recent works have demonstrated memory network (MemNet) has the advantage of
storing long-term information. However, as the decoder, it has not been well
exploited for video captioning. The reason partially comes from the difficulty
of sequence decoding with MemNet. Instead of the common practice, i.e.,
sequence decoding with RNN, in this paper, we devise a novel memory decoder for
video captioning. Concretely, after obtaining representation of each frame
through a pre-trained network, we first fuse the visual and lexical
information. Then, at each time step, we construct a multi-layer MemNet-based
decoder, i.e., in each layer, we employ a memory set to store previous
information and an attention mechanism to select the information related to the
current input. Thus, this decoder avoids the dilution of long-term information.
And the multi-layer architecture is helpful for capturing dependencies between
frames and word sequences. Experimental results show that even without the
encoding network, our decoder still could obtain competitive performance and
outperform the performance of RNN decoder. Furthermore, compared with one-layer
RNN decoder, our decoder has fewer parameters.

Flows (GBNF) model a density by successively adding new NF components with
gradient boosting. Under the boosting framework, each new NF component
optimizes a sample weighted likelihood objective, resulting in new components
that are fit to the residuals of the previously trained components. The GBNF
formulation results in a mixture model structure, whose flexibility increases
as more components are added. Moreover, GBNFs offer a wider, as opposed to
strictly deeper, approach that improves existing NFs at the cost of additional
training---not more complex transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of this technique for density estimation and, by coupling GBNF with a
variational autoencoder, generative modeling of images. Our results show that
GBNFs outperform their non-boosted analog, and, in some cases, produce better
results with smaller, simpler flows.

the known Keplerian disks around three out of the five Class I objects in the
sample. No H$_2^{18}$O emission is detected toward any of our five Class I

the upper limit to the water abundance averaged over the inner warm disk with
$T>$ 100 K is between 10$^{-7}$ up to 10$^{-5}$. Water vapor is not abundant in
warm protostellar envelopes around Class I protostars. Upper limits to the

lower than values found in Class 0 disk-like structures.

  Grasping in Clutter by State Representation Learning Based on Disentanglement
  of a Raw Input Image",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a robotic grasping task in which diverse unseen target objects exist in a
cluttered environment, some deep learning-based methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results using visual input directly. In contrast, actor-critic
deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically perform very poorly when
grasping diverse objects, especially when learning from raw images and sparse
rewards. To make these RL techniques feasible for vision-based grasping tasks,
we employ state representation learning (SRL), where we encode essential
information first for subsequent use in RL. However, typical representation
learning procedures are unsuitable for extracting pertinent information for
learning the grasping skill, because the visual inputs for representation
learning, where a robot attempts to grasp a target object in clutter, are
extremely complex. We found that preprocessing based on the disentanglement of
a raw input image is the key to effectively capturing a compact representation.
This enables deep RL to learn robotic grasping skills from highly varied and
diverse visual inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with
varying levels of disentanglement in a realistic simulated environment.

can seriously affect the final machine learning result. Most existing
algorithms for handling outliers take high time complexities (e.g. quadratic or
cubic complexity). {\em Coreset} is a popular approach for compressing data so
as to speed up the optimization algorithms. However, the current coreset
methods cannot be easily extended to handle the case with outliers. In this
paper, we propose a new variant of coreset technique, {\em layered sampling},
to deal with two fundamental robust optimization problems: {\em
$k$-median/means clustering with outliers} and {\em linear regression with
outliers}. This new coreset method is in particular suitable to speed up the
iterative algorithms (which often improve the solution within a local range)
for those robust optimization problems. Moreover, our method is easy to be
implemented in practice. We expect that our framework of layered sampling will

  localization in point and line map",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Map based visual inertial localization is a crucial step to reduce the drift
in state estimation of mobile robots. The underlying problem for localization
is to estimate the pose from a set of 3D-2D feature correspondences, of which
the main challenge is the presence of outliers, especially in changing
environment. In this paper, we propose a robust solution based on efficient
global optimization of the consensus maximization problem, which is insensitive
to high percentage of outliers. We first introduce translation invariant
measurements (TIMs) for both points and lines to decouple the consensus
maximization problem into rotation and translation subproblems, allowing for a
two-stage solver with reduced solution dimensions. Then we show that (i) the
rotation can be calculated by minimizing TIMs using only 1-dimensional
branch-and-bound (BnB), (ii) the translation can be found by running
1-dimensional search for three times with prioritized progressive voting.
Compared with the popular randomized solver, our solver achieves deterministic
global convergence without depending on an initial value. While compared with
existing BnB based methods, ours is exponentially faster. Finally, by
evaluating the performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, our
approach gives accurate pose even when there are 90\% outliers (only 2
inliers).

to our approach: we use the largest spectroscopic data set currently available,

Moreover, rather than employing scaling relations, we calculate cluster masses
individually using the virial mass estimator. Since $\mathtt{GalWCat19}$ is a
low-redshift cluster catalog we do not need to make any assumptions about

clusters themselves. Our constraints on \om ~and \sig ~are consistent and very
competitive with those obtained from non-cluster abundance cosmological probes

Because a real-world dataset may contain significant noise or even specially
crafted samples from some attacker, we are particularly interested in the
optimization problems with arbitrary (and potentially adversarial) outliers. We
focus on two fundamental optimization problems: {\em SVM with outliers} and
{\em $k$-center clustering with outliers}. They are in fact extremely
challenging combinatorial optimization problems, since we cannot impose any
restriction on the adversarial outliers. Therefore, their computational
complexities are quite high especially when we consider the instances in high
dimensional spaces. The {\em Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Transform} is one of
the most popular methods for dimension reduction. Though the JL transform has
been widely studied in the past decades, its effectiveness for dealing with
adversarial outliers has never been investigated before (to the best of our
knowledge). Based on some novel insights from the geometry, we prove that the
complexities of these two problems can be significantly reduced through the JL
transform. Moreover, we prove that the solution in the dimensionality-reduced
space can be efficiently recovered in the original $\mathbb{R}^d$ while the
quality is still preserved. In the experiments, we compare JL transform with
several other well known dimension reduction methods, and study their
performances on synthetic and real datasets.

state basis that leads to the non-linear sigma-model, we use a new basis called
the fluctuating matrix product states (fMPS) which embodies inter-site
entanglement from the outset. It forms an overcomplete set spanning the entire
Hilbert space of the spin-1 chain. Saddle-point analysis performed for the
bilinear-biquadratic spin model predicts Affeck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT)

effective action derived by gradient expansion around the saddle point is free
from constraints that plagued the non-linear sigma model and exactly solvable.
The obtained excitation modes agree precisely with the single-mode
approximation result for the AKLT Hamiltonian. Excitation spectra for other
BLBQ Hamiltonians are obtained as well by diagonalizing the quadratic action.

Viterbi-based loss. Our first contribution is the formulation of a new
set-constrained Viterbi algorithm (SCV). Given a video, the SCV generates the
MAP action segmentation that satisfies the ground truth. This prediction is
used as a framewise pseudo ground truth in our HMM training. Our second
contribution in training is a new regularization of feature affinities between
training videos that share the same action classes. Evaluation on action

similarity graphs, which are either pre-computed in the high-dimensional space
or obtained from random anchor points. On the one hand, existing methods
uncouple the procedures of hash function learning and graph construction. On
the other hand, graphs empirically built upon original data could introduce
biased prior knowledge of data relevance, leading to sub-optimal retrieval
performance. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing an
efficient and adaptive code-driven graph, which is updated by decoding in the
context of an auto-encoder. Specifically, we introduce into our framework twin
bottlenecks (i.e., latent variables) that exchange crucial information
collaboratively. One bottleneck (i.e., binary codes) conveys the high-level
intrinsic data structure captured by the code-driven graph to the other (i.e.,
continuous variables for low-level detail information), which in turn
propagates the updated network feedback for the encoder to learn more
discriminative binary codes. The auto-encoding learning objective literally
rewards the code-driven graph to learn an optimal encoder. Moreover, the
proposed model can be simply optimized by gradient descent without violating
the binary constraints. Experiments on benchmarked datasets clearly show the
superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art hashing methods. Our

and has received tremendous attention from many different areas. A major issue
of the original DBSCAN is that the time complexity could be as large as
quadratic. Most of existing DBSCAN algorithms focus on developing efficient
index structures to speed up the procedure in low-dimensional Euclidean space.
However, the research of DBSCAN in high-dimensional Euclidean space or general
metric space is still quite limited, to the best of our knowledge. In this
paper, we consider the metric DBSCAN problem under the assumption that the
inliers (excluding the outliers) have a low doubling dimension. We apply a
novel randomized $k$-center clustering idea to reduce the complexity of range
query, which is the most time consuming step in the whole DBSCAN procedure. Our
proposed algorithms do not need to build any complicated data structures and
are easy to be implemented in practice. The experimental results show that our
algorithms can significantly outperform the existing DBSCAN algorithms in terms
of running time.

potential applications such as helping hands for humans where a human can not
reach to have an assessment of the hazardous environment. Also, these kinds of
robot can be controlled remotely with an adequate control system. The proposed
methodology forces on two issues : 1. Novel mechanism design for measuring
rotation, joints, links of Degree of Freedom DOF for an arm which is integrated
with Sigma 3, 2. Precise measuring of end effector motion control over three
dimensions. In the proposed mechanism design, the DOF measurement is presented
by a planar and spatial mechanism where 4 types of rigid joints build up each
DOF with controlling by six High Torque MG996R servo motors. Rotation and DOF
measurement are consisting of different theoretical references of Rotation
Matrix, Inverse Kinematics with experimental results. Presented methodology
over Oscillation Damping performance exhibits less than 3 percent error while
configuring for on hands testing. Another evaluation of operating time state
strongly defends the mechanism of low power consumption ability.

the umbrella of Neuromorphic engineering to analyze what are the common
features among such systems. We see that there is no clear consensus but each
system has one or more of the following features:(1) Analog computing (2) Non
vonNeumann Architecture and low-precision digital processing (3) Spiking Neural
Networks (SNN) with components closely related to biology. We compare recent
machine learning accelerator chips to show that indeed analog processing and
reduced bit precision architectures have best throughput, energy and area
efficiencies. However, pure digital architectures can also achieve quite high
efficiencies by just adopting a non von-Neumann architecture. Given the design
automation tools for digital hardware design, it raises a question on the
likelihood of adoption of analog processing in the near future for industrial
designs. Next, we argue about the importance of defining standards and choosing
proper benchmarks for the progress of neuromorphic system designs and propose
some desired characteristics of such benchmarks. Finally, we show brain-machine
interfaces as a potential task that fulfils all the criteria of such
benchmarks.

clues to the evolution of the spin state of asteroids. However, so far, very
few studies have focused on NPA-rotating main-belt asteroids (MBAs). One of
MBAs that are known to be in an excited rotation state is asteroid (5247)
Krylov. Aims. By using disk-integrated photometric data, we construct a
physical model of (5247) Krylov including shape and spin state. Methods. We
apply the light curve convex inversion method employing optical light curves
obtained by using ground-based telescopes in three apparitions during 2006,
2016, and 2017, along with infrared light curves obtained by the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite in 2010. Results. Asteroid
(5247)~Krylov is spinning in a short axis mode (SAM) characterized by rotation
and precession periods of 368.7 hr and 67.27 hr, respectively. The angular
momentum vector orientation of Krylov is found to be $\lambda_{L} = 298^\circ$
and $\beta_{L} = -58^\circ$. The ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the
basic spin state energy $E/E_{0} \simeq 1.02$ shows that the (5247) Krylov is
about 2% excited state compared to the Principal Axis (PA) rotation state. The
shape of (5247) Krylov can be approximated by an elongated prolate ellipsoid
with a ratio of moments of inertia of $I_{a}:I_{b}:I_{c}=0.36:0.96:1$. This is
the first physical model of NPA rotator among MBAs. The physical processes that
led to the current NPA rotation cannot be unambiguously reconstructed.

due to the severe training bias, e.g., collapsing diverse ""human walk on / sit

such as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of
objects. However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing
methods cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context
prior (e.g., ""person read book"" rather than ""eat"") and bad long-tailed bias
(e.g., ""near"" dominating ""behind / in front of""). In this paper, we present a
novel SGG framework based on causal inference but not the conventional
likelihood. We first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional
biased training with the graph. Then, we propose to draw the counterfactual
causality from the trained graph to infer the effect from the bad bias, which
should be removed. In particular, we use Total Direct Effect (TDE) as the
proposed final predicate score for unbiased SGG. Note that our framework is
agnostic to any SGG model and thus can be widely applied in the community who
seeks unbiased predictions. By using the proposed Scene Graph Diagnosis toolkit
on the SGG benchmark Visual Genome and several prevailing models, we observed
significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods.

packet dropping rate of the relay-buffer is studied at first. With the packet
dropping rate and stationary distribution of the system state, the closed-form
expression of the delay is derived. Then the energy efficiency for
relay-assisted transmission is investigated, which takes into account the
queueing process of the relay and the source. In this context, an energy
efficiency optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimum strategy
of power and time allocation for the relay-assisted cooperative system.
Finally, the energy efficient switching strategy between the relay assisted
transmission and the direct transmission is obtained, where packet
transmissions have different delay requirements. In addition, energy efficient
transmission policy with AMC is obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design improving the energy efficiency.

without relying on ground truth annotations. Instead, it generates
probabilistic training labels by estimating the accuracies of multiple noisy
labeling sources (e.g., heuristics, crowd workers). Existing approaches use
latent variable estimation to model the noisy sources, but these methods can be
computationally expensive, scaling superlinearly in the data. In this work, we
show that, for a class of latent variable models highly applicable to weak
supervision, we can find a closed-form solution to model parameters, obviating
the need for iterative solutions like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We use
this insight to build FlyingSquid, a weak supervision framework that runs
orders of magnitude faster than previous weak supervision approaches and
requires fewer assumptions. In particular, we prove bounds on generalization
error without assuming that the latent variable model can exactly parameterize
the underlying data distribution. Empirically, we validate FlyingSquid on
benchmark weak supervision datasets and find that it achieves the same or
higher quality compared to previous approaches without the need to tune an SGD
procedure, recovers model parameters 170 times faster on average, and enables
new video analysis and online learning applications.

contrastive loss function that enforces action equivariance on the learned
representations. We prove that when our loss is zero, we have a homomorphism of
a deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP). Learning equivariant maps leads
to structured latent spaces, allowing us to build a model on which we plan
through value iteration. We show experimentally that for deterministic MDPs,
the optimal policy in the abstract MDP can be successfully lifted to the
original MDP. Moreover, the approach easily adapts to changes in the goal
states. Empirically, we show that in such MDPs, we obtain better
representations in fewer epochs compared to representation learning approaches
using reconstructions, while generalizing better to new goals than model-free
approaches.

Many novel properties and applications have been proposed around the EPs. One
of the important applications is to enhance the detection sensitivity. However,
due to the lack of single-handed superchiral fields, all of the proposed
EP-based sensing mechanisms are only useful for the non-chiral discrimination.
Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a new type of EP,

fields for chiral sensing. This type of EP is realized by suitably tuning the
coupling strength and radiation losses for a pair of orthogonal polarization
modes in the photonic crystal slab. Based on the unique modal-coupling property
at the vector EP, we demonstrate that the uniform superchiral fields can be
generated with two beams of lights illuminating on the photonic crystal slab
from opposite directions. Thus, the designed photonic crystal slab, which
supports the vector EP, can be used to perform surface-enhanced chiral
detection. Our findings provide a new strategy for ultrasensitive
characterization and quantification of molecular chirality, a key aspect for
various bioscience and biomedicine applications.

via the magnetic flux conservation scenario of a fossil field. If NSWD mergers
can indeed create magnetars, then such objects could produce at least a subset

widespread attention and it has become a hot research topic in the computer
vision domain. Deep learning features already available in 3D object retrieval
have been proven to be better than the retrieval performance of hand-crafted
features. However, most existing networks do not take into account the impact
of multi-view image selection on network training, and the use of contrastive
loss alone only forcing the same-class samples to be as close as possible. In
this work, a novel solution named Multi-view Discrimination and Pairwise CNN
(MDPCNN) for 3D object retrieval is proposed to tackle these issues. It can
simultaneously input of multiple batches and multiple views by adding the Slice
layer and the Concat layer. Furthermore, a highly discriminative network is
obtained by training samples that are not easy to be classified by clustering.
Lastly, we deploy the contrastive-center loss and contrastive loss as the
optimization objective that has better intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Large-scale experiments show that the proposed MDPCNN can achieve
a significant performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms in 3D object

discretized matrix of IFL. Moreover, the proposed schemes use the fast
sum-of-exponential approximation and Toeplitz matrix algorithms to reduce the
computational cost for the nonlocal property of time and space fractional
derivatives, respectively. The fast schemes greatly reduce the computational
work of solving the discretized linear systems from $\mathcal{O}(MN^3 + M^2N)$

and computation-intensive to suit low-capability devices or applications with
strict latency requirements. One potential remedy for this is model
compression, which has attracted a lot of research attention. Here, we
summarize the research in compressing Transformers, focusing on the especially
popular BERT model. In particular, we survey the state of the art in
compression for BERT, we clarify the current best practices for compressing
large-scale Transformer models, and we provide insights into the workings of
various methods. Our categorization and analysis also shed light on promising
future research directions for achieving lightweight, accurate, and generic NLP
models.

control arm to switch to the treatment arm if their physical conditions are
worse than certain tolerance levels. The Intention-To-Treat analysis provides
valid causal estimates of the effect of assignment, but it does not measure the
effect of the actual receipt of the treatment and ignores the information of
treatment switching. Other existing methods propose to reconstruct the outcome
a unit would have had if s/he had not switched under strong assumptions. We
propose to re-define the problem of treatment switching using principal
stratification focusing on principal causal effects for patients belonging to
subpopulations defined by the switching behavior under control. We use a
Bayesian approach to inference taking into account that (i) switching happens
in continuous time generating infinitely many principal strata; (ii) switching
time is not defined for units who never switch in a particular experiment; and
(iii) survival time and switching time are subject to censoring. We illustrate
our framework using a synthetic dataset based on the Concorde study, a
randomized controlled trial aimed to assess causal effects on time-to-disease
progression or death of immediate versus deferred treatment with zidovudine
among patients with asymptomatic HIV infection.

data--driven threshold along the ranking to control the FDR. The SDA filter
substantially outperforms the knockoff method in power under moderate to strong

for the actual FDR under general dependence, and then establish the asymptotic
validity of SDA for both the FDR and false discovery proportion (FDP) control

the correct description of light-matter interaction in solids. In monolayer
semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoSe$_2$ or
WSe$_2$, most optoelectronic phenomena are described well by labelling electron
and hole states with the spin projection along the normal to the layer (S$_z$).
In contrast, for WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ interfaces recent experiments show that
taking S$_z$ as quantum number is not a good approximation, and spin mixing
needs to be always considered. Here we argue that the correct quantum number
for these systems is not S$_z$, but the $z$-component of the total angular
momentum -- J$_z$ = L$_z$ + S$_z$ -- associated to the C$_3$ rotational lattice
symmetry, which assumes half-integer values corresponding modulo 3 to distinct
states. We validate this conclusion experimentally through the observation of
strong intervalley scattering mediated by chiral optical phonons that --
despite carrying angular momentum 1 -- cause resonant intervalley transitions
of excitons, with an angular momentum difference of 2.

framework for modeling coordinated decision-making problems in multi-agent
systems with a set of discrete variables. Later works have extended DCOPs to
model problems with a set of continuous variables, named Functional DCOPs
(F-DCOPs). In this paper, we combine both of these frameworks into the Mixed
Integer Functional DCOP (MIF-DCOP) framework that can deal with problems
regardless of their variables' type. We then propose a novel algorithm $-$
Distributed Parallel Simulated Annealing (DPSA), where agents cooperatively
learn the optimal parameter configuration for the algorithm while also solving
the given problem using the learned knowledge. Finally, we empirically evaluate
our approach in DCOP, F-DCOP, and MIF-DCOP settings and show that DPSA produces
solutions of significantly better quality than the state-of-the-art non-exact
algorithms in their corresponding settings.

unassisted setting, we introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework

bits extractable from a given quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum
number of coherent bits that can be distilled from the same state. This
relation enables us to derive tight second order expansions of both tasks in
the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent
operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states
all admit the same second order expansions, indicating their operational
equivalence for coherence distillation in both asymptotic and large block
length regime. We then generalize the above line of research to the assisted

coherence from the state at hand, aided by the benevolent Alice possessing the
other system. More precisely, we introduce a new assisted incoherent randomness
extraction task and establish an exact relation between this task and the
assisted coherence distillation. This strengthens the one-shot relation in the
unassisted setting and confirms that this cryptographic framework indeed offers
a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence distillation. Likewise,
this relation yields second order characterizations to the assisted tasks. As
by-products, we show the strong converse property of the aforementioned tasks

While this relatively small
number of planets in binaries is probably partly due to strong observational
biases, there is, however, statistical evidence that planets are indeed less
frequent in binaries with separations smaller than 100 au, strongly suggesting
that the presence of a close in companion star has an adverse effect on planet
formation. It is indeed possible for the gravitational pull of the second star
to affect all the different stages of planet formation, from proto-planetary
disk formation to dust accumulation into planetesimals, to the accretion of
these planetesimals into large planetary embryos and, eventually, the final
growth of these embryos into planets. For the crucial planetesimal accretion
phase, the complex coupling between dynamical perturbations from the binary and
friction due to gas in the protoplanetary disk suggests that planetesimal
accretion might be hampered due to increased, accretion hostile impact
velocities. Likewise, the interplay between the binary secular perturbations
and mean motion resonances lead to unstable regions, where not only planet
formation is inhibited, but where a massive body would be ejected from the
system on a hyperbolic orbit. The amplitude of these two main effects is
different for S and P type planets, so that a comparison between the two
populations might outline the influence of the companion star on the planet
formation process. Unfortunately, at present the two populations (circumstellar
or circumbinary) are not known equally well and different biases and
uncertainties prevent a quantitative comparison. We also highlight the long

different evolutions influence the final architecture of planetary systems in

Stokes equations with the classical interface conditions, the Navier boundary
condition for the slip velocity along the wall and a contact line condition
which relates the dynamic contact angle of the interface to the contact line
velocity. We propose an efficient numerical method for the model. The method
combines a finite element method for the Navier-Stokes/Stokes equations on a
moving mesh with a parametric finite element method for the dynamics of the
fluid interface. The contact line condition is formulated as a time-dependent
Robin-type of boundary condition for the interface so it is naturally imposed
in the weak form of the contact line model. For the Navier-Stokes equations,
the numerical scheme obeys a similar energy law as in the continuum model but
up to an error due to the interpolation of numerical solutions on the moving
mesh. In contrast, for Stokes flows, the interpolation is not needed so we can
prove the global unconditional stability of the numerical method in terms of
the energy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the convergence and
accuracy of the numerical methods.

an attribute graph with label information of a small number of instances.
Although with standard anomaly detection methods it is usually assumed that
instances are independent and identically distributed, in many real-world
applications, instances are often explicitly connected with each other,
resulting in so-called attributed graphs. The proposed method embeds nodes
(instances) on the attributed graph in the latent space by taking into account
their attributes as well as the graph structure based on graph convolutional
networks (GCNs). To learn node embeddings specialized for anomaly detection, in
which there is a class imbalance due to the rarity of anomalies, the parameters
of a GCN are trained to minimize the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the
node embeddings of normal instances while embedding anomalous ones outside the
hypersphere. This enables us to detect anomalies by simply calculating the
distances between the node embeddings and hypersphere center. The proposed
method can effectively propagate label information on a small amount of nodes
to unlabeled ones by taking into account the node's attributes, graph
structure, and class imbalance. In experiments with five real-world attributed
graph datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better
performance than various existing anomaly detection methods.

large amount of heterogeneous data. We analyze the primary source in dataset
search - metadata - and determine if they reflect scholarly search interests.
We examine if metadata standards provide elements corresponding to search
interests, we inspect if selected data repositories use metadata standards
representing scholarly interests, and we determine how many fields of the
metadata standards used are filled. To determine search interests in
biodiversity research, we gathered 169 questions that researchers aimed to
answer with the help of retrieved data, identified biological entities and
grouped them into 13 categories. Our findings indicate that environments,
materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations,
data parameters and data types are important search interests in biodiversity
research. The comparison with existing metadata standards shows that
domain-specific standards cover search interests quite well, whereas general
standards do not explicitly contain elements that reflect search interests. We
inspect metadata from five large data repositories. Our results confirm that
metadata currently poorly reflect search interests in biodiversity research.
From these findings, we derive recommendations for researchers and data
repositories how to bridge the gap between search interest and metadata
provided.

nuclear spins by virtue of the dipolar interaction. New technological advances
have enabled simultaneous tuning of the radio-frequency resonance circuits to
nuclei with close Larmor frequencies, bringing a great promise also to distance
measurements between such nuclei, in particular for nuclei with a spin larger
than one-half. However, this new possibility has also required modifications of
those experiments since the two nuclei cannot be irradiated simultaneously.
When measuring distances between a spin S=1/2 and a quadrupolar spin (S > 1/2),
this drawback can be overcome by splitting the continuous-wave recoupling pulse
applied to the quadrupolar nucleus. We show here that a similar adjustment to a
highly-efficient phase-modulated (PM) recoupling pulse enables distance
measurements between nuclei with close Larmor frequencies, where the coupled
spin experiences a very large coupling. Such an experiment, split
phase-modulated RESPDOR, is demonstrated on a 13C-81Br system, where the
difference in Larmor frequencies is only 7%, or 11.2 MHz on a 14.1T magnet. The
inter-nuclear distances are extracted using an unscaled analytical formula.
Since bromine usually experiences particularly high quadrupolar couplings, as
in the current case, we suggest that the split-PM-RESPDOR experiment can be
highly beneficial for the research of bromo-compounds, including many
pharmaceuticals, where carbon-bromine bonds are prevalent, and organo-catalysts
utilizing the high reactivity of bromides. We show that for butyl
triphenylphosphonium bromide, distances are in agreement with a low-hydration
compound rather than a semi-clathrate form. The split-PM-RESPDOR experiment is
suitable for distance measurement between any quadrupolar/spin-1/2 pairs, in
particular when the quadrupolar spin experiences a significantly large
coupling.

completely inhibit the local density of optical states (LDOS) at every position

infinite crystals, whereas any real crystal device is necessarily finite. This
raises the question as to how the LDOS in the gap depends on the position and
orientation inside a finite-size crystal. Therefore, we employ rigorous
numerical calculations using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
of 3D silicon inverse woodpile crystals filled with air or with toluene, as
previously studied in experiments. We find that the LDOS versus position
decreases exponentially into the bulk of the crystal. From the dependence on
dipole orientation, we infer that the characteristic LDOS decay length
$\ell_{\rho}$ is mostly related to far-field dipolar radiation effects, whereas
the prefactor is mostly related to near-field dipolar effects. The LDOS decay
length has a remarkably similar magnitude as the Bragg length for directional
transport, which suggests that the LDOS in the crystal is dominated by vacuum
states that tunnel from the closest interface towards the position of interest.

  paragraph in memoriam of the late Bob Behringer",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Isostaticity theory (IT) provides stress field equations for marginally rigid
packs of non-cohesive particles, interacting through hard-core forces. Its main
advantage over strain-based theories is by closing the stress equations with
stress-structure, rather than stress-strain, relations, which enables modelling
the stress chains, often observed in experiments and simulations. The
usefulness of IT has been argued to extend beyond its applicability at marginal
rigidity. It has been shown to be derivable from first principles in
two-dimensions, with the structure quantified by a fabric tensor that couples
to the stress field. However, upscaling IT to the continuum is done currently
empirically by postulating convenient closure equations. The problem is that a
volume average of the fabric tensor vanishes in the continuum limit,
trivialising the closure equation. This poses an unusual upscaling problem,
necessitating a new approach. Such an approach is developed here, resolving the
problem for planar granular assemblies. The new method is developed initially
for idealised 'unfrustrated' packs by coarse-graining first to the two-grain
scale, after which a conventional coarse-graining can be used. It is then
extended to general realistic systems, by introducing an intermediate
`de-frustration' procedure. The applicability of the method is illustrated with
a tractable example.

importance to capture multi-scale contexts for obtaining precise segmentation
masks. This paper proposes a novel series-parallel hybrid paradigm called the
Chained Context Aggregation Module (CAM) to diversify feature propagation. CAM
gains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style
information flows and fuses them in a two-stage process, namely pre-fusion and
re-fusion. The serial flow continuously increases receptive fields of output
neurons and those in parallel encode different region-based contexts. Each
information flow is a shallow encoder-decoder with appropriate down-sampling
scales to sufficiently capture contextual information. We further adopt an
attention model in CAM to guide feature re-fusion. Based on these developments,
we construct the Chained Context Aggregation Network (CANet), which employs an
asymmetric decoder to recover precise spatial details of prediction maps. We
conduct extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, including Pascal VOC
2012, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, CamVid, SUN-RGBD and GATECH. Results evidence
that CANet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Auriga project to examine the properties of surviving and destroyed dwarf
galaxies that are accreted by these haloes over cosmic time. We show that the
combined luminosity function of surviving and destroyed dwarfs at infall is
similar in the various Auriga haloes, and is dominated by the destroyed dwarfs.
There is, however, a strong dependence on infall time: destroyed dwarfs have
typically early infall times, $t_{infall}<6$ Gyr, whereas the majority of
dwarfs accreted at $t_{infall}>10$ Gyr have survived to the present day.
Because of their late infall the surviving satellites today had higher
metallicites at infall than their destroyed counterparts of similar infall
mass; the difference is even more pronounced for the present-day metallicites
of satellites, many of which continue to form stars after infall. In agreement
with previous work, we find that a small number of relatively massive destroyed
dwarf galaxies dominate the mass of the stellar haloes. However, there is a
significant radial dependence: while 90 per cent of the mass in the inner
regions ($<\,20\,$kpc) is contributed, on average, by only 3 massive
progenitors, the outer regions ($>\,100\,$kpc) typically have $\sim8$ main
progenitors of relatively lower mass. Finally, we show that a few massive
progenitors dominate the metallicity distribution of accreted stars, even at
the metal poor end. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, dwarf
galaxies of mass $M_{*}<10^7 \, M_{\odot}$ make up less than 10 per cent of the
accreted, metal poor stars ([Fe/H] $<\,-3$) in the inner $50\,$kpc.

recent years, with many successful variants such as MixUp and CutMix. By
studying the mutual information between the function learned by a VAE on the
original data and on the augmented data we show that MixUp distorts learned
functions in a way that CutMix does not. We further demonstrate this by showing
that MixUp acts as a form of adversarial training, increasing robustness to
attacks such as Deep Fool and Uniform Noise which produce examples similar to
those generated by MixUp. We argue that this distortion prevents models from
learning about sample specific features in the data, aiding generalisation
performance. In contrast, we suggest that CutMix works more like a traditional
augmentation, improving performance by preventing memorisation without
distorting the data distribution. However, we argue that an MSDA which builds
on CutMix to include masks of arbitrary shape, rather than just square, could
further prevent memorisation whilst preserving the data distribution in the
same way. To this end, we propose FMix, an MSDA that uses random binary masks
obtained by applying a threshold to low frequency images sampled from Fourier
space. These random masks can take on a wide range of shapes and can be
generated for use with one, two, and three dimensional data. FMix improves
performance over MixUp and CutMix, without an increase in training time, for a
number of models across a range of data sets and problem settings, obtaining a
new single model state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10 without external data.
Finally, we show that a consequence of the difference between interpolating
MSDA such as MixUp and masking MSDA such as FMix is that the two can be
combined to improve performance even further. Code for all experiments is

detected in this cluster. We find significant dips in the radial distribution
profiles of X-ray sources in M28, with the projected distance and width of the

give a slightly larger average mass for the bright sources

Compared with 47 Tuc and Terzan 5, we show that the dynamical age of M28 is
comparable to Terzan 5 and much smaller than 47 Tuc, but it is evolving more
fast (i.e., with smaller two-body relaxation timescale) than 47 Tuc. These
features may suggest an acceleration effect of cluster dynamical evolution by
tidal shock in M28. Besides, we find an abnormal deficiency of X-ray sources in
the central region ($R \lesssim 1.5 \rm~arcmin$) of M28 than its outskirts,
which indicate that M28 may have suffered an early phase of primordial binary
disruption within its central region, and mass segregation effect will erase
such a phenomenon as cluster evolve to older dynamical age.

state is thermal. The latter condition is trivially satisfied for two-level
systems, while this is generally no longer true for $N$-level systems, with $N
> 2$. Focusing on three-level systems, we discuss the occurrence of a unique
energy scale factor $\beta_{\rm eff}$ that formally plays the role of an
effective inverse temperature in the Jarzynski equality. To this aim, we
introduce a suitable parametrization of the initial state in terms of a thermal
and a non-thermal component. We determine the value of $\beta_{\rm eff}$ for a
large number of measurements and study its dependence on the initial state. Our
predictions could be checked experimentally in quantum optics.

their strong, radiatively-driven winds throughout their lives and as supernovae

While recent studies indicate that about 7% of OB stars in the Milky Way host
strong, stable, organised (fossil) magnetic fields at their surfaces, little is
known about the fields of very massive stars, nor the magnetic properties of
stars outside our Galaxy. We aim to continue searching for strong magnetic
fields in a diverse set of massive and very massive stars (VMS) in the Large

of FORS2 to usefully search for and detect stellar magnetic fields in
extra-galactic environments. We have obtained FORS2 spectropolarimetry of a
sample of 41 stars, which principally consist of spectral types B, O, Of/WN,
WNh, and classical WR stars in the LMC and SMC. Four of our targets are Of?p

infer the longitudinal magnetic field. No magnetic fields were formally

that the Of?p star SMC159-2 is magnetic with a dipolar field of the order of
2.4 to 4.4kG. In addition, our first constraints of magnetic fields in VMS

Chanin Monte Charlo (MCMC) analysis using the observation data sets. The values
of present Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter and the redshift of

for a comparison of the present models. A phase space constructed of two
different statefinder parameters breaks the degeneracy of the models. It is

  analysis without user intervention",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mammography is the primary imaging modality used for early detection and
diagnosis of breast cancer. X-ray mammogram analysis mainly refers to the
localization of suspicious regions of interest followed by segmentation,
towards further lesion classification into benign versus malignant. Among
diverse types of breast abnormalities, masses are the most important clinical
findings of breast carcinomas. However, manually segmenting breast masses from
native mammograms is time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, an integrated
computer-aided diagnosis system is required to assist clinicians for automatic
and precise breast mass delineation. In this work, we present a two-stage
multi-scale pipeline that provides accurate mass contours from high-resolution
full mammograms. First, we propose an extended deep detector integrating a
multi-scale fusion strategy for automated mass localization. Second, a
convolutional encoder-decoder network using nested and dense skip connections
is employed to fine-delineate candidate masses. Unlike most previous studies
based on segmentation from regions, our framework handles mass segmentation
from native full mammograms without any user intervention. Trained on INbreast
and DDSM-CBIS public datasets, the pipeline achieves an overall average Dice of
80.44% on INbreast test images, outperforming state-of-the-art. Our system
shows promising accuracy as an automatic full-image mass segmentation system.
Extensive experiments reveals robustness against the diversity of size, shape
and appearance of breast masses, towards better interaction-free computer-aided
diagnosis.

during large scale movement would therefore be useful. Such multi-scale
observations, however, are challenging. With video, for example, there is
typically a trade-off between the volume over which an animal can be recorded
and spatial resolution within the volume. Even with high pixel-count cameras,
motion blur can be a challenge when using available light. Here we present a
new approach for tracking animals, such as insects, with an optical system that
bypasses this tradeoff by actively pointing a telephoto video camera at the
animal. This system is based around high-speed pan-tilt mirrors which steer an
optical path shared by a quadrant photodiode and a high-resolution, high-speed
telephoto video recording system. The mirror is directed to lock on to the
image of a 25-milligram retroreflector worn by the animal. This system allows
high-magnification videography with reduced motion blur over a large tracking
volume. With our prototype, we obtained millisecond order closed-loop latency
and recorded videos of flying insects in a tracking volume extending to an
axial distance of 3 meters and horizontally and vertically by 40 degrees. The
system offers increased capabilities compared to other video recording
solutions and may be useful for the study of animal behavior and the design of

coupling with the lattice degrees of freedom. The observed splitting is of the
order of ~ 2-3 meV and is consistent with the estimated value. We also observed

of recognizing the most important features. In this paper, we provide a new
feature selection method (DRPT) that consists of first removing the irrelevant
features and then detecting correlations between the remaining features. Let
$D=[A\mid \mathbf{b}]$ be a dataset, where $\mathbf{b}$ is the class label and
$A$ is a matrix whose columns are the features. We solve $A\mathbf{x} =
\mathbf{b}$ using the least squares method and the pseudo-inverse of $A$. Each
component of $\mathbf{x}$ can be viewed as an assigned weight to the
corresponding column (feature). We define a threshold based on the local maxima
of $\mathbf{x}$ and remove those features whose weights are smaller than the
threshold.
  To detect the correlations in the reduced matrix, which we still call $A$, we
consider a perturbation $\tilde A$ of $A$. We prove that correlations are
encoded in $\Delta\mathbf{x}=\mid \mathbf{x} -\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\mid $, where
$\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ is the least quares solution of
  $\tilde A\tilde{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{b}$. We cluster features first based on
$\Delta\mathbf{x}$ and then using the entropy of features. Finally, a feature
is selected from each sub-cluster based on its weight and entropy. The
effectiveness of DRPT has been verified by performing a series of comparisons
with seven state-of-the-art feature selection methods over ten genetic datasets
ranging up from 9,117 to 267,604 features. The results show that, over all, the
performance of DRPT is favorable in several aspects compared to each feature

whether the DRC can quantify the similarity of data sets and whether the DRC

address this problem using two video streams as input; an auxiliary video with

recent work has focused on unsupervised domain adaptation, we consider a more
realistic scenario where a large amount of synthetic training data is
supplemented by a small set of real images with ground-truth. In this setting,
we find that existing domain translation approaches are difficult to train and
offer little advantage over simple baselines that use a mix of real and

objects and clutter not present in synthetic training. This high-level domain
shift isn't handled by existing image translation models.
  Based on these observations, we develop an attention module that learns to
identify and remove difficult out-of-domain regions in real images in order to
improve depth prediction for a model trained primarily on synthetic data. We
carry out extensive experiments to validate our attend-remove-complete approach

adaptation methods for depth prediction. Visualizing the removed regions

denoising network (CCADN) has achieved state-of-the-art results by enforcing
cycle-consistent loss without the need of paired training data. Our detailed
analysis of CCADN raises a number of interesting questions. For example, if the
noise is large leading to significant difference between domain $X$ and domain
$Y$, can we bridge $X$ and $Y$ with an intermediate domain $Z$ such that both
the denoising process between $X$ and $Z$ and that between $Z$ and $Y$ are
easier to learn? As such intermediate domains lead to multiple cycles, how do
we best enforce cycle-consistency? Driven by these questions, we propose a
multi-cycle-consistent adversarial network (MCCAN) that builds intermediate
domains and enforces both local and global cycle-consistency. The global
cycle-consistency couples all generators together to model the whole denoising
process, while the local cycle-consistency imposes effective supervision on the
process between adjacent domains. Experiments show that both local and global
cycle-consistency are important for the success of MCCAN, which outperforms the

pulsar that went into outburst around July 21, 2018. To better understand the
physics acting in these systems during the outburst episode we performed
detailed temporal-, timing- and spectral analyses across the 0.3-300 keV band
using data from NICER, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL. The hard X-ray 20-60
keV outburst profile is composed of four flares. During the maximum of the last
flare we discovered a type-I thermonuclear burst in INTEGRAL JEM-X data. We
derived a distance of 7.6+/-0.7 kpc, adopting Eddington luminosity limited
photospheric radius expansion burst emission and assuming anisotropic emission.
In the timing analysis using all NICER 1-10 keV monitoring data we observed a
rather complex behaviour starting with a spin-up period, followed by a
frequency drop, a episode of constant frequency and concluding with irregular
behaviour till the end of the outburst. The 1-50 keV phase distributions of the
pulsed emission, detected up to $\sim$ 120 keV using INTEGRAL ISGRI data, was
decomposed in three Fourier harmonics showing that the pulsed fraction of the
fundamental increases from ~10% to ~17% going from ~1.5 to ~4 keV, while the
harder photons arrive earlier than the soft photons for energies <10 keV. The
total emission spectrum of IGR J17591-2342 across the 0.3-150 keV band could
adequately be fitted in terms of an absorbed compPS model yielding as best fit
parameters a column density of N_H=(2.09+/-0.05) x 10^{22} /cm2, a blackbody
seed photon temperature kT_bb,seed of 0.64+/- 0.02 keV, electron temperature
kT_e=38.8+/-1.2 keV and Thomson optical depth Tau_T=1.59+/-0.04. The fit
normalisation results in an emission area radius of 11.3+/-0.5 km adopting a
distance of 7.6 kpc. Finally, the results are discussed within the framework of
accretion physics- and X-ray thermonuclear burst theory.

Quantum correlations violating Bell inequalities defy satisfactory causal

nonseparable processes featuring operations in indefinite causal order, defying
that events be causally ordered at all. The first challenge has been addressed
through the recent development of intrinsically quantum causal models, allowing
causal explanations of quantum processes -- provided they admit a definite
causal order, i.e. have an acyclic causal structure. This work addresses
causally nonseparable processes and offers a causal perspective on them through
extending quantum causal models to cyclic causal structures. Among other
applications of the approach, it is shown that all unitarily extendible

in reinforcement learning (RL). In the tabular case, all provably efficient

use optimistic initialisation despite taking inspiration from these provably
efficient tabular algorithms. In particular, in scenarios with only positive
rewards, Q-values are initialised at their lowest possible values due to
commonly used network initialisation schemes, a pessimistic initialisation.
Merely initialising the network to output optimistic Q-values is not enough,
since we cannot ensure that they remain optimistic for novel state-action
pairs, which is crucial for exploration. We propose a simple count-based
augmentation to pessimistically initialised Q-values that separates the source
of optimism from the neural network. We show that this scheme is provably
efficient in the tabular setting and extend it to the deep RL setting. Our
algorithm, Optimistic Pessimistically Initialised Q-Learning (OPIQ), augments
the Q-value estimates of a DQN-based agent with count-derived bonuses to ensure
optimism during both action selection and bootstrapping. We show that OPIQ
outperforms non-optimistic DQN variants that utilise a pseudocount-based
intrinsic motivation in hard exploration tasks, and that it predicts optimistic

all the non-orthogonal multiple access techniques in the future 5G
communication. Compared with some other non-orthogonal multiple access
techniques such as low density signature (LDS), SCMA can achieve better
performance due to the shaping gain of the SCMA codewords. However, despite of
the sparsity of the codewords, the decoding complexity of the current message
passing algorithm (MPA) utilized by SCMA is still prohibitively high. In this
paper, by exploring the lattice structure of SCMA codewords, we propose a low
complexity decoding algorithm based on list sphere decoding (LSD). The LSD
avoids the exhaustive search for all possible hypotheses and only considers
signal within a hypersphere. As LSD can be viewed a depth-first tree search
algorithm, we further propose several methods to prune the redundancy visited
nodes in order to reduce the size of the search tree. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm can reduce the decoding complexity substantially
while the performance loss compared with the existing algorithm is negligible.

of this task is to learn the robust feature against large viewpoint changes.
Existing benchmarks can help, but are limited in the number of viewpoints.
Image pairs, containing two viewpoints, e.g., satellite and ground, are usually
provided, which may compromise the feature learning. Besides phone cameras and
satellites, in this paper, we argue that drones could serve as the third
platform to deal with the geo-localization problem. In contrast to the
traditional ground-view images, drone-view images meet fewer obstacles, e.g.,
trees, and could provide a comprehensive view when flying around the target
place. To verify the effectiveness of the drone platform, we introduce a new
multi-view multi-source benchmark for drone-based geo-localization, named
University-1652. University-1652 contains data from three platforms, i.e.,
synthetic drones, satellites and ground cameras of 1,652 university buildings
around the world. To our knowledge, University-1652 is the first drone-based
geo-localization dataset and enables two new tasks, i.e., drone-view target
localization and drone navigation. As the name implies, drone-view target
localization intends to predict the location of the target place via drone-view
images. On the other hand, given a satellite-view query image, drone navigation
is to drive the drone to the area of interest in the query. We use this dataset
to analyze a variety of off-the-shelf CNN features and propose a strong CNN
baseline on this challenging dataset. The experiments show that University-1652
helps the model to learn the viewpoint-invariant features and also has good
generalization ability in the real-world scenario.

If the axion mass at the potential is a typical value of the curvature along
the direction, the potential can be well approximated by a quadratic mass term.
On the other hand, if the axion mass happens to be suppressed in the vicinity
of the minimum, the potential may be approximated by a quartic potential plus a
suppressed quadratic one, for which the initial angle, and thus the axion
abundance, can be significantly suppressed compared to the quadratic case. We
delineate the viable parameter region by taking account of various
observational constraints, and find that a broader range of the inflation scale
is allowed. Also, if the curvature of the potential is suppressed over a
certain range of the potential, the onset of coherent oscillations can be
delayed. Then, the axion dark matter with a small decay constant is possible.

emotion carriers are the speech or text segments that best explain the
emotional state of the user. Such segments may include entities, verb or noun
phrases. Advanced automatic understanding of PNs requires not only the
prediction of the user emotional state but also to identify which events (e.g.
""the loss of relative"" or ""the visit of grandpa"") or people ( e.g. ""the old

recollection. This work proposes and evaluates an annotation model for
identifying emotion carriers in spoken personal narratives. Compared to other
text genres such as news and microblogs, spoken PNs are particularly
challenging because a narrative is usually unstructured, involving multiple
sub-events and characters as well as thoughts and associated emotions perceived

By considering the aforementioned properties, it has been possible to determine
that some of the molecular bridging structures may be regarded as being

the atomic/molecular contaminants. We specifically identify the conductance
properties of a variety of configurations including examples with very high and

Model owners may be concerned that valuable intellectual property can be leaked
if adversaries mount model extraction attacks. As it is difficult to defend
against model extraction without sacrificing significant prediction accuracy,
watermarking instead leverages unused model capacity to have the model overfit
to outlier input-output pairs. Such pairs are watermarks, which are not sampled
from the task distribution and are only known to the defender. The defender
then demonstrates knowledge of the input-output pairs to claim ownership of the
model at inference. The effectiveness of watermarks remains limited because
they are distinct from the task distribution and can thus be easily removed

  We introduce Entangled Watermarking Embeddings (EWE). Our approach encourages
the model to learn features for classifying data that is sampled from the task

remove watermarks that are entangled with legitimate data is also forced to
sacrifice performance on legitimate data. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,

the perspective of dynamic logic, because the nature of two fundamental

sense of logic. After we formulate dynamic logic of QFT, we give a dynamic
logical interpretation of fermions, the so-called vacuum state, the zero vector

in the primeval signal. However, the detection of this signal is challenging
from the data analysis point of view, due to the relative low amplitude
compared to the foregrounds, the lensing contamination coming from the leakage
of $E$-modes, and the instrumental noise. Here, we studied the viability of the
detection of the primordial polarization $B$-mode with a ground-based telescope
operating in the microwave low-frequency regime (i.e., from 10GHz-120GHz) in a
handful of different scenarios: i. the instrument's channels distribution and
noise, ii. the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) detectability considering different
possible $r$ values and degrees of delensing, iii. the effect of including a
possible source of polarized anomalous microwave emission (AME), iv. the
strengths and weaknesses of different observational strategies and, v. the
atmospheric and systematic noise impact on the recovery. We focused mainly on
the removal of galactic foregrounds as well as noise contamination by applying
a full-parametric pixel-based maximum likelihood component separation
technique. Moreover, we developed a numerical methodology to estimate the
residuals power spectrum left after component separation, which allow us to
mitigate possible biases introduced in the primordial $B$-mode power spectrum
reconstruction. Among many other results, we found that this sort of experiment
is capable of detecting Starobinsky's $r$ even when no delensing is performed

of imitation is affected in the large majority of cases. Existing studies from
the literature suggest that robots can be used to teach children with autism
basic interaction skills like imitation. Based on these findings, in this
study, we investigate if children with autism show more social engagement when
interacting with an imitative robot (Fig 1) compared to a human partner in a

  arXiv:1906.05329",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many AI problems, in robotics and other domains, are goal-based, essentially
seeking trajectories leading to various goal states. Reinforcement learning
(RL), building on Bellman's optimality equation, naturally optimizes for a
single goal, yet can be made multi-goal by augmenting the state with the goal.
Instead, we propose a new RL framework, derived from a dynamic programming
equation for the all pairs shortest path (APSP) problem, which naturally solves
multi-goal queries. We show that this approach has computational benefits for
both standard and approximate dynamic programming. Interestingly, our
formulation prescribes a novel protocol for computing a trajectory: instead of
predicting the next state given its predecessor, as in standard RL, a
goal-conditioned trajectory is constructed by first predicting an intermediate
state between start and goal, partitioning the trajectory into two. Then,
recursively, predicting intermediate points on each sub-segment, until a
complete trajectory is obtained. We call this trajectory structure a sub-goal
tree. Building on it, we additionally extend the policy gradient methodology to
recursively predict sub-goals, resulting in novel goal-based algorithms.
Finally, we apply our method to neural motion planning, where we demonstrate
significant improvements compared to standard RL on navigating a 7-DoF robot
arm between obstacles.

from heterotic string theory. In 4-dimensions effective theory the bosonic
fields are: a $U(1)$ gauge boson, a Kalb-Ramond 3-form which is equivalent to a
pseudoscalar axion in 4-dimensions, the dilaton and the graviton. The coupling
constants in the theory are $\alpha^{\prime}$ (inverse string tension) and
$\kappa$ (inverse reduced Planck mass in 4-dimensions) and the charge of the
$U(1)$ field and the axion-photon coupling are related to these two. Sen found
a black hole solution (the Kerr-Sen black hole) with these fields as the
external hair of the black hole. In this paper we investigate the possibility
of determining the Sen solution from observations. The observations which can
test the Kerr-Sen black hole are: (a) determination of the shape of the photon
shadow, and (b) the rotation of polarization of photon due to axion hair. The
deviation from circularity gives the $U(1)$ charge of the black hole and
identification of this charge in terms of the photon coupling leads to a
prediction of frequency independent ""Faraday rotation"" in terms of black hole
parameters already determined from the shadow. Similar measurements of
Kerr-Newman black hole with axion hair have no correlation between the shape of
the image and the amount of ""Faraday rotation"". This correlation can be a
distinctive test of the Sen metric. In the recent observation from EHT of M87*
shadow, the deviation from circularity has an upper bound of 10%. If this
observation is refined to 1% accuracy then a definitive prediction of the
charge of the Kerr-Sen black hole and the ""Faraday rotation"" can be made.
Interestingly observations of ""Faraday rotation"" have shown that the effect is
independent of frequency pointing to an axionic hair interpretation for the
effect.

developing an automated solution for fraud detection based on graph learning
algorithms, to separate fraudsters from regular customers and uncover groups of
organized fraudsters. This solution applied at Alibaba achieves more than 80%
precision while covering 44% more suspicious accounts compared with a
previously deployed rule-based classifier after human expert investigations.

passive tracer is considered in a Rankine vortex. The action of a shear flow,
in general, is to achieve stretching of fluid elements. A vortex flow exhibits
stretching and folding of fluid elements in a way which brings adjacent fluid
elements closer every turn. A strong stretching along the direction of rotation
is accompanied by a concomitant thinning in the radial direction leading to a
strong diffusive flux which may cause material from neighbouring regions of the
mixing interface to aggregate. Through a Lagrangian concentration evolution
technique, the diffusive strip method, we obtain the concentration field and
pinpoint the signature of coalescence of two neighbouring concentration regions
by analyzing the concentration distribution profiles. We link coalescence with
reactivity for mixing-limited reactive flows. The analysis is useful to
understand scalar dispersion in vortical flow structures.

dilated convolutional units have been the network of choice for deep learning
approaches to speech enhancement. While residual links improve gradient flow
during training, feature diminution of shallow layer outputs can occur due to
repetitive summations with deeper layer outputs. One strategy to improve
feature re-usage is to fuse both ResNets and densely connected CNNs
(DenseNets). DenseNets, however, over-allocate parameters for feature re-usage.
Motivated by this, we propose the residual-dense lattice network (RDL-Net),
which is a new CNN for speech enhancement that employs both residual and dense
aggregations without over-allocating parameters for feature re-usage. This is
managed through the topology of the RDL blocks, which limit the number of
outputs used for dense aggregations. Our extensive experimental investigation
shows that RDL-Nets are able to achieve a higher speech enhancement performance
than CNNs that employ residual and/or dense aggregations. RDL-Nets also use
substantially fewer parameters and have a lower computational requirement.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that RDL-Nets outperform many state-of-the-art deep

For
low-rank matrix factorization, prior work has shown that there exist infinitely
many critical points all of which are either global minima or strict saddles.
At a strict saddle the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian is negative. Of
interest is whether this minimum eigenvalue is uniformly bounded below zero
over all strict saddles. To answer this we consider orbits of critical points
under the general linear group. For each orbit we identify a representative
point, called a canonical point. If a canonical point is a strict saddle, so is
every point on its orbit. We derive an expression for the minimum eigenvalue of
the Hessian at each canonical strict saddle and use this to show that the
minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian over the set of strict saddles is not
uniformly bounded below zero. We also show that a known invariance property of
gradient flow ensures the solution of gradient flow only encounters critical
points on an invariant manifold $\mathcal{M}_C$ determined by the initial
condition. We show that, in contrast to the general situation, the minimum
eigenvalue of strict saddles in $\mathcal{M}_{0}$ is uniformly bounded below
zero. We obtain an expression for this bound in terms of the singular values of
the matrix being factorized. This bound depends on the size of the nonzero
singular values and on the separation between distinct nonzero singular values
of the matrix.

Difference problem (ED): given descriptions of two circuits, determine which
circuit produces more entropy in its output when acting on a uniformly random
input. The analogous problem with quantum circuits (QED) is to determine which
circuit produces the state with greater von Neumann entropy, when acting on a
fixed input state and after tracing out part of the output. Based on plausible
complexity-theoretic assumptions, both of these problems are believed to be
intractable for polynomial-time quantum computation. In this paper, we
investigate the hardness of these problems in the case where the input circuits
have logarithmic and constant depth, respectively. We show that, relative to an
oracle, these problems cannot be as hard as their counterparts with
polynomial-size circuits. Furthermore, we show that if a certain type of
reduction from QED to the log-depth version exists, it implies that any
polynomial-time quantum computation can be performed in log depth. While this
suggests that having shallow circuits makes entropy estimation easier, we give
indication that the problem remains intractable for polynomial-time quantum
computation by proving a reduction from Learning-With-Errors (LWE) to
constant-depth ED. We then consider a potential application of our results to
quantum gravity research. First, we introduce a Hamiltonian version of QED
where one is given two local Hamiltonians and asked to estimate the
entanglement entropy difference in their ground states. We show that this
problem is at least as hard as the circuit version and then discuss a potential
experiment that would make use of the AdS/CFT correspondence to solve LWE
efficiently. We conjecture that unless the AdS/CFT bulk to boundary map is
exponentially complex, this experiment would violate the intractability

possess both a rich strategy space of best-responses and a clear evaluation
metric. What's more, competition is a vital mechanism in many real-world
multi-agent systems capable of generating intelligent innovations: Darwinian
evolution, the market economy and the AlphaZero algorithm, to name a few. In
two-player zero-sum games, the challenge is usually viewed as finding Nash
equilibrium strategies, safeguarding against exploitation regardless of the
opponent. While this captures the intricacies of chess or Go, it avoids the
notion of cooperation with co-players, a hallmark of the major transitions
leading from unicellular organisms to human civilization. Beyond two players,
alliance formation often confers an advantage; however this requires trust,
namely the promise of mutual cooperation in the face of incentives to defect.
Successful play therefore requires adaptation to co-players rather than the
pursuit of non-exploitability. Here we argue that a systematic study of
many-player zero-sum games is a crucial element of artificial intelligence
research. Using symmetric zero-sum matrix games, we demonstrate formally that
alliance formation may be seen as a social dilemma, and empirically that
na\""ive multi-agent reinforcement learning therefore fails to form alliances.
We introduce a toy model of economic competition, and show how reinforcement
learning may be augmented with a peer-to-peer contract mechanism to discover

temporally-extended contracts, presenting opportunities for further work.

with the supercontinuum-based system. The analytical performance of the
supercontinuum-based FTIR spectrometer was tested for a concentration series of
aqueous formaldehyde solutions in a liquid flow cell (500 $\mu$m path length)
and compared with the conventional FTIR (130 $\mu$m path length). The results
show a four-times-enhanced detection limit due to the extended path length
enabled by the high brightness of the laser. In conclusion, FTIR spectrometers
equipped with novel broadband MIR supercontinuum lasers could outperform
traditional systems providing superior performance, e.g., interaction path
lengths formerly unattainable, while maintaining low noise levels known from
highly stable thermal emitters.

the microscale is typically simulated with differential equations parameterized
by a Hamiltonian, or energy function. The Hamiltonian describes the state of
the system and its interactions with the environment. In order to derive
predictive microscopic models, one wishes to infer a molecular Hamiltonian that
agrees with observed macroscopic quantities. From the perspective of
engineering, one wishes to control the Hamiltonian to achieve desired
simulation outcomes and structures, as in self-assembly and optical control, to
then realize systems with the desired Hamiltonian in the lab. In both cases,
the goal is to modify the Hamiltonian such that emergent properties of the
simulated system match a given target. We demonstrate how this can be achieved
using differentiable simulations where bulk target observables and simulation
outcomes can be analytically differentiated with respect to Hamiltonians,
opening up new routes for parameterizing Hamiltonians to infer macroscopic
models and develop control protocols.

model is: We deduce details of the diffusion process in a medium in which
direct experimental study is difficult, based on probing diffusion in external

subdiffusion of particles in the biofilm may occur. To describe this process we
use a fractional subdiffusion-absorption equation with an adjustable anomalous
diffusion exponent. The boundary conditions at the boundaries of the biofilm
are derived by means of a particle random walk model on a discrete lattice
leading to an expression involving a fractional time derivative. We show that
the temporal evolution of the total amount of substance that has diffused
through the biofilm explicitly depends on whether there is antibiotic
absorption in the biofilm. This fact is used to experimentally check for
antibiotic absorption in the biofilm and if the biofilm parameters change over

the mentioned above physical characteristics. The biological interpretation of
the stages, in particular their relation with the bacterial defence mechanisms,
is discussed. Theoretical results are compared with empirical results of

Then, we prove that the HMI is bounded from above by the corresponding

derive hierarchical generalizations of many other classical

its classical counterpart, the hierarchical generalization of the Variation of

communication-through-coherence hypothesis, according to which communication
between two brain regions is effective only if they are phase-locked. Also of
importance is neuronal variability, a phenomenon in which a single neuron's
inter-firing times may be highly variable. In this work, we aim to connect
these two ideas by studying the effects of that variability on the capability
of neurons to reach phase synchronization. We simulate a network of
modified-Hodgkin-Huxley-bursting neurons possessing a small-world topology.
First, variability is shown to be correlated with the average degree of phase
synchronization of the network. Next, restricting to spatial variability -
which measures the deviation of firing times between all neurons in the network
- we show that it is positively correlated to a behavior we call promiscuity,
which is the tendency of neurons to to have their relative phases change with
time. This relation is observed in all cases we tested, regardless of the
degree of synchronization or the strength of the inter-neuronal coupling: high
variability implies high promiscuity (low duration of phase-locking), even if
the network as a whole is synchronized and the coupling is strong. We argue
that spatial variability actually generates promiscuity. Therefore, we conclude
that variability has a strong influence on both the degree and the manner in
which neurons phase synchronize, which is another reason for its relevance in
neural communication.

universal behavior: formation of domains of dissociation in the driving force
amplitude-frequency space, characterized by the presence of local boundary
minima. We demonstrate, that by simply following the progression of the
resonance maxima in this space, while gradually increasing intensity of the
radiation one must necessarily arrive at one of these minima, i.e. a point
where the ultra-high spectral selectivity is retained. We show that this
universal property, applicable to other oscillatory system, is a consequence of
the fact that these models belong to the fold catastrophe universality class of

bulk stress and surface stress in Sn coating evolved with time, wherein both
were compressive immediately after the deposition, and thereafter while the
bulk stress monotonically became more compressive and subsequently saturated
with aging at room temperature, the stress near the surface of the Sn coating
continually became more tensile with aging. These opposing evolutionary
behaviors of bulk and surface stresses readily established a negative

have vanishing {\sigma}4-curvature in the interior and constant H4- curvature
on the boundary. We prove that there are geometrically distinct solutions using
bifurcation results proven by Case, Moreira and Wang. Surprisingly, our
construction via products of a sphere and hyperbolic space only works for a
finite set of dimensions.
