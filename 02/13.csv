trees can be used to represent provably-correct controllers concisely. Compared
to representations using lookup tables or binary decision diagrams, decision
trees are smaller and more explainable. We present dtControl, an easily
extensible tool for representing memoryless controllers as decision trees. We
give a comprehensive evaluation of various decision tree learning algorithms
applied to 10 case studies arising out of correct-by-construction controller
synthesis. These algorithms include two new techniques, one for using arbitrary
linear binary classifiers in the decision tree learning, and one novel approach
for determinizing controllers during the decision tree construction. In
particular the latter turns out to be extremely efficient, yielding decision
trees with a single-digit number of decision nodes on 5 of the case studies.

small $(11 \%)$ dependence on the temperature. However the values of the Rabi
splitting strongly vary among the four models: the ""coupled oscillator"" model
over-estimates the coupling; the analytical ""Elliott-Tanguy"" model precisely
describes the dielectric susceptibility of GaN near the excitonic transition,
leading to a Rabi splitting equal to $82 \pm 10 \ meV$ for TE0 modes; the
experimental ellipsometry-based model leads to smaller values of $55 \pm 6 \
meV.$ We evidence that for waveguides including active layers with large
oscillator strengths, as required for room-temperature polaritonic devices, a
strong bending of the modes dispersion is not necessarily the signature of the
strong-coupling, which requires for its reliable assessment a precise analysis

deep-learning based approach to efficiently generate RGB-D images with
completed information in high resolution. To process the input images in low
resolution with missing regions, new operators for adaptive convolution are
introduced in our deep-learning network that consists of three cascaded modules
-- the completion module, the refinement module and the super-resolution
module. The completion module is based on an architecture of encoder-decoder,
where the features of input raw RGB-D will be automatically extracted by the
encoding layers of a deep neural-network. The decoding layers are applied to
reconstruct the completed depth map, which is followed by a refinement module
to sharpen the boundary of different regions. For the super-resolution module,
we generate RGB-D images in high resolution by multiple layers for feature
extraction and a layer for up-sampling. Benefited from the adaptive convolution
operators newly proposed in this paper, our results outperform the existing
deep-learning based approaches for RGB-D image complete and super-resolution.
As an end-to-end approach, high fidelity RGB-D images can be generated
efficiently at the rate of around 21 frames per second.

are yet to be fully elucidated. We provide timely short-term forecasts of the
cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter

province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the

consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified
uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth
model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here
based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models
presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei
and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.
Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 -
38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.
Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have
remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th -

China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has
slowed in recent days.

there might not exist a single path which can enable transfer of high value

paths is a better approach. While there exists several approaches which route
transactions via several paths, such techniques are quite inefficient, as the
decision on the number of splits must be taken at the initial phase of the
routing algorithm (e.g., SpeedyMurmur [42]). Algorithms which do not consider
the residual capacity of each channel in the network are susceptible to
failure. Other approaches leak sensitive information, and are quite
computationally expensive [28]. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed

into account the funds left in each channel, while splitting the transaction

existing routing schemes on real instances (e.g., Ripple Network), we observed
that HushRelay attains a success ratio of 1, with an execution time of 2.4 sec.
However, SpeedyMurmur [42] attains a success ratio of 0.98 and takes 4.74 sec

result in signatures observable with electromagnetic and gravitational waves.
We simulate grids of bare helium stars to characterize the resulting black hole
(BH) masses and ejecta composition, velocity, and thermal state. The stars do
not react ""elastically"" to the thermonuclear explosion: there is not a
one-to-one correspondence between pair-instability driven ignition and mass
ejections, causing ambiguity in what is an observable pulse. In agreement with
previous studies, we find that for carbon-oxygen core masses 28Msun<
M_CO<30.5Msun the explosions are not strong enough to affect the surface. With
increasing mass, they first cause large radial expansion
(30.5Msun<M_CO<31.4Msun), and finally, also mass ejection episodes
(M_CO>31.4Msun). The lowest mass to be fully disrupted in a pair-instability
supernova is M_CO=57Msun. Models with M_CO>121Msun reach the
photodisintegration regime, resulting in BHs with M_BH>125Msun. If the
pulsating models produce BHs via (weak) explosions, the previously-ejected
material might be hit by the blast wave. We characterize the H-free
circumstellar material from the pulsational pair-instability of helium cores
assuming simply that the ejecta maintain a constant velocity after ejection.
Our models produce He-rich ejecta with mass 10^{-3}Msun<M_CSM<40Msun. These
ejecta are typically launched at a few thousand \kms and reach distances of
~10^{12}-10^{15} cm before core-collapse. The delays between mass ejection
events and the final collapse span a wide and mass-dependent range (from
sub-hour to 10^4 years), and the shells ejected can also collide with each
other. The range of properties we find suggests a possible connection with
(some) type Ibn supernovae.

to a microparticle-suspended nematic liquid crystal cell, if reaching a
critical value, combined with its direction, surface anchoring feature and
molecular dielectric anisotropy, is possible to create an anisotropic ""bubble""
around the microparticle with a vertical fast ""lane"", in which the
microparticle can, driven by the asymmetric buoyant force, vertically move
swiftly from the cell's midplane to a new equilibrium position, triggering a
positional transition discovered by the author previously. Such a new
equilibrium position is decided via a competition between the buoyant force and
the effective force built upon the microparticle by the elastic energy gradient
along the ""lane"". The threshold value of external field, depends on thickness
$L$ and Frank elastic constant $K$ and slightly on the microparticle size and
density, in a Fr\'{e}edericksz-like manner, but by a factor. For a nematic
liquid crystal cell with planar surface alignment, a bistable equilibrium
structure for the transition is found when the direction of the applied
electric field is (a) perpendicular to the two plates of the cell with positive
molecular dielectric anisotropy, or (b) parallel to the two plates and the
anchoring direction of the cell with negative molecular dielectric anisotropy.
Except for the formation of a vertical fast ""lane"", when the electric field
applied is parallel to both the two plates and perpendicular to the anchoring
direction, the microparticle suspended in the nematic liquid crystal tends to
be trapped in the midplane, regardless of the sign of the molecular dielectric
anisotropy. Such phenomenon also occurs for negative molecular dielectric
anisotropy while the external is applied perpendicular to the two plates.

pure states together with the action of the reversible dynamics, whilst the

probabilities. For transitive dynamical structures whose dynamical group and

This is a generalisation of quantum theory where the pure states, instead of
being represented by one-dimensional subspaces of a complex vector space, are
represented by subspaces of a fixed dimension larger than one. We also show
that systems with compact two-point homogeneous dynamical structures (i.e.
every pair of pure states with a given distance can be reversibly transformed
to any other pair of pure states with the same distance), which include systems
corresponding to Euclidean Jordan Algebras, all have rigid probabilistic

creating a ""dark Bloch band"" by coupling a set of source bands through resonant
processes. Considering a $\Lambda$ system of three bands, the Chern number of
the dark band is found to follow a simple sum rule in terms of the Chern
numbers of the source bands: $C_D\!=\!C_1+C_2-C_3$. Altogether, our dark-state
scheme realizes a nearly flat Bloch band with predictable and tunable Chern
number $C_D$. We illustrate our method based on a $\Lambda$ system, formed of
the bands of the Harper-Hofstadter model, which leads to a nearly flat Chern
band with $C_D\!=\!2$. We explore a realistic sequence to load atoms into the

individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden

the perceived security-encryption trade-off in PEP design. Compared to
unencrypted PEP implementations, QPEP reduces average page load times by more

VPN encryption available to customers today, QPEP more than halves average page

that no vorticity can be created by the boundary of such possibly singular

essentially sharp in this sense by constructing domains that come arbitrarily

(EC) of an underwater acoustic (UWA) channel. Specifically, the UWA channel is
under impersonation attack by a malicious node (Eve) present in the close
vicinity of the legitimate node pair (Alice and Bob); Eve tries to inject its
malicious data into the system by making Bob believe that she is indeed Alice.
To thwart the impersonation attack by Eve, Bob utilizes the distance of the
transmit node as the feature/fingerprint to carry out feature-based
authentication at the physical layer. Due to authentication at Bob, due to lack
of channel knowledge at the transmit node (Alice or Eve), and due to the
threshold-based decoding error model, the relevant dynamics of the considered
system could be modelled by a Markov chain (MC). Thus, we compute the
state-transition probabilities of the MC, and the moment generating function
for the service process corresponding to each state. This enables us to derive
a closed-form expression of the EC in terms of authentication parameters.
Furthermore, we compute the optimal transmission rate (at Alice) through
gradient-descent (GD) technique and artificial neural network (ANN) method.
Simulation results show that the EC decreases under severe authentication
constraints (i.e., more false alarms and more transmissions by Eve). Simulation
results also reveal that the (optimal transmission rate) performance of the ANN
technique is quite close to that of the GD method.

have introduced novel tasks that are paving the way for solving AI-complete
problems. One of those tasks is called Visual Question Answering (VQA). A VQA
system must take an image and a free-form, open-ended natural language question
about the image, and produce a natural language answer as the output. Such a
task has drawn great attention from the scientific community, which generated a
plethora of approaches that aim to improve the VQA predictive accuracy. Most of
them comprise three major components: (i) independent representation learning
of images and questions; (ii) feature fusion so the model can use information
from both sources to answer visual questions; and (iii) the generation of the
correct answer in natural language. With so many approaches being recently
introduced, it became unclear the real contribution of each component for the
ultimate performance of the model. The main goal of this paper is to provide a
comprehensive analysis regarding the impact of each component in VQA models.
Our extensive set of experiments cover both visual and textual elements, as
well as the combination of these representations in form of fusion and
attention mechanisms. Our major contribution is to identify core components for
training VQA models so as to maximize their predictive performance.

the advantages of the proposed method. A control strategy is provided with the

to understand how successful cooperation-sustaining mechanisms operate. Cyclic
dominance, a non-transitive setup comprising at least three strategies wherein
the first strategy overrules the second which overrules the third which, in
turn, overrules the first strategy, is known to maintain bio-diversity, drive
competition between bacterial strains, and preserve cooperation in social
dilemmas. Here, we present a novel route to cyclic dominance in voluntary
social dilemmas by adding to the traditional mix of cooperators, defectors, and
loners, a fourth player type, risk-averse hedgers, who enact tit-for-tat upon
paying a hedging cost to avoid being exploited. When this cost is sufficiently
small, cooperators, defectors, and hedgers enter a loop of cyclic dominance
that preserves cooperation even under the most adverse conditions. In contrast,
when the hedging cost is large, hedgers disappear, consequently reverting to
the traditional interplay of cooperators, defectors, and loners. In the interim
region of hedging costs, complex evolutionary dynamics ensues, prompting
transitions between states with two, three, or four competing strategies. Our
results thus reveal that voluntary participation is but one pathway to
sustained cooperation via cyclic dominance.

the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=7, 8$ and 13TeV,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$. The mass and natural
width of the new state are measured to be \begin{eqnarray*} m & = & 6072.3 \pm
2.9 \pm 0.6 \pm 0.2 MeV\,, \Gamma & = & 72 \pm 11 \pm 2 MeV\,, \end{eqnarray*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The third
uncertainty for the mass is due to imprecise knowledge of the $\Lambda_b^0$
baryon mass. The new state is consistent with the first radial excitation of
the $\Lambda_b^0$ baryon, the $\Lambda_b(2S)^0$ resonance. Updated measurements
of the masses and the upper limits on the natural widths of the previously

manipulation scheme for fooling video classifiers by introducing a flickering
temporal perturbation that in some cases may be unnoticeable by human observers

action classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make
universal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition,
we generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant
perturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the
perturbation to the input. The attack was implemented on several target models

and deletions while facilitating queries such as connectivity, path weights,
and subtree weights. Dynamic trees are a fundamental building block of a large
number of graph algorithms. Although traditionally studied in the single-update
setting, dynamic algorithms capable of supporting batches of updates are
increasingly relevant today due to the emergence of rapidly evolving dynamic
datasets. Since processing updates on a single processor is often unrealistic
for large batches of updates, designing parallel batch-dynamic algorithms that
achieve provably low span is important for many applications. In this work, we
design the first work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic algorithm for dynamic
trees that is capable of supporting both path queries and subtree queries, as
well as a variety of non-local queries. To achieve this, we propose a framework
for algorithmically dynamizing static round-synchronous algorithms that allows
us to obtain parallel batch-dynamic algorithms with good bounds on their work
and span. In our framework, the algorithm designer can apply the technique to
any suitably defined static algorithm. We then obtain theoretical guarantees
for algorithms in our framework by defining the notion of a computation
distance between two executions of the underlying algorithm.
  Our dynamic trees algorithm is obtained by applying our dynamization
framework to the parallel tree contraction algorithm of Miller and Reif, and
then performing a novel analysis of the computation distance of this algorithm
under batch updates. We show that $k$ updates can be performed in $O(k

nonlinear behaviors. Below a yield stress they behave as plastic solids, while
they start to yield above a critical stress $\Sigma_c$. A key quantity
controlling plasticity which is, however, hard to measure is the density $P(x)$
of weak spots, where $x$ is the additional stress required for local plastic
failure. In the thermodynamic limit $P(x)\sim x^\theta$ is singular at $x= 0$
in the solid phase below the yield stress $\Sigma_c$. This singularity is
related to the presence of system spannig avalanches of plastic events. Here we
address the question if the density of weak spots and the flow properties of a
material can be determined from the geometry of an amporphous structure alone.
We show that a vertex model for cell packings in tissues exhibits the
phenomenology of plastic amorphous systems. As the yield stress is approached
from above, the strain rate vanishes and the avalanches size $S$ and their
duration $\tau$ diverge. We then show that in general, in materials where the
energy functional depend on topology, the value $x$ is proportional to the
length $L$ of a bond that vanishes in a plastic event. For this class of models
$P(x)$ is therefore readily measurable from geometry alone. Applying this
approach to a quantification of the cell packing geometry in the developing
wing epithelium of the fruit fly, we find that in this tissue $P(L)$ exhibits a
power law with exponents similar to those found numerically for a vertex model
in its solid phase. This suggests that this tissue exhibits plasticity and
non-linear material properties that emerge from collective cell behaviors and
that these material properties govern developmental processes. Our approach
based on the relation between topology and energetics suggests a new route to
outstanding questions associated with the yielding transition.

magnitude and sign of the nuclear magnetic moment differ from each other. The
large energy gap between the electronic ground and first-excited Kramers

Hamiltonian onto an effective Hamiltonian with an electronic pseudo-spin
$S_{\rm eff}=1/2$ that corresponds to the ground Kramers doublet. Our ab-initio

the use of the $\alpha$-transformation. Our model is further extended to the
$\alpha$--kernel regression by adopting the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Unlike
many of the recommended regression models for compositional data, zeros values
(which commonly occur in practice) are not problematic and they can be
incorporated into the proposed models without modification. Extensive
simulation studies and real-life data analyses highlight the advantage of using
these non-parametric regressions for complex relationships between the
compositional response data and Euclidean predictor variables. Both suggest
that $\alpha$--$k$--$NN$ and $\alpha$--kernel regressions can lead to more
accurate predictions compared to current regression models which assume a,
sometimes restrictive, parametric relationship with the predictor variables. In
addition, the $\alpha$--$k$--$NN$ regression, in contrast to current regression
techniques, enjoys a high computational efficiency rendering it highly
attractive for use with large scale, massive, or big data.

episodic perspective; the concept of non-episodic RL, where there is no restart
and therefore no reliable recovery, remains elusive. A fundamental question in
non-episodic RL is how to measure the performance of a learner and derive
algorithms to maximize such performance. Conventional wisdom is to maximize the
difference between the average reward received by the learner and the maximal
long-term average reward. In this paper, we argue that if the total time budget
is relatively limited compared to the complexity of the environment, such
comparison may fail to reflect the finite-time optimality of the learner. We
propose a family of measures, called $\gamma$-regret, which we believe to
better capture the finite-time optimality. We give motivations and derive lower
and upper bounds for such measures. Note: A follow-up work (arXiv:2010.00587)
has improved both our lower and upper bound, the gap is now closed at
$\tilde{\Theta}\left(\frac{\sqrt{SAT}}{(1 - \gamma)^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)$.

$\alpha n$ (for some $\alpha \ll 1/2$) of which are drawn i.i.d. from a
distribution $\mathcal{D}$ with a isotropic rank $r$ covariance $\Pi_*$ (the
\emph{inliers}) and the rest are arbitrary, potential adversarial outliers. The
goal is to recover a $O(1/\alpha)$ size list of candidate covariances that
contains a $\hat{\Pi}$ close to $\Pi_*$. Two recent independent works
(Raghavendra-Yau, Bakshi-Kothari 2020) gave the first efficient algorithm for
this problem. These results, however, obtain an error that grows with the
dimension (linearly in [RY] and logarithmically in BK) at the cost of
quasi-polynomial running time) and rely on \emph{certifiable
anti-concentration} - a relatively strict condition satisfied essentially only
by the Gaussian distribution.
  In this work, we improve on these results on all three fronts:
\emph{dimension-independent} error via a faster fixed-polynomial running time
under less restrictive distributional assumptions. Specifically, we give a
$poly(1/\alpha) d^{O(1)}$ time algorithm that outputs a list containing a
$\hat{\Pi}$ satisfying $\|\hat{\Pi} -\Pi_*\|_F \leq O(1/\alpha)$. Our result
only needs $\mathcal{D}$ to have \emph{certifiably hypercontractive} degree 2
polynomials. As a result, in addition to Gaussians, our algorithm applies to
the uniform distribution on the hypercube and $q$-ary cubes and arbitrary
product distributions with subgaussian marginals. Prior work (Raghavendra and
Yau, 2020) had identified such distributions as potential hard examples as such
distributions do not exhibit strong enough anti-concentration. When
$\mathcal{D}$ satisfies certifiable anti-concentration, we obtain a stronger
error guarantee of $\|\hat{\Pi}-\Pi_*\|_F \leq \eta$ for any arbitrary $\eta >
0$ in $d^{O(poly(1/\alpha) + \log (1/\eta))}$ time.

the pathway of a reaction via its intermediate complex, which is generally too
short-lived to be affected by external processes. In particular, the ultracold

intermediate complex (K$_2$Rb$_2^*$), which allows us to steer the reaction

excited-state pathway using a laser source at 1064 nm, a wavelength commonly
used to confine ultracold molecules. Furthermore, by monitoring the change in
the complex population after the sudden removal of the excitation light, we
directly measure the lifetime of the complex to be $360 \pm 30$ ns, in
agreement with our calculations based on the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus

online by an unknown, partially observed linear system, which is driven by
stochastic noise. For such systems the optimal predictor in the mean square
sense is the celebrated Kalman filter, which can be explicitly computed when
the system model is known. When the system model is unknown, we have to learn
how to predict observations online based on finite data, suffering possibly a
non-zero regret with respect to the Kalman filter's prediction. We show that it
is possible to achieve a regret of the order of $\mathrm{poly}\log(N)$ with
high probability, where $N$ is the number of observations collected. Our work
is the first to provide logarithmic regret guarantees for the widely used
Kalman filter. This is achieved using an online least-squares algorithm, which
exploits the approximately linear relation between future observations and past
observations. The regret analysis is based on the stability properties of the
Kalman filter, recent statistical tools for finite sample analysis of system
identification, and classical results for the analysis of least-squares
algorithms for time series. Our regret analysis can also be applied for state
prediction of the hidden state, in the case of unknown noise statistics but
known state-space basis. A fundamental technical contribution is that our
bounds hold even for the class of non-explosive systems, which includes the
class of marginally stable systems, which was an open problem for the case of
online prediction under stochastic noise.

Taking this perspective, the light-pulse beam splitting is interpreted as a
space- and time-dependent external potential. In a shift from the usual
approach based on a system of momentum-space ordinary differential equations,
our position-space treatment is flexible and scales favourably for realistic

than being mere plane waves. Moreover, the numerical package we developed is
effortlessly extended to the problem class of trapped and interacting

model by revisiting several case studies relevant to the precision atom
interferometry community. We retrieve analytical solutions when they exist and

especially in domains where human lives are at stake such as medicine or
autonomous vehicles. While it is often possible to approximate the input-output
relations of deep neural networks with a few human-understandable rules, the
discovery of the double descent phenomena suggests that such approximations do
not accurately capture the mechanism by which deep neural networks work. Double
descent indicates that deep neural networks typically operate by smoothly
interpolating between data points rather than by extracting a few high level
rules. As a result, neural networks trained on complex real world data are
inherently hard to interpret and prone to failure if asked to extrapolate. To
show how we might be able to trust AI despite these problems we introduce the
concept of self-explaining AI. Self-explaining AIs are capable of providing a
human-understandable explanation of each decision along with confidence levels
for both the decision and explanation. For this approach to work, it is
important that the explanation actually be related to the decision, ideally

discard actions with relatively low uncertainty and then choosing one among the
remaining actions greedily. In addition to proving that SG is theoretically
rate optimal, our empirical simulations show that SG outperforms existing
benchmarks such as greedy, OFUL, and TS. The second application of our general
framework is (to the best of our knowledge) the first polylogarithmic (in $T$)
regret bounds for OFUL and TS, under similar conditions as the ones by
Goldenshluger and Zeevi (2013). Finally, we obtain sharper regret bounds for

quantification in deep models. Especially, when combined with variational
auto-encoders (VAEs), LBD enables flexible semi-implicit posterior
representations, leading to new semi-implicit VAE~(SIVAE) models. We solve the
optimization for training with respect to the dropout parameters using
Augment-REINFORCE-Merge (ARM), an unbiased and low-variance gradient estimator.
Our experiments on a range of tasks show the superior performance of our
approach compared with other commonly used dropout schemes. Overall, LBD leads
to improved accuracy and uncertainty estimates in image classification and
semantic segmentation. Moreover, using SIVAE, we can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on collaborative filtering for implicit feedback on several public
datasets.

physical interaction between electromagnetic waves and material properties.
This framework is not dedicated to a particular environment, material,

indoor environment parameters on mmWave propagation properties, especially
coverage and path loss. Its implementation raises numerous computational
challenges that we solve by formulating an adapted link budget and designing
new memory optimization algorithms. The first simulation results for two major
5G applications are validated with measurement data and show the efficiency of
iGeoStat to simulate multiple diffusion in realistic environments, within a
reasonable amount of time and memory resources. Generated output maps confirm
that diffusion has a critical impact on indoor mmWave propagation and that
proper physical modeling is of the utmost importance to generate relevant

condition is particularly important. If treated incorrectly, it induces
incorrect behavior very quickly, because the viscous time is shortest near the
inner boundary. Recent work has determined the correct inner boundary in
Eulerian simulations. But in quasi-Lagrangian simulations (e.g., SPH, moving
mesh, and mesh-less), where the inner boundary is modeled by removing mass
within a finite zone, the inner density profile typically becomes anomalously
depleted. Here we show how the boundary condition should be applied in such

one must speed up the remaining material so that the disk's angular momentum is
unchanged. We show with both 1D and 2D moving-mesh (AREPO) simulations that
this scheme works as desired in viscously evolving disks. It produces no
spurious density depletions and is independent of the mass removal rate,
provided that the disk is adequately resolved and that the mass removal rate is
not so extreme as to trigger instabilities. This ""torque-free"" mass removal
technique permits the use of quasi-Lagrangian codes to simulate viscously
evolving disks, while including a variety of additional effects. As an example,
we apply our scheme to a 2D simulation of an accretion disk perturbed by a very
massive planet, in which the disk is evolved to viscous steady state.

we extended the widely used stellar wind theory by Castor, Abbott & Klein from

regime. In particular we modify the mass-loss rate formula in a way that we are
able to explain the empirical mass-loss dependence on the Eddington parameter

current stellar evolution models for massive and very massive stars. It makes
verifiable predictions, namely how the mass-loss rate scales with metallicity

kinetic energy spectrum and the turbulence autocorrelation time -- in the
context of the turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI). We carry out numerical simulations of the MRI as well as driven
turbulence, for a range of physical and numerical parameters. We find that the
convergence of the turbulence $\alpha$-parameter does not necessarily imply the
convergence of the energy spectrum. The MRI turbulence is largely solenoidal,
for which we observe a persistent kinetic energy spectrum of $k^{-4/3}$. The
same is obtained for solenoidal driven turbulence with and without magnetic
field, over more than 1 dex near the dissipation scale. This power-law slope
appears to be converged in terms of numerical resolution, and to be due to the
bottleneck effect. The kinetic energy in the MRI turbulence peaks at the
fastest growing mode of the MRI. In contrast, the magnetic energy peaks at the
dissipation scale. The magnetic energy spectrum in the MRI turbulence does not
show a clear power-law range, and is almost constant over approximately 1 dex
near the dissipation scale. The turbulence autocorrelation time is nearly
constant at large scales, limited by the shearing timescale, and shows a
power-law drop close to $k^{-1}$ at small scales, with a slope steeper than
that of the eddy crossing time. The deviation from the standard picture of the
Kolmogorov turbulence with the injection scale at the disk scale height can
potentially have a significant impact on the grain collisional velocities.

mass, leading to electroweak symmetry non-restoration at high temperature. We
show that such an effect can also be induced by new singlet fermions which on
the other hand have the advantage of not producing unstable directions in the
scalar potential at tree level, nor bringing additional severe hierarchy
problems. As temperature drops, such a high-temperature breaking phase may
continuously evolve into the zero-temperature breaking phase or the two phases
can be separated by a temporary phase of restored symmetry. We discuss how our
construction can naturally arise in motivated models of new physics, such as
Composite Higgs. This is particularly relevant for baryogenesis, as it opens a
whole class of possibilities in which the baryon asymmetry can be produced
during a high temperature phase transition, while not being erased later by
sphalerons.

achieve fault-tolerant error correction, Shor proposed to repeat the sequence
of parity check measurements until the same outcome is observed sufficiently
many times. Then, one can use this information to perform error correction. A
basic implementation of this fault tolerance strategy requires $\Omega(r d^2)$

drift measurements. Firstly, wavelength calibration procedures are important:
using multiple segmented polynomials within one echelle order results in
significantly better wavelength calibration compared to using a single
higher-order polynomial. Segmented polynomials should be used in all
applications aimed at precise spectral line position measurements. Secondly, we
found that changing astrocombs causes significant zero-point offsets ($\approx
60{\rm cms}^{-1}$ in our raw data) which were removed. Thirdly, astrocombs
achieve a precision of $\lesssim 4{\rm cms}^{-1}$ in a single exposure

we propose to incentivize agents to take (joint) actions whose effects cannot

additional information to send a signal to each player. A natural question is
the following: is it possible for an informed sender to reduce the overall
social cost via the strategic provision of information to players who update
their beliefs rationally? The paper focuses on the problem of computing optimal
ex ante persuasive signaling schemes, showing that symmetry is a crucial

which these models are wrong---and the consequences of those shortcomings. This
paper attempts a comprehensive, structured overview of the specific conceptual,
procedural, and statistical limitations of models in machine learning when
applied to society. Machine learning modelers themselves can use the described
hierarchy to identify possible failure points and think through how to address
them, and consumers of machine learning models can know what to question when
confronted with the decision about if, where, and how to apply machine
learning. The limitations go from commitments inherent in quantification
itself, through to showing how unmodeled dependencies can lead to
cross-validation being overly optimistic as a way of assessing model
performance.

of data sets where only a small subset of the data items is labeled. In these

a large portion or even the entire data set, leading to major degradation in
classification accuracy. Therefore, the development of new techniques to reduce
the nasty effects of label noise in semi-supervised learning is a vital issue.
Recently, a graph-based semi-supervised learning approach based on Particle
competition and cooperation was developed. In this model, particles walk in the
graphs constructed from the data sets. Competition takes place among particles
representing different class labels, while the cooperation occurs among
particles with the same label. This paper presents a new particle competition
and cooperation algorithm, specifically designed to increase the robustness to
the presence of label noise, improving its label noise tolerance. Different
from other methods, the proposed one does not require a separate technique to
deal with label noise. It performs classification of unlabeled nodes and
reclassification of the nodes affected by label noise in a unique process.
Computer simulations show the classification accuracy of the proposed method
when applied to some artificial and real-world data sets, in which we introduce
increasing amounts of label noise. The classification accuracy is compared to
those achieved by previous particle competition and cooperation algorithms and
other representative graph-based semi-supervised learning methods using the

in contemporary condensed matter physics. This is quintessentially captured in
the attractive Hubbard model, a simple theoretical model where the competition
can be directly tuned. In previous studies by the current authors, it has been
suggested that the Hubbard model maps to an $SO(3)$ non-linear sigma model,
where the phase competition becomes manifest. In this article, we rigorously
demonstrate this mapping and use it to study thermal disordering of a
supersolid. Starting with the attractive Hubbard model in the presence of an
orbital field, we take the limit of strong coupling where a pseudospin
description emerges. The in-plane pseudospin components represent
superconducting pairing while the out-of-plane component encodes charge density
wave order. We obtain an effective spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonian with ferromagnetic
in-plane couplings and antiferromagnetic z-z couplings. In addition, the
orbital field gives rise to a textured Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that
has the same periodicity as the magnetic unit cell. In order to examine the
nature of ordering in this spin model, we consider it in the classical limit.
We assume slowly varying fields, leading to the $SO(3)$ non-linear sigma model
description. As an application of these ideas, we study the nature of ordering
using simulated annealing and classical Monte Carlo simulations. The ground
state represents a supersolid with coexisting superconductivity and charge
order. It can be viewed as a `meron crystal', a regular arrangement of
superconducting vortices with charge-ordered cores. The coherent overlap of
core regions gives rise to coherent long-ranged charge order. As the
temperature is raised, this charge order is lost via a sharp phase transition
in the Ising universality class.

non-Gaussian systems can suffer from a curse of dimensionality as the number of

ensemble of Monte Carlo filters, using spatiotemporally localized weights to
select successful filters at each unit and time. We obtain conditions under

properties are important for multifunctional devices due to their potential
ability of controlling magnetism via electric field, and vice versa. The recent
discoveries of two-dimensional ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials have
ignited tremendous research interest and aroused hope to search for
two-dimensional multiferroics. However, intrinsic two-dimensional multiferroic
materials and, particularly, those with strong magnetoelectric couplings are
still rare to date. In this paper, using first-principles simulations, we
propose artificial two-dimensional multiferroics via a van der Waals
heterostructure formed by ferromagnetic bilayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) and
ferroelectric monolayer Sc2CO2. In addition to the coexistence of
ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, our calculations show that, by switching
the electric polarization of Sc2CO2, we can tune the interlayer magnetic
couplings of bilayer CrI3 between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states.
We further reveal that such a strong magnetoelectric effect is from a dramatic
change of the band alignment induced by the strong build-in electric
polarization in Sc2CO2 and the subsequent change of the interlayer magnetic
coupling of bilayer CrI3. These artificial multiferroics and enhanced
magnetoelectric effect give rise to realizing multifunctional nanoelectronics
by van der Waals heterostructures.

Compared to regular radio interferometers, VLBI networks typically have fewer

  guarantees",,,,,"q-fin.RM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work studies a stochastic optimal control problem for a pension scheme
which provides an income-drawdown policy to its members after their retirement.
To manage the scheme efficiently, the manager and members agree to share the
investment risk based on a pre-decided risk-sharing rule. The objective is to
maximise both sides' utilities by controlling the manager's investment in risky
assets and members' benefit withdrawals. We use stochastic affine class models
to describe the force of mortality of the members' population and consider a
longevity bond whose coupon payment is linked to a survival index. In our
framework, we also investigate the longevity basis risk, which arises when the
members' and the longevity bond's reference populations show different
mortality behaviours. By applying the dynamic programming principle to solve
the corresponding HJB equations, we derive optimal solutions for the single-
and sub-population cases. Our numerical results show that by sharing the risk,
both manager and members increase their utility. Moreover, even in the presence
of longevity basis risk, we demonstrate that the longevity bond acts as an
effective hedging instrument.

state-dependent edges encode pair-wise messages that can be exchanged. We
introduce a graph-dependent attention mechanisms that controls how the agents'
incoming messages are weighted. This mechanism takes into full account the
current state of the system as represented by the graph, and builds upon a
diffusion process that captures how the information flows on the graph. The
graph topology is not assumed to be known a priori, but depends dynamically on
the agents' observations, and is learnt concurrently with the attention
mechanism and policy in an end-to-end fashion. Our empirical results show that
CDC is able to learn effective collaborative policies and can over-perform
competing learning algorithms on cooperative navigation tasks.

from 1 to 12 keV using an internal transport barrier scenario reveals a
dramatic increase in the production of seed runaway electrons (REs), ultimately
accessing near-complete conversion of the pre-disruption current into sub-MeV
RE current. Injected Ar pellets are observed to ablate more intensely and
promptly as Te rises. At high Te, the observed ablation exceeds predictions
from published thermal ablation models. Simultaneously, the thermal quench (TQ)
is observed to significantly shorten with increasing Te -- a surprising result.
While the reason for the shorter TQ is not yet understood, candidate mechanisms
include: insufficiently accurate thermal ablation models, enhanced ablation
driven by the seed RE population, or significant parallel heat transport along
stochastic fields. Kinetic modeling that self-consistently treats the plasma
cooling via radiation, the induced electric field, and the formation of the
seed RE is performed. Including the combined effect of the inherent dependence
of hot-tail RE seeding on Te together with the shortened TQ, modeling recovers
the progression towards near-complete conversion of the pre-disruption current
to RE current as Te rises. Measurement of the HXR spectrum during the early
current quench (CQ) reveals a trend of decreasing energy with pre-disruption
Te. At the very highest Te ($\approx$ 12 keV), $\approx$ 100% conversion of the
thermal current to runaway current is found. The energy of this peculiar RE
beam is inferred to be sub-MeV as it emits vanishingly few MeV hard X-rays
(HXRs). These measurements demonstrate novel TQ dynamics as Te is varied and
illustrate the limitations of treating the RE seed formation problem without
considering the inter-related dependencies of the pellet ablation, radiative
energy loss, and resultant variations of the TQ duration.

competing risks model to model breast and ovarian cancer risks within BRCA1
families that accounts for time-varying covariates (TVCs). Different parametric
forms for these TVCs are proposed for more flexibility and a correlated gamma
frailty model is specified to account for the correlated competing events. We
also introduced a new ascertainment correction approach that accounts for the

date, nearly all work has focused on five-component, equimolar compositions.
This perspective article briefly reviews different families of HECs and
selected properties. Following a couple of our most recent studies, we propose
a step forward to expand HECs to Compositionally Complex ceramics (CCCs) to
include medium-entropy and non-equimolar compositions. Using defective fluorite
and ordered pyrochlore oxides as two primary examples, we further consider the
complexities of aliovalent cations and anion vacancies as well as ordered
structures with two cation sublattices. Better thermally-insulating yet stiff
CCCs have been found in non-equimolar compositions with optimal amounts of
oxygen vacancies and in ordered pyrochlores with substantial size disorder. It
is demonstrated that medium-entropy ceramics (MECs) can prevail over their
high-entropy counterparts. The diversifying classes of CCCs provide even more
possibilities than HECs to tailor the composition, defects, disorder/order,
and, consequently, various properties.

of a player in a cooperative setting. In a geometric context, it provides a way
to measure the contribution of a geometric object in a set towards some
function on the set. Recently, Cabello and Chan (SoCG 2019) presented
algorithms for computing Shapley values for a number of functions for point
sets in the plane. More formally, a coalition game consists of a set of players
$N$ and a characteristic function $v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$ with $v(\emptyset) =
0$. Let $\pi$ be a uniformly random permutation of $N$, and $P_N(\pi, i)$ be
the set of players in $N$ that appear before player $i$ in the permutation
$\pi$. The Shapley value of the game is defined to be $\phi(i) =
\mathbb{E}_\pi[v(P_N(\pi, i) \cup \{i\}) - v(P_N(\pi, i))]$. More intuitively,
the Shapley value represents the impact of player $i$'s appearance over all
insertion orders. We present an algorithm to compute Shapley values in 3-D,
where we treat points as players and use the mean width of the convex hull as
the characteristic function. Our algorithm runs in $O(n^3\log^2{n})$ time and
$O(n)$ space. Our approach is based on a new data structure for a variant of
the dynamic convolution problem $(u, v, p)$, where we want to answer $u\cdot v$
dynamically. Our data structure supports updating $u$ at position $p$,
incrementing and decrementing $p$ and rotating $v$ by $1$. We present a data
structure that supports $n$ operations in $O(n\log^2{n})$ time and $O(n)$
space. Moreover, the same approach can be used to compute the Shapley values
for the mean volume of the convex hull projection onto a uniformly random $(d -
2)$-subspace in $O(n^d\log^2{n})$ time and $O(n)$ space for a point set in
$d$-dimensional space ($d \geq 3$).

indirect mechanism operating through an intermediate outcome or mediator, as

the evaluation of direct and indirect effects is frequently complicated by
non-ignorable selection into the treatment and/or mediator, even after
controlling for observables, as well as sample selection/outcome attrition. We
propose a method for bounding direct and indirect effects in the presence of
such complications using a method that is based on a sequence of linear
programming problems. Considering inverse probability weighting by propensity
scores, we compute the weights that would yield identification in the absence
of complications and perturb them by an entropy parameter reflecting a specific
amount of propensity score misspecification to set-identify the effects of
interest. We apply our method to data from the National Longitudinal Survey of

gender wage gap decomposition that is likely prone to non-ignorable mediator

suitably large datasets to bring machine learning to level design in the same
way as it's been used for image generation. Here we propose Generative Playing
Networks which design levels for itself to play. The algorithm is built in two
parts; an agent that learns to play game levels, and a generator that learns
the distribution of playable levels. As the agent learns and improves its
ability, the space of playable levels, as defined by the agent, grows. The
generator targets the agent's playability estimates to then update its
understanding of what constitutes a playable level. We call this process of
learning the distribution of data found through self-discovery with an
environment, self-supervised inductive learning. Unlike previous approaches to
procedural content generation, Generative Playing Networks are end-to-end
differentiable and do not require human-designed examples or domain knowledge.
We demonstrate the capability of this framework by training an agent and level
generator for a 2D dungeon crawler game.

the internal graph receives time independent input from the tails, say
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{in}$, at every time step. We show that the response of
the Szegedy walk to the input, which is the output, say
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_{out}$, from the internal graph to the tails in the long

underlying random walk. If the underlying random walk is reversible, we have
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_{out}=\mathrm{Sz}(\boldsymbol{m}_{\delta

$\mathrm{Sz}(\boldsymbol{m}_{\delta E})$ is the reflection matrix to the unit

linear combination of the reversible measure and the electric current on the
electric circuit determined by the internal graph and the random walk's
reversible measure. On the other hand, if the underlying random walk is not
reversible, then the unitary matrix is just a phase flip; that is,
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_{out}=-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{in}$, and the stationary state
is similar to the current flow but satisfies a different type of the Kirchhoff

that affects the lives of more than 3 million people in the U.S. and over 33
million people around the world and is associated with a five-fold increased
risk of stroke and mortality. like other problems in healthcare domain,
artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have been used to reliably detect
AF from patients' physiological signals. The cardiologist level performance in
detecting this arrhythmia is often achieved by deep learning-based methods,
however, they suffer from the lack of interpretability. In other words, these
approaches are unable to explain the reasons behind their decisions. The lack
of interpretability is a common challenge toward a wide application of machine
learning-based approaches in the healthcare which limits the trust of
clinicians in such methods. To address this challenge, we propose HAN-ECG, an
interpretable bidirectional-recurrent-neural-network-based approach for the AF
detection task. The HAN-ECG employs three attention mechanism levels to provide
a multi-resolution analysis of the patterns in ECG leading to AF. The first
level, wave level, computes the wave weights, the second level, heartbeat
level, calculates the heartbeat weights, and third level, window (i.e.,
multiple heartbeats) level, produces the window weights in triggering a class
of interest. The detected patterns by this hierarchical attention model
facilitate the interpretation of the neural network decision process in
identifying the patterns in the signal which contributed the most to the final
prediction. Experimental results on two AF databases demonstrate that our
proposed model performs significantly better than the existing algorithms.
Visualization of these attention layers illustrates that our model decides upon
the important waves and heartbeats which are clinically meaningful in the
detection task.

of the same system are concurrently described at different levels of detail. In
enzymes, computationally expensive atomistic detail is crucial in the modelling
of the active site in order to capture e.g. the chemically subtle process of
ligand binding. In contrast, important yet more collective properties of the
remainder of the protein can be reproduced with a coarser description. In the
present work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the
calculation of the binding free energy of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) with
the inhibitor di-N-acetylchitotriose. Particular attention is posed to the
impact of the mapping, i.e. the selection of atomistic and coarse-grained
residues, on the binding free energy. It is shown that, in spite of small
variations of the binding free energy with respect to the active site
resolution, the separate contributions coming from different energetic terms
(such as electrostatic and van der Waals interactions) manifest a stronger
dependence on the mapping, thus pointing to the existence of an optimal level

shape is of interest in multiple disciplines, from biology to engineering.
Theoretical studies are often limited by the complexity of long-range
particle-particle and particle-wall forces, including many-body fluctuating
hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we report a computational study on the
diffusion of spherical and cylindrical particles confined in a spherical
cavity. We rely on an Immersed-Boundary General geometry Ewald-like method to
capture lubrication and long-range hydrodynamics, and include appropriate
non-slip conditions at the confining walls. A Chebyshev polynomial
approximation is used to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the
Brownian suspension. We explore how lubrication, long-range hydrodynamics,
particle volume fraction and shape affect the equilibrium structure and the
diffusion of the particles. It is found that once the particle volume fraction
is greater than $10\%$, the particles start to form layered aggregates that
greatly influence particle dynamics. Hydrodynamic interactions strongly
influence the particle diffusion by inducing spatially dependent short-time
diffusion coefficients, stronger wall effects on the particle diffusion towards
the walls, and a sub-diffusive regime --caused by crowding-- in the long-time
particle mobility. The level of asymmetry of the cylindrical particles
considered here is enough to induce an orientational order in the layered
structure, decreasing the diffusion rate and facilitating a transition to the
crowded mobility regime at low particle concentrations. Our results offer
fundamental insights into the diffusion and distribution of globular and
fibrillar proteins inside cells.

depending crucially on the choice of the step sizes. Accordingly, a variety of
strategies for tuning the step sizes have been proposed, ranging from
coordinate-wise approaches (a.k.a. ``adaptive'' step sizes) to sophisticated
heuristics to change the step size in each iteration. In this paper, we study
two step size schedules whose power has been repeatedly confirmed in practice:
the exponential and the cosine step sizes. For the first time, we provide
theoretical support for them proving convergence rates for smooth non-convex
functions, with and without the Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. Moreover,
we show the surprising property that these two strategies are \emph{adaptive}
to the noise level in the stochastic gradients of PL functions. That is,
contrary to polynomial step sizes, they achieve almost optimal performance
without needing to know the noise level nor tuning their hyperparameters based
on it. Finally, we conduct a fair and comprehensive empirical evaluation of
real-world datasets with deep learning architectures. Results show that, even
if only requiring at most two hyperparameters to tune, these two strategies
best or match the performance of various finely-tuned state-of-the-art
strategies.

enrichment mechanism contributing to the population of Li-rich giants (A(Li) >=
1.5 dex). Using MESA stellar models and A(Li) abundance measurements obtained
by the GALAH survey, we calculate the strength and observability of the surface
Li enrichment signature produced by the engulfment of a hot Jupiter (HJ). We
consider solar-metallicity stars in the mass range of 1-2 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$
and the Li supplied by a HJ of 1.0 $\mathrm{M_J}$. We explore engulfment events
that occur near the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and out to orbital

We identify the parameter space of masses and evolutionary phases where the
engulfment of a HJ can lead to Li enrichment signatures at a $5\sigma$
confidence level and with meteoritic abundance strengths. The most compelling
strengths and survival times of engulfment-derived Li enrichment are found
among host stars of 1.4 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ near the MSTO. Our calculations
indicate that planetary engulfment is not a viable enrichment pathway for stars
that have evolved beyond the subgiant branch. For these sources, observed Li
enhancements are likely to be produced by other mechanisms, such as the
Cameron-Fowler process or the accretion of material from an asymptotic giant

signatures.

(EUROCRYPT 2010) and quantum search, we devise an algorithm with asymptotic
cost $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(2^{0.236 n})$, lower than the cost of the quantum
walk based on the same classical algorithm proposed by Bernstein, Jeffery,
Lange and Meurer (PQCRYPTO 2013). This algorithm has the advantage of using
\emph{classical} memory with quantum random access, while the previously known
algorithms used the quantum walk framework, and required \emph{quantum} memory
with quantum random access.
  We also propose new quantum walks for subset-sum, performing better than the
previous best time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(2^{0.226 n})$ given by
Helm and May (TQC 2018). We combine our new techniques to reach a time
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(2^{0.216 n})$. This time is dependent on a heuristic on
quantum walk updates, formalized by Helm and May, that is also required by the

obtain an algorithm with quantum time $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(2^{0.218 n})$
requiring only the standard classical subset-sum heuristics.

coupled limit cycle and chaotic oscillators are considered. For coupled Van der
Pol oscillators (and in fact, other oscillators as well) the delay can produce
transitions from amplitude death(AD) or oscillation death (OD) to Hopf
bifurcation-induced periodic behavior, with the delayed limit cycle shrinking
or growing as the delay is varied towards or away from the bifurcation point
respectively. The transition from AD to OD is mediated here via a pitchfork
bifurcation, as seen earlier for other couplings as well. Also, the cyclically
coupled undelayed van der Pol system here is already in a state of AD/OD, and
introducing the delay allows both oscillations and AD/OD as the delay parameter
is varied. This is in contrast to other limit cycle systems, where diffusive
coupling alone does not result in the onset of AD/OD. For systems where the
individual oscillators are chaotic, such as a Sprott oscillator system or a
coupled van der Pol-Rayleigh system with parametric forcing, the delay may
produce AD/OD (as in the Sprott case), with the AD to OD transition now
occurring via a transcritical bifurcation instead. However, this may not be
possible, and the delay might just vary the attractor shape. In either of these
situations however, increased delay strength tends to cause the system to have
simpler behavior, streamlining the shape of the attractor, or shrinking it in
cases with oscillations.

reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter.
The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the
Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February
2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary
mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here,
the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as
inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based
strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such
as during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the
exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic
reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected
person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people.
Assuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of

effectiveness.

fictitious quantum fluctuation. The most groundbreaking progress in the
research field of quantum annealing is its hardware implementation, i.e., the
so-called quantum annealer, using artificial spins. However, the connectivity
between the artificial spins is sparse and limited on a special network known
as the chimera graph. Several embedding techniques have been proposed, but the
number of logical spins, which represents the optimization problems to be
solved, is drastically reduced. In particular, an optimization problem
including fully or even partly connected spins suffers from low embeddable size
on the chimera graph. In the present study, we propose an alternative approach
to solve a large-scale optimization problem on the chimera graph via a
well-known method in statistical mechanics called the Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation or its variants. The proposed method can be used to deal with a
fully connected Ising model without embedding on the chimera graph and leads to
nontrivial results of the optimization problem. We tested the proposed method
with a number of partition problems involving solving linear equations and the

$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV are reported. These measurements scan the
phase space of jet emissions in search of medium-induced signals which are
expected to emerge at different scales. These include effects such as multiple
soft-radiation, single hard emissions, and color coherence. The Lund plane
diagram is shown, including projections onto distributions of the splitting
scale $k_{\mathrm{T}}$ in intervals of the splitting angle $R_{\mathrm{g}}$.
Soft Drop grooming is applied to access hard splittings within the jet,
enabling measurements of groomed substructure variables. These include the
shared momentum fraction $z_{\mathrm{g}}$ between the two hardest subjets and
the number of Soft Drop splittings $n_{\mathrm{SD}}$. The results in Pb--Pb
collisions are compared to PYTHIA events embedded into a Pb--Pb background to
separate out background from in-medium effects. Measurements of
$z_{\mathrm{g}}$ and the normalized splitting angle $\theta_{\mathrm{g}}$ will
also be shown in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV for different grooming
settings.

  Estimation",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of many scientific experiments including A/B testing is to estimate
the average treatment effect (ATE), which is defined as the difference between
the expected outcomes of two or more treatments. In this paper, we consider a
situation where an experimenter can assign a treatment to research subjects
sequentially. In adaptive experimental design, the experimenter is allowed to
change the probability of assigning a treatment using past observations for
estimating the ATE efficiently. However, with this approach, it is difficult to
apply a standard statistical method to construct an estimator because the
observations are not independent and identically distributed. We thus propose
an algorithm for efficient experiments with estimators constructed from
dependent samples. We also introduce a sequential testing framework using the
proposed estimator. To justify our proposed approach, we provide finite and
infinite sample analyses. Finally, we experimentally show that the proposed
algorithm exhibits preferable performance.

  Optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epoch gradient descent method (a.k.a. Epoch-GD) proposed by Hazan and Kale
(2011) was deemed a breakthrough for stochastic strongly convex minimization,
which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ with $T$ iterative
updates for the {\it objective gap}. However, its extension to solving
stochastic min-max problems with strong convexity and strong concavity still
remains open, and it is still unclear whether a fast rate of $O(1/T)$ for the
{\it duality gap} is achievable for stochastic min-max optimization under
strong convexity and strong concavity. Although some recent studies have
proposed stochastic algorithms with fast convergence rates for min-max
problems, they require additional assumptions about the problem, e.g.,
smoothness, bi-linear structure, etc. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
providing a sharp analysis of epoch-wise stochastic gradient descent ascent
method (referred to as Epoch-GDA) for solving strongly convex strongly concave
(SCSC) min-max problems, without imposing any additional assumption about
smoothness or the function's structure. To the best of our knowledge, our
result is the first one that shows Epoch-GDA can achieve the optimal rate of
$O(1/T)$ for the duality gap of general SCSC min-max problems. We emphasize
that such generalization of Epoch-GD for strongly convex minimization problems
to Epoch-GDA for SCSC min-max problems is non-trivial and requires novel
technical analysis. Moreover, we notice that the key lemma can also be used for
proving the convergence of Epoch-GDA for weakly-convex strongly-concave min-max
problems, leading to a nearly optimal complexity without resorting to
smoothness or other structural conditions.

from the model exhibit small but obvious deviations in the peak region. A
binary lens (2L1S) model with a mass ratio $q\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ improves the
fits by $\Delta\chi^2=181.8$, indicating that the lens possesses a planetary
companion. From additional modeling by introducing an extra planetary lens
component (3L1S model) and an extra source companion (2L2S model), it is found
that the residuals from the 2L1S model further diminish, but claiming these
interpretations is difficult due to the weak signals with $\Delta\chi^2=16.0$
and $13.5$ for the 3L1S and 2L2L models, respectively. From a Bayesian
analysis, we estimate that the host of the planets has a mass of $M_{\rm

a distance of $D_{\rm L}=7.04^{+1.10}_{-1.33}~{\rm kpc}$ toward the Galactic

applications such as autonomous driving. Despite significant progress has been
made, we observe two aspects to be further improved. First, the semantic
context information in LiDAR is seldom explored in previous works, which may
help identify ambiguous vehicles. Second, the distribution of point cloud on
vehicles varies continuously with increasing depths, which may not be well
modeled by a single model. In this work, we propose a unified model SegVoxelNet
to address the above two problems. A semantic context encoder is proposed to
leverage the free-of-charge semantic segmentation masks in the bird's eye view.
Suspicious regions could be highlighted while noisy regions are suppressed by
this module. To better deal with vehicles at different depths, a novel
depth-aware head is designed to explicitly model the distribution differences
and each part of the depth-aware head is made to focus on its own target
detection range. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives in both accuracy
and efficiency with point cloud as input only.

discover a class of quantum entropy vectors which reach beyond those of

the hypergraph cone is identical to the stabilizer entropy cone, thus
demonstrating that the hypergraph framework is broadly applicable to the study

well-known coupled Landau-Stuart system, as well as a chaotic van der
Pol-Rayleigh system with parametric forcing. The systems are close via the
'linear chain trick'. Linear stability analysis of the systems and conditions
for Hopf bifurcation which initiates oscillations are investigated, including
deriving the normal form at bifurcation, and deducing the stability of the
resulting limit cycle attractor. The value of the delay parameter $a=a_{Hopf}$
at Hopf bifurcation picks out the onset of Amplitude Death(AD) in all three
systems, with oscillations at larger values (corresponding to weaker delay). In
the Landau-Stuart system, the Hopf-generated limit cycles for $a>a_{Hopf}$ turn
out to be remarkably stable under very large variations of all other system
parameters beyond the Hopf bifurcation point, and do not undergo further
symmetry breaking, cyclic-fold, flip, transcritical or Neimark-Sacker
bifurcations. This is to be expected as the corresponding undelayed systems are
robust oscillators over wide ranges of their respective parameters. Numerical
simulations reveal strong distortion and rotation of the limit cycles in phase
space as the parameters are pushed far into the post-Hopf regime, and reveal
other features, such as how the oscillation amplitudes and time periods of the
physical variables on the limit cycle attractor change as the delay and other
parameters are varied. For the chaotic system, very strong delays may still
lead to the cessation of oscillations and the onset of AD (even for relatively
large values of the system forcing which tends to oppose this phenomenon).
Varying of the other important system parameter, the parametric excitation,
leads to a rich sequence of dynamical behaviors, with the bifurcations leading
from one regime (or type of attractor) into the next being carefully tracked.

near-omnidirectional (0{\deg}-75{\deg}) acoustic metasurface absorber composed
of 4 coupled unit cells at a thickness of 15.4 cm (1/45 of the wavelength at 50

strong coupling between unit cells, which is realized by carefully engineering
geometric parameters of each unit cell, especially the judicious assignment of
lateral size to each unit cell. To further broaden the bandwidth (50-100 Hz,
one octave band), a design with 19 unit cells coupled in a supercell is
analytically studied to achieve an average absorption coefficient of 85% for a
wide angle range (0{\deg}-75{\deg}) at a thickness of 20 cm (1/34 of wavelength

the number of unit cells in the supercell, are demonstrated to facilitate such
a causally optimal design which is close to the ideally causal optimality. The
proposed design methodology may solve the long-standing issue for low frequency

decomposition method (DDM) with source transfer for solving the high-frequency
Helmholtz equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In the method the computational domain is
partitioned into overlapping checkerboard subdomains for source transfer with
the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique, then a set of diagonal sweeps over
the subdomains are specially designed to solve the system efficiently. The
method improves the additive overlapping DDM (W. Leng and L. Ju, 2019) and the
L-sweeps method (M. Taus, et al., 2019) by employing a more efficient subdomain
solving order. We show that the method achieves the exact solution of the
global PML problem with $2^n$ sweeps in the constant medium case. Although the
sweeping usually implies sequential subdomain solves, the number of sequential
steps required for each sweep in the method is only proportional to the $n$-th
root of the number of subdomains when the domain decomposition is quasi-uniform
with respect to all directions, thus it is very suitable for parallel computing
of the Helmholtz problem with multiple right-hand sides through the pipeline
processing. Extensive numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed

their decoupling with the environment. However, the spin-lattice interaction is
inevitable in a real setting. While the Majorana fermion evades a strong decay
due to the gradient form of spin-lattice coupling, the study of the phonon
dynamics may serve as an indirect probe of fractionalization of spin degrees of
freedom. Here we propose that the signatures of fractionalization can be seen
in the sound attenuation and the Hall viscosity. Despite the fact that both
quantities can be related to the imaginary part of the phonon self-energy,
their origins are quite different, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking is
required for the Hall viscosity. First, we compute the sound attenuation due to
a phonon scattering off of a pair of Majorana fermions and show that it is
linear in temperature ($\sim T$). We argue that it has a particular angular
dependence providing the information about the spin-lattice coupling and the
low-energy Majorana fermion spectrum. The observable effects in the absence of
time-reversal symmetry are then analyzed. We obtain the phonon Hall viscosity
term from the microscopic Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry breaking
term. Importantly, the Hall viscosity term mixes the longitudinal and
transverse phonon modes and renormalize the spectrum in a unique way, which may
be probed in spectroscopy measurement.

observers (e.g. sensors) measuring the state of an environment or dynamical
system, a centralized executive (e.g. controller) deciding on the state, and
agents (e.g. actuators) that implement the executive's decisions. The executive
harvests the observers' measurements and decides on the short-term trajectory
of the system by instructing its agents to take appropriate actions. All
observation packets (typically uplink) and action packets (typically downlink)
must be delivered by hard deadlines to ensure the proper functioning of the

further define adjoint generalised Hermite functions (A-GHFs) which have an

avoiding the use of convexity. For any $d$-uniform hypergraph $H$, let
$ex_d(n,H)$ be the maximum possible number of edges in an $H$-free $d$-uniform

developers to quickly create app privacy policies which are required by privacy
regulations to be incorporated to each mobile app. The creation of these tools
brings convenience to app developers; however, the quality of these tools puts
developers and stakeholders at legal risk. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study to assess the quality of online APPGs. We analyze the
completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be
covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with
boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static
or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of
issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete
because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy.
Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal
information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input.
Ultimately, the defects of APPGs may potentially lead to serious legal issues.
We hope that the results and insights developed in this paper can motivate the
healthy and ethical development of APPGs towards generating a more complete,
accurate, and robust privacy policy.

prescription in the SAGE semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. The new
model, called Dusty SAGE, follows the condensation of dust in the ejecta of
type II supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, grain growth in the
dense molecular clouds, destruction by supernovae shocks, and the removal of
dust from the ISM by star formation, reheating, inflows and outflows. Our model
successfully reproduces the observed dust mass function at redshift z = 0 and
the observed scaling relations for dust across a wide range of redshifts. We
find that the dust mass content in the present Universe is mainly produced via
grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). By contrast, in the early
Universe, the primary production mechanism for dust is the condensation in
stellar ejecta. The shift of the significant production channel for dust
characterises the scaling relations of dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metal
(DTM) ratios. In galaxies where the grain growth dominates, we find positive
correlations for DTG and DTM ratios with both metallicity and stellar mass. On
the other hand, in galaxies where dust is produced primarily via condensation,
we find negative or no correlation for DTM and DTG ratios with either
metallicity or stellar mass. In agreement with observation showing that the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains more dust than the ISM, our model also
shows the same trend for z < 4. Our semi-analytic model is publicly available

among them. However, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous
knowledge when learned incrementally without access to the old data. Most
existing object detectors are domain-specific and static, while some are
learned incrementally but only within a single domain. Training an object
detector incrementally across various domains has rarely been explored. In this
work, we propose three incremental learning scenarios across various domains
and categories for object detection. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
attentive feature distillation is proposed to leverages both bottom-up and
top-down attentions to extract important information for distillation. We then
systematically analyze the proposed distillation method in different scenarios.
We find out that, contrary to common understanding, domain gaps have smaller
negative impact on incremental detection, while category differences are
problematic. For the difficult cases, where the domain gaps and especially
category differences are large, we explore three different exemplar sampling
methods and show the proposed adaptive sampling method is effective to select
diverse and informative samples from entire datasets, to further prevent
forgetting. Experimental results show that we achieve the significant
improvement in three different scenarios across seven object detection
benchmark datasets.

corresponding monocular images. Most existing deep learning frameworks with
two-streams input data always fuse separate data by concatenating or adding,
which views every part of a feature map can contribute equally to the whole

Firstly, we implemented different structures with one-dimensional CCA and
Alexnet to test the performance on the image classification task. And then, we
applied one of these structures with 2D-CCA for object detection. During these
experiments, we found that our proposed framework behaves better when taking

outliers), which will significantly increase the computational burden. In order
to overcome the above problem, we propose a novel hypergraph optimization based
model fitting (HOMF) method to construct a simple but effective hypergraph.
Specifically, HOMF includes two main parts: an adaptive inlier estimation
algorithm for vertex optimization and an iterative hyperedge optimization
algorithm for hyperedge optimization. The proposed method is highly efficient,
and it can obtain accurate model fitting results within a few iterations.
Moreover, HOMF can then directly apply spectral clustering, to achieve good
fitting performance. Extensive experimental results show that HOMF outperforms
several state-of-the-art model fitting methods on both synthetic data and real
images, especially in sampling efficiency and in handling data with severe

interest throughout ecology and biology. Various mathematical techniques allow
us to generate knowledge regarding individual behaviour, which can be analysed
to obtain predictions about the ultimate survival or extinction of the
population. A common model employed to describe population dynamics is the
lattice-based random walk model with crowding (exclusion). This model can
incorporate behaviour such as birth, death and movement, while including
natural phenomena such as finite size effects. Performing sufficiently many
realisations of the random walk model to extract representative population
behaviour is computationally intensive. Therefore, continuum approximations of
random walk models are routinely employed. However, standard continuum
approximations are notoriously incapable of making accurate predictions about
population extinction. Here, we develop a new continuum approximation, the
state space diffusion approximation, which explicitly accounts for population
extinction. Predictions from our approximation faithfully capture the behaviour
in the random walk model, and provides additional information compared to
standard approximations. We examine the influence of the number of lattice
sites and initial number of individuals on the long-term population behaviour,
and demonstrate the reduction in computation time between the random walk model
and our approximation.

(LAF-TMS). This is a prototype of an off-axis telescope that enables very wide
field of view (FoV) infrared satellites that can observe Paschen-$\alpha$
emission, zodiacal light, integrated star light, and other infrared sources. It
has the entrance pupil diameter of 150 mm, the focal length of 500 mm, and the
FoV of 5.5$^\circ$ $\times$ 4.1$^\circ$. LAF-TMS is an obscuration-free
off-axis system with minimal out-of-field baffling and no optical support
structure diffraction. This optical design is analytically optimized to remove
linear astigmatism and to reduce high-order aberrations. Sensitivity analysis
and Monte-Carlo simulation reveal that tilt errors are the most sensitive
alignment parameters that allow $\sim$1$^\prime$. Optomechanical structure
accurately mounts aluminum mirrors, and withstands satellite-level vibration
environments. LAF-TMS shows optical performance with 37 $\mu$m FWHM of the
point source image satisfying Nyquist sampling requirements for typical 18
$\mu$m pixel Infrared array detectors. The surface figure errors of mirrors and
scattered light from the tertiary mirror with 4.9 nm surface micro roughness
may affect the measured point spread function (PSF). Optical tests successfully
demonstrate constant optical performance over wide FoV, indicating that LAF-TMS
suppresses linear astigmatism and high-order aberrations.

obtained pure comic gammas by reducing background by more 2 orders, which is

with the ratio of CBMG and GDMG. Now 511keV gammas GDMG are preliminarily
detected with ~5 and >10 sigma respectively around Galactic Centre. Also we
have obtained near 105events of CBMG in with quite low background of only a few
10% in total CBMG events. Thus we obtained good data for both with high

cosmological population produces a confusion background that could masquerade
the detection of potential primordial stochastic backgrounds. In this paper we
study the ability of current and future detectors to resolve the confusion
background to reveal interesting primordial backgrounds. The current detector
network of LIGO and Virgo and the upcoming KAGRA and LIGO-India will not be
able to resolve the cosmological compact binary source population and its
sensitivity to stochastic background will be limited by the confusion
background of these sources. We find that a network of three (and five) third
generation (3G) detectors of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will
resolve the confusion background produced by binary black holes leaving only
about 0.013\% (respectively, 0.00075\%) unresolved; in contrast, as many as
25\% (respectively, 7.7\%) of binary neutron star sources remain unresolved.
Consequently, the binary black hole population will likely not limit
observation of primordial backgrounds but the binary neutron star population
will limit the sensitivity of 3G detectors to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 10^{-11}$
at 10 Hz (respectively, $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3\times 10^{-12}$).

By doing so, PER minimizes the upper bound of the Wasserstein distance of order
one between an empirical distribution of activations and the standard normal

regularize activations via distribution matching in the probability

the strategy is a neural network that is evolved to maximize the predictions of

done on the surrogate, ESP is more sample efficient, has lower variance, and
lower regret than standard RL approaches. Surprisingly, its solutions are also
better because both the surrogate and the strategy network regularize the

The velocity at the exit scales with the outlet size, in agreement with

not collapse to a single curve when scaled with the outlet size. We show that
the height of an $\textit{equi-inertial}$ curve, which is defined to be a curve

The main realization algorithms we present are the following.

Bottleneck (CEB), which is closely related to the Information Bottleneck (IB).
We experimentally test our hypothesis by comparing the performance of CEB
models with deterministic models and Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)
models on a variety of different datasets and robustness challenges. We find
strong empirical evidence supporting our hypothesis that MNI models improve on
these problems of robust generalization.

  Capacity Links",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-stabilizing protocols enable distributed systems to recover correct
behavior starting from any arbitrary configuration. In particular, when
processors communicate by message passing, fake messages may be placed in
communication links by an adversary. When the number of such fake messages is
unknown, self-stabilization may require huge resources: (a) generic solutions
(a.k.a. data link protocols) require unbounded resources, which makes them
unrealistic to deploy and (b) specific solutions (e.g., census or tree
construction) require $O(n\log n)$ or $O(\Delta\log n)$ bits of memory per
node, where $n$ denotes the network size and $\Delta$ its maximum degree, which
may prevent scalability.
  We investigate the possibility of resource efficient self-stabilizing
protocols in this context. Specifically, we present a self-stabilizing protocol
for $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in any n-node graph, under the asynchronous
message-passing model. It is deterministic, it converges in $O(k\Delta n^2\log
n)$ message exchanges, where $k$ is the bound of the link capacity in terms of
number of messages, and it uses messages on $O(\log\log n+\log\Delta)$ bits
with a memory of $O(\Delta\log\Delta+\log\log n)$ bits at each node. The
resource consumption of our protocol is thus almost oblivious to the number of
nodes, enabling scalability. Moreover, a striking property of our protocol is
that the nodes do not need to know the number, or any bound on the number of
messages initially present in each communication link of the initial
(potentially corrupted) network configuration. This permits our protocol to
handle any future network with unknown message capacity communication links. A
key building block of our coloring scheme is a spanning directed acyclic graph
construction, that is of independent interest, and can serve as a useful tool
for solving other tasks in this challenging setting.

confronted with an apparent instability when integrating over the Maxwell
potential $A_{\mu}$ due to the fast growth of the box graphs $AAAA$ and $AAAZ$
for large amplitude variations of $A_{\mu}$. $Z_{\mu}$ is from the vector part
of the weak neutral current. These graphs are unavoidable because they are
conditionally convergent and have to be isolated in the model's exact Euclidean
one-loop effective action arising from its fermion determinants. A previous QED
calculation of the large amplitude variation of its fermion determinant for a
class of random potentials showed that the $AAAA$ box graph cancels in this

amplitude variations of $A_{\mu}$ for fixed $Z_{\mu}$ in a superposition of
these fields cancel the $AAAA$ and $AAAZ$ graphs, thereby removing an apparent
obstacle to the model's non-perturbative quantization. A negative paramagnetic

Turbulence is characterized by some universal statistical laws. Although there

statistical laws of localized quantum turbulence, referring to two statistical
laws deduced from the vibrating wire experiments in [Yano $et$ $al.$, J. Low
Temp. Phys. $\bf{196}$, $184\ (2019)$]. The first law is the Poisson process
for the detection of vortex rings; the vortex tangle emits vortex rings with
frequencies depending on their sizes. The second law is the power law between
the frequency and the size of the emitted vortex rings, showing the
self-similarity of the tangle. To study these statistical laws numerically, we
developed a system similar to experiments. First, we generate a localized
statistically steady vortex tangle by injecting vortex rings from two opposite
sides and causing collisions. We investigated the conditions that aid the
formation of the tangles and the anisotropy of the emission of vortex rings
from the tangle. Second, from the data on emitted rings, we reconstruct the two
statistical laws. Results from our numerical investigations are consistent with
the known self-similarity of emitted vortex rings and localized tangles.

arises due to a combination of broken time-reversal and crystal symmetries

so-called crystal Hall effect in terminology of \v{S}mejkal et al.

results in a parsimonious model allowing for high computational performance.

temperatures in (Bi0.7Y0.3)2O3 although the conductivity is much less than that
observed in the undoped high temperature {\delta}-phase of Bi2O3. This result
is consistent with the calculated diffusion coefficients of oxygen and
observation by QENS experiments. Our ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations
predict that macroscopic diffusion is attainable in (Bi0.7Y0.3)2O3 at much
lower temperatures, which is more suited for technological applications. Our
studies elucidate the easy directions of diffusion in {\delta}-Bi2O3 and
(Bi0.7Y0.3)2O3.

two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) is demonstrated by using a novel planar
back-gate approach based on ion implantation. This technique overcomes some
common problems of the traditional design like the poor 2DEG mobility and
leakage currents between the gate and the quantum well. Both bilayers with and
without separate contacts have been prepared and tested. Tuning the electron
density in one layer while keeping the second 2DEG at fixed density, one
observes a dramatic increase of the carrier concentration. This tunneling
resonance, which occurs at equal densities of both layers, demonstrates the
separated contacts to each individual layer. In another sample with a smaller
tunneling barrier and parallel contacted 2DEGs, the transition from a single
2DEG to a bilayer system is investigated at 50 mK in magnetic fields up to 12
T, showing the gate stability in high magnetic fields and very low
temperatures. Transitions into an insulating (Wigner crystal) phase are
observed in the individual layers in high fields at filling factors below 1/3.
The absence of a fractional quantum Hall liquid at filling factor 1/5 in our
structure seems to be a consequence of confining the electrons in quantum wells
rather than at interfaces. The observed metal-insulator transitions appear to
be nearly unaffected by the presence of the second layer separated by a barrier
which is only 3 nm thick. We believe that this planar back-gate design holds
great promise to produce controllable bilayers suitable to investigate the
exotic (non-abelian) properties of correlated states.

and transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable interest due
to their unique physical properties. A range of physical effects can be
transferred to the realms of photonics by creating artificial photonic lattices
emulating these two-dimensional materials. Here, exciton-polaritons in
semiconductor microcavities offer an exciting opportunity to study a
part-light, part-matter quantum fluid of light in a complex lattice potential.
In this paper, we study exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice of
buried optical traps. The $S$ and $P_{xy}$ photonic orbitals of such a Lieb
lattice give rise to the formation of two flatbands which are of greatest
interest for the distortion-free storage of compact localized states. By using
a well controlled etch-and-overgrowth technique, we manage to control the
trapping as well as the site couplings with great precision. This allows us to
spectroscopically monitor the flatness of the flatbands across the full
Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that these flatbands
can be directly populated by condensation under non-resonant laser excitation.
Finally, using this advanced device approach we demonstrate resonant and
deterministic excitation of flatband modes in transmission geometry. Our
findings establish the exciton-polariton systems as a highly controllable,
optical many-body system to study flatband effects and for distortion-free
storage of compact localized states.

keyphrase extraction is able to facilitate the management, categorization, and

are three approaches to address keyphrase extraction: (i) traditional two-step
ranking method, (ii) sequence labeling and (iii) generation using neural
networks. Two-step ranking approach is based on feature engineering, which is
labor intensive and domain dependent. Sequence labeling is not able to tackle
overlapping phrases. Generation methods (i.e., Sequence-to-sequence neural

and gain state-of-the-art performance. However, generation methods can not

Span Keyphrase Extraction model that extracts span-based feature representation
of keyphrase directly from all the content tokens. In this way, our model
obtains representation for each keyphrase and further learns to capture the

In addition, with the help of tokens, our model is able to extract overlapped

importance of different groups of features to model handwriting deficits that
appear due to Parkinson's disease; and how those features are able to
discriminate between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy subjects.
  Methods: Features based on kinematic, geometrical and non-linear dynamics
analyses were evaluated to classify Parkinson's disease and healthy subjects.
Classifiers based on K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random
forest were considered.
  Results: Accuracies of up to $93.1\%$ were obtained in the classification of
patients and healthy control subjects. A relevance analysis of the features
indicated that those related to speed, acceleration, and pressure are the most
discriminant. The automatic classification of patients in different stages of
the disease shows $\kappa$ indexes between $0.36$ and $0.44$. Accuracies of up

  Conclusions: The results confirmed the negative impact of aging in the

  (GECCO '20)",,,,"cs.NE cs.DM math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is imperative for testing to determine if the components within
large-scale software systems operate functionally. Interaction testing involves
designing a suite of tests, which guarantees to detect a fault if one exists
among a small number of components interacting together. The cost of this
testing is typically modeled by the number of tests, and thus much effort has
been taken in reducing this number. Here, we incorporate redundancy into the
model, which allows for testing in non-deterministic environments. Existing
algorithms for constructing these test suites usually involve one ""fast""
algorithm for generating most of the tests, and another ""slower"" algorithm to
""complete"" the test suite. We employ a genetic algorithm that generalizes these
approaches that also incorporates redundancy by increasing the number of
algorithms chosen, which we call ""stages."" By increasing the number of stages,
we show that not only can the number of tests be reduced compared to existing
techniques, but the computational time in generating them is also greatly
reduced.

along with their spatial trajectories during their lifetime, whether through
continuous-time observations or discrete-time observations. Natural
applications include epidemiology, individual-based modelling in ecology,
spatio-temporal dynamics observed in bio-imaging, and computer vision. The aim
of this article is to estimate in this context the birth and death intensity
functions, that depend in full generality on the current spatial configuration
of all alive individuals. While the temporal evolution of the population size
is a simple birth-death process, observing the lifetime and trajectories of all
individuals calls for a new paradigm. To formalise this framework, we introduce
spatial birth-death-move processes, where the birth and death dynamics depends
on the current spatial configuration of the population and where individuals
can move during their lifetime according to a continuous Markov process with
possible interactions.We consider non-parametric kernel estimators of their
birth and death intensity functions. The setting is original because each
observation in time belongs to a non-vectorial, infinite dimensional space and
the dependence between observations is barely tractable. We prove the
consistency of the estimators in presence of continuous-time and discrete-time
observations, under fairly simple conditions. We moreover discuss how we can
take advantage in practice of structural assumptions made on the intensity
functions and we explain how data-driven bandwidth selection can be conducted,
despite the unknown (and sometimes undefined) second order moments of the
estimators. We finally apply our statistical method to the analysis of the
spatio-temporal dynamics of proteins involved in exocytosis in cells, providing
new insights on this complex mechanism.

mechanisms and yields a subdiffusive regime. Here we extend the comb-model to
simultaneously account for quenched and annealed disorder mechanisms. To do so,
we replace usual derivatives in the comb diffusion equation by different
fractional time-derivative operators and the conventional comb-like structure
by a generalized fractal structure. Our hybrid comb-models thus represent a
diffusion where different comb-like structures describe different quenched
disorder mechanisms, and the fractional operators account for various annealed
disorders mechanisms. We find exact solutions for the diffusion propagator and
mean square displacement in terms of different memory kernels used for defining

mechanisms that could cause this difference. Recent observational results seem
to indicate that the deceleration must be caused by the development of
small-scale instabilities that force mixing at the jet boundary. According to
these results, the mixing layer expands and propagates down to the jet axis
along several kiloparsecs, until it covers the whole jet cross-section. Several
candidate mechanisms have been proposed as the initial trigger for the
generation of such mixing layer. However, the instabilities proposed so far do
not fully manage to explain the observations of FRI jets and/or require a
triggering mechanism. Therefore, there is not still a satisfactory explanation

periodically reverses in the course of the 11/22-year solar cycle. Among the
various processes that contribute to the removal of `old-polarity' toroidal
magnetic flux is the emergence of flux loops forming bipolar regions at the
solar surface. We quantify the loss of subsurface net toroidal flux by this
process. To this end, we determine the contribution of an individual emerging
bipolar loop and show that it is unaffected by surface flux transport after
emergence. Together with the linearity of the diffusion process this means that
the total flux loss can be obtained by adding the contributions of all emerging
bipolar magnetic regions. The resulting total loss rate of net toroidal flux
amounts to 1.3 X 10^{15} Mx/s during activity maxima and 6.1 X 10^{14} Mx/s
during activity minima, to which ephemeral regions contribute about 90% and
97%, respectively. This rate is consistent with the observationally inferred
loss rate of toroidal flux into interplanetary space and corresponds to a decay
time of the subsurface toroidal flux of about 12 years, also consistent with a
simple estimate based on turbulent diffusivity. Consequently, toroidal flux
loss by flux emergence is a relevant contribution to the budget of net toroidal
flux in the solar convection zone. That the toroidal flux loss rate due to flux
emergence is consistent with what is expected from turbulent diffusion, and
that the corresponding decay time is similar to the length of the solar cycle
are important constraints for understanding the solar cycle and the Sun's
internal dynamics.

fog radio access networks (FRANs) to alleviate the heavy burden on
capacity-limited fronthaul links and reduce delivery latency. In this paper, an
advanced minimal delay association policy is proposed to minimize latency while
guaranteeing spectral efficiency in F-RANs. By utilizing stochastic geometry
and queueing theory, closed-form expressions of successful delivery
probability, average ergodic rate, and average delivery latency are derived,
where both the traditional association policy based on accessing the base
station with maximal received power and the proposed minimal delay association
policy are concerned. Impacts of key operating parameters on the aforementioned
performance metrics are exploited. It is shown that the proposed association
policy has a better delivery latency than the traditional association policy.
Increasing the cache size of fog-computing based access points (F-APs) can more
significantly reduce average delivery latency, compared with increasing the
density of F-APs. Meanwhile, the latter comes at the expense of decreasing
average ergodic rate. This implies the deployment of large cache size at F-APs
rather than high density of F-APs can promote performance effectively in
F-RANs.

signs of Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics, even if new states are
somehow hidden. In particular, in models with extended Higgs sectors, it is
known that non-decouplings effects in BSM-scalar contributions at one loop can
cause $\lambda_{hhh}$ to deviate significantly from its SM prediction, raising
the question of what happens at two loops. We review here our calculation of
the leading two-loop corrections to $\lambda_{hhh}$ in an aligned scenario of a
Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. We find their typical size to be 10-20% of the
one-loop corrections, meaning that they do not modify significantly the

  Lengths",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Search patterns of randomly oriented steps of different lengths have been
observed on all scales of the biological world, ranging from the microscopic to
the ecological, including in protein motors, bacteria, T-cells, honeybees,
marine predators, and more. Through different models, it has been demonstrated
that adopting a variety in the magnitude of the step lengths can greatly
improve the search efficiency. However, the precise connection between the
search efficiency and the number of step lengths in the repertoire of the
searcher has not been identified. Motivated by biological examples in
one-dimensional terrains, a recent paper studied the best cover time on an
n-node cycle that can be achieved by a random walk process that uses k step
lengths. By tuning the lengths and corresponding probabilities the authors
therein showed that the best cover time is roughly n 1+$\Theta$(1/k). While
this bound is useful for large values of k, it is hardly informative for small
k values, which are of interest in biology. In this paper, we provide a tight
bound for the cover time of such a walk, for every integer k > 1. Specifically,
up to lower order polylogarithmic factors, the upper bound on the cover time is
a polynomial in n of exponent 1+ 1/(2k--1). For k = 2, 3, 4 and 5 the exponent
is thus 4/3 , 6/5 , 8/7 , and 10/9 , respectively. Informally, our result
implies that, as long as the number of step lengths k is not too large,
incorporating an additional step length to the repertoire of the process
enables to improve the cover time by a polynomial factor, but the extent of the
improvement gradually decreases with k.

paper proposes a methodology to analyse how the functional behaviour is
affected by Single-Event Transients in the clock distribution network. The
approach is based on logic-level simulation and thus, only uses the
register-transfer level description of a design. Therefore, a fault model is
proposed which implements the main effects due to radiation-induced transients

functional failure rate caused by Single-Event Transients for each individual
clock buffer, as well as the complete network. Further, it allows the
identification of the most vulnerable flip-flops related to Single-Event
Transients in the clock network.
  The proposed methodology is applied in a practical example and a fault

Single-Event Transients in clock distribution networks, the obtained functional
failure rate is compared to the error rate caused by Single-Event Upsets in the

pp-wave geometry of the non-supersymmetric Schrodinger background. That
solution exhibits an intriguing behavior as the deformation parameter of the
spacetime varies. Firstly, the degeneracy between the giant and the point
graviton is lifted for the benefit of the giant graviton as soon as the
deformation is turned on. Secondly, when the deformation parameter exceeds a
critical value the barrier separating the point from the giant graviton
disappears. This suggests that the mere presence of a D3-brane leads to the
spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance. We perform a detailed analysis of
the full bosonic spectrum, which reveals that the deformation induces a
coupling between the scalar and the gauge field fluctuations. It is exactly
this coupling that keeps the giant graviton free of tachyonic instabilities.
Furthermore, the giant graviton configuration completely breaks the
supersymmetry of the pp-wave background, as the Kappa-symmetry analysis
suggests.

low-frequency signals in a medium of polar molecules in a gas phase. The
physical mechanism of the signal generation relies on the permanent dipole
moment characterizing systems without inversion symmetry. The molecules are
polarized with a DC electric field yielding a permanent electric dipole moment
in the laboratory frame; the direction and magnitude of the moment depend on
the molecular state. As the system is resonantly driven, the dipole moment
oscillates at the Rabi frequency and, hence, generates microwave radiation. We
demonstrate the tuning capability of the output signal frequency with the drive
amplitude and detuning. We find that even though decoherence mechanisms such as
spontaneous emission may damp the output field, a scenario based on pulsed

prior work on individual fairness, we do not assume the similarity measure

fairness violations without enunciating the quantitative measure. In each
round, the auditor examines the learner's decisions and attempts to identify a
pair of individuals that are treated unfairly by the learner. We provide a
general reduction framework that reduces online classification in our model to
standard online classification, which allows us to leverage existing online
learning algorithms to achieve sub-linear regret and number of fairness

independently from a distribution, we are also able to establish PAC-style
fairness and accuracy generalization guarantees (Rothblum and Yona [2018]),

classical and intensively studied problem. However, in the single-pass
streaming model, where the elements arrive one by one and an algorithm can
store only a small fraction of input elements, there is much gap in our
knowledge, even though several approximation algorithms have been proposed in
the literature.
  In this work, we present the first lower bound on the approximation ratios
for cardinality and matroid constraints that beat $1-\frac{1}{e}$ in the
single-pass streaming model. Let $n$ be the number of elements in the stream.
Then, we prove that any (randomized) streaming algorithm for a cardinality
constraint with approximation ratio $\frac{2}{2+\sqrt{2}}+\varepsilon$ requires
$\Omega\left(\frac{n}{K^2}\right)$ space for any $\varepsilon>0$, where $K$ is
the size limit of the output set. We also prove that any (randomized) streaming
algorithm for a (partition) matroid constraint with approximation ratio
$\frac{K}{2K-1}+\varepsilon$ requires $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{K}\right)$ space
for any $\varepsilon>0$, where $K$ is the rank of the given matroid.
  In addition, we give streaming algorithms when we only have a weak oracle
with which we can only evaluate function values on feasible sets. Specifically,
we show weak-oracle streaming algorithms for cardinality and matroid
constraints with approximation ratios $\frac{K}{2K-1}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$,
respectively, whose space complexity is exponential in $K$ but is independent
of $n$. The former one exactly matches the known inapproximability result for a
cardinality constraint in the weak oracle model.
  The latter one almost matches our lower bound of $\frac{K}{2K-1}$ for a
matroid constraint, which almost settles the approximation ratio for a matroid
constraint that can be obtained by a streaming algorithm whose space complexity
is independent of $n$.

conditions throughout the observed outflows. Aims. The evolution of sulfur
chemistry is studied along the outflows driven by the NGC1333-IRAS4A
protobinary system located in the Perseus cloud to constrain the physical and
chemical processes at work in shocks. Methods. We observed various transitions
from OCS, CS, SO, and SO$_2$ towards NGC1333-IRAS4A in the 1.3, 2, and 3mm
bands using the IRAM NOEMA array and we interpreted the observations through
the use of the Paris-Durham shock model. Results. The targeted species clearly
show different spatial emission along the two outflows driven by IRAS4A. OCS is
brighter on small and large scales along the south outflow driven by IRAS4A1,
whereas SO$_2$ is detected rather along the outflow driven by IRAS4A2 that is
extended along the north east - south west (NE-SW) direction. Column density
ratio maps estimated from a rotational diagram analysis allowed us to confirm a
clear gradient of the OCS/SO$_2$ column density ratio between the IRAS4A1 and
IRAS4A2 outflows. SO is detected at extremely high radial velocity up to 25
km/s relative to the source velocity, clearly allowing us to distinguish the
two outflows on small scales. Conclusions. The observed chemical
differentiation between the two outflows of the IRAS4A system could be
explained by a different chemical history. The outflow driven by IRAS4A1 is
likely younger and more enriched in species initially formed in interstellar
ices, such as OCS, and recently sputtered into the shock gas. In contrast, the
longer and likely older outflow triggered by IRAS4A2 is more enriched in

exhibit a ground-state fermion parity that is $4\pi$-periodic in the

(QSH) insulator, we show how the thermodynamic cycle can be used to test the

parity-conserving and non-parity-conserving engines. Interestingly, we find
that parity conservation generally boosts both the efficiency and power of the
topological heat engine with respect to its non-topological counterpart. Our
results, applicable not only to QSH-based junctions but also to any topological
Josephson junction, demonstrate the potential of the intriguing and fruitful

synchronization takes place in cases involving almost identical dynamical
systems and it means that the phase difference between the systems is kept
bounded over the time, while their amplitudes remain chaotic and may be
uncorrelated. Instead of complete synchronization, phase synchronization is
believed to be a mechanism for neural integration in brain. In this paper, an
object selection model is proposed. Oscillators in the network representing the
salient object in a given scene are phase synchronized, while no phase
synchronization occurs for background objects. In this way, the salient object
can be extracted. In this model, a shift mechanism is also introduced to change

connected the dots between human behaviour in the offline and online worlds.
Consequently, researchers have exploited these new findings to create models
that better predict different aspects of human life and recommend future
behaviour. To date, however, we do not yet fully understand the similarities
and differences of human behaviour in these virtual and physical worlds. Here,
we analyse and discuss the mobility and application usage of 400,000
individuals over eight months. We find an astonishing similarity between
people's mobility in the physical space and how they move from app to app in
smartphones. Our data shows that individuals use and visit a finite number of
apps and places, but they keep exploring over time. In particular, two distinct
profiles of individuals emerge: those that keep changing places and services,
and those that are stable over time, named as ""explorers"" and ""keepers"". We see
these findings as crucial to enrich a discussion for the potentials and the
challenges of building human-centric AI systems, which might leverage recent
results in Computational Social Science.

sequential decision making and control tasks. However, a common problem is that
learned nearly optimal policy always overfits to the training environment and
may not be extended to situations never encountered during training. For
practical applications, the randomness of environment usually leads to some
devastating events, which should be the focus of safety-critical systems such
as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce the minimax formulation and
distributional framework to improve the generalization ability of RL algorithms
and develop the Minimax Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (Minimax DSAC)
algorithm. Minimax formulation aims to seek optimal policy considering the most
severe variations from environment, in which the protagonist policy maximizes
action-value function while the adversary policy tries to minimize it.
Distributional framework aims to learn a state-action return distribution, from
which we can model the risk of different returns explicitly, thereby
formulating a risk-averse protagonist policy and a risk-seeking adversarial
policy. We implement our method on the decision-making tasks of autonomous
vehicles at intersections and test the trained policy in distinct environments.
Results demonstrate that our method can greatly improve the generalization
ability of the protagonist agent to different environmental variations.

only two bands in the spin density wave. Therefore, their susceptibilities, as

spin-valley half-metal does not have rotational symmetry, thus, in general the
off-diagonal components of susceptibility tensor are non-zero. The spin density
wave obeys robust rotational symmetry and off-diagonal components of the

interstellar medium, astronomers have considered a variety of fractal models.
Here we argue that, to properly characterise a fractal model, one needs to
define precisely the algorithm used to generate the density field, and to
specify -- at least -- three parameters: one parameter constrains the spatial
structure of the field; one parameter constrains the density contrast between
structures on different scales; and one parameter constrains the dynamic range
of spatial scales over which self-similarity is expected (either due to
physical considerations, or due to the limitations of the observational or
numerical technique generating the input data). A realistic fractal field must
also be noisy and non-periodic. We illustrate this with the exponentiated
fractional Brownian motion (xfBm) algorithm, which is popular because it
delivers an approximately lognormal density field, and for which the three
parameters are, respectively, the power spectrum exponent, $\beta$, the
exponentiating factor, ${\cal S}$, and the dynamic range, ${\cal R}$. We then
explore and compare two approaches that might be used to estimate these
parameters: Machine Learning and the established $\Delta$-Variance procedure.
We show that for $2\leq\beta \leq 4$ and $0\leq{\cal S}\leq 3$, a suitably
trained Convolutional Neural Network is able to estimate objectively both
$\beta$ (with root-mean-square error $\epsilon_{_\beta}\sim 0.12$) and ${\cal
S}$ (with $\epsilon_{_{\cal S}}\sim 0.29$). $\;\Delta$-variance is also able to
estimate $\beta$, albeit with a somewhat larger error ($\epsilon_{_\beta}\sim
0.17$) and with some human intervention, but is not able to estimate ${\cal

transmit a certain amount of data with a transmission rate from a finite set of
discrete rate levels, using the energy initially available in its battery and
the energy it can harvest until the end of its transmission. Considering this
model, we propose a novel discrete rate based minimum length scheduling problem
to determine the optimal power control, rate adaptation and transmission
schedule subject to data, energy causality and maximum transmit power
constraints. The proposed optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard which
requires exponential-time algorithms to solve for the global optimum. As a
solution strategy, first, we demonstrate that the power control and rate
adaptation, and scheduling problems can be solved separately in the optimal

computed within Kubo linear response theory. By systematically studying their

Network (GNN) models. We transform the input images into region adjacency
graphs (RAGs), in which regions are superpixels and edges connect neighboring
superpixels. Our experiments suggest that Graph Attention Networks (GATs),
which combine graph convolutions with self-attention mechanisms, outperforms
other GNN models. Although raw image classifiers perform better than GATs due
to information loss during the RAG generation, our methodology opens an
interesting avenue of research on deep learning beyond rectangular-gridded
images, such as 360-degree field of view panoramas. Traditional convolutional
kernels of current state-of-the-art methods cannot handle panoramas, whereas
the adapted superpixel algorithms and the resulting region adjacency graphs can
naturally feed a GNN, without topology issues.

analyze it under strong convexity assumptions. Special cases of the algorithm
include SAGA, L-SVRG and their proximal variants. Our analysis sheds light on
epoch-length selection and the need to balance the convergence of the iterates
with how often gradients are stored. The analysis improves on other convergence
rates found in the literature and produces a new and faster converging sampling
strategy for SAGA. Problem instances for which the predicted rates are the same
as the practical rates are presented together with problems based on real world

orbital mixing: using both a toy model and a realistic multi-orbital

symmetry breaking enables the onset of interfacial orbital momentum that is at
the origin of the DMI. We then investigate the contribution of the different
layers to the DMI and reveal that it can expand over several nonmagnetic metal
layers depending on the Fermi energy, thereby revealing the complex orbital
texture of the band structure. Finally, we examine the thickness dependence of
DMI on both ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic metal thicknesses and we find that
whereas the former remains very weak, the latter can be substantial.

allows for the independent management of business logic and execution of access
control policies. It also facilitates secure, low cost, and a high degree of

decentralized governance of access control policies and efficient smart

this framework to benefit enterprise and non-enterprise dApps and provide

that in the latter case, the TWA is very accurate, becoming asymptotically
exact in the infinite-range limit, provided that the semiclassical Hamiltonian
is correctly identified. Within the TWA, different dynamical timescales of
charges and spins can be clearly distinguished. Interestingly, for a weak and
moderate disorder strength, we observe subdiffusive behavior of charges, while
spins exhibit diffusive dynamics. At strong disorder, the quantum Fisher
information shows logarithmic growth in time with a slower increase for charges
than for spins. It is shown that in contrast to the short-range model, strong
inhomogeneities such as domain walls in the initial state can significantly
slow down thermalization dynamics, especially at weak disorder. This behavior
can put additional challenges in designing cold-atom experimental protocols

networks on millimeter-wave bands present a significant challenge, considering
the necessity of constantly adjusting the beam directions. Conventional methods
are mostly based on classical control theory, e.g., Kalman filter and its
variations, which mainly deal with stationary scenarios. Therefore, severe
application limitations exist, especially with complicated, dynamic
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) channels. This paper gives a thorough study of this
subject, by first modifying the classical approaches, e.g., Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF), for non-stationary scenarios, and then
proposing a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach that can achieve the
URLLC requirements in a typical intersection scenario. Simulation results based
on a commercial ray-tracing simulator show that enhanced EKF and PF methods
achieve packet delay more than $10$ ms, whereas the proposed deep RL-based
method can reduce the latency to about $6$ ms, by extracting context
information from the training data.

the geometry-induced Berry phase encodes novel features for a broad class of

Previously considered passivation layers result in a large shift of the Dirac

strongly enhanced by the presence of a surface band near the Fermi level.

We study the optical properties of a system composed of all-dielectric

compare these dielectric arrays with metallic nanoparticle arrays. We tune the
light-matter interaction by changing the concentration in the dye film and
report the system to be in the strong coupling regime. We observe a Rabi
splitting between the surface lattice resonances (SLRs) of the nanoparticle
arrays and the absorption line of the dye molecules of up to 253 meV and 293

splitting depends linearly on the square root of the dye molecule concentration
, and we further assess how the Rabi splitting depends on the film thickness
for a low dye molecule concentration. For thinner films of thicknesses up to
260 nm, we observe no visible Rabi splitting. However, a Rabi splitting evolves

form p(x) \propto e^{-\beta f(x)} for some function f whose values and
gradients we can query. This mode of access to f is natural in the scenarios in
which such problems arise, for instance sampling from posteriors in parametric
Bayesian models. Classical results show that a natural random walk, Langevin
diffusion, mixes rapidly when f is convex. Unfortunately, even in simple
examples, the applications listed above will entail working with functions f
that are nonconvex -- for which sampling from p may in general require an
exponential number of queries.
  In this paper, we focus on an aspect of nonconvexity relevant for modern
machine learning applications: existence of invariances (symmetries) in the
function f, as a result of which the distribution p will have manifolds of
points with equal probability. First, we give a recipe for proving mixing time
bounds for Langevin diffusion as a function of the geometry of these manifolds.
Second, we specialize our arguments to classic matrix factorization-like
Bayesian inference problems where we get noisy measurements A(XX^T), X \in R^{d
\times k} of a low-rank matrix, i.e. f(X) = \|A(XX^T) - b\|^2_2, X \in R^{d

are invariant under orthogonal transformations, and include problems like
matrix factorization, sensing, completion. Beyond sampling, Langevin dynamics
is a popular toy model for studying stochastic gradient descent. Along these
lines, we believe that our work is an important first step towards
understanding how SGD behaves when there is a high degree of symmetry in the
space of parameters the produce the same output.

and the Euclidean distance between $u$ and $v$ is small. The maximum such

  First, we show that deciding whether a graph admits a straight-line drawing
with spanning ratio $1$, a proper straight-line drawing with spanning ratio
$1$, and a planar straight-line drawing with spanning ratio $1$ are
NP-complete, $\exists \mathbb R$-complete, and linear-time solvable problems,
respectively, where a drawing is proper if no two vertices overlap and no edge
overlaps a vertex.
  Second, we show that moving from spanning ratio $1$ to spanning ratio
$1+\epsilon$ allows us to draw every graph. Namely, we prove that, for every
$\epsilon>0$, every (planar) graph admits a proper (resp. planar) straight-line
drawing with spanning ratio smaller than $1+\epsilon$.
  Third, our drawings with spanning ratio smaller than $1+\epsilon$ have large

great potential in a variety of situations, such as fast motion and low
illumination scenes. However, most of the event-based object tracking methods
are designed for scenarios with untextured objects and uncluttered backgrounds.
There are few event-based object tracking methods that support bounding
box-based object tracking. The main idea behind this work is to propose an
asynchronous Event-based Tracking-by-Detection (ETD) method for generic
bounding box-based object tracking. To achieve this goal, we present an
Adaptive Time-Surface with Linear Time Decay (ATSLTD) event-to-frame conversion
algorithm, which asynchronously and effectively warps the spatio-temporal
information of asynchronous retinal events to a sequence of ATSLTD frames with
clear object contours. We feed the sequence of ATSLTD frames to the proposed
ETD method to perform accurate and efficient object tracking, which leverages
the high temporal resolution property of event cameras. We compare the proposed
ETD method with seven popular object tracking methods, that are based on
conventional cameras or event cameras, and two variants of ETD. The
experimental results show the superiority of the proposed ETD method in
handling various challenging environments.

characterize the protostellar accretion phase in W43-MM1. The W43-MM1
protocluster host a sufficient number of protostars to statistically
investigate molecular outflows in a single, homogeneous region. We used the
CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) line datacubes, taken as part of an ALMA mosaic with a
2000 AU resolution, to search for protostellar outflows, evaluate the influence
that the environment has on these outflows' characteristics and put constraints
on outflow variability in W43-MM1. We discovered a rich cluster of 46 outflow
lobes, driven by 27 protostars with masses of 1-100 Msun. The complex
environment inside which these outflow lobes develop has a definite influence
on their length, limiting the validity of using outflows' dynamical timescales
as a proxy of the ejection timescale in clouds with high dynamics and varying
conditions. We performed a detailed study of Position-Velocity (PV) diagrams of
outflows that revealed clear events of episodic ejection. The time variability
of W43-MM1 outflows is a general trend and is more generally observed than in
nearby, low- to intermediate-mass star-forming regions. The typical timescale
found between two ejecta, about 500 yr, is consistent with that found in nearby
protostars. If ejection episodicity reflects variability in the accretion
process, either protostellar accretion is more variable or episodicity is
easier to detect in high-mass star-forming regions than in nearby clouds. The
timescale found between accretion events could be resulting from disk
instabilities, associated with bursts of inflowing gas arising from the
dynamical environment of high-mass star-forming cores.

(mops). The classical domination problem is to minimize the size of a set $S$

of the Art Gallery Theorem, Chv\'{a}tal showed that the minimum size, called
the domination number of $G$ and denoted by $\gamma(G)$, is at most $n/3$ if
$G$ is a mop. Here we consider a modification by allowing $G - N[S]$ to have a
maximum degree of at most $k$. Let $\iota_k(G)$ denote the size of a smallest
set $S$ for which this is achieved. If $n \le 2k+3$, then trivially $\iota_k(G)
\leq 1$. Let $G$ be a mop on $n \ge \max\{5,2k+3\}$ vertices, $n_2$ of which
are of degree $2$. Upper bounds on $\iota_k(G)$ have been obtained for $k = 0$

$\iota_{k}(G) \le \min\{\frac{n}{k+4},\frac{n+n_2}{k+5},\frac{n-n_2}{k+2}\}$

argument presented yields that if an art gallery has exactly $n$ corners and at
least one of every $k + 2$ consecutive corners must be visible to at least one
guard, then the number of guards needed is at most $n/(k+4)$. We also prove
that $\gamma(G) \le \frac{n - n_2}{2}$ unless $n = 2n_2$, $n_2$ is odd, and
$\gamma(G) = \frac{n - n_2 + 1}{2}$. Together with the inequality $\gamma(G)
\le \frac{n+n_2}{4}$, obtained by Campos and Wakabayashi and independently by
Tokunaga, this improves Chv\'{a}tal's bound. The bounds are sharp.

a wireless power transfer (WPT) scenario between an energy transmitter (ET)
capable of retrodirective WPT and an energy receiver (ER) capable of ambient
backscatter in the presence of an ambient source (AS). The ER requests WPT by
backscattering signals from an AS towards the ET, which then retrodirectively
beamforms an energy signal towards the ER. To remove the inherent direct-link
ambient interference, we propose a scheme of ambient backscatter training.
Specifically, the ER varies the reflection coefficient multiple times while
backscattering each ambient symbol according to a certain pattern called the
training sequence, whose design criterion we also present. To evaluate the
system performance, we derive an analytical expression for the average
harvested power at the ER. Our numerical results show that with the proposed
scheme, the ER harvests tens of $\mu$W of power, without any CSI estimation or
active transmission from the ER, which is a significant improvement for
low-power and low-cost ambient backscatter devices.

deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be effective in modeling with

added to generate a pyramid squeeze-excitation CRNN. The pyramid

responsible for the breakup of nanowires with the diamond cubic crystal
structure into a chain of nanoparticles discovered in preceding experiments on
Silicon nanowires. We show that this process is based on the well-known
mechanism of roughening transition, which specifically manifests itself in
quasi-one-dimensional systems/nanowires with a pronounced anisotropy of the
surface energy density. Depending on the temperature and orientation of the
nanowire relative to its internal crystal structure, the wavelengths of
substantial cross-sectional modulations exceed its initial radius by 4 to 18
times. For certain orientations, a straight nanowire at the initial stage of
evolution forms a serpentine/helical structure. The scenarios of the stage of
nanowire ruptures into single nanoclusters are also diverse: either each
spindle-shaped region of the nanowire transforms into a separate drop (by
long-wave surface perturbations), or the adjacent short-scale beads absorb each
other due to the Ostwald ripening effect, which can be accompanied by the
formation of long-lived many-body dumbbells. The discovered features of the
dynamics of quasi-onedimensional systems expand our conceptions of the physical
mechanisms involved in the breakup of nanowires (presented by Nichols and
Mullins as a classical model for such instabilities) which could be useful in
applications based on chains of ordered nanoparticles.

the automatic identification of damage-sensitive features from data acquired
through pervasive sensor systems. Damage detection and localization are
formulated as classification problems, and tackled through Fully Convolutional
Networks (FCNs). A supervised training of the proposed network architecture is
performed on data extracted from numerical simulations of a physics-based model
(playing the role of digital twin of the structure to be monitored) accounting
for different damage scenarios. By relying on this simplified model of the
structure, several load conditions are considered during the training phase of
the FCN, whose architecture has been designed to deal with time series of
different length. The training of the neural network is done before the
monitoring system starts operating, thus enabling a real time damage
classification. The numerical performances of the proposed strategy are
assessed on a numerical benchmark case consisting of an eight-story shear
building subjected to two load types, one of which modeling random vibrations
due to low-energy seismicity. Measurement noise has been added to the responses
of the structure to mimic the outputs of a real monitoring system. Extremely
good classification capacities are shown: among the nine possible alternatives
(represented by the healthy state and by a damage at any floor), damage is
correctly classified in up to 95% of cases, thus showing the strong potential
of the proposed approach in view of the application to real-life cases.

visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the
images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal
(THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there
is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding.
However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack
of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to
transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available
GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise
losses (like $L_1$ or $L_2$) as the objective function for training. The
quality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still
not up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective
functions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the
transformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called
Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is
introduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the
perceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the
adversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to
judge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR
scene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image
transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in

polynomial-time algorithms which \emph{always} find a solution for an arbitrary

findings. We apply the model to screening mammography interpretation:
predicting the presence or absence of benign and malignant lesions. On the NYU

our model achieves an AUC of 0.93 in classifying breasts with malignant

Thus, chaotic itinerancy is a topic of great interest, particularly for

LIGO/Virgo are correlated with a narrow dispersion that appears to increase in
proportion to mass. The mean binary mass ratio $1.45\pm0.07$ we show is
consistent with pairs drawn randomly from the mass distribution of black holes
in our Galaxy. However, BBH masses are concentrated around $\simeq 30M_\odot$,
whereas black holes in our Galaxy peak at $\simeq 10M_\odot$. This mass
difference can be reconciled by gravitational lensing magnification which
allows distant events to be detected with typically $z\simeq 2$, so the
waveform is reduced in frequency by $1+z$, and hence the measured chirp masses
appear 3 times larger than their intrinsic values. This redshift enhancement
also accounts for the dispersion of primary and secondary masses, both of which
should increase as $1+z$, thereby appearing to scale with mass, in agreement
with the data. Thus the BBH component masses provide independent support for
lensing, implying most high chirp mass events have intrinsic masses like the
stellar mass black holes in our Galaxy, coalescing at $z>1$, with only two low
mass BBH detections, of $\simeq 10M_\odot$ as expected for unlensed events in
the local Universe, $z\simeq 0.1$. This lensing solution requires a rapidly
declining BBH event rate below $z<1$, which together with the observed absence
of BBH spin suggests most events originate within young globular clusters at
$z>1$, via efficient binary capture of stellar mass black holes with randomly

fortunate combination of new astrophysics technologies with new, high capacity,

materials and also show the details of possession, its relation to the book,
the identity of the collectors and their social status and wealth, amongst
others. Asian collectors have typically used artistic ancient characters rather
than modern ones to make their seals. In addition to the owner's name, several
other words are used to express more profound meanings. A system that
automatically recognizes these characters can help enthusiasts and
professionals better understand the background information of these seals.
However, there is a lack of training data and labelled images, as samples of
some seals are scarce and most of them are degraded images. It is necessary to
find new ways to make full use of such scarce data. While these data are
available online, they do not contain information on the characters'position.
The goal of this research is to provide retrieval tools assist in obtaining
more information from Asian collector's seals imprints without consuming a lot
of computational resources. In this paper, a character segmentation method is
proposed to predict the candidate characters'area without any labelled training
data that contain character coordinate information. A retrieval-based
recognition system that focuses on a single character is also proposed to
support seal retrieval and matching. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed character segmentation method performs well on Asian collector's
seals, with 92% of the test data being correctly segmented.

  Coverage Analysis",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Privacy policies are legal documents that describe how a website will
collect, use, and distribute a user's data. Unfortunately, such documents are
often overly complicated and filled with legal jargon; making it difficult for
users to fully grasp what exactly is being collected and why. Our solution to
this problem is to provide users with a coverage analysis of a given website's
privacy policy using a wide range of classical machine learning and deep
learning techniques. Given a website's privacy policy, the classifier
identifies the associated data practice for each logical segment. These data
practices/labels are taken directly from the OPP-115 corpus. For example, the
data practice ""Data Retention"" refers to how long a website stores a user's
information. The coverage analysis allows users to determine how many of the
ten possible data practices are covered, along with identifying the sections
that correspond to the data practices of particular interest.

accretion from the circumstellar disk to the central star. One group of young
stellar objects, the FU Orionis-type stars exhibit accretion rate peaks
accompanied by bright eruptions. The occurrence of these outbursts might solve
the luminosity problem of protostars, play a key role in accumulating the final
star mass, and have a significant effect on the parameters of the envelope and
the disk. In the framework of the Structured Accretion Disks ERC project, we
are conducting a systematic investigation of these sources with millimeter
interferometry to examine whether they represent normal young stars in
exceptional times or they are unusual objects. Our results show that FU
Orionis-type stars can be similar to both Class I and Class II systems and may
be in a special evolutionary phase between the two classes with their
infall-driven episodic eruptions being the main driving force of the
transition.
