fluctuations from lattice QCD, we construct mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis,
hyper-skewness and hyper-kurtosis of net-baryon number distributions for small
baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B$. For the strangeness neutral case
($\mu_S=0$) at fixed ratio of electric charge to baryon number density
($\frac{n_Q}{n_B}=0.4$), which is appropriate for a comparison with heavy ion
collisions, we present results for $\kappa_B \sigma_B^2$, $S_B \sigma_B^3/M_B$,
$\kappa^{H}_{B}\sigma_{B}^4$ and $S^{H}_{B}\sigma^5_{B}/M_{B}$ on the crossover
line for the chiral transition, $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$. Continuum extrapolations for
this pseudo-critical transition line have recently been reported by HotQCD up
to baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\simeq 300$ MeV [arXiv:1812.08235]. These
cumulant ratios are of direct relevance for comparisons with corresponding
ratios measured by STAR in the BES-I and II runs at beam energies
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}\ge 20$ GeV. In particular, we point out that recent high
statistics results on skewness and kurtosis of net-baryon number distributions
obtained by STAR at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV put strong constraints on
freeze-out parameters and are consistent with predictions from thermal QCD.

quantum information field with both fundamental and practical applications.
However, it is generally challenging to find Bell inequalities with
self-testing property for multipartite states and actually there are not many
known candidates. In this work, we propose a systematical framework to
construct Bell inequalities from stabilizers which are maximally violated by
general stabilizer states, with two observables for each local party. We show
that the constructed Bell inequalities can self-test any stabilizer state which
is essentially device-independent, if and only if these stabilizers can
uniquely determine the state in a device-dependent manner. This bridges the gap
between device-independent and device-dependent verification methods. Our
framework can provide plenty of Bell inequalities for self-testing stabilizer
states. Among them, we give two families of Bell inequalities with different
advantages: (1) a family of Bell inequalities with a constant ratio of quantum
and classical bounds using 2N correlations, (2) Single pair inequalities
improving on all previous robustness self-testing bounds using N+1
correlations, which are both efficient and suitable for realizations in
multipartite systems. Our framework can not only inspire more fruitful
multipartite Bell inequalities from conventional verification methods, but also
pave the way for their practical applications.

cosmological crucial for molecule formation as dust plays a major role by
cooling low-metallicity star-forming clouds which can fragment to create lower

uncertainty within stellar evolution, with drastic implications for the
thermally-pulsing stars on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Various sources
are taken as motivation for the incorporation of convective boundary mixing
during this phase, from s-process nucleosynthesis to hydrodynamical models. In
spite of the considerable evidence in favour of the existence of convective
boundary mixing on the pre-AGB evolution, this mixing is not universally
included in models of TP-AGB stars. The aim of this investigation is to
ascertain the extent of convective boundary mixing, which is compatible with
observations when considering full evolutionary models. Additionally, we
investigate a theoretical argument that has been made that momentum-driven
overshooting at the base of the pulse-driven convection zone should be
negligible. We show that, while the argument holds,estimations based on the
picture of turbulent entrainment suggest that mixing is possible at both
convective boundaries. We demonstrate that additional mixing at convective
boundaries during core-burning phases prior to the thermally-pulsing Asymptotic
Giant Branch has an impact on the later evolution, changing the mass range at
which the third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning occur, and thus also the final
surface composition. In addition, an effort has been made to constrain the
efficiency of convective boundary mixing at the different convective
boundaries, using observational constraints. Our study suggests a strong
tension between different constraints that makes it impossible to reproduce all
observables simultaneously within the framework of an exponentially decaying
overshooting. This result calls for a reassessment of both the models of
convective boundary mixing and the observational constraints.

difficult, but on balance we find that modest amounts of annotated data (less

our models into an end-to-end cloud platform that provides both an easy-to-use
annotation interface as well as an inference interface that allows users to
upload documents and inspect model outputs.

have reliable results two different approaches are used: the first one is based
on a least-squares analysis to fit the lepton masses and the mixing parameters
to their corresponding experimental values, for this case the best fit for the
lightest neutrino mass is $(3.9\pm^{0.6}_{0.8})\times 10^{-3}$ eV.; the second
approach is just algebraic, based on the weak basis transformation method, in

and the restrictions coming from the five texture zeros of the mass matrices is
equal to $(3.5\pm0.9)\times 10^{-3}$ eV.

optimisation in batch settings in which the black-box function can be evaluated

exploitative fashion on the mean prediction, or -- with probability $\epsilon$

densely sampled in regions where the function is changing rapidly and in
locations predicted to be good (i.e close to predicted optima), with more
scattered samples in regions where the function is flatter and/or of poorer

approach is adopted to simulate the dynamics of spheres and cylinders under the
influence of short-and long-range fluctuating hydrodynamic interactions with

$\it{O(N)}$ parallel finite element algorithm is used, thereby allowing
simulations at high concentrations, while a Chebyshev polynomial approximation

concentration-dependent anomalous diffusion is observed for suspended
particles. It is found that introducing cylinders in a background of spheres,
i.e. particles with a simple degree of anisotropy, has a pronounced influence
on the structure and dynamics of the particles. First, increasing the fraction
of cylinders induces a particle segregation effect, where spheres are pushed
towards the wall and cylinders remain near the center of the cavity. This
segregation leads to lower mobility for the spheres relative to that
encountered in a system of pure spheres at the same volume fraction. Second,
the diffusive-to-anomalous transition and the degree of anomaly--quantified by
the power-law exponent in the mean square displacement vs. time relation-both
increase as the fraction of cylinders becomes larger. These findings are of

$\epsilon$-nets on the instance space whose prunings correspond to different
""locality profiles"" for the problem at hand. Using a technique based on tree
experts, we simultaneously and efficiently compete against all such prunings,
and prove regret bounds each scaling with a quantity associated with a
different type of local regularity. When competing against ""simple"" locality
profiles, our technique delivers regret bounds that are significantly better
than those proven using the previous approach. On the other hand, the time
dependence of our bounds is not worse than that obtained by ignoring any local
regularities.

(TRAC) method permits fast and accurate numerical solutions of the
field-aligned hydrodynamic equations, capturing the enthalpy exchange between
the corona and transition region, when the corona undergoes impulsive heating.
The TRAC method eliminates the need for highly resolved numerical grids in the
transition region and the commensurate very short time steps that are required
for numerical stability. When employed with coarse spatial resolutions,
typically achieved in multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic codes, the errors
at peak density are less than 5% and the computation time is three orders of
magnitude faster than fully resolved field-aligned models. This paper presents
further examples that demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the method
over a range of heating events, including impulsive and quasi-steady footpoint
heating. A detailed analytical assessment of the TRAC method is also presented,
showing that the approach works through all phases of an impulsive heating
event because (i) the total radiative losses and (ii) the total heating when
integrated over the transition region are both preserved at all temperatures
under the broadening modifications of the method. The results from the
numerical simulations complement this conclusion.

oil recovery and groundwater remediation. As the fluid navigates the tortuous
pore space, elastic stresses build up, causing the flow to become unstable at
sufficiently large injection rates. However, it is poorly understood how the
spatial and temporal characteristics of this unstable flow depend on pore space
geometry. We elucidate this dependence by systematically varying the spacing
between pore constrictions in a model porous medium. We find that when the pore
spacing is large, unstable eddies form upstream of each pore, similar to
observations of an isolated pore. By contrast, when the pore spacing is
sufficiently small, the flow exhibits a surprising bistability, stochastically
switching between two distinct unstable flow states. We hypothesize that this
unusual behavior arises from the interplay between flow-induced polymer
elongation and relaxation of polymers as they are advected through the porous
medium. Consistent with this idea, we find that the flow state in a given pore
persists for long times. Moreover, we find that the flow state is correlated
between neighboring pores; however, these correlations do not persist
long-range. Our results thus help to elucidate the rich array of flow behaviors
that can arise in polymer solution flow through porous media.

provides a marked improvement, capturing the broadband features of the
absorption spectrum (not present in NZ and TCL implementations). We attribute
this difference to the effect of the Markov approximation, and particularly its
unsuitability in pulsed excitation regime. Even the CWE adaptation, however,
breaks down in the regime of high temperature ($50K$) and strong exciton-cavity
coupling ($g \gtrsim 0.2$ meV). The TD solution is of comparable computational
complexity to the above-mentioned master equation approaches, yet remains
accurate at higher temperatures and across a broad range of exciton-cavity
coupling strengths (at least up to $g=1.5$ meV).

interest as a candidate distributed privacy framework with trust assumptions
better than the central model but with achievable errors smaller than the local
model. We study pure differentially private (DP) protocols in the shuffled
model for summation, a basic and widely used primitive:
  - For binary summation where each of n users holds a bit as an input, we give
a pure $\epsilon$-DP protocol for estimating the number of ones held by the
users up to an error of $O_\epsilon(1)$, and each user sends $O_\epsilon(\log
n)$ messages each of 1 bit. This is the first pure protocol in the shuffled
model with error $o(\sqrt{n})$ for constant $\epsilon$.
  Using this protocol, we give a pure $\epsilon$-DP protocol that performs
summation of real numbers in $[0, 1]$ up to an error of $O_{\epsilon}(1)$, and
where each user sends $O_{\epsilon}(\log^3 n)$ messages each of $O(\log\log n)$
bits.
  - In contrast, we show that for any pure $\epsilon$-DP protocol for binary
summation in the shuffled model having absolute error $n^{0.5-\Omega(1)}$, the
per user communication has to be at least $\Omega_{\epsilon}(\sqrt{\log n})$
bits. This implies the first separation between the (bounded-communication)
multi-message shuffled model and the central model, and the first separation
between pure and approximate DP protocols in the shuffled model.
  To prove our lower bound, we consider (a generalization of) the following
question: given $\gamma$ in $(0, 1)$, what is the smallest m for which there
are two random variables $X^0, X^1$ supported on $\{0, \dots ,m\}$ such that
(i) the total variation distance between $X^0$ and $X^1$ is at least

structure, the pass transistor logic (PTL) family reduces the number of
transistors required to perform logic functions, thereby reducing both area and
power consumption. However, this logic family requires inter-stage inverters to
ensure signal integrity in cascaded logic circuits, and inverters must be used
to provide each logical input signal in its complementary form. These inverters
and complementary signals increase the device count and significantly degrade
overall system efficiency.
  Dual-gate ambipolar field-effect transistors natively provide a
single-transistor XNOR operation and permit highly-efficient and compact
circuits due to their ambipolar capabilities. Similar to PTL, logic circuits
based on ambipolar field-effect transistors require complementary signals.
Therefore, numerous inverters are required, with significant energy and area
costs.
  Ambipolar field-effect transistors are a natural match for PTL, as hybrid
ambipolar-PTL circuits can simultaneously use these inverters to satisfy their
necessity in both PTL and ambipolar circuits. We therefore propose a new hybrid
ambipolar-PTL logic family that exploits the compact logic of PTL and the
ambipolar capabilities of ambipolar field-effect transistors. Novel hybrid
ambipolar-PTL circuits were designed and simulated in SPICE, demonstrating
strong signal integrity along with the efficiency advantages of using the
required inverters to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of PTL and
ambipolar circuits. In comparison to the ambipolar field-effect transistors in
the conventional CMOS logic structure, our hybrid full adder circuit can reduce
propagation delay by 47%, energy consumption by 88%, energy-delay product by a
factor of 9, and area-energy-delay product by a factor of 20.

ecosystem and are the main mechanism through which low-mass galaxies regulate
their star formation. These winds are generally observed to be multi-phase with
detections of entrained neutral and molecular gas. They are also thought to
enrich the circum-galactic medium around galaxies with metals and dust. This
ejected dust encodes information about the integrated star formation and
outflow history of the galaxy. It is therefore, important to understand how
much dust is entrained and driven out of the disc by galactic winds. Here we
demonstrate that stellar feedback is efficient in driving dust-enriched winds
and eject enough material to account for the amount of extraplanar dust
observed in nearby galaxies. The amount of dust in the wind depends on the
sites from where they are launched, with dustier galaxies launching more dust
enriched outflows. Moreover, the outflowing cold-dense gas is significantly
more dust-enriched than the volume filling hot tenuous material, naturally
reproducing the complex multiphase structure of the outflowing wind observed in
nearby galaxies. These results provide an important new insight into the
dynamics, structure, and composition of galactic winds and their role in
determining the dust content of the extragalactic gas in galaxies.

cosmological analysis. However, their power is limited by astrophysical
systematics that bias mass estimates and introduce additional scatter.
Turbulence injected into the intracluster medium via mass assembly contributes
substantially to cluster non-thermal pressure support, a significant source of
such uncertainties. We use an analytical model to compute the assembly-driven
non-thermal pressure profiles of haloes based on Monte Carlo-generated
accretion histories. We introduce a fitting function for the average
non-thermal pressure fraction profile, which exhibits minimal dependence on
redshift at fixed peak height. Using the model, we predict deviations from
self-similarity and the intrinsic scatter in the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect
observable-mass scaling relation ($Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$) due solely to
inter-cluster variation in mass accretion histories. We study the dependence of
$Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$ on aperture radius, cosmology, redshift, and mass limit. The
model predicts $5-9\%$ scatter in $Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$ at $z=0$, increasing as the
aperture used to compute $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$ increases from $R_\mathrm{500c}$ to
$5R_\mathrm{500c}$. The predicted scatter lies slightly below that of studies
based on non-radiative hydro-simulations, illustrating that assembly history
variance is likely responsible for a substantial fraction of scatter in
$Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$. This should be regarded as a lower bound, which will likely
increase with the use of an updated gas density model that incorporates a more
realistic response to halo assembly. As redshift increases, $Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$
deviates more from self-similarity and scatter increases. We show that the
$Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$ residuals correlate strongly with the recent halo mass
accretion rate, potentially providing an opportunity to infer the latter.

exponential effect on computation time and memory footprint. In this work, we
implement new randomized protocols that find very high quality contraction
paths for arbitrary and large tensor networks. We test our methods on a variety
of benchmarks, including the random quantum circuit instances recently
implemented on Google quantum chips. We find that the paths obtained can be
very close to optimal, and often many orders or magnitude better than the most
established approaches. As different underlying geometries suit different
methods, we also introduce a hyper-optimization approach, where both the method
applied and its algorithmic parameters are tuned during the path finding. The
increase in quality of contraction schemes found has significant practical
implications for the simulation of quantum many-body systems and particularly
for the benchmarking of new quantum chips. Concretely, we estimate a speed-up

  Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence","Submitted, comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.SR nucl-th physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nuclear burning plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical stellar
transients, including thermonuclear, pair instability, and core collapse
supernovae, as well as kilonovae and collapsars. Turbulence is now understood
to also play a key role in these astrophysical transients. Here we demonstrate
that turbulent nuclear burning may lead to large enhancements above the uniform
background burning rate, since turbulent dissipation gives rise to temperature
fluctuations, and in general the nuclear burning rates are highly sensitive to
temperature. We derive results for the turbulent enhancement of the nuclear
burning rate under the influence of strong turbulence in the distributed
burning regime in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, using probability
distribution function (PDF) methods. We demonstrate that the turbulent
enhancement obeys a universal scaling law in the limit of weak turbulence. We
further demonstrate that, for a wide range of key nuclear reactions, such as
C$^{12}$(O$^{16}$, $\alpha$)Mg$^{24}$ and triple-$\alpha$, even relatively
modest temperature fluctuations, of the order ten percent, can lead to
enhancements of 1 - 3 orders of magnitude in the turbulent nuclear burning
rate. We verify the predicted turbulent enhancement directly against numerical
simulations, and find very good agreement. We also present an estimation for
the onset of turbulent detonation initiation, and discuss implications of our
results for the modeling of stellar transients.

background subtraction, and handling outliers and other systematics. For
tentative candidate lenses, we identify a signature based on an anomalous

quasi-spiral structure, accentuated by tangential discontinuities known as cold
fronts (CFs). These discontinuities are thought to isolate between low-entropy,
high-metallicity gas inside (i.e., below) the CF that was lifted from the
center of the cluster by some radial factor $f_i$, and high-entropy,
low-metallicity gas outside the CF that was pushed inward by a factor $f_o$. We
find broad support for such a picture, by comparing the entropy and metallicity
discontinuities with the respective azimuthal averages, using newly deprojected
thermal profiles in clusters A2029, A2142, A2204 and Centaurus, supplemented by
deprojected CFs from the literature. In particular, the mean advection factors
$f_K$ and $f_Z$, inferred respectively from entropy and metallicity, strongly
correlate ($\mathcal{R}=0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) with each other, consistent with
large-scale advection. However, unlike sloshing simulations, in which the
inside/outside phases are an inflow/outflow settling back to equilibrium after
a violent perturbation, our results are more consistent with an outflow/inflow,
with the fast, Mach $\mathcal{M}_i\sim0.8$ gas inside the CF being a rapidly
heated or mixed outflow, probably originating from the cD galaxy, and gas
outside the CF being a $\mathcal{M}_o\sim0.03$, slowly-cooling inflow. In
particular, entropy indicates an outside advection factor $f_{Ko}\simeq
1.33\pm0.04$ that is approximately constant in all CFs, gauging the distance
traversed by inflowing gas within a cooling time. In contrast, $1.1\lesssim
f_{Ki}\lesssim 2.5$ and $1\lesssim f_Z\lesssim 17$ vary considerably among
clusters, and strongly correlate ($3.1\sigma\text{-}4.2\sigma$) with the virial
mass, $f_{Ki}\propto M_{200}^{0.14\pm0.07}$ and $f_Z\propto

numbers: total stellar mass and half-light radius. The total mass of a galaxy,
however, is not a well-defined quantity, due to the finite depth of photometric
observations and the arbitrariness of the distinction between galaxy and
diffuse intra-group light. This limits our ability to make accurate comparisons
between models and observations. I wish to provide a more robust two-parameter
description of the stellar density distribution of elliptical galaxies, in
terms of quantities that can be measured unambiguously. I propose to use the
stellar mass enclosed within 10 kpc in projection, $M_{*,10}$, and the
mass-weighted stellar density slope within the same aperture, $\Gamma_{*,10}$,
for this purpose. I measured the distribution in $M_{*,10}$ and $\Gamma_{*,10}$
of a sample of elliptical galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the
Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, using photometry from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
survey. The pair of values of $(M_{*,10},\Gamma_{*,10})$ can be used to predict
the stellar density profile in the inner 10 kpc of a galaxy with better than
20% accuracy. Similarly, $M_{*,10}$ and $\Gamma_{*,10}$ can be combined to
obtain a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion at least as good as the stellar
mass fundamental plane. As a first application, I then compared the observed
$M_{*,10}-\Gamma_{*,10}$ relation of elliptical galaxies with that of similarly
selected galaxies in the EAGLE Reference simulation. Observed and simulated
galaxies match at $M_{*,10}=10^{11}M_\odot$, but the EAGLE
$M_{*,10}-\Gamma_{*,10}$ relation is shallower and has a larger intrinsic
scatter compared to observations. This new parameterisation of the stellar
density profile of massive elliptical galaxies provides a more robust way of
comparing results from different photometric surveys and from hydrodynamical

investigate how the formation and evolution of galaxies takes place in
Milgromian gravity (MOND), we present full hydrodynamical simulations with the
Phantom of Ramses (POR) code. These are the first-ever galaxy formation
simulations done in MOND with detailed hydrodynamics, including star formation,
stellar feedback, radiative transfer and supernovae. These models start from
simplified initial conditions, in the form of isolated, rotating gas spheres in
the early Universe. These collapse and form late-type galaxies obeying several
scaling relations, which was not a priori expected. The formed galaxies have a
compact bulge and a disk with exponentially decreasing surface mass density
profiles and scale lengths consistent with observed galaxies, and vertical
stellar mass distributions with distinct exponential profiles (thin and thick
disk). This work thus shows for the first time that disk galaxies with
exponential profiles in both gas and stars are a generic outcome of collapsing
gas clouds in MOND. These models have a slight lack of stellar angular momentum
because of their somewhat compact stellar bulge, which is connected to the
simple initial conditions and the negligible later gas accretion. We also
analyse how the addition of more complex baryonic physics changes the main
resulting properties of the models and find this to be negligibly so in the
Milgromian framework.

recently being overtaking. Smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of

predictions of the evolution of the dust grain size distribution. We compare
for the first time the evolution of the dust grain size distribution predicted

analyse how the radial distribution of the small to large grain mass ratio

M 33. We find good agreement between the observed radial distribution of
D(S)/D(L) and what is obtained from the SPH simulations of a single galaxy. The
central parts of NGC 628, at high metallicity and with a high molecular gas
fraction, are mainly affected not only by accretion but also by coagulation of
dust grains. The centre of M 33, having lower metallicity and lower molecular
gas fraction, presents an increase of D(S)/D(L), showing that shattering is
very effective in creating a large fraction of small grains. Observational
results provided by our galaxies confirm the general relations predicted by the
cosmological simulations based on the two grain size approximation. However, we
present evidence that the simulations could be overestimating the amount of
large grains in high massive galaxies.

high-significance event labelled S190814bv. Preliminary analysis of the GW data
suggests that the event was likely due to the merger of a compact binary system
formed by a BH and a NS. ElectromagNetic counterparts of GRAvitational wave
sources at the VEry Large Telescope (ENGRAVE) collaboration members carried out
an intensive multi-epoch, multi-instrument observational campaign to identify
the possible optical/near infrared counterpart of the event. In addition, the
ATLAS, GOTO, GRAWITA-VST, Pan-STARRS and VINROUGE projects also carried out a
search on this event. Our observations allow us to place limits on the presence
of any counterpart and discuss the implications for the kilonova (KN) possibly
generated by this NS-BH merger, and for the strategy of future searches.
Altogether, our observations allow us to exclude a KN with large ejecta mass
$M\gtrsim 0.1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to a high ($>90\%$) confidence, and we can
exclude much smaller masses in a subsample of our observations. This disfavours
the tidal disruption of the neutron star during the merger. Despite the
sensitive instruments involved in the campaign, given the distance of S190814bv
we could not reach sufficiently deep limits to constrain a KN comparable in
luminosity to AT 2017gfo on a large fraction of the localisation probability.
This suggests that future (likely common) events at a few hundreds Mpc will be
detected only by large facilities with both high sensitivity and large field of
view. Galaxy-targeted observations can reach the needed depth over a relevant
portion of the localisation probability with a smaller investment of resources,
but the number of galaxies to be targeted in order to get a fairly complete
coverage is large, even in the case of a localisation as good as that of this
event.

(inductor), and the associated quadratic field energy determines that only
two-body interaction in the Hamiltonian can be directly realized. Here we
propose and experimentally synthesize the three-body spin-chirality interaction
in a superconducting circuit based on Floquet engineering. By periodically
modulating the resonant frequencies of the qubits connected with each other via
capacitors, we can dynamically turn on and off qubit-qubit couplings, and
further create chiral flows of the excitations in the three-qubit circular

the degree of freedom in quantum simulation tasks.

that galaxy clusters in the early universe are actively forming and dynamically
young. Located at a high redshift of z=1.71, SpARCS1049+56 offers a unique look
into the galaxy cluster formation process. This cluster has been shown to be
rich in cluster galaxies and to have intense star formation. Its high redshift
pushes a weak-lensing analysis beyond the regime of the optical spectrum into
that of the infrared. Equipped with deep Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field
Camera 3 UVIS and IR observations, we present a weak-lensing characterization
of SpARCS1049+56. As few IR weak-lensing studies have been performed, we
discuss the details of PSF modeling and galaxy shape measurement for an IR
weak-lensing procedure and the systematics that come with the territory. It
will be critical to understand these systematics in future weak-lensing studies
in the IR with the next generation space telescopes such as JWST, Euclid, and
WFIRST. Through a careful analysis, the mass distribution of this young galaxy
cluster is mapped and the convergence peak is detected at a 3.3 sigma level.
The weak-lensing mass of the cluster is estimated to be
$3.5\pm1.2\times10^{14}\ \text{M}_\odot$ and is consistent with the mass
derived from a mass-richness scaling relation. This mass is extreme for a
cluster at such a high redshift and suggests that SpARCS1049+56 is rare in the

subspaces $H_1,...,H_n$ possesses the inverse best approximation property
(IBAP) if for arbitrary elements $x_1\in H_1,...,x_n\in H_n$ there exists an
element $x\in H$ such that $P_k x=x_k$ for all $k=1,2,...,n$. We provide
various new necessary and sufficient conditions for a system of $n$ subspaces

examples of systems of subspaces which possess the IBAP.
  These results are applied to a problem of probability theory. Let

integrate into urban environments. The safety of these agents is dependent on
their ability to predict collisions with other vehicles' future trajectories
for replanning and collision avoidance. The information needed to predict
collisions can be learned from previously observed vehicle trajectories in a
specific environment, generating a traffic model. The learned traffic model can
then be incorporated as prior knowledge into any trajectory estimation method
being used in this environment. This work presents a Gaussian process based
probabilistic traffic model that is used to quantify vehicle behaviors in an
intersection. The Gaussian process model provides estimates for the average
vehicle trajectory, while also capturing the variance between the different
paths a vehicle may take in the intersection. The method is demonstrated on a
set of time-series position trajectories. These trajectories are reconstructed
by removing object recognition errors and missed frames that may occur due to
data source processing. To create the intersection traffic model, the
reconstructed trajectories are clustered based on their source and destination
lanes. For each cluster, a Gaussian process model is created to capture the
average behavior and the variance of the cluster. To show the applicability of
the Gaussian model, the test trajectories are classified with only partial
observations. Performance is quantified by the number of observations required
to correctly classify the vehicle trajectory. Both the intersection traffic
modeling computations and the classification procedure are timed. These times
are presented as results and demonstrate that the model can be constructed in a
reasonable amount of time and the classification procedure can be used for
online applications.

the dynamics of the early universe, under the action of an effective potential
$V_{eff}$. That potential, depends on three parameters. Depending on the values
of these parameters, $V_{eff}$ may have two different shapes. $V_{eff}(a)$ may
have the shape of a barrier or the shape of a well followed by a barrier. We
solve, numerically, the appropriate time dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation and
obtain the time evolution of an initial wave function, for both cases. These
wave functions satisfy suitable boundary conditions. For both shapes of
$V_{eff}$, we compute the tunneling probability, which is a function of the
mean kinetic energy associated to the radiation energy $E_m$ and of the three
parameters of the generalized Chaplygin gas: $\alpha$, $A$ and $B$. The
tunneling probabilities, for both shapes of $V_{eff}$, indicates that the
universe should nucleate with the highest possible values of $E_m$, $\alpha$,
$A$ and $B$. Finally, we study the classical universe evolution after the
wavefunction has tunneled $V_{eff}$. The calculations show that the universe
may emerge from the Planck era in an inflationary phase.

  (2019)",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a coherent and consistent framework for explicit time-dependence
in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. The area of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics
has been growing rapidly over the past twenty years. This has been driven by
the fact that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian systems exhibit real
energy eigenvalues and unitary time evolution. Historically, the introduction
of time into the world of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics has been a
conceptually difficult problem to address, as it requires the Hamiltonian to
become unobservable. We solve this issue with the introduction of a new
observable energy operator and explain why its instigation is a necessary and
natural progression in this setting. For the first time, the introduction of
time has allowed us to make sense of the parameter regime in which the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is spontaneously broken. Ordinarily, in the
time-independent setting, the energy eigenvalues become complex and the wave
functions are asymptotically unbounded. We demonstrate that in the
time-dependent setting this broken symmetry can be mended and analysis on the
spontaneously broken $\mathcal{PT}$ regime is indeed possible. We provide many
examples of this mending on a wide range of different systems, beginning with a
$2\times2$ matrix model and extending to higher dimensional matrix models and
coupled harmonic oscillator systems with infinite Hilbert space. Furthermore,
we use the framework to perform analysis on time-dependent quasi-exactly
solvable models. We present the ""eternal life"" of entropy in this thesis.
Ordinarily, for entangled quantum systems coupled to the environments, the
entropy decays rapidly to zero. However, in the spontaneously broken regime, we
find the entropy decays asymptotically to a non-zero value. We create an
elegant framework for Darboux and Darboux/Crum transformations for
time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

solving multiple optimal power flow (OPF) tasks. PHCA is expedited here by
leveraging the powerful tool of multiparametric programming (MPP). Using an
approximate grid model, optimal DER setpoints are decided by a quadratic
program, which depends on analysis and uncertain parameters in a possibly
nonlinear fashion. By reformulating this program, feasible and infeasible OPF
instances alike are handled in a unified way to uniquely reveal the location,
frequency, and severity of feeder constraint violations. The effect of voltage
regulators is also captured by novel approximate models. Upon properly
extending MPP to PHCA, we were able to find the exact minimizers for 518,400

the mean-field limit, where the finite population of neurons in the hidden

phrased as global minimization of a free-energy functional on the space of

a controlled nonlinear dynamics in the space of probability measures over

problem is closely related to the Schr\""odinger bridge (or entropic optimal

evolution from normally ordered low-lying states to the ""Island of Inversion""
(IoI), and the behavior of a wide range of excited states with a $0f_{7/2}$
proton and neutron coupled to maximum spin of $7 \hbar$. Above a proton number
of about 13 the $0f_{7/2}$ orbital lies below that of $1p_{3/2}$, which is
considered normal ordering, but systematically at $Z = 10$ to $12$ the orbitals
cross. The calculations reproduce well the 2p2h - 0p0h inversion in the
configurations of nuclei inside the IoI, they reproduce the absolute binding
energies and the transition to normal ordering as the proton number approaches
that of the neutrons. The important role of $1p_{3/2}$ neutron pairs in the IoI
is also demonstrated. The calculations account well for the energies of the
fully aligned states with 0, 1, or 2 individual $sd$ nucleon aligned in spin
with the aligned $\pi 0f_{7/2}$ - $\nu 0f_{7/2}$ pair and reproduce well their
systematic variation with $A$ and number of aligned $sd$ nucleons. The results
presented in this paper give hope for the predictive power of the FSU
interaction for more exotic nuclei to be explored in near future.

obtained by extracting mode-$k$ fibers of $\mathcal{X}$, and matrices $U_j$,
$j=1,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,d$, chosen to minimize the approximation error. The
approximation can easily be modified to preserve the fibers in more than one

dimension increases. It also increases as the number of modes in which the

ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model
population dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now
increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular
because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological
processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows
ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear
or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the
two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate
between biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the
sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological
quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly
modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures
have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can
limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide
the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and
often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools
that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. In this paper,
we present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists
interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users,
and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in
ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that
demonstrates how SSMs models can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the

constraining masses and eccentricities of multi-planet systems. Recent
measurements of the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1 led to an estimate of the masses of the
planets, enabling an estimate of their densities. A recent TTV analysis using
data obtained in the past two years yields a 34% and 13% increase in mass for
TRAPPIST-1b and c, respectively. In most studies to date, a Newtonian N-body
model is used to fit the masses of the planets, while sometimes general
relativity is accounted for. Using the Posidonius N-body code, we show that in
the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, non-Newtonian effects might be also relevant
to correctly model the dynamics of the system and the resulting TTVs. In
particular, using standard values of the tidal Love number $k_2$ (accounting
for the tidal deformation) and the fluid Love number $k_{2f}$ (accounting for
the rotational flattening) leads to differences in the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1b and
c similar to the differences caused by general relativity. We also show that
relaxing the values of tidal Love number $k_2$ and the fluid Love number
$k_{2f}$ can lead to TTVs which differ by as much as a few 10~s on a $3-4$-year
timescale, which is a potentially observable level. The high values of the Love
numbers needed to reach observable levels for the TTVs could be achieved for
planets with a liquid ocean, which, if detected, might then be interpreted as a
sign that TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c could have a liquid magma ocean. For
TRAPPIST-1 and similar systems, the models to fit the TTVs should potentially
account for general relativity, for the tidal deformation of the planets, for
the rotational deformation of the planets and, to a lesser extent, for the
rotational deformation of the star, which would add up to 7x2+1 = 15 additional
free parameters in the case of TRAPPIST-1.

their underlying physical principles, such as the laws of motion or the
conservation of mass, energy or momentum. These models facilitate a causal
explanation for the drivers and impediments of the processes. But do they
describe the behaviour of the observed data? And how can we quantify the
models' parameters that cannot be measured directly? This paper addresses these
two questions by providing a methodology for estimating the solution; and the
parameters of linear dynamical systems from incomplete and noisy observations
of the processes.
  The proposed procedure builds on the parameter cascading approach, where a
linear combination of basis functions approximates the implicitly defined
solution of the dynamical system. The systems' parameters are then estimated so
that this approximating solution adheres to the data. By taking advantage of
the linearity of the system, we have simplified the parameter cascading
estimation procedure, and by developing a new iterative scheme, we achieve fast
and stable computation.
  We illustrate our approach by obtaining a linear differential equation that
represents real data from biomechanics. Comparing our approach with popular
methods for estimating the parameters of linear dynamical systems, namely, the
non-linear least-squares approach, simulated annealing, parameter cascading and
smooth functional tempering reveals a considerable reduction in computation and
an improved bias and sampling variance.

neutral atoms penetrates the interstellar medium, these atoms gradually get
ionised and deposit their energy over a region, whose longitudinal dimension is
set by the ""ionisation length"". The channel, where the energy is deposited,
expands sideways and drives a shock in the lateral direction. Once the density

UV-continuum slopes $\beta$ are in a range of $-3.4\le \beta \le -2.6$. Unlike
previous, tentative detections of $\beta \simeq -3$ in photometrically
selected, low-luminosity galaxies, our LAEs are spectroscopically confirmed and
luminous ($M_{\rm UV}<-20$ mag). We model their broadband spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), and find that two $\beta\simeq-2.6\pm0.2$ galaxies can be
well fitted with young and dust-free stellar populations. However, it becomes
increasingly difficult to fit bluer galaxies. We explore further
interpretations by including non-zero LyC escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}$, very
low metallicities, and/or AGN contributions. Assuming $f_{\rm esc}\simeq0.2$,
we achieve the bluest slopes $\beta\simeq-2.7$ when nebular emission is
considered. This can nearly explain the SEDs of two galaxies with
$\beta\simeq-2.8$ and --2.9 ($\sigma_{\beta}=0.15$). Larger $f_{\rm esc}$
values and very low metallicities are not favored by the strong nebular line
emission (evidenced by the IRAC flux) or the observed (IRAC 1 - IRAC 2) color.
Finally, we find that the $\beta\simeq-2.9$ galaxy can potentially be well
explained by the combination of a very young population with a high $f_{\rm

$\beta \simeq -3.4 \pm0.4$ galaxies. Future deep spectroscopic observations are

the LAE sample and its subsamples in the narrowband NB816 (i.e., the

stacked objects with their corresponding point spread functions, we clearly
detect extended LAHs around these LAEs. We perform sophisticated simulations
and analyses on statistical and systematic errors, and confirm that the
detected halos are not caused by errors. The scale lengths of the LAHs, when
described by a double-component model, range from 1.2 to 5.3 kpc with a typical
value of $\sim$2 kpc. The LAH sizes from our sample are in agreement with those
of individual LAEs at the similar redshift measured by VLT/MUSE, but are
relatively smaller than those of photometrically selected LAEs in previous
studies. We also find that LAEs with higher Lyman-alpha luminosities, higher UV
continuum luminosities or smaller Lyman-alpha equivalent widths tend to have
larger LAH sizes. Our results are consistent with a scenario that LAHs
originate from the scattered light of the central galaxies by H I gas in the

directional preference in the control design, leading to system behavior that
is adapted to the local environment geometry, carefully considering medial
obstacles while paying less attention to lateral ones. We use a virtual
reference governor system to adaptively follow a desired navigation path,
slowing down when system safety may be violated and speeding up otherwise. The

thermodynamic settings comprises an important and interesting aspect of its
development. One such situation is the analysis of the thermodynamic
consequences of structured environments that induce a non-Markovian dynamics.
We study a quantum Otto refrigerator where the standard Markovian cold
reservoir is replaced by a specific engineered cold reservoir which may induce
a Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics on the quantum refrigerant system. The
two dynamical regimes can be interchanged by varying the coupling between the
refrigerant and the reservoir. An increase of non-Markovian effects will be
related to an increase of the coupling strength, which in turn will make the
energy stored in the interaction Hamiltonian, the interaction energy,
increasingly relevant. We show how the figures of merit, the coefficient of
performance and the cooling power, change for non-negligible interaction
energies, discussing how neglecting this effect would lead to an overestimation
of the refrigerator performance. Finally, we also consider a numerical
simulation of a spin quantum refrigerator with experimentally feasible
parameters to better illustrate the non-Markovian effects induced by the
engineered cold reservoir. We argue that a moderate non-Markovian dynamics
performs better than either a Markovian or a strong non-Markovian regime of
operation.

entries, is known as \textit{matrix completion}. In today's data-driven world,
data completion is essential whether it is the main goal or a pre-processing
step. Structured matrix completion includes any setting in which data is not
missing uniformly at random. In recent work, a modification to the standard
nuclear norm minimization (NNM) for matrix completion has been developed to
take into account \emph{sparsity-based} structure in the missing entries. This
notion of structure is motivated in many settings including recommender
systems, where the probability that an entry is observed depends on the value
of the entry. We propose adjusting an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares

around the particles are still unknown. In this article, we address the
propulsion mechanism of ultrasound-propelled nano- and microparticles in more
detail. Based on direct computational fluid dynamics simulations and focusing
on traveling ultrasound waves, we study the effect of two important aspects of
the particle shape on the propulsion: rounded vs. pointed and filled vs. hollow

results reveal that pointedness leads to an increase of the propulsion speed,

that the flow field of ultrasound-propelled particles allows to classify them
as pusher squirmers, which has far-reaching consequences for the understanding
of these particles and allows us to predict that they can be used to realize
active materials with a tunable viscosity that can exhibit suprafluidity and
even negative viscosities. The obtained results are helpful, e.g., for future

considered as a special case of domain shift. In this paper, for the first

we construct each episode with two sub-episodes without class overlap on the
seen classes to simulate the domain shift between the seen and unseen classes.
To align the feature distributions of the two sub-episodes with limited
training samples, a feature transfer network is employed together with a margin
disparity discrepancy (MDD) loss. Importantly, theoretical analysis is provided
to give the learning bound of our DAPNA. Extensive experiments show that our
DAPNA outperforms the state-of-the-art FSL alternatives, often by significant

concerns the search for the minimum time charging without irreversibly damaging
the cells. This can fall into solving large-scale nonlinear optimal control
problems according to a battery model. Within this context, several model-based
techniques have been proposed in the literature.However, the effectiveness of
such strategies is significantly limited by model complexity and uncertainty.
Additionally, it is difficult to track parameters related to aging and re-tune
the model-based control policy. With the aim of overcoming these limitations,
in this paper we propose a fast-charging strategy subject to safety constraints
which relies on a model-free reinforcement learning framework. In particular,
we focus on the policy gradient-based actor-critic algorithm, i.e., deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), in order to deal with continuous sets of
actions and sets. The validity of the proposal is assessed in simulation when a
reduced electrochemical model is considered as the real plant. Finally, the
online adaptability of the proposed strategy in response to variations of the
environment parameters is highlighted with consideration of state reduction.

vulnerable to model extraction attacks that can steal confidential information

been considered a promising technique to mitigate this attack. However, we find
that the vulnerability persists when regression models are being protected by
current DP solutions. We show that the adversary can launch a query-flooding
parameter duplication (QPD) attack to infer the model information by repeated

  To defend against the QPD attack on logistic and linear regression models, we
propose a novel High-Dimensional Gaussian (HDG) mechanism to prevent
unauthorized information disclosure without interrupting the intended services.
In contrast to prior work, the proposed HDG mechanism will dynamically generate
the privacy budget and random noise for different queries and their results to
enhance the obfuscation. Besides, for the first time, HDG enables an optimal
privacy budget allocation that automatically determines the minimum amount of
noise to be added per user-desired privacy level on each dimension. We
comprehensively evaluate the performance of HDG using real-world datasets and
shows that HDG effectively mitigates the QPD attack while satisfying the
privacy requirements. We also prepare to open-source the relevant codes to the

structural lemma showing the current state of the system to be a small linear

logarithmic regret in the partially observed setting under Gaussian noise, with

sound sources. Source separation is fundamental for computational auditory
scene analysis. Previous work on source separation has focused on separating
particular sound classes such as speech and music. Many of previous work
require mixture and clean source pairs for training. In this work, we propose a
source separation framework trained with weakly labelled data. Weakly labelled
data only contains the tags of an audio clip, without the occurrence time of
sound events. We first train a sound event detection system with AudioSet. The
trained sound event detection system is used to detect segments that are mostly
like to contain a target sound event. Then a regression is learnt from a
mixture of two randomly selected segments to a target segment conditioned on
the audio tagging prediction of the target segment. Our proposed system can
separate 527 kinds of sound classes from AudioSet within a single system. A
U-Net is adopted for the separation system and achieves an average SDR of 5.67

of Majorana fermions and have orthogonal symmetry groups. In models of vector
type, only one of the symmetry groups has a large rank. The large $N$ limit is
taken keeping $gN=\lambda$ fixed, where $g$ multiplies the quartic Hamiltonian.
We introduce a simple model with $O(N)\times SO(4)$ symmetry, whose energies
are expressed in terms of the quadratic Casimirs of the symmetry groups. This
model may be deformed so that the symmetry is $O(N)\times O(2)^2$, and the
Hamiltonian reduces to that studied in arXiv:1802.10263. We find analytic
expressions for the large $N$ density of states and free energy. In both vector
models, the large $N$ density of states varies approximately as
$e^{-|E|/\lambda}$ for a wide range of energies. This gives rise to critical
behavior as the temperature approaches the Hagedorn temperature $T_{\rm H} =
\lambda$. In the formal large $N$ limit, the specific heat blows up as $(T_H-
T)^{-2}$, which implies that $T_H$ is the limiting temperature. However, at any
finite $N$, it is possible to reach arbitrarily large temperatures. Thus, the
finite $N$ effects smooth out the Hagedorn transition. We also study models of
matrix type, which have two $O(N)$ symmetry groups with large rank. An example
is provided by the Majorana matrix model with $O(N)^2\times O(2)$ symmetry,

density of states is smooth and nearly Gaussian near the middle of the

automatically learn the intrinsic features from various scanned images. Our
experimental results show that high accuracy can be achieved for source scanner
identification. The proposed system can also generate a reliability map that

sparse reward issues in reinforcement learning. In HRL, the policy model has an
inner representation structured in levels. With this structure, the
reinforcement learning task is expected to be decomposed into corresponding
levels with sub-tasks, and thus the learning can be more efficient. In HRL,
although it is intuitive that a high-level policy only needs to make macro
decisions in a low frequency, the exact frequency is hard to be simply
determined. Previous HRL approaches often employed a fixed-time skip strategy
or learn a terminal condition without taking account of the context, which,
however, not only requires manual adjustments but also sacrifices some decision
granularity. In this paper, we propose the \emph{temporal-adaptive hierarchical
policy learning} (TEMPLE) structure, which uses a temporal gate to adaptively
control the high-level policy decision frequency. We train the TEMPLE structure
with PPO and test its performance in a range of environments including 2-D
rooms, Mujoco tasks, and Atari games. The results show that the TEMPLE
structure can lead to improved performance in these environments with a
sequential adaptive high-level control.

unify them into a single value interval that comes with a special type of
double robustness: when either the value-function or the importance-weight

misspecification of the other class. Our interval also provides a unified view

In the past, there have been very few studies on measuring and comparing the
actual level of decentralization between Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains and
blockchains with other consensus protocols. This paper presents a new
comparison study of the level of decentralization in Bitcoin and Steem, a
prominent Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain. Our study particularly
focuses on analysing the power that decides the creators of blocks in the
blockchain. In Bitcoin, miners with higher computational power generate more
blocks. In contrast, blocks in Steem are equally generated by witnesses while
witnesses are periodically elected by stakeholders with different voting power
weighted by invested stake. We analyze the process of stake-weighted election
of witnesses in DPoS and measure the actual stake invested by each stakeholder
in Steem. We then compute the Shannon entropy of the distribution of
computational power among miners in Bitcoin and the distribution of invested
stake among stakeholders in Steem. Our analyses reveal that neither Bitcoin nor
Steem is dominantly better than the other with respect to decentralization.
Compared with Steem, Bitcoin tends to be more decentralized among top miners
but less decentralized in general. Our study is designed to provide insights
into the current state of the degree of decentralization in DPoS and PoW
blockchains. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can
facilitate future studies of decentralization in other blockchain systems

  Classification of Human Actions in Videos",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel scheme for human action recognition in videos, using a
3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) based classifier.
Traditionally in deep learning based human activity recognition approaches,
either a few random frames or every $k^{th}$ frame of the video is considered
for training the 3D CNN, where $k$ is a small positive integer, like 4, 5, or
6. This kind of sampling reduces the volume of the input data, which speeds-up
training of the network and also avoids over-fitting to some extent, thus
enhancing the performance of the 3D CNN model. In the proposed video sampling
technique, consecutive $k$ frames of a video are aggregated into a single frame
by computing a Gaussian-weighted summation of the $k$ frames. The resulting
frame (aggregated frame) preserves the information in a better way than the
conventional approaches and experimentally shown to perform better. In this
paper, a 3D CNN architecture is proposed to extract the spatio-temporal
features and follows Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to recognize human actions.
The proposed 3D CNN architecture is capable of handling the videos where the
camera is placed at a distance from the performer. Experiments are performed
with KTH and WEIZMANN human actions datasets, whereby it is shown to produce
comparable results with the state-of-the-art techniques.

Using controlled N-body simulations, we explore the possibility that their
properties can be reproduced through tidal stripping from the elliptical galaxy
NGC 1052, in both cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM) scenarios. To explain the dark matter deficiency, we find that a CDM
halo must have a very low concentration so that it can lose sufficient inner
mass in the tidal field. In contrast, SIDM favors a higher and more reasonable
concentration as core formation enhances tidal mass loss. Final stellar
distributions in our SIDM benchmarks are more diffuse than the CDM one, and
hence the former are in better agreement with the data. We further show that a
cored CDM halo model modified by strong baryonic feedback is unlikely to
reproduce the observations. Our results indicate that SIDM is more favorable
for the formation of dark-matter-deficient galaxies.

response data of a vehicle traveling over a bridge to assess bridge health.
Motivated by indirect sensing methods' benefits, such as low-cost and
low-maintenance, vehicle-vibration-based bridge health monitoring has been
studied to efficiently monitor bridges in real-time. Yet applying this approach
is challenging because 1) physics-based features extracted manually are
generally not damage-sensitive, and 2) features from machine learning
techniques are often not applicable to different bridges. Thus, we formulate a
vehicle bridge interaction system model and find a physics-guided DS & DI
feature, which can be extracted using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform
representing non-stationary signals as intrinsic-mode-type components. We
validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature with simulated experiments.
Compared to conventional time- and frequency-domain features, our feature
provides the best damage quantification and localization results across
different bridges in five of six experiments.

a timely study of the rate-density of LGRBs with an assumed broken power law
GRB spectrum and obtained a GRB-burst-rate functional form that gives
acceptable fits to the preSwift and Swift redshift and jet angle distributions.
The results indicated an excess of LGRBs at redshift below $z \sim 2$ in the
Swift sample. In this work, we are investigating if the excess is caused by the
cosmological Hubble constant $H_0$, the $\gamma$-ray energy released
$E_\gamma$, the low- and high-energy indices ($\alpha, \beta$) of the Band
function, the minimum and maximum jet angles $\theta_{\rm j,min}$ and
$\theta_{\rm j, max}$, or that the excess is due to a biased in the
Swift-Ryan-2012 sample. Our analyses indicate that none of the above physical
parameters resolved the excess problem, but suggesting that the
Swift-Ryan-2012~sample is biased with possible afterglow selection effect. The
following model physical parameter values provide the best fit to the
Swift-Ryan-2012 and preSwift~samples: the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72 \, {\rm km
s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, the energy released $E_\gamma \sim 4.47 \times 10^{51}$ erg,

angle power-law index, and a GRB formation rate that is similar to the Hopkins

space with the progress of cosmic time, through a simple equation, $\Delta V =
\Delta t\left(N_{surf}- N_{bulk}\right)$. This law of emergence suggested by
Padmanabhan in the context of general relativity for a flat universe has been
generalized by Sheykhi to Gauss Bonnet and Lovelock gravity for a universe with
any spacial curvature. We investigate whether this generalized holographic
equipartition effectively implies the maximization of horizon entropy. First,
we obtain the constraints imposed by the maximization of horizon entropy in
Einstein, Gauss Bonnet and Lovelock gravities for a universe with any spacial
curvature. We then analyze the consistency of the law of emergence in
\cite{Sheykhi}, with these constraints obtained. Interestingly, both the law of
emergence and the horizon entropy maximization demands an asymptotically de
Sitter universe with $\omega \geq -1$. More specifically, when the degrees of
freedom in the bulk $( N_{bulk})$ becomes equal to the degrees of freedom on
the boundary surface $(N_{surf}),$ the universe attains a state of maximum
horizon entropy. Thus, the law of emergence can be viewed as a tendency for
maximizing the horizon entropy, even in a non flat universe. Our results points
at the deep connection between the law of emergence and horizon thermodynamics,
beyond Einstein gravity irrespective of the spacial curvature.

(IoT) system, where a server transmits time-stamped status updates to multiple
IoT devices. We apply a recently proposed metric, named age of information
(AoI), to capture the timeliness of the information delivery. The AoI is
defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most recently received
status update. Different from the existing studies that considered either
multicast transmission without hard deadlines or unicast transmission with hard
deadlines, we enforce a hard deadline for the service time of multicast
transmission. This is important for many emerging multicast IoT applications,
where the outdated status updates are useless for IoT devices. Specifically,
the transmission of a status update is terminated when either the hard deadline
expires or a sufficient number of IoT devices successfully receive the status
update. We first calculate the distributions of the service time for all
possible reception outcomes at IoT devices, and then derive a closed-form
expression of the average AoI. Simulations validate the performance analysis,
which reveals that: 1) the multicast transmission with hard deadlines achieves
a lower average AoI than that without hard deadlines; and 2) there exists an
optimal value of the hard deadline that minimizes the average AoI.

collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for
recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to
recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally
designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network
operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in
GCNs -- feature transformation and nonlinear activation -- contribute little to
the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds to
the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance.
  In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise
and appropriate for recommendation. We propose a new model named LightGCN,
including only the most essential component in GCN -- neighborhood aggregation
-- for collaborative filtering. Specifically, LightGCN learns user and item
embeddings by linearly propagating them on the user-item interaction graph, and
uses the weighted sum of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final
embedding. Such simple, linear, and neat model is much easier to implement and
train, exhibiting substantial improvements (about 16.0\% relative improvement
on average) over Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) -- a
state-of-the-art GCN-based recommender model -- under exactly the same

millimeter-wave (mmWave) transceivers. These works are based solely on creating
sufficient isolation between a transceiver's transmitter and receiver via
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding and combining. In this work, we
propose supplementing these beamforming strategies with analog
self-interference cancellation (A-SIC). By leveraging A-SIC, a portion of the
self-interference is cancelled without the need for beamforming, allowing for
more optimal beamforming strategies to be used in serving users. We use
simulation to demonstrate that even with finite resolution A-SIC solutions,
there are significant gains to be had in sum spectral efficiency. With a single
bit of A-SIC resolution, improvements over a beamforming-only design are
present. With 8 bits of A-SIC resolution, our design nearly approaches that of
ideal full-duplex operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
mmWave full-duplex design that combines both beamforming and A-SIC to achieve
simultaneous transmission and reception in-band.

bursts that have been observed during periods of moderate solar activity, where
S stands for short. The frequency drift of S-bursts can reflect the density
variation and the motion state of the electron beams. In this work, we
investigate the frequency drift and the fine structure of the S-bursts with the
LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We find that the average frequency drift rate of
the S-bursts within 110-180MHz could be described by $df/dt=-0.0077f^{1.59}$.
With the high time and frequency resolution of LOFAR, we can resolve the fine
structures of the observed solar S-bursts. A fine drift variation pattern was
found in the structure of S-bursts (referred to as solar Sb-bursts in this
paper) during the type-III storm on 2019 April 13, in the frequency band of
120-240 MHz. The Sb-bursts have a quasi-periodic segmented pattern, and the
relative flux intensity tends to be large when the frequency drift rate is
relatively large. This kind of structure exists in about 20\% of the solar
S-burst events within the observed frequency range. We propose that the fine
structure is due to the density fluctuations of the background coronal density.
We performed a simulation based on this theory which can reproduce the shape
and relative flux intensity of the Sb-bursts. This work shows that the fine
structure of solar radio bursts can be used to diagnose the coronal plasma.

spin-polarization. In contrast to the single interface, for stacked system, the

generalization is obtained by replacing the exponential function with the power

Gaussian measure. For $1\leq q <3$, the set of all $q$-Gaussian densities over
the real line satisfies a certain regularity condition to define information
geometric structures such as an entropy and a relative entropy via escort
expectations. The ordinary expectation of a random variable is the integral of
the random variable with respect to its law. Escort expectations admit us to
replace the law to any other measures. A choice of escort expectations on the
set of all $q$-Gaussian densities determines an entropy and a relative entropy.
One of most important escort expectations on the set of all $q$-Gaussian
densities is the $q$-escort expectation since this escort expectation
determines the Tsallis entropy and the Tsallis relative entropy.
  The phenomenon gauge freedom of entropies is that different escort
expectations determine the same entropy, but different relative entropies. In
this note, we first introduce a refinement of the $q$-logarithmic function.
Then we demonstrate the phenomenon on an open set of all $q$-Gaussian densities

field), the sum rule here proposed involves expectation values of field
operators calculated between general eigenstates of the interacting
light-matter system. This sum rule provides constraints and guidance for the
analysis of strongly interacting light-matter systems and can be used to test
the validity of approximate effective Hamiltonians often used in quantum
optics.

Multiple OSNs constitute a multiplex network. For privacy protection and usage
purposes, accounts belonging to the same user in different OSNs may have
different usernames, photographs, and introductions. Interlayer link prediction
in multiplex network aims at identifying whether the accounts in different OSNs
belong to the same person, which can aid in tasks including cybercriminal
behavior modeling and customer interest analysis. Many real-world OSNs exhibit
a scale-free degree distribution; thus, neighbors with different degrees may
exert different influences on the node matching degrees across different OSNs.
We developed an iterative degree penalty (IDP) algorithm for interlayer link
prediction in the multiplex network. First, we proposed a degree penalty
principle that assigns a greater weight to a common matched neighbor with fewer
connections. Second, we applied node adjacency matrix multiplication for
efficiently obtaining the matching degree of all unmatched node pairs.
Thereafter, we used the approved maximum value method to obtain the interlayer
link prediction results from the matching degree matrix. Finally, the
prediction results were inserted into the priori interlayer node pair set and
the above processes were performed iteratively until all unmatched nodes in one
layer were matched or all matching degrees of the unmatched node pairs were
equal to 0. Experiments demonstrated that our advanced IDP algorithm
significantly outperforms current network structure-based methods when the
multiplex network average degree and node overlapping rate are low.

images is an essential prerequisite for an anatomical understanding of
orthodontic structures in several applications, such as tooth reformation
planning and implant guide simulations. However, the presence of severe metal
artifacts in CBCT images hinders the accurate segmentation of each individual
tooth. In this study, we propose a neural network for pixel-wise labeling to
exploit an instance segmentation framework that is robust to metal artifacts.
Our method comprises of three steps: 1) image cropping and realignment by pose
regressions, 2) metal-robust individual tooth detection, and 3) segmentation.
We first extract the alignment information of the patient by pose regression
neural networks to attain a volume-of-interest (VOI) region and realign the
input image, which reduces the inter-overlapping area between tooth bounding
boxes. Then, individual tooth regions are localized within a VOI realigned
image using a convolutional detector. We improved the accuracy of the detector
by employing non-maximum suppression and multiclass classification metrics in
the region proposal network. Finally, we apply a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to perform individual tooth segmentation by converting the pixel-wise
labeling task to a distance regression task. Metal-intensive image augmentation
is also employed for a robust segmentation of metal artifacts. The result shows
that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially
for teeth with metal artifacts. The primary significance of the proposed method
is two-fold: 1) an introduction of pose-aware VOI realignment followed by a
robust tooth detection and 2) a metal-robust CNN framework for accurate tooth
segmentation.

by the asymmetry of the collapse. We study the evolution of the angular
momentum in a non-axisymmetric collapse of a dense core from an analytical
point of view. To test the theory, we perform three-dimensional simulations of
a collapsing prestellar dense core using adaptative mesh refinement. We start
from a non-axisymmetrical situation, considering a dense core with random
density perturbations that follow a turbulence spectrum. We analyse the
emerging disk comparing the angular momentum it contains with the one expected
from our analytic development. We study the velocity gradients at different
scales in the simulation as it is done with observations. We show that the
angular momentum in the frame of a stellar object which is not located at the
center of mass of the core is not conserved, due to inertial forces. Our
simulations of such non-axisymmetrical collapse quickly produce accretion disks
at the small scales in the core. The analysis of the kinematics at different
scales in the simulated core reveals projected velocity gradients of amplitudes
similar to the ones observed in protostellar cores, and which directions vary,
sometimes even reversing when small and large scales are compared. These
complex kinematics patterns appear in recent observations, and could be a
discriminating feature with models where rotation is inherited from large

consistent with these recent observations than when solid-body rotation is

computational cost has limited current searches to less sensitive
coincidence-based schemes. Following up on previous work that has demonstrated
the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization in reducing the computational
cost of this search, we present an implementation that achieves near real-time
computational speed. This is achieved by combining the search efficiency of PSO
with a significantly revised and optimized numerical implementation of the
underlying mathematical formalism along with additional multi-threaded
parallelization layers in a distributed computing framework. For a network of
four second-generation detectors with $60$~min data from each, the runtime of
the implementation presented here ranges between $\approx 1.4$ to $\approx 0.5$
times the data duration for network signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of $\gtrsim
10$ and $\gtrsim 12$, respectively. The reduced runtimes are obtained with
small to negligible losses in detection sensitivity: for a false alarm rate of
$\simeq 1$~event per year in Gaussian stationary noise, the loss in detection
probability is $\leq 5\%$ and $\leq 2\%$ for SNRs of $10$ and $12$,
respectively. Using the fast implementation, we are able to quantify
frequentist errors in parameter estimation for signals in the double neutron
star mass range using a large number of simulated data realizations. A clear
dependence of parameter estimation errors and detection sensitivity on the
condition number of the network antenna pattern matrix is revealed. Combined
with previous work, this paper securely establishes the effectiveness of
PSO-based fully-coherent all-sky search across the entire binary inspiral mass

dynamics simulations using a reactive force field, as well as a neural network
yield rate coefficients about one order of magnitude lower. This
underestimation of the rates is traced back to the multireference character of
the transition state [MgOCH$_4$]$^+$. Statistical modeling of the
temperature-dependent kinetics provides further insight into the reactive
potential surface. The rate limiting step was found to be consistent with a
four-centered activation of the C-H bond, consistent with previous
calculations. The product branching was modeled as a competition between
dissociation of an insertion intermediate directly after the rate-limiting
transition state, and traversing a transition state corresponding to a methyl
migration leading to a Mg-CH$_3$OH$^+$ complex, though only if this transition
state is stabilized significantly relative to the dissociated MgOH$^+$ + CH$_3$

a post-transition state bifurcation in the potential surface could allow the
reaction to proceed directly from the four-centered TS to the Mg-CH$_3$OH$^+$

smaller nucleosynthetic isotope variations than the more refractory
neighbouring elements. Based on this observation we present a new model in
which thermal destruction of interstellar medium dust results in an enrichment
of s-process dominated stardust in regions closer to the Sun. We propose that
stardust is depleted in volatile elements due to incomplete condensation of
these elements into dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. This led
to the smaller nucleosynthetic variations for Pd reported here and the lack of
such variations for more volatile elements. The smaller magnitude variations
measured in heavier refractory elements suggest that material from
high-metallicity AGB stars dominated stardust in the Solar System. These stars
produce less heavy s-process elements compared to the bulk Solar System
composition.

that emits a temporal blinking pattern of infrared (IR) light representing its
ID. We used a multi-material three dimensional (3D) printer to fabricate a
projection object with optical fibers that can guide IR light from LEDs
attached on the bottom of the object. The aperture of an optical fiber is
typically very small; thus, it is unnoticeable to human observers under
projection and can be placed on a strongly curved part of a projection surface.
In addition, the working range of our system can be larger than previous
marker-based methods as the blinking patterns can theoretically be recognized
by a camera placed at a wide range of distances from markers. We propose an
automatic marker placement algorithm to spread multiple active markers over the
surface of a projection object such that its pose can be robustly estimated
using captured images from arbitrary directions. We also propose an
optimization framework for determining the routes of the optical fibers in such
a way that collisions of the fibers can be avoided while minimizing the loss of
light intensity in the fibers. Through experiments conducted using three
fabricated objects containing strongly curved surfaces, we confirmed that the
proposed method can achieve accurate dynamic PMs in a significantly wide

inequality of order $\sigma$). In the present paper we consider several sharp
global estimates for the resolvent and the solution to the time-dependent

coupling constant $a>-C_{\sigma,n}$, we first prove {\it uniform resolvent
estimates} of Kato--Yajima type for all $0<\sigma<n/2$, which turn out to be
equivalent to {\it Kato smoothing estimates} for the Cauchy problem. We then
establish {\it Strichartz estimates} for $\sigma>1/2$ and {\it uniform Sobolev

same properties for the Schr\""odinger operator with the inverse-square

{\it improved Strichartz estimates with a gain of regularities} for general
initial data if $1<\sigma<n/2$ and for radially symmetric data if
$n/(2n-1)<\sigma\le1$, which extends the corresponding results for the free
evolution to the case with Hardy potentials. These arguments can be further
applied to a large class of higher-order inhomogeneous elliptic operators and
even to certain long-range metric perturbations of the Laplace operator.
Finally, in the critical coupling constant case (i.e. $a=-C_{\sigma,n}$), we
show that the same results as in the subcritical case still hold for functions
orthogonal to radial functions.

varied from $\rm 0 \: wt\%$ (a negligible envelop) to $\rm 100 \: wt\%$ (a

remain visible. We apply Electrically Focus-Tunable Lenses (ETL) as eyeglasses
and a synchronized high-speed projector as illumination for a real scene. We
periodically modulate the focal lengths of the glasses (focal sweep) at more
than 60 Hz so that a wearer cannot perceive the modulation. A part of the scene
to appear focused is illuminated by the projector when it is in focus of the
user's eyes, while another part to appear blurred is illuminated when it is out
of the focus. As the basis of our spatial focus control, we build mathematical
models to predict the range of distance from the ETL within which real objects
become blurred on the retina of a user. Based on the blur range, we discuss a
design guideline for effective illumination timing and focal sweep range. We
also model the apparent size of a real scene altered by the focal length
modulation. This leads to an undesirable visible seam between focused and
blurred areas. We solve this unique problem by gradually blending the two
areas. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal by implementing
various vision augmentation applications.

  Models",,,,,"eess.SP cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, autonomous driving has attracted much attention from both industry
and academia. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a key component in
autonomous driving, which is also increasingly adopted in pervasive computing
such as smartphones, wearable devices, and IoT networks. Prior work shows
CNN-based classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However,
it is uncertain to what extent regression models such as driving models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the effectiveness of existing defense
techniques, and the defense implications for system and middleware builders.
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of five adversarial attacks and four
defense methods on three driving models. Experiments show that, similar to
classification models, these models are still highly vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. This poses a big security threat to autonomous driving and thus should
be taken into account in practice. While these defense methods can effectively
defend against different attacks, none of them are able to provide adequate
protection against all five attacks. We derive several implications for system
and middleware builders: (1) when adding a defense component against
adversarial attacks, it is important to deploy multiple defense methods in
tandem to achieve a good coverage of various attacks, (2) a blackbox attack is
much less effective compared with a white-box attack, implying that it is
important to keep model details (e.g., model architecture, hyperparameters)
confidential via model obfuscation, and (3) driving models with a complex
architecture are preferred if computing resources permit as they are more
resilient to adversarial attacks than simple models.

polarization has been observed experimentally due to a non-collinear magnetic

magnetic spin order, hysteresis, polarisation and the so-called magnetic
compensation effect in $ACr_2O_4$ ($A$=$Co$, $Mn$,$Fe$, $Ni$) using Monte Carlo
simulation. With a careful choice of the exchange interaction, we were able to
explain various experimental findings such as magnetization vs. temperature (T)
behavior, conical stability, unique magnetic ordering and polarization in a
representative compound $CoCr_2O_4$ which is the best known multiferroic
compound in the $AB_2O_4$ spinel family. We have also studied the effect of
$Fe$-substitution in $CoCr_2O_4$, with an onset of few exotic phenomena such as
magnetic compensation and sign reversible exchange bias effect. These effects
are investigated using an effective interactions mimicking the effect of
substitution. Two other compounds in this family, $CoMn_2O_4$ and $CoFe_2O_4$,
are also studied where no conical magnetic order and polarisation was observed,
as hence provide a distinct contrast. Here all calculations are done using the
polarisation calculated by the spin-current model. This model has certain
limitation and it works quite good for low temperature and low magnetic field.
But the model despite its limitation it can reproduce sign reversible exchange
bias and magnetic compensation like phenomena quite well.

promising candidate as a super-hydrophobic material for novel technological

natural and industrial environments. During the last several years, a number of
studies have revealed that nucleation in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical,
where the formation of crystalline phases involves several steps. Based on
these recent insights we have formulated a tentative general model for calcium
sulfate precipitation from solution. This model involves primary species that
are formed through the assembly of multiple Ca2+ and SO42- ions into
nanoclusters. These nanoclusters assemble into poorly ordered (i.e. amorphous)
hydrated aggregates, which in turn undergo ordering into coherent crystalline
units. The thermodynamic (meta)stability of any of the three CaSO4 phases is
regulated by temperature, pressure and ionic strength with gypsum being the
stable form at low temperatures and low to medium ionic strengths, and
anhydrite the stable phase at high temperatures and lower temperature at high
salinities. Bassanite is metastable across the entire phase diagram but readily
forms as the primary phase at high ionic strengths across a wide range of
temperatures, and can persist up to several months. Although the
physicochemical conditions leading to bassanite formation in aqueous systems
are relatively well established, nanoscale insights into the nucleation
mechanisms and pathways are still lacking. To fill this gap, and to further
improve our general model for calcium sulfate precipitation, we have conducted
in situ scattering measurements at small- and wide-angles (SAXS/WAXS) and
complemented these with in situ Raman spectroscopic characterization. Based on
these experiments we show that the process of formation of bassanite from
aqueous solutions is very similar to the formation of gypsum: it involves the
aggregation of small primary species into larger disordered aggregates.

of 477 classical cepheids (CCs). The SEDs were fitted with a dust radiative
transfer code. Four stars showed a large mid- or far-infrared excess and the
fitting then included a dust component. These comprise the well-known case of
RS Pup, and three stars that are (likely) Type-II cepheids (T2Cs), AU Peg, QQ
Per, and FQ Lac.
  The remainder of the sample was fitted with a stellar photosphere to derive
the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature. Distance and reddening
were taken from the literature. The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram and compared to evolutionary tracks for cepheids and theoretical
instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is
consistent with the instability strip for a CC or T2C. About 5% of the stars
are outliers in the sense that they are much hotter or cooler than expected. A
comparison to effective temperatures derived from spectroscopy suggests in some
cases that the photometrically derived temperature is not correct and that this
is likely linked to an incorrectly adopted reddening.
  In this work the presence of a small NIR excess, as has been proposed in the
literature for a few well-known cepheids, is investigated. Firstly, this was
done by using a sample of about a dozen stars for which a mid-infrared spectrum
is available. Secondly, the SEDs of all stars were fitted with a dust model to
see if a statistically significant better fit could be obtained. The results
were compared to recent work. Eight new candidates for exhibiting a NIR excess
are proposed, solely based on the photometric SEDs. Obtaining mid-infrared
spectra would be needed to confirm this excess. Finally, period-bolometric
luminosity and period-radius relations are presented for samples of over 370
fundamental-mode CCs.

specifically, the proposed method involves a two-stage learning procedure.
Firstly, a facial expression synthesis generative adversarial network (FESGAN)

increase the diversity of the training images, FESGAN is elaborately designed
to generate images with new identities from a prior distribution. Secondly, an
expression recognition network is jointly learned with the pre-trained FESGAN
in a unified framework. In particular, the classification loss computed from
the recognition network is used to simultaneously optimize the performance of
both the recognition network and the generator of FESGAN. Moreover, in order to
alleviate the problem of data bias between the real images and the synthetic
images, we propose an intra-class loss with a novel real data-guided
back-propagation (RDBP) algorithm to reduce the intra-class variations of
images from the same class, which can significantly improve the final

semantic RGB segmentation. We show how our proposed self-supervised

using 25x less images and without requiring any manual labeling. We pre-train a
semantic segmentation network with our HN-labels, which resembles our final
task more than pre-training on a less related task, e.g. classification with

in dozens of transitional protoplanetary discs are caused by anticyclonic
vortices. These vortices can play a key role in planet formation, as mm-sized
dust -- the building blocks of planets -- can be accumulated inside them.
Anticyclonic vortices are formed by the Rossby wave instability, which can be
excited at the gap edges opened by a giant planet or at sharp viscosity
transitions of accretionally inactive regions. It is known that vortices are
prone to stretching and subsequent dissolution due to disc self-gravity for
canonical disc masses in the isothermal approximation. To improve the
hydrodynamic model of protoplanetary discs, we include the disc thermodynamics
in our model. In this paper, we present our results on the evolution of the
vortices formed at the outer edge of an accretionally inactive region (dead
zone) assuming an ideal equation of state and taking $PdV$ work, disc cooling
in the $\beta$-approximation, and disc self-gravity into account.
Thermodynamics affects the offset and the mode number (referring to the number
of small vortices at the early phase) of the RWI excitation, as well as the
strength, shape, and lifetime of the large-scale vortex formed through merging
of the initial small vortices. We found that the inclusion of gas
thermodynamics results in stronger, however decreased lifetime vortices. Our
results suggest that a hypothetical vortex-aided planet formation scenario
favours effectively cooling discs.

Furthermore, when the volume fraction of bubbles is large enough, the bubble

numerically, performing direct numerical simulations (DNS) with a
Volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. In the first part of the work, we perform both 2D

  We then carry out a highly-resolved simulation of a 3D bubble column, with a
configuration and physical parameters similar to those used in laboratory
experiments. This is the largest simulation attempted for such a configuration
and is possible only thanks to adaptive grid refinement. Results are compared
both with experiments and previous coarse-mesh numerical simulations. In

exhibit exotic phenomena such as negative refractive index, extraordinary

achieved by combining geometrical and resonance effects. Holey-structured
acoustic metamaterials have already shown potential for sub-wavelength acoustic
imaging in air, where it is relatively simple to achieve the required
difference in acoustic impedance needed to create resonances within the holes.
However, the use of polymers for metamaterial operation in water is difficult,
due to the much lower difference in acoustic impedance between water and the
many polymers used, for example, in additive manufacturing. Hence, metals are
commonly used. Here we show that this can be overcome by trapping air layers so
that they surround each water-filled channel, making sub-wavelength imaging in
water possible. The operation of such a Trapped air design is confirmed at
200-300 kHz ultrasonic frequencies via both finite element modelling and
experimental measurements in a water tank. It is also shown quantitatively that
the trapped air design outperforms its metal counterpart. The results indicate
a way forward for exploiting additive-manufacturing for realising acoustic
metamaterials in water at ultrasonic frequencies.

implications of the new spectral features reported during the 2015--2017

nicely fits the description of a standard accretion disk emission from an SMBH

end-May 2013 (MJD 56439) is in close coincidence with the time of impact

which argue a total central-engine mass in the range of $\rm 10^{7-9}~M_\odot$.
On the other hand, the MeV-GeV spectral change is naturally reproduced by the
inverse Compton scattering of photons from the broad-line region and is
consistent with the detection of broad emission lines during the previous
cycles of quasi-periodic outbursts. Combining this with previous SED studies
suggests that in OJ 287, MeV-GeV emission results from external Comptonization.

decisions is essential for the wider adoption of autonomous vehicle technology.
One promising direction is to pose safety requirements as planning constraints
in nonlinear, non-convex optimization problems of motion synthesis. However,
many implementations of this approach are limited by uncertain convergence and
local optimality of the solutions achieved, affecting overall robustness. To
improve upon these issues, we propose a novel two-stage optimization framework:
in the first stage, we find a solution to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) formulation of the motion synthesis problem, the output of which
initializes a second Nonlinear Programming (NLP) stage. The MILP stage enforces
hard constraints of safety and road rule compliance generating a solution in
the right subspace, while the NLP stage refines the solution within the safety
bounds for feasibility and smoothness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework via simulated experiments of complex urban driving scenarios,
outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline in metrics of convergence, comfort

testing, and operating decentralized socio-technical systems at large-scale. In
such systems, autonomous agents interact locally with their users, and remotely
with other agents to make intelligent collective choices. Via these
interactions they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed
resources. While such complex systems are often deployed and operated using
centralized computing infrastructures, the socio-technical nature of these
decentralized systems requires new value-sensitive design paradigms; empowering
trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens' social values, such as
privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens' choices.
Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the
prototyping process from simulation to live deployment are missing, or not
practical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized
socio-technical systems running on IoT. This new architecture is designed for a
seamless reusability of (i) application-independent decentralized services by
an IoT application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same
decentralized service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications
that are simpler to prototype, and can interoperate with decentralized services
during runtime to self-integrate more complex functionality. Such integration
provides stronger validation of IoT applications, and improves resource
utilization. Pressure and crash tests during continuous operations of several
weeks, with more than 80K network joining and leaving of agents, 2.4M parameter
changes, and 100M communicated messages, confirm the robustness and
practicality of the testbed architecture.

Heat-work conversion mechanisms and dissipation of energy can be described,
respectively, by the antisymmetric and symmetric components of a thermal
geometric tensor defined in the space of time-dependent parameters generalized
to include the temperature bias. The antisymmetric component can be identified
as a Berry curvature, while the symmetric component defines the metric of the
manifold. We show that the operation of adiabatic thermal machines, and
consequently also their efficiency, are intimately related to these geometric
aspects. We illustrate these ideas by discussing two specific cases: a slowly
driven qubit asymmetrically coupled to two bosonic reservoirs kept at different
temperatures, and a quantum dot driven by a rotating magnetic field and
strongly coupled to electron reservoirs with different polarizations. Both
examples are already amenable for an experimental verification.

potentials. We consider contacts with and without adhesion. We found that the
contact area and the friction force are nearly velocity independent for small
velocities ($v < 0.25 \ {\rm m/s}$) in spite of the fact that the shear stress
in the contact area is rather non-uniform. For the case of no adhesion the
friction coefficient is very small. For the case of adhesion the friction
coefficient is higher, and is mainly due to energy dissipation at the opening
crack tip, where rapid atomic snap-off events occur during sliding. Adhesion
experiments between a human finger and a clean glass plate were carried out,
and for a dry finger no macroscopic adhesion occurred. We suggest that the
observed decrease in the contact area with increasing shear force results from
non-adhesive finger-glass contact mechanics, involving large deformations of a

resolution, as a practically oriented algorithm, is widely used in state-of-art
modern theorem provers. In this paper, we devise a resolution decision
procedure, which not only proves decidability of querying of the guarded
fragment, but is implementable in any `off-the-shelf' resolution theorem prover
with modest effort. Further, we extend the procedure to querying the loosely
guarded fragment.
  The difficulty in querying a knowledge base of (loosely) guarded clauses is
that query clauses are not guarded. We show however there are ways to
reformulate query clauses into (loosely) guarded clauses either directly via
the separation and splitting rules, or via performing inferences using our
top-variable inference system combining with a form of dynamic renaming.
Therefore, the problem of querying the (loosely) guarded fragment can be
reduced to deciding the (loosely) guarded fragment and possibly irreducible
query clauses, i.e., a clause that cannot derive any new conclusion. Meanwhile,
our procedure yields a goal-oriented query rewriting algorithm: Before
introducing datasets, one can produce a saturated clausal set $\mathcal{S}$
using given BCQs and (loosely) guarded theories. Clauses in $\mathcal{S}$ can
be easily transformed first-order queries, therefore query answering over the
(loosely) guarded fragment is reduced to evaluating a union of first-order
queries over datasets. As far as we know, this is the first practical decision
procedure for answering and rewriting Boolean conjunctive queries over the

mutually coupled Thomas oscillators with linear/nonlinear coupling in a dynamic
environment. We claim our model calculations can explain the diffusion of
interacting particles in a fluid. In an ordinary fluid, frequent momentum
transfer between particles keeps the particles in a fluid moving together with
correlated time behaviour. The diffusion of interacting particles in a dynamic
environment like this is a nonequilibrium phenomenon and is similar to the
observed transient chaotic dynamics in the model. The detailed study of the
nature of dynamics and synchronization reveals that, for two qualitatively
different regimes of system parameters, the coupled system passes through an
interval of transient chaos before it settles into a chaotic or limit cycle
attractor. The linear diffusive coupling is equivalent to weak momentum
transfer, leading to conventional dynamics and synchronization. The sinusoidal
nonlinear coupling, harmonic momentum transfer, produces exceptional dynamical
features. The nature of synchronization is complete(directed motion) when the
attractor is chaotic or an unstable transient attractor. In contrast, it is
either lag, anti-lag, or space lag for a limit cycle. In such situations, the
diffusion is due to particles pedalling and eddy/swirling motion on top of
translatory motion via transient chaos. Also, the trajectories of the two
particles in the state space resemble a Chiral Phenomenon.

increased understanding of the various nonlinear phenomena that limit the
performance of MEMS sensors. In this work, we develop a model of two
nonlinearly coupled mechanical modes and employ it to explain measured drive
mode instabilities in MEMS gyroscopes. Due to 3:1 internal resonance between
the drive mode and a parasitic mode, energy transfer within the conservative

situations, there are more than one property to be exploited and, as a
consequence, a set of separation criteria may be used to recover the original

of an approach based on multi-objective optimization. Differently from the

algorithms for Neural Networks (NNs) that have been inspired by Dropout (Hinton
et al., 2012). With the goal of avoiding overfitting during training of NNs,
dropout algorithms consist in practice of multiplying the weight matrices of a
NN componentwise by independently drawn random matrices with $\{0, 1 \}$-valued
entries during each iteration of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This paper
presents a probability theoretical proof that for fully-connected NNs with
differentiable, polynomially bounded activation functions, if we project the
weights onto a compact set when using a dropout algorithm, then the weights of
the NN converge to a unique stationary point of a projected system of Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs). After this general convergence guarantee, we go
on to investigate the convergence rate of dropout. Firstly, we obtain generic
sample complexity bounds for finding $\epsilon$-stationary points of smooth
nonconvex functions using SGD with dropout that explicitly depend on the
dropout probability. Secondly, we obtain an upper bound on the rate of
convergence of Gradient Descent (GD) on the limiting ODEs of dropout algorithms
for NNs with the shape of arborescences of arbitrary depth and with linear
activation functions. The latter bound shows that for an algorithm such as
Dropout or Dropconnect (Wan et al., 2013), the convergence rate can be impaired
exponentially by the depth of the arborescence. In contrast, we experimentally
observe no such dependence for wide NNs with just a few dropout layers. We also
provide a heuristic argument for this observation. Our results suggest that
there is a change of scale of the effect of the dropout probability in the
convergence rate that depends on the relative size of the width of the NN
compared to its depth.

method to overcome the above disadvantage using a multilayer perceptron
network, which we call MagMLP, based on a back-propagation algorithm with one
input layer, five hidden layers, and one output layer. We use the data from the
\textit{Spectropolarimeter} (SP) on board \textit{Hinode} to simulate
single-wavelength observations for the model training, and take into account
the influence of the Doppler velocity field and the filling factor. The
training results show that the linear fitting coefficient (LFC) of the
transverse field reaches above 0.91, and that of the longitudinal field is
above 0.98. The generalization of the models is good because the corresponding
LFCs are above 0.9 for the test subsets. Compared with the linear calibration
method, the MagMLP is much more effective on dealing with the magnetic
saturation effect. Analyzing an active region, the results of the linear
calibration present an evident magnetic saturation effect in the umbra regions;
the corresponding systematic error reaches values greater than 1000 G in most
areas, or even exceeds 2000 G at some pixels. However, the results of MagMLP at
these locations are very close to the inversion results, and the systematic
errors are basically within 300 G. In addition, we find that there are many
""bright spots"" and ""dark spots"" on the inclination angle images from the
inversion results of \textit{Hinode}/SP with values of 180 and 0 degrees,
respectively, where the inversion is not reliable and does not produce a good

energy harvesters for energy autonomous sensor systems. In Industry 4.0 (or
Industrial IoT) applications, interconnected sensors provide a means of data
acquisition for automated control of the manufacturing process. Ensuring a
continuous energy supply to the sensors is essential for their reliable
operation. Manufacturing machines usually display a wide spectrum of vibration
frequencies which needs to be covered by an array of harvester substructures in
order to maintain the desired output level. We show that mechanical structures
designed to implement a Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator have an increased
bandwidth by exploiting several orders of parametric resonances. In contrast to
concepts implementing parametric amplification in a multi-mode scenario, our
concept is based on a single mechanical mode. Therefore, it is more robust
against fabrication tolerances as the relevant multi-mode resonance conditions
do not need to be matched on the level of single chips. Using exact transient
simulations and semi-analytic models to showcase the relation of the
Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator to the damped and driven Mathieu equation, we show
that parametric resonances highly increase the bandwidth of the output power
whenever high Helmholtz nonlinearities are present. To achieve the required
nonlinearities, we suggest nonlinear stress-strain curves and we propose to
achieve such nonlinearities through field-induced striction by magneto- or
electrostriction. Thus, we are able to propose a novel energy harvester concept
incorporating strictive materials that exploits the effects of parametric
excitation to achieve broadband vibrational energy harvesting.

graphene is inquired theoretically by simulations based on state-of-the-art
interatomic force fields. Results show that any typical cylinder-over-surface
approximation is essentially inaccurate. NTs tend to flatten at the interface
with the substrate and upon driving they can either roll or slide depending on
their size and on their relative orientation with the substrate. In the
epitaxially aligned orientation we find that rolling is always the main
mechanism of motion, producing a kinetic friction linearly growing with the
number of walls, in turn causing an unprecedented supra-linear scaling with the
contact area. A 30 degrees misalignment raises superlubric effects, making
sliding favorable against rolling. The resulting rolling-to-sliding transition
in misaligned NTs is explained in terms of the faceting appearing in large
multi-wall tubes, which is responsible for the increased rotational stiffness.
Modifying the geometrical conditions provides an additional means of
drastically tailoring the frictional properties in this unique tribological
system.

synergistic alignment of domains from both image and feature perspectives. In
particular, we simultaneously transform the appearance of images across domains
and enhance domain-invariance of the extracted features by leveraging
adversarial learning in multiple aspects and with a deeply supervised
mechanism. The feature encoder is shared between both adaptive perspectives to
leverage their mutual benefits via end-to-end learning. We have extensively
evaluated our method with cardiac substructure segmentation and abdominal
multi-organ segmentation for bidirectional cross-modality adaptation between

practical data can be approximated by low rank triple decomposition as long as
it can be approximated by low rank CP or Tucker decomposition. This theoretical
discovery is confirmed numerically. Numerical tests show that third order
tensor data from practical applications such as internet traffic and video

triple decomposition is proposed. Its convergence and convergence rate are
established. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of this method.

very crucial to seabed geophysical exploration. In this study, we use the
boundary integral method to investigate the highly non-spherical airgun-bubble
dynamics and its corresponding pressure wave emission. Moreover, a model is
proposed to also consider the process of air release from the airgun port,
which is found to be the most crucial factor to estimate the initial peak of
the pressure wave. The numerical simulations show good agreement with
experiments, in terms of non-spherical bubble shapes and pressure waves.
Thereafter, the effects of the port opening time $T\rm_{open}$, airgun firing
depth, heat transfer, and gravity are numerically investigated. We find that a
smaller $T\rm_{open}$ leads to a more violent air release that consequently
causes stronger high-frequency pressure wave emissions; however, the
low-frequency pressure waves are little affected. Additionally, the
non-spherical bubble dynamics is highly dependent on the Froude number $Fr$.
Starting from $Fr=2$, as $Fr$ increases, the jet contains lower kinetic energy,
resulting in a stronger energy focusing of the bubble collapse itself and thus
a larger pressure peak during the bubble collapse phase. For $Fr \ge 7$, the
spherical bubble theory becomes an appropriate description of the
airgun-bubble. The new findings of this study may provide a reference for
practical operations and designing environmentally friendly airguns in the near
future.

which is particularly problematic given the accelerating trend towards
specialized hardware devices to further increase efficiency.
  Many emerging DSLs used in performance demanding domains such as deep
learning, automatic differentiation, or image processing attempt to simplify or
even fully automate the optimization process. Using a high-level - often
functional - language, programmers focus on describing functionality in a
declarative way. In some systems such as Halide or TVM, a separate schedule
specifies how the program should be optimized. Unfortunately, these schedules
are not written in well-defined programming languages. Instead, they are
implemented as a set of ad-hoc predefined APIs that the compiler writers have
exposed.
  In this paper, we present Elevate: a functional language for describing
optimization strategies. Elevate follows a tradition of prior systems used in
different contexts that express optimization strategies as composition of
rewrites. In contrast to systems with scheduling APIs, in Elevate programmers
are not restricted to a set of built-in optimizations but define their own
optimization strategies freely in a composable way. We show how user-defined
optimization strategies in Elevate enable the effective optimization of
programs expressed in a functional data-parallel language demonstrating
competitive performance with Halide and TVM.

increasingly used for analyzing brain imaging data. Such studies typically
involve a small number of participants (n<100), where standard asymptotic
results often fail to appropriately control the type 1 error. This paper
presents two corrections improving the control of the type 1 error of Wald
tests in LVMs estimated using maximum likelihood (ML). First, we derive a
correction for the bias of the ML estimator of the variance parameters. This
enables us to estimate corrected standard errors for model parameters and
corrected Wald statistics. Second, we use a Student's t-distribution instead of
a Gaussian distribution to account for the variability of the variance
estimator. The degrees of freedom of the Student's t-distributions are
estimated using a Satterthwaite approximation. A simulation study based on data
from two published brain imaging studies demonstrates that combining these two
corrections provides superior control of the type 1 error rate compared to the
uncorrected Wald test, despite being conservative for some parameters. The
proposed methods are implemented in the R package lavaSearch2 available at

of planets triggering these structures. The observation of N dark rings of
emission is often interpreted as evidence for the presence of N planets which
clear dust gaps around their orbit and form dust-trapping pressure maxima in
the disk. The vast majority of the models that studied the impact of planets on
the dynamics of dust and gas in a protoplanetary disk assumed planets on fixed
orbits. Here we go a different route and examine how the large-scale inward
migration of a single planet structures the dust content of a massive disk. In
many circumstances, the migration of a partial gap-opening planet with a mass
comparable to Saturn is found to run away intermittently. By means of 2D gas
and dust hydrodynamical simulations, we show that intermittent runaway
migration can form multiple dust rings and gaps across the disk. Each time
migration slows down, a pressure maximum forms beyond the planet gap that traps
the large dust. Post-processing of our simulations results with 3D dust
radiative transfer calculations confirms that intermittent runaway migration
can lead to the formation of multiple sets of bright and dark rings of
continuum emission in the (sub)millimeter beyond the planet location.

functional $W$ is directly related to the reduced density matrix $\hat\rho$

across different camera views, is an important task in visual surveillance.
Substantial development of re-id has recently been observed, and the majority
of existing models are largely dependent on color appearance and assume that
pedestrians do not change their clothes across camera views. This limitation,
however, can be an issue for re-id when tracking a person at different places
and at different time if that person (e.g., a criminal suspect) changes his/her
clothes, causing most existing methods to fail, since they are heavily relying
on color appearance and thus they are inclined to match a person to another
person wearing similar clothes. In this work, we call the person re-id under
clothing change the ""cross-clothes person re-id"". In particular, we consider
the case when a person only changes his clothes moderately as a first attempt
at solving this problem based on visible light images; that is we assume that a
person wears clothes of a similar thickness, and thus the shape of a person
would not change significantly when the weather does not change substantially
within a short period of time. We perform cross-clothes person re-id based on a
contour sketch of person image to take advantage of the shape of the human body
instead of color information for extracting features that are robust to
moderate clothing change. Due to the lack of a large-scale dataset for
cross-clothes person re-id, we contribute a new dataset that consists of 33698
images from 221 identities. Our experiments illustrate the challenges of
cross-clothes person re-id and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) presents the drawback of accumulating position

poses an obstacle to the performance of teleoperation and may prevent the
successful accomplishment of such tasks. Several techniques have been developed
in order to solve the position-drift problem in TDPA-based teleoperation.
However, they either present poor transparency by over-conservatively
constraining force feedback or add high impulse-like force signals that can be
harmful to the hardware and to the human operator. We propose a new approach to
compensate position drift in TDPA-based teleoperation in a smoother way, which
keeps the forces within the normal range of the teleoperation task while
preserving the level of transparency and the robust stability of energy-based
TDPA. We also add a way of tuning the compensator to behave in accordance with
the task being performed, whether it requires faster or smoother compensation.
The feasibility and performance of the method were experimentally validated.
Good position tracking and regular-amplitude forces are demonstrated with up to
500 ms round-trip constant and variable delays for hard-wall contacts.

technique, which involves tracing the arms of spiral galaxies on images
observed in different wavelengths. Density wave theory predicts that spiral
arms observed from different wavelengths show a phase crossing at the
co-rotation radius. For the purpose of this study, 20 nearby galaxies were
analyzed in four different wavelengths with pitch angle measurements performed
by two independent methods. We used optical wavelength images ($B$-band 440nm),
two infrared wavelength images provided by Spitzer (3.6$\mu$m and 8$\mu$m) and
ultraviolet images from GALEX (1350\AA, 1750\AA). The results were compared and
verified with other records found in the literature. We then found rotation
curve data for six of our galaxies and used our co-rotation radii estimates to
measure the time that would elapse between star formation and moving to their
observed positions in the $B$-band spirals. The average time lapse for this

learning framework combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for each robot
to extract messages from the visual inputs, and a graph neural network (GNN)
over the entire swarm to transmit, receive and process these messages in order
to decide on actions. The use of a GNN and locally-run CNNs results naturally
in a decentralized controller. We jointly train the CNNs and the GNN so that
each robot learns to extract messages from the images that are adequate for the
team as a whole. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed architecture in the

similar operations are bundled together into a single transaction in order to
optimize gas consumption on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, some costly
verifications are replaced by a challenge game, pushing most of the computing
cost off-chain. This results in a gas reduction of the transfer costs of three
orders of magnitude, achieving around 1700 transactions per second on the
Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, it includes many relevant features, like
meta-transactions for end-user operation without ether, and key-locked payments
for atomic exchange of digital goods.

adversary makes over-the-air transmissions that are received as superimposed
with the transmitter's signals to fool the classifier at the receiver into
making errors. While this evasion attack has received growing interest
recently, the channel effects from the adversary to the receiver have been
ignored so far such that the previous attack mechanisms cannot be applied under
realistic channel effects. In this paper, we present how to launch a realistic
evasion attack by considering channels from the adversary to the receiver. Our
results show that modulation classification is vulnerable to an adversarial
attack over a wireless channel that is modeled as Rayleigh fading with path
loss and shadowing. We present various adversarial attacks with respect to
availability of information about channel, transmitter input, and classifier

targeted attack (with minimum power) and non-targeted attack that aims to
change the classification to a target label or to any other label other than
the true label, respectively. Both are white-box attacks that are transmitter
input-specific and use channel information. Then we introduce an algorithm to
generate adversarial attacks using limited channel information where the
adversary only knows the channel distribution. Finally, we present a black-box
universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) attack where the adversary has limited
knowledge about both channel and transmitter input.

the distributed network slicing for a massive scale IoT network supported by 5G

supported by both spectrum resource offered by 5G network and computational
resourc of the fog computing network. We propose a novel distributed framework
based on a new control plane entity, federated-orchestrator , which can
coordinate the spectrum and computational resources without requiring any
exchange of the local data and resource information from BSs. We propose a
distributed resource allocation algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers with Partial Variable Splitting . We prove DistADMM-PVS
minimizes the average service response time of the entire network with
guaranteed worst-case performance for all supported types of services when the
coordination between the F-orchestrator and BSs is perfectly synchronized.
Motivated by the observation that coordination synchronization may result in
high coordination delay that can be intolerable when the network is large in
scale, we propose a novel asynchronized ADMM algorithm. We prove that AsynADMM
can converge to the global optimal solution with improved scalability and
negligible coordination delay. We evaluate the performance of our proposed
framework using two-month of traffic data collected in a in-campus smart
transportation system supported by a 5G network. Extensive simulation has been
conducted for both pedestrian and vehicular-related services during peak and

is by looking at the asymptotic distributions of the masses (sum of the

which is intimately related to the excursion lengths of certain L\'evy-type
processes. We, instead, look at the metric structure of these components and
prove their Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov convergence to a class of random compact
measured metric spaces that have been introduced in a companion paper. Our
asymptotic regimes relate directly to the general convergence condition
appearing in the work of Aldous and Limic. Our techniques provide a unified
approach for this general ""critical"" regime, and relies upon two key
ingredients: an encoding of the graph by some L\'evy process as well as an
embedding of its connected components into Galton-Watson forests. This
embedding transfers asymptotically into an embedding of the limit objects into
a forest of L\'evy trees, which allows us to give an explicit construction of

value an agent gets from the allocation and the subsidies.
  We consider the natural optimization problem of computing allocations that
are {\em envy-freeable} using the minimum amount of subsidies. As the problem
is NP-hard, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms. On the positive
side, we present an algorithm that, for a constant number of agents,
approximates the minimum amount of subsidies within any required accuracy, at
the expense of a graceful increase in the running time. On the negative side,
we show that, for a super-constant number of agents, the problem of minimizing
subsidies for envy-freeness is not only hard to compute exactly (as a folklore
argument shows) but also, more importantly, hard to approximate.

benefits to greatly enhance applications such as downloading big amounts of
data from LEO satellites by using the GEO satellite as a relay. By using this
strategy, the total availability of the LEO satellite increases from less than
1% if the data is downloaded directly to the ground up to about 60% if the data
is relayed through GEO. The main drawback of using a GEO relay is that link
budget is much more difficult to close due to the much larger distance.
However, this can be partially compensated by transmitting at a lower data
rate, and still benefiting from the much-higher link availability when compared
to LEO-to-ground downlinks, which additionally are more limited by the clouds
than the relay option. After carrying out a feasibility study, NICT and the
University of Tokyo started preparing a mission to demonstrate the technologies
needed to perform these challenging lasercom links. Furthermore, to demonstrate
the feasibility of this technique, an extremely-small satellite, i.e. a 6U
CubeSat, will be used to achieve data rates as high as 10 Gbit/s between LEO

size, weight and power available in the CubeSat, the accurate pointing
precision required for the lasercom link, and the difficulties of closing the
link at such a high speed as 10 Gbit/s.

cannot take advantage of the multiple antennas to improve the average provided
energy, its dispersion can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, AA-SS provides
the greatest average energy, but also the greatest energy dispersion, and the
gains depend critically on the mean phase shifts between the antenna elements.
We find that consecutive antennas must be $\pi$ phase-shifted for optimum
average energy performance under AA-SS. Our numerical results evidenced that
correlation is beneficial under AA-SS, while a greater line of sight (LOS)

method. Using the aforementioned method we define 'excited' states for the
Bianchi VIII wave function and construct leading order 'excited' states which
appear to be a hybrid of scattering and bound states. Also six new solutions
for the $\Lambda \ne 0$ Bianchi VIII Euclidean-signature Hamilton Jacobi
equation are presented which can be used to construct semi-classical states
corresponding to the Lorentzian signature symmetry reduced Wheeler DeWitt
equation. In addition, new solutions to the Euclidean-signature Hamilton Jacobi
equation for the Bianchi VIII models are found when $\Lambda \ne 0$ and an
aligned primordial magnetic field is present. Furthermore, we find eight new
complex solutions to the Euclidean-signature Hamilton Jacobi equation for the
case when matter is not present, which can be used to construct additional
semi-classical states. We also study the leading order wave functions which
result from our aforementioned solutions when they are restricted to the
$\beta+$ axis. Prior to presenting these results we explain the
Euclidean-signature semi classical method and discuss how to solve the
resultant equations this method generates when it is applied to the
Lorentzian-signature symmetry reduced Bianchi VIII Wheeler DeWitt equation. The
Euclidean-signature semi-classical method used here is applicable to other
field theories as well. The work presented throughout this paper further shows
the power Eulclidean-signature semi classical methods possess for solving
problems in quantum cosmology and solving Lorentzian signature problems in
general.

can be categorized into strategic and tactical domains. The strategical
techniques mainly concern airport slot allocation and for the tactical domain,
the ATFM function has several solutions available that range from the ground
and air holding to rerouting actions, which have not gained significant
efficiency in ATFM delay mitigation due to the fact that delays become apparent
only on the tactical level when the strategic flight plan has been filled
already. To tackle and address this problem there is a need for an algorithm
that can synchronize strategical and tactical schedules. To fill this gap, in
this paper the concept of fair buffer scheduling is proposed which can
potentially contribute to strategical and tactical operations synchronization
that would result in ATFM delay mitigation by increasing the system's
robustness. The objective is to obtain an optimum fair and efficient buffer
choice that mitigates ATFM delay and increases the stakeholders' welfare. Each
appropriate and efficient approach requires a comprehensive understanding of
the strategical buffer scheduling. This study presents a delay cost and flight
buffer model that could be used for generating optimal buffer times to be
considered as the initial population for the optimization problem to
investigate the viability of employing fairness measures to obtain schedules
with different trade-offs between cost, delay, and fairness.

a key challenge in ecology and ecosystem management. The apparent decline of
insect populations necessitates more biomonitoring but the time-consuming
sorting and identification of taxa pose strong limitations on how many insect
samples can be processed. In turn, this affects the scale of efforts to map
invertebrate diversity altogether. Given recent advances in computer vision, we
propose to replace the standard manual approach of human expert-based sorting
and identification with an automatic image-based technology. We describe a
robot-enabled image-based identification machine, which can automate the
process of invertebrate identification, biomass estimation and sample sorting.
We use the imaging device to generate a comprehensive image database of
terrestrial arthropod species. We use this database to test the classification
accuracy i.e. how well the species identity of a specimen can be predicted from
images taken by the machine. We also test sensitivity of the classification
accuracy to the camera settings (aperture and exposure time) in order to move
forward with the best possible image quality. We use state-of-the-art Resnet-50

can easily be used for other groups of invertebrates as well. As such, our

Hierarchical Graph Attention Network(HGAT), which uses a novel hierarchical
attention mechanism to perform node representation learning in HIN, and then
detects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments on two
real-world fake news datasets show that HGAT can outperform text-based models

The visualization of the choroid is hindered by the vessel shadows from the
superficial layers of the inner retina. In this paper, we propose to
incorporate medical and imaging prior knowledge with deep learning to address
these two problems. We propose a biomarker infused global-to-local network for
the choroid segmentation. It leverages the choroidal thickness, a primary
biomarker in clinic, as a constraint to improve the segmentation accuracy. We
also design a global-to-local strategy in the choroid segmentation: a global
module is used to segment all the retinal and choroidal layers simultaneously
for suppressing overfitting and providing global structure information, then a
local module is used to refine the segmentation with the biomarker infusion. To
eliminate the retinal vessel shadows, we propose a pipeline that firstly use
anatomical and OCT imaging knowledge to locate the shadows using their
projection on the retinal pigment epithelium layer, then the contents of the
choroidal vasculature at the shadow locations are predicted with an
edge-to-texture generative adversarial inpainting network. The experiments show
our method outperforms the existing methods on both the segmentation and shadow
elimination tasks. We further apply the proposed method in a clinical

utilization of multipliers by designing the computational circuit with the same

computations to fixed hardware. In addition, a specially designed filter
circuit simultaneously provides all the data of the receptive field, using only
one memory read operation during each clock cycle; this allows the computation
circuit to operate seamlessly without idle cycles. Our reference system based
on the proposed architecture uses 97% of the peak-multiplication capability in
actual computations required by the computation model throughout the

proportion of the resources constituting the non-multiplier components is
smaller than that constituting the multiplier components, which are
indispensable for the computational model. The efficiency of the proposed

several privacy and security concerns that are actively studied in recent
years. On the other hand, given the ability of today's browsers to load dynamic
web pages with complex animations and Javascript, online advertising has also
transformed and can have a significant impact on webpage performance. The
performance cost of online ads is critical since it eventually impacts user
satisfaction as well as their Internet bill and device energy consumption.
  In this paper, we apply an in-depth and first-of-a-kind performance
evaluation of web ads. Unlike prior efforts that rely primarily on adblockers,
we perform a fine-grained analysis on the web browser's page loading process to
demystify the performance cost of web ads. We aim to characterize the cost by
every component of an ad, so the publisher, ad syndicate, and advertiser can
improve the ad's performance with detailed guidance. For this purpose, we
develop an infrastructure, adPerf, for the Chrome browser that classifies page
loading workloads into ad-related and main-content at the granularity of
browser activities (such as Javascript and Layout). Our evaluations show that
online advertising entails more than 15% of browser page loading workload and
approximately 88% of that is spent on JavaScript. We also track the sources and
delivery chain of web ads and analyze performance considering the origin of the
ad contents. We observe that 2 of the well-known third-party ad domains
contribute to 35% of the ads performance cost and surprisingly, top news
websites implicitly include unknown third-party ads which in some cases build
up to more than 37% of the ads performance cost.

It also brings complexity to the features involving multiple RATs, e.g., dual

form factors can be used to calculate the $B^+ \rightarrow \rho^+ {\mu}^+
{\mu}^-$ rare decay branching ratio.

  Approach","24 pages, 1 figure, 1 table","Journal of Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism (2020)","10.1007/s10948-019-05337-9",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Bozovic et al. reported that [Nature 536, 309-311 (2016)], in the
overdoped side of the single-crystal $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ (LSCO) films, the
transition temperature $T_c$ and zero-temperature superfluid phase stiffness
$\rho_s(0)$ will obey a two-class scaling law: $T_c=\gamma \cdot
\sqrt{\rho_s(0)}$ for $T_c \leq T_Q$ and $T_c \propto \rho_s(0)$ for $T_c \geq
T_M$, where $\gamma=(4.2 \pm 0.5) K^{1/2} $, $T_Q \approx 15 K$, and $T_M
\approx 12 K$. They further pointed out that the parabolic scaling observed in
the highly overdoped side indicates a quantum phase transition from a
superconductor to a normal metal. In this paper, we propose a quantum partition
function (QPF) for zero-temperature Cooper pairs, by which one can effectively
distinguish between mean-field and quantum critical behaviors. We theoretically
show that the two-class scaling law can be exactly derived by using the QPF,
and the theoretical values of $\gamma$, $T_Q$, and $T_M$ are well in accordance
with experimental measure values. Our analyses indicate that the linear scaling
$T_c \propto \rho_s(0)$ is a mean-field behavior, while the parabolic scaling
$T_c=\gamma \cdot \sqrt{\rho_s(0)}$ is a quantum critical behavior.
