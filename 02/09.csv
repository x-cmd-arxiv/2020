combination of re-parametrization of the so-called EGNB2 and transmuted
exponential distributions. This combination aims to modify the transmuted
exponential distribution via the incorporation of an additional parameter,
mainly adding a high degree of flexibility on the mode and impacting the
skewness and kurtosis of the tail. We explore some mathematical properties of
this distribution including the hazard rate function, moments, the moment
generating function, the quantile function, various entropy measures and
(reversed) residual life functions. A statistical study investigates estimation
of the parameters using the method of maximum likelihood. The distribution
along with other existing distributions are fitted to two environmental data
sets and its superior performance is assessed by using some goodness-of-fit
tests. As a result, some environmental measures associated with these data are
obtained such as the return level and mean deviation about this level.

growth is faster for porous grains, enabling them to transition to the Stokes

independent Poisson processes at the same rate and independently abandon the
market if not matched after an exponential amount of time with the same mean.
In this centralized market, the utility for the system manager from matching
any buyer and any seller is a general random variable. We consider a sequence
of systems indexed by $n$ where the arrivals in the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ system
are sped up by a factor of $n$. We analyze two families of one-parameter
policies: the population threshold policy immediately matches an arriving agent
to its best available mate only if the number of mates in the system is above a
threshold, and the utility threshold policy matches an arriving agent to its
best available mate only if the corresponding utility is above a threshold.
Using a fluid analysis of the two-dimensional Markov process of buyers and
sellers, we show that when the matching utility distribution is light-tailed,
the population threshold policy with threshold $\frac{n}{\ln n}$ is
asymptotically optimal among all policies that make matches only at agent
arrival epochs. In the heavy-tailed case, we characterize the optimal threshold
level for both policies. We also study the utility threshold policy in an
unbalanced matching market with heavy-tailed matching utilities and find that
the buyers and sellers have the same asymptotically optimal utility threshold.
We derive optimal thresholds when the matching utility distribution is
exponential, uniform, Pareto, and correlated Pareto. We find that as the right
tail of the matching utility distribution gets heavier, the threshold level of
each policy (and hence market thickness) increases, as does the magnitude by
which the utility threshold policy outperforms the population threshold policy.

observed channel output. In multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
setups, where multiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted, accurate symbol
detection is challenging. A family of algorithms capable of reliably recovering
multiple symbols is based on interference cancellation. However, these methods
assume that the channel is linear, a model which does not reflect many relevant
channels, as well as require accurate channel state information (CSI), which
may not be available. In this work we propose a multiuser MIMO receiver which
learns to jointly detect in a data-driven fashion, without assuming a specific
channel model or requiring CSI. In particular, we propose a data-driven
implementation of the iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm
which we refer to as DeepSIC. The resulting symbol detector is based on
integrating dedicated machine-learning (ML) methods into the iterative SIC
algorithm. DeepSIC learns to carry out joint detection from a limited set of
training samples without requiring the channel to be linear and its parameters
to be known. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that for linear channels
with full CSI, DeepSIC approaches the performance of iterative SIC, which is
comparable to the optimal performance, and outperforms previously proposed
ML-based MIMO receivers. Furthermore, in the presence of CSI uncertainty,
DeepSIC significantly outperforms model-based approaches. Finally, we show that
DeepSIC accurately detects symbols in non-linear channels, where conventional
iterative SIC fails even when accurate CSI is available.

the model takes into account internal factors such as the ethical quality of

measuring the impact of macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth and the
corruption perception upon the severity and frequency of losses implied by the

that country specific corruption perceptions positively affects internal fraud

planned contact configurations and monitoring undesired slip events; and 2)
control the object state by tactile-based tracking and iterative replanning of
the object and robot trajectories.
  Key to this formulation is the decomposition of manipulation plans into
sequences of manipulation primitives with simple mechanics and efficient
planners. We consider the scenario of manipulating an object from an initial
pose to a target pose on a flat surface while correcting for external

has been shown to produce good robustness guarantees against $\ell_2$-norm
bounded adversaries. In this work, we show that extending the smoothing
technique to defend against other attack models can be challenging, especially
in the high-dimensional regime. In particular, for a vast class of
i.i.d.~smoothing distributions, we prove that the largest $\ell_p$-radius that
can be certified decreases as $O(1/d^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}})$ with
dimension $d$ for $p > 2$. Notably, for $p \geq 2$, this dependence on $d$ is
no better than that of the $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified using
isotropic Gaussian smoothing, essentially putting a matching lower bound on the
robustness radius. When restricted to {\it generalized} Gaussian smoothing,
these two bounds can be shown to be within a constant factor of each other in
an asymptotic sense, establishing that Gaussian smoothing provides the best
possible results, up to a constant factor, when $p \geq 2$. We present
experimental results on CIFAR to validate our theory. For other smoothing

attention from researchers. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of
convolutional neural networks (without a pooling layer) based on probability
fusion for automated pavement crack detection and measurement. Specifically, an
ensemble of convolutional neural networks was employed to identify the
structure of small cracks with raw images. Secondly, outputs of the individual
convolutional neural network model for the ensemble were averaged to produce
the final crack probability value of each pixel, which can obtain a predicted
probability map. Finally, the predicted morphological features of the cracks
were measured by using the skeleton extraction algorithm. To validate the
proposed method, some experiments were performed on two public crack databases
(CFD and AigleRN) and the results of the different state-of-the-art methods
were compared. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the other methods. For crack measurement, the crack length and
width can be measure based on different crack types (complex, common, thin, and
intersecting cracks.). The results show that the proposed algorithm can be
effectively applied for crack measurement.

real positivity is often the right replacement in a general algebra $A$ for
positivity in C*-algebras. We then apply this to studying contractive
projections (`conditional expectations') and isometries of operator algebras.
For example we generalize and find variants of certain classical results on
positive projections on C*-algebras and JB algebras due to Choi, Effros,
St{\o}rmer, Friedman and Russo, and others. In previous work with Neal we had
done the `completely contractive' case; we focus here on describing the real

several new and complementary results on this topic due to the author, indeed
this new work constitutes most of Section 5. Finally, in the last section we
describe a related part of some recent joint work with Labuschagne on what we
consider to be a good noncommutative generalization of the `characters' (i.e.
homomorphisms into the scalars) on an algebra. Such characters are a special
case of the projections mentioned above, and are shown to be intimately related
to conditional expectations. The idea is to try to use these to generalize

comprised of electromagnetic modes and atomic polarization, is considered. It
is shown that the start of coherent generation at the laser threshold is
preceded by the formation of a special hybrid state at the lasing
pre-threshold. This special state is characterized by an enhanced coupling
among excited atoms and electromagnetic modes. This leads to an increase in the
rate of stimulated emission in the special state and, ultimately, to lasing. At
the lasing pre-threshold, the transformation of hybrid eigenstates has the
features of an exceptional point (EP) observed in non-Hermitian systems. The
special state is formed when eigenfrequencies of two hybrid states coalesce or
come close to each other. Below the pre-threshold, lifetimes of all hybrid
states grow with increasing pump rate. When the pump rate crosses the
pre-threshold, resonance trapping occurs with the lifetime of the special state
continuing to increase while the lifetimes of all other eigenstates begin to
decrease. Consequently, the latter eigenstates do not participate in the
lasing. Thus, above the pre-threshold, a laser transitions into the single-mode
regime.

traverse and explore them for enterprise transactions and mining. Temporal
property graphs are a recent variant where time is a first-class entity to be
queried over, and their properties and structure vary over time. These are seen
in social, telecom, transit and epidemic networks. However, current graph
databases and query engines have limited support for temporal relations among
graph entities, no support for time-varying entities and/or do not scale on
distributed resources. We address this gap by extending a linear path query
model over property graphs to include intuitive temporal predicates and
aggregation operators over temporal graphs. We design a distributed execution
model for these temporal path queries using the interval-centric computing
model, and develop a novel cost model to select an efficient execution plan
from several. We perform detailed experiments of our Granite distributed query
engine using both static and dynamic temporal property graphs as large as 52M
vertices, 218M edges and 325M properties, and a 1600-query workload, derived
from the LDBC benchmark. We often offer sub-second query latencies on a
commodity cluster, which is 149x-1140x faster compared to industry-leading
Neo4J shared-memory graph database and the JanusGraph / Spark distributed graph

compared to only 32-92% workload completion by the baseline systems. Further,
our cost model selects a query plan that is within 10% of the optimal execution

exhibit a weak-scaling efficiency >= 60% on 8 nodes and >= 40% on 16 nodes, for

mostly due to the availability of large-scale face images dataset that can be
exploited by deep neural networks to learn powerful face representations.
However, recent research has shown differences in face recognition performance
across different ethnic groups mostly due to the racial imbalance in the
training datasets where Caucasian identities largely dominate other
ethnicities. This is actually symptomatic of the under-representation of
non-Caucasian ethnic groups in the celebdom from which face datasets are
usually gathered, rendering the acquisition of labeled data of the
under-represented groups challenging. In this paper, we propose an Asymmetric
Rejection Loss, which aims at making full use of unlabeled images of those
under-represented groups, to reduce the racial bias of face recognition models.
We view each unlabeled image as a unique class, however as we cannot guarantee
that two unlabeled samples are from a distinct class we exploit both labeled
and unlabeled data in an asymmetric manner in our loss formalism. Extensive
experiments show our method's strength in mitigating racial bias, outperforming
state-of-the-art semi-supervision methods. Performance on the under-represented
ethnicity groups increases while that on the well-represented group is nearly
unchanged.

adaptation with multiple source domains, we propose to use a graphical model as
a compact way to encode the change property of the joint distribution, which
can be learned from data, and then view domain adaptation as a problem of
Bayesian inference on the graphical models. Such a graphical model
distinguishes between constant and varied modules of the distribution and
specifies the properties of the changes across domains, which serves as prior
knowledge of the changing modules for the purpose of deriving the posterior of
the target variable $Y$ in the target domain. This provides an end-to-end
framework of domain adaptation, in which additional knowledge about how the
joint distribution changes, if available, can be directly incorporated to
improve the graphical representation. We discuss how causality-based domain
adaptation can be put under this umbrella. Experimental results on both

this approach enables the investigation of nonlinear phenomena whose

extract information about transition phenomena (e.g., mean exit time and escape
probability), from data of stochastic differential equations with non-Gaussian
L\'evy noise. As a tool in describing dynamical systems, the Koopman semigroup
transforms a nonlinear system into a linear system, but at the cost of
elevating a finite dimensional problem into an infinite dimensional one. In
spite of this, using the relation between the stochastic Koopman semigroup and
the infinitesimal generator of a stochastic differential equation, we learn the
mean exit time and escape probability from data. Specifically, we first obtain
a finite dimensional approximation of the infinitesimal generator by an
extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm. Then we identify the drift
coefficient, diffusion coefficient and anomalous diffusion coefficient for the
stochastic differential equation. Finally, we compute the mean exit time and
escape probability by finite difference discretization of the associated
nonlocal partial differential equations. This approach is applicable in
extracting transition information from data of stochastic differential

link privacy preserving and propose the target-link privacy preserving (TPP)
model: target links referred to as targets are the most important and sensitive
objectives that would be intentionally attacked by adversaries, in order that
need privacy protections, while other links of less privacy concerns are
properly released to maintain the graph utility. The goal of TPP is to limit
the target disclosure by deleting a budget limited set of alternative
non-target links referred to as protectors to defend the adversarial link
predictions for all targets. Traditional link privacy preserving treated all
links as targets and concentrated on structural level protections in which
serious link disclosure and high graph utility loss is still the bottleneck of
graph releasing today, while TPP focuses on the target level protections in
which key protection is implemented on a tiny fraction of critical targets to
achieve better privacy protection and lower graph utility loss. Currently there
is a lack of clear TPP problem definition, provable optimal or near optimal
protector selection algorithms and scalable implementations on large-scale
social graphs. Firstly, we introduce the TPP model and propose a dissimilarity
function used for measuring the defense ability against privacy analyzing for
the targets. We consider two different problems by budget assignment settings:
1) we protect all targets and to optimize the dissimilarity of all targets with
a single budget; 2) besides the protections of all targets, we also care about
the protection of each target by assigning a local budget to every target,
considering two local protector selections. We also implement scalable
implementations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed algorithms.

optimal dynamic reinsurance policy and dynamic dividend strategy, which are
state-dependent, for an insurance company that operates under multiple
insurance lines of business. The aggregate claims model with a
thinning-dependence structure is adopted for the risk process. In the
optimization method, the maximum of the cumulative expected discounted dividend
payouts with respect to the dividend and reinsurance strategies are considered
as value function. This value function is characterized as the smallest super
Viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman (HJB) equation.
The finite difference method (FDM) has been utilized for the numerical solution
of the value function and the optimal control strategy and the proof for the
convergence of this numerical solution to the value function is provided. The
findings of this paper provide insights for the insurance companies as such
that based upon the lines in which they are operating, they can choose a vector
of the optimal dynamic reinsurance strategies and consequently transfer some

tight bound for $M=2^{n-1}$ derived by Kahn, Kalai, and Linial in 1989.
Moreover, our bound is also tight for $M=2^{n-2}$ and $r\le\frac{n}{2}-1$. Our

a CNN pruning method based on filter attenuation in which weak filters are not

In the proposed attenuation approach, weak filters are not abruptly removed,

the well-known piano mover's problem where a robot pushing an object must plan
its movements as well as those of the object. This requires simultaneous
planning in the joint space of the robot and the configuration space of the
object, in contrast to the original problem which only requires planning in the
latter space. The effects of a robot action on the object configuration are
determined by the non-invertible rigid body mechanics. Second, I consider
planning under uncertainty and in particular planning for information effects.
I consider the case where a robot has to reach and grasp an object under pose
uncertainty caused by shape incompleteness. The approach presented in this
report is to study and possibly extend a new approach to artificial
intelligence (A.I.) which has emerged in the last years in response to the
necessity of building intelligent controllers for agents operating in
unstructured stochastic environments. Such agents require the ability to learn
by interaction with its environment an optimal action-selection behaviour. The
main issue is that real-world problems are usually dynamic and unpredictable.
Thus, the agent needs to update constantly its current image of the world using
its sensors, which provide only a noisy description of the surrounding
environment. Although there are different schools of thinking, with their own
set of techniques, a brand new direction which unifies many A.I. researches is
to formalise such agent/environment interactions as embedded systems with
stochastic dynamics.

prior, i.e., fine-grained facial components, to attain a frontal HR face image
with authentic details. In the fine-level FHnet, we also design a facial
component-aware module that adopts the facial geometry guidance as clues to
accurately align and merge the frontal coarse HR face and prior information.
Meanwhile, two-level discriminators are designed to capture both the global
outline of a face image as well as detailed facial characteristics. The
Coarse-D enforces the coarsely hallucinated faces to be upright and complete
while the Fine-D focuses on the fine hallucinated ones for sharper details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VividGAN achieves photo-realistic

Although the past decade has witnessed progress in action recognition with the
development of deep learning, such process has been slow in competitive sports

competitive sports video clips, we introduce a Figure Skating Dataset (FSD-10)
for finegrained sports content analysis. To this end, we collect 1484 clips
from the worldwide figure skating championships in 2017-2018, which consist of
10 different actions in men/ladies programs. Each clip is at a rate of 30
frames per second with resolution 1080 $\times$ 720. These clips are then
annotated by experts in type, grade of execution, skater info, .etc. To build a
baseline for action recognition in figure skating, we evaluate state-of-the-art
action recognition methods on FSD-10. Motivated by the idea that domain
knowledge is of great concern in sports field, we propose a keyframe based
temporal segment network (KTSN) for classification and achieve remarkable
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that FSD-10 is an ideal dataset
for benchmarking action recognition algorithms, as it requires to accurately
extract action motions rather than action poses. We hope FSD-10, which is
designed to have a large collection of finegrained actions, can serve as a new
challenge to develop more robust and advanced action recognition models.

inner emissivity profile indicating a compact corona as the primary source is
required in order to achieve a good fit. In addition, a reflection model with a
lamp-post configuration (relxilllp), which is normally invoked to explain the
steep emissivity profile, gives a worse fit and is excluded at 99% confidence

arbitrarily closely approximated by an inner function associated to the

availability of channel state information (CSI), namely, blind relaying and
CSI-assisted relaying. We further consider two energy harvesting (EH)
techniques, i.e., instantaneous EH (IEH) and average EH (AEH). Capitalizing on
the derived analytical results, we present a detailed numerical investigation
of the diversity order for the underlying scenarios under the impulsive noise
assumption. For the case when two relays and the availability of a direct link,
it is demonstrated that the considered SWIPT system with blind AEH-relaying is
able to achieve an asymptotic diversity order of less than 3, which is equal to
the diversity order achieved by CSI-assisted IEH-relaying. This result suggests
that, by employing the blind AEH relaying, the power consumption of the network
can be reduced, due to eliminating the need of CSI estimation. This can be
achieved without any performance loss. Our results further show that placing
the relays close to the source can significantly mitigate the detrimental
effects of impulsive noise. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation results are

a surrogate reward function $\tilde r$ for the discounted setting that induces

Theoretically, we show that there exists a surrogate reward that leads to

process of the plasma density grating. In the first model, a nonlinear
analytical solution based on the fluid equations is presented while in the
second model a particle-mesh method is adopted to investigate the kinetic
effects. It is found that both models can describe the plasma density grating
formation at different stages, well beyond the linear growth stage. More
importantly, the second model can reproduce the phenomenon of ""ion
wave-breaking"" of plasma density grating, which eventually induces the
saturation of plasma density grating. Using the second model, the saturation
time of the plasma density grating is obtained as a function of laser intensity
and plasma density, which can be applied to estimate the lifetime of the plasma
density grating in experiments. The results from these two nonlinear models are
verified using particle-in-cell simulations.

remains a challenging task due to the massive computational cost. Designing
lightweight networks is a possible solution, but it may degrade the recognition
performance. In this paper, we innovatively propose a general dynamic inference
idea to improve inference efficiency by leveraging the variation in the
distinguishability of different videos. The dynamic inference approach can be
achieved from aspects of the network depth and the number of input video
frames, or even in a joint input-wise and network depth-wise manner. In a
nutshell, we treat input frames and network depth of the computational graph as
a 2-dimensional grid, and several checkpoints are placed on this grid in
advance with a prediction module. The inference is carried out progressively on
the grid by following some predefined route, whenever the inference process
comes across a checkpoint, an early prediction can be made depending on whether
the early stop criteria meets. For the proof-of-concept purpose, we instantiate
three dynamic inference frameworks using two well-known backbone CNNs. In these
instances, we overcome the drawback of limited temporal coverage resulted from
an early prediction by a novel frame permutation scheme, and alleviate the
conflict between progressive computation and video temporal relation modeling
by introducing an online temporal shift module. Extensive experiments are
conducted to thoroughly analyze the effectiveness of our ideas and to inspire
future research efforts. Results on various datasets also evident the
superiority of our approach.

has been recently analyzed in the context of two-flavor neutrino mixing and
oscillations. It has been shown that the decay rates as measured by an inertial
and comoving observer are in agreement, provided that: i) the thermal nature of
the accelerated vacuum (Unruh effect) is taken into account; ii) the asymptotic
behavior of neutrinos is described through flavor (rather than mass)
eigenstates; iii) the Unruh radiation is made up of oscillating neutrinos. Here
we extend the above considerations to a more realistic scenario including three
generations of Dirac neutrinos. By following the outlined recipe, we find that
the equality between the two rates still holds true, confirming that mixing is
perfectly consistent with the General Covariance of Quantum Field Theory.
Notably, we prove that the analysis of CP violation in neutrino oscillations

representation of asymptotic neutrino states. Our approach is finally discussed

tested using 200 ISS images. Preliminary experimental results show that it can
remove the false image stars in more than 95% of ISS images with disk-resolved

detection based on Circular Hough Transform (CHT) by 17%. In addition, its
speed is more than twice as fast as that of the CHT method. It is also more

derive a uniform Bahadur representation and a strong Gaussian approximation

important to effectively aggregate data from multiple sites for robust model

in images. Recently, learning based image compression has achieved significant
progress by using the powerful representation ability from neural networks.
However, the current state-of-the-art learning based image compression methods
suffer from the huge computational cost, which limits their capacity for
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called
Efficient Deep Image Compression (EDIC) based on three new technologies,
including a channel attention module, a Gaussian mixture model and a
decoder-side enhancement module. Specifically, we design an auto-encoder style
network for learning based image compression. To improve the coding efficiency,
we exploit the channel relationship between latent representations by using the
channel attention module. Besides, the Gaussian mixture model is introduced for
the entropy model and improves the accuracy for bitrate estimation.
Furthermore, we introduce the decoder-side enhancement module to further
improve image compression performance. Our EDIC method can also be readily
incorporated with the Deep Video Compression (DVC) framework to further improve
the video compression performance. Simultaneously, our EDIC method boosts the
coding performance significantly while bringing slightly increased
computational cost. More importantly, experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art image compression
methods and is up to more than 150 times faster in terms of decoding speed when
compared with Minnen's method. The proposed framework also successfully
improves the performance of the recent deep video compression system DVC. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/liujiaheng/compression.

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for multidimensional relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on general meshes. A distinct feature of the
schemes is their physical-constraint-preserving (PCP) property, i.e., they are
proven to preserve the subluminal constraint on the fluid velocity and the
positivity of density, pressure, and specific internal energy. Developing PCP
high-order schemes for RMHD is highly desirable but remains a challenging task,
especially in the multidimensional cases, due to the inherent strong
nonlinearity in the constraints and the effect of the magnetic divergence-free
condition. Inspired by some crucial observations at the PDE level, we construct
the provably PCP schemes by using the locally divergence-free DG schemes of the
recently proposed symmetrizable RMHD equations as the base schemes, a limiting
technique to enforce the PCP property of the DG solutions, and the
strong-stability-preserving methods for time discretization. We rigorously
prove the PCP property by using a novel ""quasi-linearization"" approach to
handle the highly nonlinear physical constraints, technical splitting to offset
the influence of divergence error, and sophisticated estimates to analyze the
beneficial effect of the additional source term in the symmetrizable RMHD
system. Several two-dimensional numerical examples are provided to confirm the
PCP property and to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed PCP schemes.

sufficiently slow decay of the initial density. More precisely, for the Cauchy

we look for linear transformations to segment the matrix into many small
sub-matrices for which each of them are uncorrelated with the others both
contemporaneously and serially, thus they can be analyzed separately, which
will greatly reduce the number of parameters to be estimated in terms of
modeling. To overcome the identification issue, we propose a two-step and more
structured procedure to segment the rows and columns separately. When
$\max(p,q)$ is large in relation to the sample size $n$, we assume the
transformation matrices are sparse and use threshold estimators for the
(auto)covariance matrices. We also propose a block-wisely thresholding method
to separate the columns (or rows) of the transformed matrix-valued data. The
asymptotic properties are established for both fixed and diverging $\max(p,q)$.
Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) for independent data, we cannot
guarantee that the required linear transformation exists. When it does not, the
proposed method provides an approximate segmentation, which may be useful for
forecasting. The proposed method is illustrated with both simulated and real

that whilst NbSe$_2$ exhibits a strongly enhanced CDW order in the 2D limit,
the opposite trend exists for TaSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, with CDW being entirely
absent in NbS$_2$ from its bulk to the monolayer. Such distinct behaviours are
then demonstrated to be the result of a subtle, yet profound, competition
between three factors: ionic charge transfer, electron-phonon coupling, and the
spreading extension of the electronic wave functions. Despite its simplicity,
our approach can, in essence, be applied to other quasi-2D materials to account

processes in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) around a young star, including
planetesimal formation, surface chemistry, and being the reservoir of water in
habitable zones. In this paper, we will perform two-dimensional modeling of
rotational disruption of dust grains and ice mantles due to centrifugal force
within suprathermally rotating grains spun-up by radiative torques for disks
around T-Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars. We first study rotational disruption of
large composite grains and find that large aggregates could be disrupted into
individual nanoparticles via the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism.
We then study rotational desorption of ice mantles and ro-thermal desorption of
molecules from the ice mantle. We will show that ice mantles in the warm
surface layer and above of the disk can be disrupted into small icy fragments,
followed by rapid evaporation of molecules. We suggest that the rotational
disruption mechanism can replenish the ubiquitous presence of polycyclic
aromatic hydrogen (PAHs)/ nanoparticles in the hot surface layers of PPDs as
observed in mid-IR emission, which are presumably destroyed by extreme
ultraviolet (UV) stellar photons. We show that the water snowline is more
extended in the presence of rotational desorption, which would decrease the
number of comets but increase the number of asteroids formed in the solar
nebula. Finally, we suggest that the more efficient breakup of carbonaceous
grains than silicates by RATD might resolve the carbon deficit problem measured
on the Earth and rocky bodies.

$c$ cut vertices. In particular, the well-known negative correlation between
the number of connected induced subgraphs of trees and the Wiener index (sum of
distances) fails for unicyclic graphs with $n$ nodes and $c$ cut vertices: for
instance, the maximal unicyclic graph with $n=3,4\mod 5$ nodes and $c=n-5>3$
cut vertices is different from the unique graph that was shown by Tan et

The 2-branch Batch DropBlock (BDB) network was recently proposed for achieving
diversity between the global branch and the feature-dropping branch. In this
paper, we propose to move the dropping operation from the intermediate feature
layer towards the input (image dropping). Since it may drop a large portion of
input images, this makes the training hard to converge. Hence, we propose a
novel double-batch-split co-training approach for remedying this problem. In
particular, we show that the feature diversity can be well achieved with the
use of multiple dropping branches by setting individual dropping ratio for each

superior to BDB on popular person Re-ID datasets, including Market-1501,
DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 and the use of more dropping branches can further
boost the performance.

the parameters of a Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions of an Ising (or Potts) model
from samples drawn from that distribution. The algorithmic and computational
interest stems from the fact that this inference task cannot be done
efficiently by the maximum likelihood criterion, since the normalizing constant
of the distribution (the partition function) can not be calculated exactly and
efficiently. The practical interest on the other hand flows from several
outstanding applications, of which the most well known has been predicting
spatial contacts in protein structures from tables of homologous protein
sequences. Most applications to date have been to data that has been produced
by a dynamical process which, as far as it is known, cannot be expected to
satisfy detailed balance. There is therefore no a priori reason to expect the
distribution to be of the Gibbs-Boltzmann type, and no a priori reason to
expect that inverse Ising (or Potts) techniques should yield useful
information. In this review we discuss two types of problems where progress
nevertheless can be made. We find that depending on model parameters there are
phases where, in fact, the distribution is close to Gibbs-Boltzmann
distribution, a non-equilibrium nature of the under-lying dynamics
notwithstanding. We also discuss the relation between inferred Ising model
parameters and parameters of the underlying dynamics.

prospective research direction for reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper,
we propose SARL, a novel State-Augmented RL framework for PM. Our framework
aims to address two unique challenges in financial PM: (1) data heterogeneity
-- the collected information for each asset is usually diverse, noisy and
imbalanced (e.g., news articles); and (2) environment uncertainty -- the
financial market is versatile and non-stationary. To incorporate heterogeneous
data and enhance robustness against environment uncertainty, our SARL augments
the asset information with their price movement prediction as additional
states, where the prediction can be solely based on financial data (e.g., asset
prices) or derived from alternative sources such as news. Experiments on two
real-world datasets, (i) Bitcoin market and (ii) HighTech stock market with
7-year Reuters news articles, validate the effectiveness of SARL over existing
PM approaches, both in terms of accumulated profits and risk-adjusted profits.
Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the importance of
our proposed state augmentation, providing new insights and boosting
performance significantly over standard RL-based PM method and other baselines.

as an accelerometer by comparing its response to that of a commercially
available geophone. This system shows great promise for ultrahigh acceleration
sensitivities without the need for large masses or cryogenics. With feedback
cooling, the transient decay time is reduced and the center-of-mass motion is
cooled to \SI{9}{K} or less. Remarkably, the levitated particle accelerometer
has a sensitivity down to \SI{3.6e-8}{\mathit{g}/\sqrt{Hz}} and gives
measurements similar to those of the commercial geophone at frequencies up to
\SI{14}{Hz} despite a test mass that is four billion times smaller. With no
free parameters in the calibration, the responses of the accelerometers match
within \num{3}\% at \SI{5}{Hz}. The system reaches this sensitivity due to a
relatively large particle mass of \SI{0.25}{\upmu g}, a low center of mass
oscillation frequency of \SI{1.75}{Hz}, and a novel image analysis method that
can measure the displacement with an uncertainty of \SI{1.6}{nm} in a single
image.

machine based on a flexible element are addressed for the first time. A general
theoretical framework is developed by extending that of the classical
catastrophe machines made up of discrete elastic systems. The new formulation,
based on the nonlinear solution of the elastica, is enhanced by considering the
concept of the universal snap surface. Among the infinite set of elastica
catastrophe machines, two families are proposed and investigated to explicitly
assess their features. The related catastrophe locus is disclosed in a large
variety of shapes, very different from those generated by the classical
counterpart. Substantial changes in the catastrophe locus properties, such as
convexity and number of bifurcation points, are achievable by tuning the design
parameters of the proposed machines towards the design of very efficient
snapping devices. Experiments performed on the physical realization of the
elastica catastrophe machine fully validate the present theoretical approach.
The developed model can find applications in mechanics at different scales, for
instance, in the design of new devices involving actuation or hysteresis loop
mechanisms to achieve energy harvesting, locomotion, and wave mitigation.

  Alpha Factors in Quantitative Investment","7 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-fin.CP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The multi-factor model is a widely used model in quantitative investment. The
success of a multi-factor model is largely determined by the effectiveness of
the alpha factors used in the model. This paper proposes a new evolutionary
algorithm called AutoAlpha to automatically generate effective formulaic alphas
from massive stock datasets. Specifically, first we discover an inherent
pattern of the formulaic alphas and propose a hierarchical structure to quickly
locate the promising part of space for search. Then we propose a new Quality
Diversity search based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA-QD) to guide
the search away from the well-explored space for more desirable results. Next,
we utilize the warm start method and the replacement method to prevent the
premature convergence problem. Based on the formulaic alphas we discover, we
propose an ensemble learning-to-rank model for generating the portfolio. The
backtests in the Chinese stock market and the comparisons with several
baselines further demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoAlpha in mining
formulaic alphas for quantitative trading.

Then, we use four real dynamical variables $\left\{ a,\alpha ,v,W \right\}$ to
show the dynamical essence of Cartan structural equation, we obtain the
geometrodynamics on Riemannian manifolds that can be expressed below
\begin{align}
  & \Theta /d{{t}^{2}}=a-v\wedge W,\nonumber
  & d\Theta /d{{t}^{3}}=v\wedge \alpha -a\wedge W,\nonumber
  & \Omega /d{{t}^{2}}=\alpha -W\wedge W, \nonumber
  & d\Omega /d{{t}^{3}}=W\wedge \alpha -\alpha \wedge W\nonumber \end{align}
that is valid more generally for any connection in a principal bundle. We can
see that the first equation explains the geodesic equation very well, the
second formula means the first Bianchi identity, while the last equation
reveals the dynamical nature of the second Bianchi identity. It implies that
Cartan structural equations on Riemannian manifolds can be rewritten in a real
geometrodynamical form based on the geospin matrix.

common pre-training models: BERT, ERNIE, ERNIE2.0-tiny, and RoBERTa. Then, we
apply these pre-training models to a NER task by fine-tuning, and compare the
effects of the different model architecture and pre-training tasks on the NER
task. The experiment results showed that RoBERTa achieved state-of-the-art
results on the MSRA-2006 dataset.

fake videos more accessible than ever before. Manipulated videos can fuel
disinformation and reduce trust in media. Therefore detection of fake videos
has garnered immense interest in academia and industry. Recently developed
Deepfake detection methods rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to distinguish
AI-generated fake videos from real videos. In this work, we demonstrate that it
is possible to bypass such detectors by adversarially modifying fake videos
synthesized using existing Deepfake generation methods. We further demonstrate
that our adversarial perturbations are robust to image and video compression
codecs, making them a real-world threat. We present pipelines in both white-box
and black-box attack scenarios that can fool DNN based Deepfake detectors into
classifying fake videos as real.
