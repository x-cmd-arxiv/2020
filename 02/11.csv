  Graphics 2020",,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The visualization of hierarchically structured data over time is an ongoing
challenge and several approaches exist trying to solve it. Techniques such as
animated or juxtaposed tree visualizations are not capable of providing a good
overview of the time series and lack expressiveness in conveying changes over
time. Nested streamgraphs provide a better understanding of the data evolution,
but lack the clear outline of hierarchical structures at a given timestep.
Furthermore, these approaches are often limited to static hierarchies or
exclude complex hierarchical changes in the data, limiting their use cases. We
propose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all
hierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical
structure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth
transitions between tree maps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration
of the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure. As our
technique handles topological changes of all types, it is suitable for a wide
range of applications. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several use
cases, evaluate it with a user study, and provide its full source code.

of the centroids. More precisely, we build on the idea of median-of-means
statistics to estimate the centroids, but allow for replacement while
constructing the blocks. We call this methodology the bootstrap median-of-means
(bMOM) and prove that if enough blocks are generated through the bootstrap
sampling, then it has a better breakdown point for mean estimation than the
classical median-of-means (MOM), where the blocks form a partition of the
dataset. From a clustering perspective, bMOM enables to take many blocks of a
desired size, thus avoiding possible disappearance of clusters in some blocks,
a pitfall that can occur for the partition-based generation of blocks of the
classical median-of-means. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the
proposed approach, called K-bMOM, performs better than existing robust K-means
based methods. Guidelines are provided for tuning the hyper-parameters K-bMOM
in practice. It is also recommended to the practitionner to use such a robust
approach to initialize their clustering algorithm. Finally, considering a
simplified and theoretical version of our estimator, we prove its robustness to
adversarial contamination by deriving robust rates of convergence for the
K-means distorsion. To our knowledge, it is the first result of this kind for
the K-means distorsion.

detections to date. Various explanations for this have been proposed, from the
observed frequency range, telescope sensitivity, to beaming of the emission. In
a recent paper, we illustrated that exoplanets can orbit through the radio
photosphere of the wind of the host star, a region that is optically thick at a
specific frequency, for a large fraction of their orbits. As a result, radio
emission originating from the planet could be absorbed or `eclipsed' by the
wind of the host star. Here we investigate how the properties of the stellar
wind and orbital parameters affect the fraction of the orbit where the planet
is eclipsed by the stellar wind. We show that planets orbiting stars with low
density winds are more favourable for detection in the radio. In terms of the
orbital parameters, emission from transiting planets can escape the stellar
wind easiest. We apply our model to the $\tau$~Boo planetary system, and show
that observing the fraction of the planet's orbit where it is eclipsed by the
wind of the host star could be used to constrain the properties of the stellar
wind. However, our model developed would need to be used in conjunction with a
separate method to disentangle the mass-loss rate and temperature of the

generative sequence models (e.g. the HMM), our model makes few assumptions

amortized variational inference admits a practical surrogate. Further, by
drawing connections between our variational objective and other recent

to their unique band-inversion character and band-crossing points. However, the
intentional modulation of such topological responses by experimentally feasible
means is less explored. Here, an unusual elevation of anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) is obtained in electron(Ni)-doped magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3-xNixSn2S2,
showing peak values of anomalous Hall-conductivity, Hall-angle and Hall-factor
at a relatively low doping level of x = 0.11. The separation of intrinsic and
extrinsic contributions to total AHE using TYJ scaling model indicates that
such significant enhancement is dominated by the intrinsic mechanism of
electronic Berry curvature. Theoretical calculations reveal that compared with
the Fermi-level shifting from electron filling, a usually overlooked effect of
doping, i.e., local disorder, imposes a striking effect on broadening the bands
and narrowing the inverted gap, and thus results in an elevation of the
integrated Berry curvature. Our results not only realize the enhancement of AHE
in a magnetic Weyl semimetal, but also provide a practical design principle to
modulate the bands and transport properties in topological materials, by
exploiting the disorder effect of doping.

occlusions or textureless appearances. Vector-field based keypoint voting has

However, direct regression of vector-fields neglects that the distances between

other words, small errors in direction vectors may generate severely deviated
hypotheses when pixels are far away from a keypoint. In this paper, we aim to
reduce such errors by incorporating the distances between pixels and keypoints

differentiable proxy voting loss (DPVL) which mimics the hypothesis selection
in the voting procedure. By exploiting our voting loss, we are able to train
our network in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on widely used datasets, i.e.,

correctly predict the class of data passed to it as a query. However, along
with queries containing clean data, the learner could also receive malicious or
adversarial queries from an adversary. The objective of the adversary is to
evade the learner's prediction mechanism by sending adversarial queries that
result in erroneous class prediction by the learner, while the learner's
objective is to reduce the incorrect prediction of these adversarial queries
without degrading the prediction quality of clean queries. We propose a game
theory-based technique called a Repeated Bayesian Sequential Game where the
learner interacts repeatedly with a model of the adversary using self play to
determine the distribution of adversarial versus clean queries. It then
strategically selects a classifier from a set of pre-trained classifiers that
balances the likelihood of correct prediction for the query along with reducing
the costs to use the classifier. We have evaluated our proposed technique using
clean and adversarial text data with deep neural network-based classifiers and
shown that the learner can select an appropriate classifier that is
commensurate with the query type (clean or adversarial) while remaining aware

($T_{\mathrm eff}$) of some 20,000 K in the last century. To characterize the
binary orbit and $T_{\mathrm eff}$ changes more precisely, new high-resolution
spectroscopy has been obtained with SALT. The previous orbital period is not
confirmed; previous measurements may have been confused by the presence of
pulsations. Including data from earlier epochs (1987, 2002, and 2010),
self-consistent spectral analyses from all four epochs demonstrate an increase
in $T_{\mathrm eff}$ from 18,800 to 24,400 K between 1987 and 2015. Line

continues. The 1987 spectrum shows evidence of a very high abundance of the

there are only a few possible classes we show that we can improve the transfer
by forcing the teacher to divide each class into many subclasses that it
invents during the supervised training. The student is then trained to match
the subclass probabilities. For datasets where there are known, natural
subclasses we demonstrate that the teacher learns similar subclasses and these
improve distillation. For clickthrough datasets where the subclasses are
unknown we demonstrate that subclass distillation allows the student to learn
faster and better.

multiagent reinforcement learning (Deep-MARL) algorithms have shown superior
performance in such challenging settings. One representative class of work is
multiagent value decomposition, which decomposes the global shared multiagent
Q-value $Q_{tot}$ into individual Q-values $Q^{i}$ to guide individuals'
behaviors, i.e. VDN imposing an additive formation and QMIX adopting a
monotonic assumption using an implicit mixing method. However, most of the
previous efforts impose certain assumptions between $Q_{tot}$ and $Q^{i}$ and
lack theoretical groundings. Besides, they do not explicitly consider the
agent-level impact of individuals to the whole system when transforming
individual $Q^{i}$s into $Q_{tot}$. In this paper, we theoretically derive a
general formula of $Q_{tot}$ in terms of $Q^{i}$, based on which we can
naturally implement a multi-head attention formation to approximate $Q_{tot}$,
resulting in not only a refined representation of $Q_{tot}$ with an agent-level
attention mechanism, but also a tractable maximization algorithm of
decentralized policies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods on the widely adopted StarCraft

model, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which posits a fundamental
acceleration scale $a_0$ common to all the galaxies. However, it was later
shown, using Bayesian inference, that this seems not to be the case: the $a_0$
credible intervals for individual galaxies were not found to be compatible

for gravity, since it directly evaluates its basic assumption and this using
the data that most favor MOND: galaxy rotation curves. Here we improve upon the

active research area as many real-world problems can be inherently viewed as
multiagent systems. A particularly interesting and widely applicable class of
problems is the partially observable cooperative multiagent setting, in which a
team of agents learns to coordinate their behaviors conditioning on their
private observations and commonly shared global reward signals. One natural
solution is to resort to the centralized training and decentralized execution
paradigm. During centralized training, one key challenge is the multiagent
credit assignment: how to allocate the global rewards for individual agent
policies for better coordination towards maximizing system-level's benefits. In
this paper, we propose a new method called Q-value Path Decomposition (QPD) to
decompose the system's global Q-values into individual agents' Q-values. Unlike
previous works which restrict the representation relation of the individual
Q-values and the global one, we leverage the integrated gradient attribution
technique into deep MARL to directly decompose global Q-values along trajectory
paths to assign credits for agents. We evaluate QPD on the challenging
StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and show that QPD achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiagent
scenarios compared with existing cooperative MARL algorithms.

incorporate complex network structures into limiting equations. In many cases,
only heuristic approximations exist, or the limits rely on particular classes

nearby and bright Sun-like star HD 191939 (TIC 269701147, TOI 1339), a
$K_{s}=7.18$ magnitude G8 V dwarf at a distance of only 54 parsecs. We validate
the planetary nature of the transit signals by combining five months of data
from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite with follow-up ground-based
photometry, archival optical images, radial velocities, and high angular
resolution observations. The three sub-Neptunes have similar radii ($R_{b} =
3.42^{+0.11}_{-0.11}\,R_{\oplus}$, $R_{c}=3.23_{-0.11}^{+0.11}\,R_{\oplus}$,
and $R_{d}=3.16_{-0.11}^{+0.11}\,R_{\oplus}$) and their orbits are consistent
with a stable, circular, and co-planar architecture near mean motion resonances
of 1:3 and 3:4 ($P_{b}=8.88$ days, $P_{c}=28.58$ days, and $P_{d}=38.35$ days).
The HD~191939 system is an excellent candidate for precise mass determinations
of the planets with high-resolution spectroscopy due to the host star's
brightness and low chromospheric activity. Moreover, the system's compact and
near-resonant nature can provide an independent way to measure planetary masses
via transit timing variations while also enabling dynamical and evolutionary
studies. Finally, as a promising target for multi-wavelength transmission
spectroscopy of all three planets' atmospheres, HD 191939 can offer valuable
insight into multiple sub-Neptunes born from a proto-planetary disk that may
have resembled that of the early Sun.

their cumulants (e.g., mean, (co)variance, skew, kurtosis). Here, we introduce
the natural analogue of cumulants for networks, building a hierarchical
description based on correlations between an increasing number of connections,
seamlessly incorporating additional information, such as directed edges, node
attributes, and edge weights. These graph cumulants provide a principled and
unifying framework for quantifying the propensity of a network to display any
substructure of interest (such as cliques to measure clustering). Moreover,
they give rise to a natural hierarchical family of maximum entropy models for
networks (i.e., ERGMs) that do not suffer from the ""degeneracy problem"", a
common practical pitfall of other ERGMs.

during development and early embryogenesis. Although epithelial monolayers are
often modeled as two-dimensional (2D) elastic surfaces, they distinguish
themselves from conventional thin elastic plates in three important ways - the
presence of an apical-basal polarity, spatial variability of cellular
thickness, and their nonequilibrium active nature. Here, we develop a minimal
continuum model of a planar epithelial tissue as an active elastic material
that incorporates all these features. We start from a full three-dimensional
(3D)description of the tissue and derive an effective 2D model that captures,
through the curvature of the apical surface, both the apical-basal asymmetry
and the spatial geometry of the tissue. Crucially, variations of active
stresses across the apical-basal axis lead to active torques that can drive
curvature transitions. By identifying four distinct sources of activity, we
find that bulk active stresses arising from actomyosin contractility and growth
compete with boundary active tensions due to localized actomyosin cables and
lamellipodial activity to generate the various states spanning the morphospace
of a planar epithelium. Our treatment hence unifies 3D shape deformations
through the coupled mechanics of apical curvature change and in-plane
expansion/contraction of substrate-adhered tissues. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our results for some biologically relevant processes such as
tissue folding at the onset of lumen formation.

transitions of thin elastic sheets. While stretching dominates the mechanical

monolayers have shown that, due to the asymmetry in surface stresses generated
by molecular motors across the thickness $e$ of the epithelium, the free edges

as a result. This suggests that a competition between bending and stretching
sets the morphology of the tissue margin. In this study, we use the framework
of non-euclidean plates to incorporate active pre-strain and spontaneous
curvature to the theory of thin elastic shells. We show that, when the
spontaneous curvature of the sheet scales like $1/e$, stretching and bending
energies have the same scaling in the limit of a vanishingly small thickness
and therefore both compete, in a way that is continuously altered by an
external tension, to define the three-dimensional shape of the tissue.

Nasutitermes termites, whose cooperation may similarly be mediated by the shape
of the structure they are walking on, for example focusing the building
activity of termites where local mean curvature is high. We adopt a phase-field
model where the nest is described by one continuous scalar field and its growth
is governed by a single nonlinear equation with one adjustable parameter d.
When d is large enough the equation is linearly unstable and fairly reproduces
a growth process where the initial walls expand, branch and merge, while
progressively invading all the available space, which is consistent with the
intricate structures of real nests. Interestingly, the linear problem
associated to our growth equation is analogous to the buckling of a thin
elastic plate under symmetric in-plane compression which is also known to
produce rich pattern through non linear and secondary instabilities. We
validated our model by collecting nests of two species of arboreal Nasutitermes
from the field and imaging their structure with a micro-CT scanner. We found a
strong resemblance between real and simulated nests, characterised by the
emergence of a characteristic length-scale and by the abundance of
saddle-shaped surfaces with zero-mean curvature which validates the choice of
the driving mechanism of our growth model.

theories, characterized by an infinite number of Kaluza-Klein fields, one-loop
amplitudes involve discrete as well as continuous sums, $\sum^\infty_{n=1}\int
d^4k$, that could diverge. Using dimensional regularization, we express such
sums as products of gamma and Epstein functions, both defined on the complex
plane, with divergences arising from poles of these functions in the limit as $
D \to 4$. Using the analytical properties of the Epstein function, we show that
the ultraviolet divergences generated by the Kaluza-Klein sums can be
consistently renormalized, which means that the corresponding renormalized
quantities reduce to the usual ones of QED at the limit of a very large
compactification scale $R^{-1}$. The main features of QED at the one-loop level
were studied. We use the mass-dependent $\mu$-scheme to calculate, in QED with
an arbitrary number $n$ of extra dimensions, a beta function fulfilling all
desirable physical requirements. We argue that in this type of theories, with a
large mass spectrum covering a wide energy range, beta functions should not be
calculated by using mass-independent renormalization schemes. We show that the
beta function is finite for any energy $\mu$. In particular, it reduces to the
usual QED result $e^3/12\pi^2$ for $m\ll \mu \ll R^{-1}$ and vanishes for $m\gg

bodies that slide by changing their interlink angle periodically in time. We
find that the anisotropy ratio of the sliding friction coefficients is a key
parameter, while solutions have a simple scaling dependence on the friction
coefficients' magnitudes. With very anisotropic friction, efficient motions
involve coasting in low-drag states, with rapid and asymmetric power and
recovery strokes. As the anisotropy decreases, burst-and-coast motions change
to motions with long power strokes and short recovery strokes, and roughly
constant interlink angle velocity on each. These motions are seen in the spaces
of sinusoidal and power-law motions described by two and five parameters,
respectively. Allowing the duty cycle to vary greatly increases the motions'
efficiency compared to the case of symmetric power and recovery strokes.
Allowing further variations in the concavity of the power and recovery strokes
improves the efficiency further only when friction is very anisotropic. Near
isotropic friction, a variety of optimally efficient motions are found with
more complex waveforms. Many of the optimal sinusoidal and power-law motions
are similar to those that we find with an optimization search in the space of
more general periodic functions (truncated Fourier series). When we increase
the resistive force's power-law dependence on velocity, the optimal motions
become smoother, slower, and less efficient, particularly near isotropic
friction.

such as spatial regularity, volume prior and object shapes cannot be well
handled by existing DCNNs. We propose a novel Soft Threshold Dynamics (STD)

method is to interpret the softmax activation function as a dual variable in a
variational problem, and thus many spatial priors can be imposed in the dual
space. From this viewpoint, we can build a STD based framework which can enable
the outputs of DCNNs to have many special priors such as spatial regularity,
volume constraints and star-shape priori. The proposed method is a general
mathematical framework and it can be applied to any semantic segmentation
DCNNs. To show the efficiency and accuracy of our method, we applied it to the

of a given set of $n$ points, i.e., when one wants to exclude the local motions

whether a given polyhedron is non-trivially flexible. We prove that such

the object study in the recent past. In this paper, we make use of deep gated
networks (DGNs) as a framework to obtain insights about DNNs with ReLU
activation. In DGNs, a single neuronal unit has two components namely the
pre-activation input (equal to the inner product the weights of the layer and
the previous layer outputs), and a gating value which belongs to $[0,1]$ and
the output of the neuronal unit is equal to the multiplication of
pre-activation input and the gating value. The standard DNN with ReLU
activation, is a special case of the DGNs, wherein the gating value is $1/0$
based on whether or not the pre-activation input is positive or negative. We
theoretically analyse and experiment with several variants of DGNs, each
variant suited to understand a particular aspect of either training or
generalisation in DNNs with ReLU activation. Our theory throws light on two
questions namely i) why increasing depth till a point helps in training and ii)
why increasing depth beyond a point hurts training? We also present
experimental evidence to show that gate adaptation, i.e., the change of gating
value through the course of training is key for generalisation.

WTs follow a Pareto Type IV statistical distribution. The difference of the
position-angle of a considerable population of consecutive CME pairs is less
than $30^\circ$, indicating the possibility that their source locations are in
the same region. The difference between the speed of trailing and leading
consecutive CMEs follows a generalized Student t-distribution. The fact that
the WT and the speed difference have heavy-tailed distributions along with a
detrended fluctuation analysis shows that the CME process has a long-range
dependence. As a consequence of the long-range dependence, we found a small but
significative difference between the speed of consecutive CMEs, with the speed
of the trailing CME being higher than the speed of the leading CME. The
difference is largest for WTs < 2 hrs and tends to be zero for WTs > 10 hrs,
and it is more evident during the ascending and descending phases of the solar
cycle. We suggest that this difference may be caused by a drag force acting
over CMEs closely related in space and time.

deformation when illuminated. They are made by incorporating photoactive
molecules like azobenzene into nematic liquid crystal elastomers. Since its
initial demonstration in 2001, it has received increasing interest with many
recent studies of periodic and buckling behavior. However, theoretical models
developed have focused on describing specific deformation modes (e.g., beam
bending and uniaxial contraction) in the absence of mechanical loads, with only
limited attention to the interplay between mechanical stress and light-induced
deformation. This paper explores photomechanical coupling in a photoactive
nematic elastomer under both light illumination and mechanical stress. We begin
with a continuum framework built on the free energy developed by Corbett and
Warner (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006). Mechanical stress leads to nematic alignment
parallel to a uniaxial tensile stress. In the absence of mechanical stress, in
the photo-stationary state where the system reaches equilibrium, the nematic
director tends to align perpendicular to the polarization of a linearly
polarized light. However, sufficient illumination can destroy nematic order
through a first-order nematic-isotropic phase transition which is accompanied
by a snap through deformation. Combined illumination and mechanical stress can
lead to an exchange of stability accompanied by stripe domains. Finally, the
stress-intensity phase diagram shows a critical point that may be of interest
for energy conversion.

in transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) significantly change when the
X-ray luminosity decays below $\sim 10^{-2}$ of the Eddington limit ($L_{\rm
Edd}$). However, there are few observational cases where the evolution of the
accretion flow is tracked in a single X-ray binary over a wide dynamic range.
In this work, we use NuSTAR and NICER observations obtained during the 2018
accretion outburst of the neutron star LMXB 4U 1608-52, to study changes in the
reflection spectrum. We find that the broad Fe-K$\alpha$ line and Compton hump,
clearly seen during the peak of the outburst when the X-ray luminosity is $\sim
10^{37}$ erg/s ($\sim 0.05$ $L_{\rm Edd}$), disappear during the decay of the
outburst when the source luminosity drops to $\sim 4.5 \times 10^{35}$ erg/s
($\sim 0.002$ $L_{\rm Edd}$). We show that this non-detection of the reflection
features cannot be explained by the lower signal-to-noise at lower flux, but is
instead caused by physical changes in the accretion flow. Simulating synthetic
NuSTAR observations on a grid of inner disk radius, disk ionisation, and
reflection fraction, we find that the disappearance of the reflection features
can be explained by either increased disk ionisation ($\log \xi \geq 4.1$) or a
much decreased reflection fraction. A changing disk truncation alone, however,
cannot account for the lack of reprocessed Fe-K$\alpha$ emission. The required
increase in ionisation parameter could occur if the inner accretion flow
evaporates from a thin disk into a geometrically thicker flow, such as the
commonly assumed formation of an radiatively inefficient accretion flow at
lower mass accretion rates.

Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution

heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random
network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine
the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the
heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show
the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the
data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without
data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious
diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically.
Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing

polynomial time, say); but concerning continuous data, already real numbers
naturally suggest various encodings (so-called REPRESENTATIONS) with very
different properties, ranging from the computably 'unreasonable' binary

complexity-theoretically 'reasonable' signed-digit expansion. But how to
distinguish between un/suitable encodings of other spaces common in Calculus

identified ADMISSIBILITY as crucial criterion for a representation over the
Cantor space of infinite binary sequences to be 'reasonable'; cmp.
[doi:10.1007/11780342_48]. Refining computability over topological to
complexity over metric spaces, we develop the theory of POLYNOMIAL/LINEAR
ADMISSIBILITY as two quantitative refinements of qualitative admissibility.
  We also rephrase quantitative admissibility as quantitative continuity of
both the representation and of its set-valued inverse, the latter adopting from
[doi:10.4115/jla.2013.5.7] a new notion of 'sequential' continuity for
multifunctions. By establishing a quantitative continuous selection theorem for
multifunctions between compact ultrametric spaces, we can extend our above
quantitative MAIN THEOREM from functions to multifunctions aka search problems.
Higher-type complexity is captured by generalizing Cantor's (and Baire's)

  This paper presents a revisited version of the Bang Calculus, called $\lambda
!$, enjoying some important properties missing in the original formulation.
Indeed, the new calculus integrates permutative conversions to unblock value
redexes while being confluent at the same time. A second contribution is
related to nonidempotent types. We provide a quantitative type system for our

translation from $\lambda$-calculus to the Bang Calculus, which preserves
normal forms and is sound and complete with respect to the (quantitative) type
system for CBN. However, in the case of CBV, we reformulate both the
translation and the type system to restore two main properties: preservation of
normal forms and completeness. Last but not least, the quantitative system is
refined to a tight one, which transforms the previous upper bound on the length

  In the cooperative abstract Tile Assembly Model, square tiles attach to each

control of tile binding is directly exploited for algorithmic tasks including
growth of specified shapes using very few tile types, as well as simulation of
Turing machines and even self-simulation of self-assembly systems. But are
cooperative bindings required for these computational tasks? The definitionally

the conjecture that it is impossible for it to exhibit precisely controlled
growth of computationally-defined shapes.

requiring any direct supervision, has become the new weapon in modern
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for achieving superhuman performance in practice.
However, the majority of exisiting theory in reinforcement learning only
applies to the setting where the agent plays against a fixed environment; it
remains largely open whether self-play algorithms can be provably effective,
especially when it is necessary to manage the exploration/exploitation
tradeoff. We study self-play in competitive reinforcement learning under the
setting of Markov games, a generalization of Markov decision processes to the
two-player case. We introduce a self-play algorithm---Value Iteration with
Upper/Lower Confidence Bound (VI-ULCB)---and show that it achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ after playing $T$ steps of the game, where the
regret is measured by the agent's performance against a \emph{fully
adversarial} opponent who can exploit the agent's strategy at \emph{any} step.
We also introduce an explore-then-exploit style algorithm, which achieves a
slightly worse regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, but is guaranteed to
run in polynomial time even in the worst case. To the best of our knowledge,
our work presents the first line of provably sample-efficient self-play
algorithms for competitive reinforcement learning.

has been widely recognized useful for AU detection. Most region-based studies
focus on a small region where the AU occurs. Focusing on a specific region
helps eliminate the influence of identity, but bringing a risk for losing
information. It is challenging to find balance. In this study, I propose a
simple strategy. I divide the face into three broad regions, upper, middle, and
lower region, and group AUs based on where it occurs. I propose a new
end-to-end deep learning framework named three regions based attention network
(TRA-Net). After extracting the global feature, TRA-Net uses a hard attention
module to extract three feature maps, each of which contains only a specific
region. Each region-specific feature map is fed to an independent branch. For
each branch, three continuous soft attention modules are used to extract
higher-level features for final AU detection. In the DISFA dataset, this model
achieves the highest F1 scores for the detection of AU1, AU2, and AU4, and

Inspired by this, we propose to study the expressive power of graph neural
networks (GNNs) via their ability to count attributed graph substructures,
extending recent works that examine their power in graph isomorphism testing
and function approximation. We distinguish between two types of substructure
counting: induced-subgraph-count and subgraph-count, and establish both
positive and negative answers for popular GNN architectures. Specifically, we
prove that Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), 2-Weisfeiler-Lehman (2-WL)
and 2-Invariant Graph Networks (2-IGNs) cannot perform induced-subgraph-count
of substructures consisting of 3 or more nodes, while they can perform
subgraph-count of star-shaped substructures. As an intermediary step, we prove
that 2-WL and 2-IGNs are equivalent in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs,
partly answering an open problem raised in Maron et al. (2019). We also prove
positive results for k-WL and k-IGNs as well as negative results for k-WL with
a finite number of iterations. We then conduct experiments that support the
theoretical results for MPNNs and 2-IGNs. Moreover, motivated by substructure
counting and inspired by Murphy et al. (2019), we propose the Local Relational
Pooling model and demonstrate that it is not only effective for substructure
counting but also able to achieve competitive performance on molecular

we establish that the lack of generalization is mainly due to the channel
mismatch, i.e. different recording conditions between the trained and untrained

techniques are not effective in improving cross-corpus generalization. Further,
we evaluate publicly available datasets that are promising for generalization.
We find one particular corpus to be significantly better than others. Finally,
we find that using a smaller frame shift in short-time processing of speech can
significantly improve cross-corpus generalization. The proposed techniques to

kinematics, dynamics, ionisation mechanisms and oxygen abundances of the
ionised gas, by modelling the H$\alpha$-[NII] emission lines at high
signal-to-noise (>15) with multiple Gaussian components. MEGARA observations
reveal, for the first time for NGC7469, the presence of a very thin (20 pc)
ionised gas disc supported by rotation (V/$\sigma$ = 4.3), embedded in a
thicker (222 pc), dynamically hotter (V/$\sigma$ = 1.3) one. These discs nearly
co-rotate with similar peak-to-peak velocities (163 vs. 137 km/s ), but with
different average velocity dispersion (38 vs. 108 km/s ). The kinematics of
both discs could be possibly perturbed by star-forming regions. We interpret
the morphology and the kinematics of a third (broader) component ($\sigma$ >
250 km/s) as suggestive of the presence of non-rotational turbulent motions
possibly associated either to an outflow or to the lense. For the narrow
component, the [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios point to the star-formation as the
dominant mechanism of ionisation, being consistent with ionisation from shocks
in the case of the intermediate component. All components have roughly solar
metallicity. In the nuclear region of NGC7469, at r < 1.85 arcsec, a very broad

in extracting the characteristics of spermatozoa for studies or measuring human
fertility. The first step in sperm characteristics analysis is sperm detection
in the frames of the video sample. In this article, we used RetinaNet, a deep
fully convolutional neural network as the object detector. Sperms are small
objects with few attributes, that makes the detection more difficult in
high-density samples and especially when there are other particles in semen,
which could be like sperm heads. One of the main attributes of sperms is their
movement, but this attribute cannot be extracted when only one frame would be
fed to the network. To improve the performance of the sperm detection network,
we concatenated some consecutive frames to use as the input of the network.
With this method, the motility attribute has also been extracted, and then with
the help of the deep convolutional network, we have achieved high accuracy in
sperm detection. The second step is tracking the sperms, for extracting the
motility parameters that are essential for indicating fertility and other
studies on sperms. In the tracking phase, we modify the CSR-DCF algorithm. This
method also has shown excellent results in sperm tracking even in high-density
sperm samples, occlusions, sperm colliding, and when sperms exit from a frame
and re-enter in the next frames. The average precision of the detection phase
is 99.1%, and the F1 score of the tracking method evaluation is 96.61%. These
results can be a great help in studies investigating sperm behavior and
analyzing fertility possibility.

post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum multipoles from the final data
release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Geometric
constraints are obtained from the positions of BAO peaks in reconstructed
spectra, analyzed in combination with the unreconstructed spectra in a
full-shape (FS) likelihood using a joint covariance matrix, giving stronger
parameter constraints than FS-only or BAO-only analyses. We introduce a new
method for obtaining constraints from reconstructed spectra based on a
correlated theoretical error, which is shown to be simple, robust, and
applicable to any flavor of density-field reconstruction. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM
with massive neutrinos, we analyze data from two redshift bins
$z_\mathrm{eff}=0.38,0.61$ and obtain $1.6\%$ constraints on the Hubble
constant $H_0$, using only a single prior on the current baryon density
$\omega_b$ from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and no knowledge of the power
spectrum slope $n_s$. This gives $H_0 =
68.6\pm1.1\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with the inclusion of BAO
data sharpening the measurement by $40\%$, representing one of the strongest
current constraints on $H_0$ independent of cosmic microwave background data.
Restricting to the best-fit slope $n_s$ from Planck (but without additional
priors on the spectral shape), we obtain a $1\%$ $H_0$ measurement of $67.8\pm
0.7\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find strong constraints on the
cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of the FS, BAO, and Planck data.
This sets new bounds on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu <
0.14\,\mathrm{eV}$ (at $95\%$ confidence) and the effective number of
relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff} = 2.90^{+0.15}_{-0.16}$, though
contours are not appreciably narrowed by the inclusion of BAO data.

evolution of stellar black hole binaries (BHBs) around supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). We show that dynamical interactions can efficiently drive ""in-situ""
BHB formation if the SMBH is surrounded by a massive nuclear cluster (NC),
while orbitally segregated star clusters can replenish the BHB reservoir in
SMBH-dominated nuclei. We discuss how the combined action of stellar hardening
and mass segregation sculpts the BHB orbital properties. We use direct N-body
simulations including post-Newtonian corrections up to 2.5 order to study the
BHB-SMBH interplay, showing that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism plays a crucial role
in shortening binaries lifetime. We find that the merging probability weakly
depends on the SMBH mass in the $10^6-10^9{\rm ~M}_\odot$ mass range, leading
to a merger rate $\Gamma \simeq 3-8$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ at redshift zero.
Nearly $40\%$ of the mergers have masses in the ""BH mass gap"", $50-140{\rm
~M}_\odot$, thus indicating that galactic nuclei are ideal places to form BHs
in this mass range. We argue that gravitational wave (GW) sources with
components mass $m_1>40{\rm ~M}_\odot$ and $m_2<30{\rm ~M}_\odot$ would
represent a strong indicator of a galactic nuclei origin. The majority of these
mergers could be multiband GW sources in the local Universe: nearly $40\%$
might be seen by LISA as eccentric sources and, a few years later, as circular
sources by LIGO and the Einstein Telescope, making decihertz observatories like
DECIGO unique instruments to bridge the observations during the binary

First, its mass is low, $\lesssim 1$ GeV (but $\gtrsim 5$ keV to avoid

For this purpose, it is necessary to consistently simulate different

modeling approach presented in Fagioli et al. 2018, by extending the spectra
simulator Uspec to model galaxies of different kinds with improved parameters
from Tortorelli et al. 2020. Furthermore, we improve the modeling of the
selection function by using the image simulator Ufig. We apply this to the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and simulate $\sim157,000$ multi-band images.
We pre-process and analyse them to apply cuts for target selection, and finally
simulate SDSS/BOSS DR14 galaxy spectra. We compute photometric, astrometric and
spectroscopic properties for red and blue, real and simulated galaxies, finding
very good agreement. We compare the statistical properties of the samples by
decomposing them with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We find very good
agreement for red galaxies and a good, but less pronounced one, for blue
galaxies, as expected given the known difficulty of simulating those. Finally,
we derive stellar population properties, mass-to-light ratios, ages and
metallicities, for all samples, finding again very good agreement. This shows
how this method can be used not only to forecast cosmology surveys, but it is
also able to provide insights into studies of galaxy formation and evolution.

closer to the star-forming main sequence have CO SLED slopes that are
comparable to other star-forming populations, such as local SMGs and BzK
star-forming galaxies; the three objects with higher specific star formation

extrapolate the luminosity of the CO(1-0) transition, and using a classical
conversion factor for main sequence galaxies of alpha_CO = 3.8 M_sun(K km s^-1

multiple nuclear K'-band emission, we estimate the activation of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) at individual galaxy nuclei in the form of AGN luminosity
normalized by SMBH mass inferred from host galaxy stellar luminosity. We
confirm a trend that more massive SMBHs in K'-band brighter primary galaxy
nuclei are generally more active, with higher SMBH-mass-normalized AGN
luminosity than less massive SMBHs in K'-band fainter secondary galaxy nuclei,
as predicted by numerical simulations of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. In two

indicated by comparisons with available (sub)millimeter data. Non-synchronous

we have never seen before, some containing features that we may not even know
exist in the universe. Second, once we have images of exoplanets, we need a way
to take these images and rank them by importance. Equipment fails and data
rates are slow, thus we need a method to ensure that the most important images
to humankind are the ones that are prioritized for data transfer. Finally, the
energy on board is minimal and must be conserved and used sparingly. No
exoplanet images should be missed, but using energy erroneously would be
detrimental. We introduce simulator-based methods that leverage artificial
intelligence, mostly in the form of computer vision, in order to solve all
three of these issues. Our results confirm that simulators provide an extremely
rich training environment that surpasses that of real images, and can be used

guarantee a considerable reduction in the complexity of circuits for the
purpose of performing quantum state tomography of N-dimensional path qudits.
The POVM (Positive Operator-Valued Measure) chosen in this work ensures that,
for odd dimensions, such process is minimal. Our proposal consists of
organizing the waveguides that form the circuit as a square array formed by N
vertical sectors composed of N waveguides each, arranged in the vertical
direction. Based on the symmetry of the chosen POVM, the interferometer acting
on the initial quantum system can be divided into a sequence of three different
unitary operations. These operations act independently on each vertical sector,
or layer, of the circuit, which simplifies their determination. We have thus
obtained circuits such that the number of beam splitters obeys a polynomial
function of degree 3 with the quantum system dimension, whereas in current
proposals this quantity grows with a polynomial function of degree 4. Besides
that, the optical depth is reduced from a quadratic to a linear function of the
quantum system dimension in our scheme. These results confirm the remarkable
reduction of the complexity of the photonic circuits in our proposal.

a variety of beyond-Standard-Model scenarios. These fields can tap energy and
angular momentum from spinning black holes through superradiant instabilities,
during which a macroscopic bosonic condensate develops around the black hole.
Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution
of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave~(GW) signal
emitted by the condensate. So far these processes have been studied in great
detail for scalar fields and, more recently, for vector fields. Here we take an
important step forward in the black-hole superradiance program by computing,
analytically, the instability time scale, the direct GW emission, and the
stochastic background, in the case of massive tensor (i.e., spin-$2$) fields.
Our analysis is valid for any black hole spin and for small boson masses. The
instability of massive spin-$2$ fields shares some properties with the scalar
and vector cases, but its phenomenology is much richer, for example there exist
multiple modes with comparable instability time scales, and the dominant GW
signal is hexadecapolar rather than quadrupolar. Electromagnetic and GW
observations of spinning black holes in the mass range $M\in(1,10^{10})M_\odot$
can constrain the mass of a putative spin-$2$ field in the range $10^{-22}

the field of view of the coronagraphs on board the Solar and Heliospheric

Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). We computed the CME shock and
flux rope speeds based on the multi-view observations by the different
coronagraphs and by EUV instruments. We determined the shock speed from metric
and interplanetary radio observations and found them to be consistent with
white-light observations, provided the metric type II burst and its
continuation into the decameter-hectometric domain are produced at the shock
flanks, where the speed is still high enough to accelerate electrons that
produce the type II bursts. Interestingly, there was an interplanetary type II
burst segment consistent with an origin at the shock nose suggesting that the
curved shock was crossing plasma levels separated by a few solar radii. We
conclude that the CME speed is high enough to produce the interplanetary Type
II burst and a solar energetic particle (SEP) event. However, the speed is not
high enough to produce a ground level enhancement (GLE) event, which requires
the shock to form at a height of ~1.5 Rs.

because of its numerous applications in real-world problems. It is well known
that the standard greedy algorithm guarantees a worst-case approximation factor

constraint. However, empirical studies show that its performance is
substantially better in practice. This raises a natural question of explaining
this improved performance of the greedy algorithm. In this work, we define
sharpness for submodular functions as a candidate explanation for this
phenomenon. The sharpness criterion is inspired by the concept of strong
convexity in convex optimization. We show that the greedy algorithm provably
performs better as the sharpness of the submodular function increases. This
improvement ties in closely with the faster convergence rates of first order
methods for sharp functions in convex optimization. Finally, we perform a
computational study to empirically support our theoretical results and show
that sharpness explains the greedy performance better than other justifications

that motion cues obtained from consecutive images yield sufficient information

from a uniqueness theorem, which can be evaded if one considers higher

cubic gravity, a well-motivated modification of Einstein gravity that includes
third-order curvature corrections in accordance with low-energy effective

dimensions that is free from pathologies. Examination of these black hole's
thermodynamics reveals that when two branches coexist only the larger black
hole is thermodynamically stable, while the smaller branch has negative
specific heat. Einsteinian cubic gravity unveils two further surprising
features. The charged black holes do not possess an inner horizon, in contrast
with the usual Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime, thus avoiding the need to resort
to strong cosmic censorship to uphold determinism. In addition to black holes,
there exists a one-parameter family of naked singularity spacetimes sharing the

different ratios of gold and PCMs. Our designed metasurface possesses a
bi-functionality that is capable of splitting beams or generating vortex beams

humans do effortlessly in day-to-day activities. This paper builds upon key
ideas to build perception of touch sounds without access to any ground-truth

large amounts of data of any sound of interest with a high precision. These
sounds are then used, along with the images to map the sounds to a clustered
space of the latent representation of these images. This approach, not only
allows us to learn semantic representation of the possible sounds of interest,
but also allows association of different modalities to the learned
distinctions. The model trained to map sounds to this clustered representation,
gives reasonable performance as opposed to expensive methods collecting a lot
of human annotated data. Such approaches can be used to build a state of art
perceptual model for any sound of interest described using a few signal
processing features. Daisy chaining high precision sound event detectors using
signal processing combined with neural architectures and high dimensional
clustering of unlabelled data is a vastly powerful idea, and can be explored in

related to the vehicular traffic management. Usually, their solutions include
the integration of computational technologies such as vehicular networks,
central servers, and roadside units. Most systems use a hybrid approach, which
means they still need a central entity (central server or roadside unit) and
Internet connection to find out an en-route event as well as alternative routes
for vehicles. It is easy to understand the need for a central entity because
selecting the most appropriate vehicle to perform aforementioned procedures is
a difficult task. In addition to that, as far as we know, there are very few
systems that apply the altruistic approach (not selfish behavior) to routing
decisions. Because of that, the issue addressed in this work is how to perform
the vehicular traffic management, when an en-route event is detected, in a
distributed, scalable, and cost-effective fashion. To deal with these issues,
we proposed a distributed vehicle traffic management system, named as dEASY
(distributed vEhicle trAffic management SYstem). The dEASY system was designed
and implemented on a three-layer architecture, namely environment sensing and
vehicle ranking, knowledge generation and distribution, and knowledge
consumption. Each layer of the dEASY architecture is responsible for dealing
with the main issues that were not addressed in related works or could be
improved. Simulation results have shown that, compared with other systems from
the literature, our proposed system has lower network overhead due to applied
vehicle selection and broadcast suppression mechanisms. In average, dEASY also
outperformed all other competitors in what regards to the travel time and time
lost metrics. Through the analysis of results, it is possible to conclude that
our infrastructure-less system is scalable and cost-effective.

been the subject of extensive research interest. It presents a substantial
challenge in medical image processing, as the shape and distribution of
abdominal organs can vary greatly among the population and within an individual
over time. While continuous integration of novel datasets into the training set
provides potential for better segmentation performance, collection of data at
scale is not only costly, but also impractical in some contexts. Moreover, it
remains unclear what marginal value additional data have to offer. Herein, we
propose a single-pass active learning method through human quality assurance
(QA). We built on a pre-trained 3D U-Net model for abdominal multi-organ
segmentation and augmented the dataset either with outlier data (e.g.,
exemplars for which the baseline algorithm failed) or inliers (e.g., exemplars
for which the baseline algorithm worked). The new models were trained using the
augmented datasets with 5-fold cross-validation (for outlier data) and withheld
outlier samples (for inlier data). Manual labeling of outliers increased Dice
scores with outliers by 0.130, compared to an increase of 0.067 with inliers
(p<0.001, two-tailed paired t-test). By adding 5 to 37 inliers or outliers to
training, we find that the marginal value of adding outliers is higher than
that of adding inliers. In summary, improvement on single-organ performance was
obtained without diminishing multi-organ performance or significantly
increasing training time. Hence, identification and correction of baseline
failure cases present an effective and efficient method of selecting training
data to improve algorithm performance.

intensity, $P$, degree of polarization, $\Pi=P/I$, and two new quantities, the
astrophysical $E$ and $B$ modes of Ly$\alpha$ polarization. The one-halo terms
of the $\Pi$ power spectra show a turnover that signals the average extent of
the polarization signal, and thus the extent of the scattering medium. The
position of this feature depends on redshift, and on the specific emission
profile shape and extent, in our formalism. Therefore, the comparison of
various Ly$\alpha$ polarization quantities and redshifts can break degeneracies
between competing effects, and it can reveal the true shape of the emission
profiles, and thus, the physical properties of the cool gas in halos.
Furthermore, measurements of Ly$\alpha$ $E$ and $B$ modes may be used as probes
of galaxy evolution, because they are related to the average degree of
anisotropy in the emission and in the halo gas distribution across redshifts.
The detection of the polarization signal at $z \sim 3-5$ requires improvements
in the sensitivity of current ground-based experiments by a factor of $\sim
10$, and of $\sim 100$ for space-based instruments targeting the redshifts
$z\sim 9-10$, the exact values depending on the specific redshift and
experiment. Interloper contamination in polarization is expected to be small,
because the interlopers need to also be polarized. Overall, Ly$\alpha$
polarization boosts the amount of physical information retrievable on galaxies
and their surroundings, most of it not achievable with total emission alone.

binary system. In this review, we present an overview of the multi-wavelength
observations and attempts to understand the 2010 transient event and, later,
the re-classification of this system as NGC~300 ULX-1: a red supergiant +
neutron star ultraluminous X-ray source.

  Re-Identification","accepted by AAAI'20",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RGB-Infrared (IR) person re-identification is very challenging due to the
large cross-modality variations between RGB and IR images. The key solution is
to learn aligned features to the bridge RGB and IR modalities. However, due to
the lack of correspondence labels between every pair of RGB and IR images, most
methods try to alleviate the variations with set-level alignment by reducing
the distance between the entire RGB and IR sets. However, this set-level
alignment may lead to misalignment of some instances, which limits the
performance for RGB-IR Re-ID. Different from existing methods, in this paper,
we propose to generate cross-modality paired-images and perform both global
set-level and fine-grained instance-level alignments. Our proposed method
enjoys several merits. First, our method can perform set-level alignment by
disentangling modality-specific and modality-invariant features. Compared with
conventional methods, ours can explicitly remove the modality-specific features
and the modality variation can be better reduced. Second, given cross-modality
unpaired-images of a person, our method can generate cross-modality paired
images from exchanged images. With them, we can directly perform instance-level
alignment by minimizing distances of every pair of images. Extensive
experimental results on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
model favourably against state-of-the-art methods. Especially, on SYSU-MM01
dataset, our model can achieve a gain of 9.2% and 7.7% in terms of Rank-1 and
mAP. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/JSIA-ReID.

integrate NAS with Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), despite
them being the most powerful AI accelerating platforms. The major bottleneck
comes from the large design freedom associated with ASIC designs. Moreover,
with the consideration that multiple DNNs will run in parallel for different
workloads with diverse layer operations and sizes, integrating heterogeneous
ASIC sub-accelerators for distinct DNNs in one design can significantly boost
performance, and at the same time further complicate the design space. To
address these challenges, in this paper we build ASIC template set based on
existing successful designs, described by their unique dataflows, so that the
design space is significantly reduced. Based on the templates, we further
propose a framework, namely NASAIC, which can simultaneously identify multiple
DNN architectures and the associated heterogeneous ASIC accelerator design,
such that the design specifications (specs) can be satisfied, while the
accuracy can be maximized. Experimental results show that compared with
successive NAS and ASIC design optimizations which lead to design spec
violations, NASAIC can guarantee the results to meet the design specs with
17.77%, 2.49x, and 2.32x reductions on latency, energy, and area and with 0.76%

$\lambda\log\left(1+\frac{N_t(\lambda)}{\lambda}\right)$. For the MIMO case
with single-stream eigenbeamforming and $N_r(\lambda) \leq N_t(\lambda)$

This removes a barrier in the prior state-of-the-art analysis for the
well-studied Metropolized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for sampling
from a strongly logconcave distribution. We correspondingly demonstrate that
Metropolized HMC mixes in $\tilde{O}(\kappa d)$ iterations, improving upon the

to our knowledge have not appeared in the literature and may be of independent

behavior, and a new reduction technique for boosting a constant-accuracy total
variation guarantee under weak warmness assumptions. This is the first
high-accuracy mixing time result for logconcave distributions using only

$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. By establishing an appropriate form of the
dynamic programming principle for both the value function and the Q function,
it proposes a model-free kernel-based Q-learning algorithm (MFC-K-Q), which is
shown to have a linear convergence rate for the MFC problem, the first of its
kind in the MARL literature. It further establishes that the convergence rate
and the sample complexity of MFC-K-Q are independent of the number of agents
$N$, which provides an $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ approximation to the
MARL problem with $N$ agents in the learning environment. Empirical studies for
the network traffic congestion problem demonstrate that MFC-K-Q outperforms
existing MARL algorithms when $N$ is large, for instance when $N>50$.

charged particle bombardment, and possible cryovolcanic activity can alter the
percentage of the crystalline form of water ice compared to that of the
amorphous form of water ice (the ''crystallinity'') on Europa's surface. The
timescales over which amorphous water ice is thermally transformed to
crystalline water ice at Europan surface temperatures suggests that the water
ice there should be primarily in the crystalline form, however, surface
bombardment by charged particles induced by Jupiter's magnetic field, and vapor
deposition of water ice from Europan plumes, can produce amorphous water ice
surface deposits on short timescales. The purpose of this investigation is to
determine whether the Europan surface water ice crystallinity derived from
ground-based spectroscopic measurements is in agreement with the crystallinity
expected based on temperature and radiation modeling. Using a 1D thermophysical
model of Europa's surface, we calculate a full-disk crystallinity of Europa's
leading hemisphere by incorporating the thermal relaxation of amorphous to
crystalline water ice and the degradation of crystalline to amorphous water ice
by irradiation. Concurrently, we derive the full-disk crystallinity of Europa's
leading hemisphere using a comparison of near-infrared ground-based spectral
observations from Grundy et al. (1999), Busarev et al. (2018), and the Apache
Point Observatory with laboratory spectra from Mastrapa et al. (2018) and the
Ice Spectroscopy Lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We calculate a modeled
crystallinity significantly higher than crystallinities derived from
ground-based observations and laboratory spectra. This discrepancy may be a
result of geophysical processes, such as by vapor-deposited plume material, or
it may arise from assumptions and uncertainties in the crystallinity
calculations.

index tracks inflammation in piglets and its relationship to VENG. Following
anesthesia, electrodes were attached to the left vagal nerve; ECG and blood
pressure (BP) were recorded throughout the experiment. Following baseline, the
piglets were administered LPS as 2mg/kg IV bolus. In the VNS treated piglet,
the vagus nerve was stimulated for 10 minutes prior to and 10 min after the
injection of LPS. In both groups, every 15 min post LPS, the arterial blood
sample was drawn for blood gas, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines. At the
end of the experiment, the piglets were euthanized. BP and HRV measures were
calculated. The piglets developed a potent inflammatory response to the LPS
injection with TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 peaking between 45 and 90 min
post-injection. VNS diminished the LPS-induced systemic inflammatory response
varying across the measured cytokines from two to ten-fold. The HRV index
tracked accurately the temporal profile of cytokines and VENG changes. This
novel model allows manipulating and tracking neonatal sepsis: The HRV
inflammatory index 1) applies across species pre- and postnatally and 2)
performs well at different degrees of sepsis (i.e., nanogram and milligram

inflammation, even at high doses of LPS. The potential of early postnatal VNS
to counteract sepsis and of HRV monitoring to early detect and track it deserve

from a perturbative analysis of scattering processes in the frequency domain.
This requires a knowledge of a full set of eigenstates in order to account for

quadratic phase coupling which can be detected by the bispectrum. The proposed
method maximizes an integral measure of this third-order statistic to compute
modes associated with frequency triads, as well as a mode bispectrum that
identifies resonant three-wave interactions. Unlike the classical bispectrum,
the decomposition establishes a causal relationship between the three frequency
components of a triad. This permits the distinction of sum- and
difference-interactions, and the computation of interaction maps that indicate
regions of nonlinear coupling. Three examples highlight different aspects of
the method. Cascading triads and their regions of interaction are educed from
direct numerical simulation data of laminar cylinder flow. It is further
demonstrated that linear instability mechanisms that attain an appreciable
amplitude are revealed indirectly by their difference-self-interactions.
Applicability to turbulent flows and noise-rejection is demonstrated on
particle image velocimetry data of a massively separated wake. The generation
of sub- and ultra-harmonics in large eddy simulation data of a transitional jet

study the scenario where a sender, Alice, causes information-carrying
disturbances in a quantum field. We track the exact spread of these
disturbances in space and time by using the technique of quantum information
capsules (QIC). We find that the channel capacity between Alice and a receiver,
Bob, is enhanced by Bob placing detectors not only inside but in addition also
outside the causal future of Alice's encoding operation. Intuitively, this type
of superadditivity arises because the field outside the causal future of Alice
is entangled with the field inside Alice's causal future. Hence, the quantum
noise picked up by Bob's detectors outside Alice's causal future is correlated
with the noise of Bob's detectors inside Alice's causal future. In effect, this
correlation allows Bob to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of those of his
detectors which are in the causal future of Alice. Further, we develop the
multimode generalization of the QIC technique. This allows us to extend the
analysis to the case where Alice operates multiple localized and optionally
entangled emitters. We apply the new techniques to the case where Alice
enhances the channel capacity by operating multiple emitters that are suitably
lined up and pre-timed to generate a quantum shockwave in the field.

models over the data residing at mobile devices, while protecting the privacy

large number of users is the overhead of secure model aggregation across many
users. In particular, the overhead of the state-of-the-art protocols for secure
model aggregation grows quadratically with the number of users. In this paper,
we propose the first secure aggregation framework, named Turbo-Aggregate, that
in a network with $N$ users achieves a secure aggregation overhead of
$O(N\log{N})$, as opposed to $O(N^2)$, while tolerating up to a user dropout
rate of $50\%$. Turbo-Aggregate employs a multi-group circular strategy for
efficient model aggregation, and leverages additive secret sharing and novel
coding techniques for injecting aggregation redundancy in order to handle user
dropouts while guaranteeing user privacy. We experimentally demonstrate that
Turbo-Aggregate achieves a total running time that grows almost linear in the
number of users, and provides up to $40\times$ speedup over the

interpolates between the values in the domains by either reducing to zero (in
Ising-type DW) or rotating (Bloch type DW). Here we present a new member of DW

where the primary order parameter reduces to zero. Our first-principles-derived

annihilation or decay, essentially free of astrophysical background. Studies in
recent years have emphasized that models for cosmic-ray antideuterons must be
considered together with the abundant cosmic antiprotons and any potential
observation of antihelium. Therefore, a second dedicated Antideuteron Workshop
was organized at UCLA in March 2019, bringing together a community of theorists
and experimentalists to review the status of current observations of cosmic-ray
antinuclei, the theoretical work towards understanding these signatures, and
the potential of upcoming measurements to illuminate ongoing controversies.
This review aims to synthesize this recent work and present implications for

discussion of a possible dark matter signature in the AMS-02 antiproton

the literature. The research on this topic is vast and still flourishing. One
way to analyze the scaling properties of time series is through the estimation
of their scaling exponents, that are recognized as being valuable measures to
discriminate between random, persistent, and anti-persistent behaviors in these
time series. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to study the
multiscaling property. In this paper, we use the generalized Hurst exponent
(GHE) tool and we propose a novel statistical procedure based on GHE which we
name Relative Normalized and Standardized Generalized Hurst Exponent (RNSGHE).
This method is used to robustly estimate and test the multiscaling property
and, together with a combination of t-tests and F-tests, serves to discriminate
between real and spurious scaling. Furthermore, we introduce a new tool to
estimate the optimal aggregation time used in our methodology which we name
Autocororrelation Segmented Regression. We numerically validate this procedure
on simulated time series by using the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) and we
then apply it to real financial data. We present results for times series with
and without anomalies and we compute the bias that such anomalies introduce in
the measurement of the scaling exponents. We also show how the use of proper
scaling and multiscaling can ameliorate the estimation of risk measures such as
Value at Risk (VaR). Finally, we propose a methodology based on Monte Carlo
simulation, which we name Multiscaling Value at Risk (MSVaR), that takes into
account the statistical properties of multiscaling time series. We show that by
using this statistical procedure in combination with the robustly estimated
multiscaling exponents, the one year forecasted MSVaR mimics the VaR on the
annual data for the majority of the stocks analyzed.

where millimeter-wave and microwave carriers are used for the access links and
fronthaul links, respectively. The base stations (BSs) jointly serve users
through cooperating hybrid analog/digital BF. We first develop an analog BF for
cooperating BSs. On this basis, we formulate a secrecy rate maximization (SRM)
problem subject both to a realistic limited fronthaul capacity and to the total
BS transmit power constraint. Due to the intractability of the non-convex
problem formulated, advanced convex approximated techniques, constrained
concave convex procedures and semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation are
applied to transform it into a convex one. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm
of jointly optimizing multicast BF, cooperative digital BF and the artificial
noise (AN) covariance is proposed. Next, we construct the solution of the
original problem by exploiting both the primal and the dual optimal solution of
the SDP-relaxed problem. Furthermore, a per-BS transmit power constraint is
considered, necessitating the reformulation of the SRM problem, which can be
solved by an efficient iterative algorithm. We then eliminate the idealized
simplifying assumption of having perfect channel state information (CSI) for
the eavesdropper links and invoke realistic imperfect CSI. Furthermore, a
worst-case SRM problem is investigated. Finally, by combining the so-called

sedimentation. In experiment and theory on disks, aligned facing their
neighbours in a horizontal one-dimensional lattice and settling at Reynolds

for large enough lattice spacing the coupling of disk orientation and
translation rescues the array from the clumping instability. Despite the
absence of inertia the resulting dynamics displays the wavelike excitations of
a mass-and-spring array, with a conserved ""momentum"" in the form of the
collective tilt of the disks and an emergent spring stiffness from the viscous
hydrodynamic interaction. However, the non-normal character of the dynamical
matrix leads to algebraic growth of perturbations even in the linearly stable
regime. Stability analysis demarcates a phase boundary in the plane of
wavenumber and lattice spacing, separating the regimes of algebraically growing
waves and clumping, in quantitative agreement with our experiments. Anisotropic
shape thus suppresses the classic linear instability of sedimenting sphere
arrays, introduces a new conserved variable, and opens a window to the physics
of transient growth of linearly stable modes.

Multiple RRHs form a cluster to cooperatively serve the actuators, which
acquire their required files either from the local caches or from the central
processor via multicast fronthaul links. For such a scenario, we formulate a
beamforming design problem to minimize the secure transmission delay under

{\textit{i)}} minimizing the fronthaul transmission delay by jointly optimizing
the transmit and receive beamforming; {\textit{ii)}} minimizing the maximum

introduce a structure embedding scheme to explicitly embed the learned
structure features into the inpainting process, thus to provide possible

Through multi-task learning, structure embedding besides with attention, our

atomistic modeling of complex materials with near first-principles accuracy.
For molecular dynamics simulations, accurate energies and interatomic forces
are a prerequisite, but training ANN potentials simultaneously on energies and
forces from electronic structure calculations is computationally demanding.
Here, we introduce an efficient alternative method for the training of ANN
potentials on energy and force information based on an extrapolation of the
total energy via a Taylor expansion. By translating the force information to
approximate energies, the quadratic scaling with the number of atoms exhibited
by conventional force-training methods can be avoided, which enables the
training on reference data sets containing complex atomic structures. We
demonstrate for different materials systems, clusters of water molecules, bulk
liquid water, and a lithium transition-metal oxide, that the proposed
force-training approach provides substantial improvements over schemes that
train on energies only. Including force information for training reduces the
size of the reference data sets required for ANN potential construction,
increases the transferability of the potential, and generally improves the
force prediction accuracy. For a set of water clusters, the Taylor-expansion
approach achieves around 50% of the force error improvement compared to the
explicit training on all force components, at a much smaller computational
cost. The alternative force training approach thus simplifies the construction
of general ANN potentials for the prediction of accurate energies and
interatomic forces for diverse types of materials, as demonstrated here for
water and a transition-metal oxide.

  Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2020)",,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We consider the task of learning a parametric Continuous Time Markov Chain
(CTMC) sequence model without examples of sequences, where the training data
consists entirely of aggregate steady-state statistics. Making the problem
harder, we assume that the states we wish to predict are unobserved in the
training data. Specifically, given a parametric model over the transition rates
of a CTMC and some known transition rates, we wish to extrapolate its steady
state distribution to states that are unobserved. A technical roadblock to
learn a CTMC from its steady state has been that the chain rule to compute
gradients will not work over the arbitrarily long sequences necessary to reach
steady state ---from where the aggregate statistics are sampled. To overcome
this optimization challenge, we propose $\infty$-SGD, a principled stochastic
gradient descent method that uses randomly-stopped estimators to avoid infinite
sums required by the steady state computation, while learning even when only a
subset of the CTMC states can be observed. We apply $\infty$-SGD to a
real-world testbed and synthetic experiments showcasing its accuracy, ability
to extrapolate the steady state distribution to unobserved states under
unobserved conditions (heavy loads, when training under light loads), and
succeeding in difficult scenarios where even a tailor-made extension of
existing methods fails.

However, it does not satisfy triangular inequality and has high computational
complexity, severely limiting its applications in similarity search on
large-scale datasets. Usually, we resort to lower bounding distances to speed
up similarity search under DTW. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of an
effective lower bounding distance that can measure unequal-length time series
and has desirable tightness. In the paper, we propose a novel lower bounding
distance LB_Keogh+, which is a seamless combination of sequence extension and
LB_Keogh. It can be used for unequal-length sequences and has low computational
complexity. Besides, LB_Keogh+ can extend sequences to an arbitrary suitable
length, without significantly reducing tightness. Next, based on LB_Keogh+, an
exact index of time series under DTW is devised. Then, we introduce several
theorems and complete the relevant proofs to guarantee no false dismissals in
our similarity search. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on
real-world datasets. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method can
perform similarity search of unequal-length sequences with high tightness and
good pruning power.

energy arbitrage, peak demand shaving, power factor correction, energy backup
to name a few, and can play a major role at increasing the capacity of power
networks to host renewable energy sources. Often, storage control algorithms
will need to be \textit{tailored} according to power networks billing
structure, reliability restrictions, and other local power networks norms. In
this paper we explore residential energy storage applications in Uruguay, one
of the global leaders in renewable energies, where new low-voltage consumer
contracts were recently introduced. Based on these billing mechanisms, we focus
on energy arbitrage and reactive energy compensation with the aim of minimizing
the cost of consumption of an end-user. Given that in the new contacts the
buying and selling price of electricity are equal and that reactive power
compensation is primarily governed by the installed converter, the storage
operation is not sensitive to parameter uncertainties and, therefore, no
lookahead is required for decision making. A threshold-based
\textit{hierarchical} controller is proposed which decides on the optimal
active energy for arbitrage and uses the remaining converter capacity for
reactive power compensation, which is shown to increase end-user profit.
Numerical results indicate that storage could be profitable, even considering
battery degradation, under some but not all of the studied contracts. For the
cases in which it is not, we propose the best-suited contract. Results
presented here can be naturally applied whenever the tariff structure satisfies
the hypothesis considered in this work.

spontaneous CP violation which simultaneously addresses the affects coming from
supersymmetry breaking. The generated CP violating phase is communicated to the
quark sector by interacting with a heavy quark a la Nelson-Barr. The Majorana
mass of the right handed neutrinos is generated by interactions with the CP
violating sector and so does not conserve CP. This gives the neutrino sector a
non-trivial CP violating phase which can then generate the baryon asymmetry of
the universe through leptogeneis. The problematic phase in the supersymmetry
breaking parameters are suppressed by appealing to a particular gauge mediation
model which naturally suppresses the phases of the tree-level gluino mass. This
suppression plus the fact that in gauge mediation all loop generated flavor and
CP violation is of the minimal flavor violation variety allows for a complete
and consistent solution to the strong CP problem.

point from the in-distribution dataset. We extend this argument to detect
finer-grained uncertainty that distinguishes between (a). certain points, (b).
uncertain points but within the data distribution, and (c). out-of-distribution
points. Our method corrects overconfident NN decisions, detects outlier points
and learns to say ``I don't know'' when uncertain about a critical point
between the top two predictions. In addition, we provide a mechanism to
quantify class distributions overlap in the decision manifold and investigate
its implications in model interpretability.
  Our method is two-step: in the first step, the proposed method builds a class
distribution using Kernel Activation Vectors (kav) extracted from the Network.
In the second step, the algorithm determines the confidence of a test point by
a hierarchical decision rule based on the chi-squared distribution of squared
Mahalanobis distances.
  Our method sits on top of a given Neural Network, requires a single scan of
training data to estimate class distribution statistics, and is highly scalable
to deep networks and wider pre-softmax layer. As a positive side effect, our
method helps to prevent adversarial attacks without requiring any additional
training. It is directly achieved when the Softmax layer is substituted by our
robust uncertainty layer at the evaluation phase.

many of visual recognition applications like, e.g., video surveillance, where
fine tuning with labeled image data from each new camera is required to reduce
the domain shift between videos captured from the source domain, e.g., a
laboratory setting, and the target domain, i.e, an operational environment. In
many video surveillance applications, like face recognition (FR) and person
re-identification, a pair-wise matcher is used to assign a query image captured
using a video camera to the corresponding reference images in a gallery. The
different configurations and operational conditions of video cameras can
introduce significant shifts in the pair-wise distance distributions, resulting
in degraded recognition performance for new cameras. In this paper, a new deep
domain adaptation (DA) method is proposed to adapt the CNN embedding of a
Siamese network using unlabeled tracklets captured with a new video cameras. To
this end, a dual-triplet loss is introduced for metric learning, where two
triplets are constructed using video data from a source camera, and a new
target camera. In order to constitute the dual triplets, a mutual-supervised
learning approach is introduced where the source camera acts as a teacher,
providing the target camera with an initial embedding. Then, the student relies
on the teacher to iteratively label the positive and negative pairs collected
during, e.g., initial camera calibration. Both source and target embeddings
continue to simultaneously learn such that their pair-wise distance
distributions become aligned. For validation, the proposed metric learning
technique is used to train deep Siamese networks under different training
scenarios, and is compared to state-of-the-art techniques for still-to-video FR
on the COX-S2V and a private video-based FR dataset.

Edges and boundaries encode shape information, while textures manifest the

imprecise boundary delineations. In medical imaging, expert manual segmentation

medical practitioner usually identifies edges first and subsequently fills in
the segmentation mask. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
plug-and-play module, dubbed Edge-Gated CNNs (EG-CNNs), that can be used with
existing encoder-decoder architectures to process both edge and texture

predict crisp boundaries by an auxiliary edge supervision, and to fuse its

on event detection from tweet streams, most existing methods have not
considered the posted images in tweets, which provide richer information than
the text, and potentially can be a reliable indicator of whether an event
occurs or not. In this paper, we design an event detection algorithm that
combines textual, statistical and image information, following an unsupervised
machine learning approach. Specifically, the algorithm starts with semantic and
statistical analyses to obtain a list of tweet clusters, each of which
corresponds to an event candidate, and then performs image analysis to separate
events from non-events---a convolutional autoencoder is trained for each
cluster as an anomaly detector, where a part of the images are used as the
training data and the remaining images are used as the test instances. Our
experiments on multiple datasets verify that when an event occurs, the mean
reconstruction errors of the training and test images are much closer, compared
with the case where the candidate is a non-event cluster. Based on this
finding, the algorithm rejects a candidate if the difference is larger than a
threshold. Experimental results over millions of tweets demonstrate that this
image analysis enhanced approach can significantly increase the precision with
minimum impact on the recall.

of two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in a uniform magnetic
field. At $\pi$ flux per plaquette, this model corresponds to the typical model
of HOTIs proposed by Benalcazar, Bernevig, and Hughes (BBH). The BBH model can
be approximated by Dirac fermions with two kinds of mass terms, which will be
referred to as BBH Dirac insulator. To clarify the BOTP transition of the 2D
SSH model around $\pi$ flux, we study such BBH Dirac insulator in the presence
of a magnetic field. On the other hand, generically in continuum Dirac models,
boundary conditions associated with the Hermiticity of Hamiltonians are known
to play a crucial role in determining the edge states. We first demonstrate
that for the conventional Dirac fermion with a single mass term, such boundary
conditions indeed determine the edge states even in the presence of a magnetic
field. Next, imposing boundary conditions consistent to the lattice
terminations and symmetries of the BBH Hamiltonian as well as to the
Hermiticity of the BBH Dirac insulator, we obtain the edge states of the BBH

the hope of understanding the functionality of the device and determining its

has become an increasingly important area of research. At the same time,
network regularization has been recognized as a crucial dimension to effective
training of DNNs. However, the role of metalearning in establishing effective
regularization has not yet been fully explored. There is recent evidence that
loss-function optimization could play this role, however it is computationally
impractical as an outer loop to full training. This paper presents an algorithm
called Evolutionary Population-Based Training (EPBT) that interleaves the
training of a DNN's weights with the metalearning of loss functions. They are
parameterized using multivariate Taylor expansions that EPBT can directly
optimize. Such simultaneous adaptation of weights and loss functions can be
deceptive, and therefore EPBT uses a quality-diversity heuristic called Novelty
Pulsation as well as knowledge distillation to prevent overfitting during
training. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN image classification benchmarks, EPBT
results in faster, more accurate learning. The discovered hyperparameters adapt
to the training process and serve to regularize the learning task by
discouraging overfitting to the labels. EPBT thus demonstrates a practical
instantiation of regularization metalearning based on simultaneous training.

devices, e.g., clutches and brakes, that use dry friction. In these systems,
the variability in power transmission is brought about by engaging and
disengaging the friction plates. Though commonly used, this method of making
the coupling noisy is not as versatile as their electrical analog. An
alternative method would be to intermittently vary the frictional force. In
this paper, we demonstrate a self-organized way to tune the noise in the
frictional coupling between two surfaces which are in relative motion with each
other. This is achieved by exploiting the complexity that arises from the
frictional interaction of the balls which are placed in a circular groove
between the surfaces. The extent of floppiness in the coupling is related to
the rate at which the balls make transitions between their rolling and sliding
states. If the moving surface is soft and the static surface is hard we show
that with increasing filling fraction of the balls the transitions between
rolling and sliding against the static surface give way to the transitions
between rolling and sliding against the moving surface. As a consequence, the
noise in the coupling is large for both small and large filling fraction with a
dip in the middle. In contrast, the sliding with the static surface is
suppressed if the moving pate is hard and the noise in the coupling decreases
monotonically with the filling fraction of the balls.

that unavoidable disorder in the environment is responsible for non-Markovian
effects and information backflow from the environment into the system owing to
Anderson localization. This~turns disorder into a resource for enhancing
non-Markovianity in the system--environment dynamics, which could be of
relevance in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we consider the decoherence
dynamics of a qubit weakly coupled to a two-dimensional bath with a nontrivial
topological phase, such as a two-level atom embedded in a two-dimensional
coupled-cavity array with a synthetic gauge field realizing a quantum-Hall
bath, and~show that Markovianity is protected against moderate disorder owing
to the robustness of chiral edge modes in the quantum-Hall bath. Interestingly,
switching off the gauge field, i.e., flipping the bath into a topological
trivial phase, allows one to re-introduce non-Markovian effects. Such a result
indicates that changing the topological phase of a bath by a tunable synthetic
gauge field can be harnessed to control non-Markovian effects and quantum

competing constraints: sensor coverage, line-of-sight visibility, and network
connectivity. The central challenge in our synthesis problem is quickly scaling
to large regions while producing cost-effective solutions. We explore two
qualitatively different representations of the synthesis problems
satisfiability modulo convex optimization (SMC), and mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP). The former is more expressive, for our problem, than the
latter, but is less well-suited for solving optimization problems like ours. We
show how to express our network synthesis in these frameworks, and, to scale to
problem sizes beyond what these frameworks are capable of, develop a
hierarchical synthesis technique that independently synthesizes networks in
sub-regions of the deployment area, then combines these. We find that, while
MILP outperforms SMC in some settings for smaller problem sizes, the fact that
SMC's expressivity matches our problem ensures that it uniformly generates
better quality solutions at larger problem sizes.

However, the fundamental limitation of machine learning methods is their

Here, we implement the workflow for causal analysis of structural scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data and explore the interplay between
physical and chemical effects in ferroelectric perovskite across the
ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase transitions. The combinatorial library of
the Sm-doped BiFeO3 is grown to cover the composition range from pure
ferroelectric BFO to orthorhombic 20% Sm-doped BFO. Atomically resolved STEM
images are acquired for selected compositions and are used to create a set of
local compositional, structural, and polarization field descriptors. The
information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) and additive noise model (ANM)
analysis are used to establish the pairwise causal directions between the
descriptors, ordering the data set in the causal direction. The causal chain
for IGCI and ANM across the composition is compared and suggests the presence
of common causal mechanisms across the composition series. Ultimately, we
believe that the causal analysis of the multimodal data will allow exploring
the causal links between multiple competing mechanisms that control the
emergence of unique functionalities of morphotropic materials and ferroelectric

between responses ($y$) and contexts ($x$), i.e., the forward probability $\log
p(y|x)$ and the backward probability $\log p(x|y)$, has been widely used as the
objective in the \sts model to address the dull-response issue in open-domain
dialog generation. Unfortunately, under the framework of the \sts model, direct
decoding from $\log p(y|x) + \log p(x|y)$ is infeasible since the second part
(i.e., $p(x|y)$) requires the completion of target generation before it can be
computed, and the search space for $y$ is enormous. Empirically, an N-best list
is first generated given $p(y|x)$, and $p(x|y)$ is then used to rerank the
N-best list, which inevitably results in non-globally-optimal solutions. In
this paper, we propose to use non-autoregressive (non-AR) generation model to
address this non-global optimality issue. Since target tokens are generated
independently in non-AR generation, $p(x|y)$ for each target word can be
computed as soon as it's generated, and does not have to wait for the
completion of the whole sequence. This naturally resolves the non-global
optimal issue in decoding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
non-AR strategy produces more diverse, coherent, and appropriate responses,
yielding substantive gains in BLEU scores and in human evaluations.

achieves a substantial reduce in time consumption of training and inference

metamaterials owing to the extremely large photonic density of states in
classical local framework. While recent advances in nonlocal and quantum
effects extend our understanding of light-matter interactions in metallic
nanostructures, the influence of nonlocality on threshold-free Cherenkov
radiation still remains elusive. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the
nonlocality provides an indispensable way to flexibly engineer Cherenkov
thresholds in metallodielectric layered structures. Particularly, the
nonlocality results in a lower-bound velocity cutoff, whose value is comparable
to the electron Fermi velocity. Surprisingly, this lower-bound threshold can be
significantly smaller than the classically predicted one if the metamaterial
works around epsilon-near-zero frequencies. The capability to control Cherenkov
thresholds opens numerous prospects for practical applications of Cherenkov
radiation, in particular, for integrated free-electron radiation sources.

statistical problem assessing whether sample points are generated from a fixed
density $f_0$, or not. The observations are kept hidden and replaced by a
stochastic transformation satisfying the local differential privacy constraint.
In this setting, we propose a testing procedure which is based on an estimation
of the quadratic distance between the density $f$ of the unobserved samples and
$f_0$. We establish an upper bound on the separation distance associated with
this test, and a matching lower bound on the minimax separation rates of
testing under non-interactive privacy in the case that $f_0$ is uniform, in
discrete and continuous settings. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the
first minimax optimal test and associated private transformation under a local
differential privacy constraint over Besov balls in the continuous setting,
quantifying the price to pay for data privacy. We also present a test that is
adaptive to the smoothness parameter of the unknown density and remains minimax
optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Finally, we note that our results can be
translated to the discrete case, where the treatment of probability vectors is
shown to be equivalent to that of piecewise constant densities in our setting.
That is why we work with a unified setting for both the continuous and the
discrete cases.

local regions that correspond to subtle visual traits. Great strides have been
made, with complex networks designed specifically to learn part-level
discriminate feature representations. In this paper, we show it is possible to
cultivate subtle details without the need for overly complicated network
designs or training mechanisms -- a single loss is all it takes. The main trick
lies with how we delve into individual feature channels early on, as opposed to
the convention of starting from a consolidated feature map. The proposed loss
function, termed as mutual-channel loss (MC-Loss), consists of two
channel-specific components: a discriminality component and a diversity
component. The discriminality component forces all feature channels belonging
to the same class to be discriminative, through a novel channel-wise attention
mechanism. The diversity component additionally constraints channels so that
they become mutually exclusive on spatial-wise. The end result is therefore a
set of feature channels that each reflects different locally discriminative
regions for a specific class. The MC-Loss can be trained end-to-end, without
the need for any bounding-box/part annotations, and yields highly
discriminative regions during inference. Experimental results show our MC-Loss
when implemented on top of common base networks can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on all four fine-grained categorization datasets (CUB-Birds,
FGVC-Aircraft, Flowers-102, and Stanford-Cars). Ablative studies further
demonstrate the superiority of MC-Loss when compared with other recently
proposed general-purpose losses for visual classification, on two different
base networks. Code available at

generate MR sequences and corresponding reconstruction based on the target
contrast of interest. Combined with a flexible, task-driven cost function this
allows for an efficient exploration of novel MR sequence strategies. Methods:
The scanning and reconstruction process is simulated end-to-end in terms of RF
events, gradient moment events in x and y, and delay times, acting on the input
model spin system given in terms of proton density, T1 and T2, and $\Delta$B0.
As a proof of concept, we use both conventional MR images and T1 maps as
targets and optimize from scratch using the loss defined by data fidelity, SAR
penalty, and scan time. Results: In a first attempt, \textit{MRzero} learns
gradient and RF events from zero, and is able to generate a target image
produced by a conventional gradient echo sequence. Using a neural network
within the reconstruction module allows arbitrary targets to be learned
successfully. Experiments could be translated to image acquisition at the real
system (3T Siemens, PRISMA) and could be verified in the measurements of
phantoms and a human brain \textit{in vivo}. Conclusions: Automated MR sequence
generation is possible based on differentiable Bloch equation simulations and a
supervised learning approach.

TSN and IETF Detnet) in order to reduce burstiness inside the network and to
support the computation of guaranteed latency bounds. This is performed using
per-flow regulators (such as the Token Bucket Filter) or interleaved regulators
(as with IEEE TSN Asynchronous Traffic Shaping). Both types of regulators are
beneficial as they cancel the increase of burstiness due to multiplexing inside
the network. It was demonstrated, by using network calculus, that they do not
increase the worst-case latency. However, the properties of regulators were
established assuming that time is perfect in all network nodes. In reality,
nodes use local, imperfect clocks. Time-sensitive networks exist in two
flavours: (1) in non-synchronized networks, local clocks run independently at
every node and their deviations are not controlled and (2) in synchronized
networks, the deviations of local clocks are kept within very small bounds
using for example a synchronization protocol (such as PTP) or a satellite based
geo-positioning system (such as GPS). We revisit the properties of regulators
in both cases. In non-synchronized networks, we show that ignoring the timing
inaccuracies can lead to network instability due to unbounded delay in per-flow
or interleaved regulators. We propose and analyze two methods (rate and burst
cascade, and asynchronous dual arrival-curve method) for avoiding this problem.
In synchronized networks, we show that there is no instability with per-flow
regulators but, surprisingly, interleaved regulators can lead to instability.
To establish these results, we develop a new framework that captures industrial
requirements on clocks in both non-synchronized and synchronized networks, and
we develop a toolbox that extends network calculus to account for clock
imperfections.

depositing them on nano-structured surfaces, where position-dependent strain
can be produced on the nano-scale. Here, we demonstrate strain-induced
modifications of the optical properties of mono- and bilayer TMD WSe$_2 $
placed on photonic nano-antennas made from gallium phosphide (GaP).
Photoluminescence (PL) from the strained areas of the TMD layer is enhanced
owing to the efficient coupling with the confined optical mode of the
nano-antenna. Thus, by following the shift of the PL peak, we deduce the
changes in the strain in WSe$_2$ deposited on the nano-antennas of different
radii. In agreement with the presented theory, strain up to $\approx 1.4 \%$ is
observed for WSe$_2$ monolayers. We also estimate that $>3\%$ strain is
achieved in bilayers, accompanied with the emergence of a direct bandgap in
this normally indirect-bandgap semiconductor. At cryogenic temperatures, we
find evidence of the exciton confinement in the most strained nano-scale parts

disappearing at the event horizon. In Schwarzschild metric PR degenerates to
the two-dimensional photon sphere $r=3r_g/2$ where closed circular photon
orbits are located. The photon sphere as a three-dimensional hypersurface in
spacetime is umbilic (its second quadratic form is pure trace). In Kerr metric
the equatorial circular orbits have different radii for prograde, $r_p$, and
retrograde, $r_r$, motion (where $r$ is Boyer-Lindquist radial variable), while
for $r_p<r<r_r$ the spherical orbits with constant $r$ exist which are no more
planar, but filling some spheres. These spheres, however, do not correspond to
umbilic hypersurfaces. In more general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes not
allowing for complete integration of geodesic equations, the numerical
integration show the existence of PR as well, but the underlying geometric
structure was not fully identified so far. Here we suggest geometric
description of PR in generic stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, showing that
PR can be foliated by {\em partially umbilic hypersurfaces}, such that the
umbilic condition holds for classes of orbits defined by the foliation
parameter. New formalism opens a way of analytic description of PR in
stationary axisymmetric spacetimes with non-separable geodesic equations.

vacancies, such as Nb(1-x)CoSb, Ti(1-x)NiSb and V(1-x)CoSb, are a group of
promising thermoelectric materials. Even with high vacancy concentrations they
maintain the average half-Heusler crystal structure. These systems show high
electrical conductivity but low thermal conductivity arising from an ordered YZ
lattice, which conducts electrons, while the large amounts of vacancies on the
X sublattice effectively scatters phonons. Using electron scattering it was
recently observed that in addition to Bragg diffraction from the average cubic
half-Heusler structure, some of these samples show broad diffuse scattering
indicating short-range vacancy order while other samples show sharp additional
peaks, indicating long-range vacancy ordering. Here we show that both the short
and long-range ordering can be explained using the same simple model, which
assumes that vacancies on the X-sublattice avoid each other. The samples
showing long-range vacancy order are in agreement with the predicted
ground-state of the model, while short-range order samples are quenched
high-temperature states of the system. A previous study showed that changes in
sample stoichiometry affect whether the short or long-range vacancy structure
is obtained, but the present model suggests that thermal treatment of samples
should allow controlling the degree of vacancy order, and thereby the thermal
conductivity, without changes in composition. This is important as the
composition also dictates the amount of electrical carriers. Independent
control of electrical carrier concentration and degree of vacancy order should
allow further improvements in the thermoelectric properties of these systems.

the wave dynamics of two classic models of WCI; namely, the Generalised
Lagrangian Mean (GLM) model and the Craik--Leibovich (CL) model. The key idea
for the GLM approach is the separation of the Lagrangian (fluid) and Eulerian
(wave) degrees of freedom in Hamilton's principle. This is done by coupling an
Euler--Poincar\'e {\it reduced Lagrangian} for the current flow and a {\it
phase-space Lagrangian} for the wave field. WCI in the GLM model involves the
nonlinear Doppler shift in frequency of the Hamiltonian wave subsystem, which
arises because the waves propagate in the frame of motion of the
Lagrangian-mean velocity of the current. In contrast, WCI in the CL model
arises because the fluid velocity is defined relative to the frame of motion of
the Stokes mean drift velocity, which is usually taken to be prescribed, time
independent and driven externally. We compare the GLM and CL theories by
placing them both into the general framework of a stochastic Hamilton's
principle for a 3D Euler--Boussinesq (EB) fluid in a rotating frame. In other
examples, we also apply the GLM and CL methods to add wave physics and
stochasticity to the familiar 1D and 2D shallow water flow models. The
differences in the types of stochasticity which arise for GLM and CL models can
be seen by comparing the Kelvin circulation theorems for the two models. The
GLM model acquires stochasticity in its Lagrangian transport velocity for the
currents and also in its group velocity for the waves. The Kelvin circulation
theorem stochastic CL model can accept stochasticity in its both its integrand
and in the Lagrangian transport velocity of its circulation loop.

system configurations. Here we employ a neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (NADE) to boost Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of a
paradigmatic classical model of spin-glass theory, namely the two-dimensional
Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian. We show that a NADE can be trained to accurately
mimic the Boltzmann distribution using unsupervised learning from system
configurations generated using standard MCMC algorithms. The trained NADE is
then employed as smart proposal distribution for the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm. This allows us to perform efficient MCMC simulations, which provide
unbiased results even if the expectation value corresponding to the probability
distribution learned by the NADE is not exact. Notably, we implement a
sequential tempering procedure, whereby a NADE trained at a higher temperature
is iteratively employed as proposal distribution in a MCMC simulation run at a
slightly lower temperature. This allows one to efficiently simulate the
spin-glass model even in the low-temperature regime, avoiding the divergent
correlation times that plague MCMC simulations driven by local-update
algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the NADE-driven simulations quickly

signatures of the excitonic charge character in the molecular valence states.
Optical excitation with visible light results in the instantaneous formation of
charge-transfer (CT) excitons, which transform stepwise into energetically
lower Frenkel-like excitons. While the number and energetic position of energy
levels within this cascade process are independent of the molecular coverage
and the light polarization of the optical excitation, we find quantitative
differences in the depopulation times and the optical excitation efficiency.
Our comprehensive study reveals the crucial role of CT excitons for the excited
state dynamics of homo-molecular fullerene materials and thin films.

also compared to simulated activity cycles. We use the chromospheric Ca II H&K

identify 47 individual cycles from 18 stars. We use the statistical skewness of
a cycle as a measure of its asymmetry, and compare this to other stellar
parameters. A similar analysis has been done to magnetic cycles extracted from
direct numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar-type convection
zones. The shape of the solar cycle (fast rise and slower decline) is common in
other stars as well, although the Sun has particularly asymmetric cycles.
Cycle-to-cycle variations are large, but the average shape of a cycle is still
fairly well represented by a sinusoid. We find only slight correlations between
the cycle asymmetry and other stellar parameters. There are large differences
in the shape of the solar cycle, depending on what activity indicator is used.
In the simulated cycles, there is a difference in the symmetry of global
simulations covering the full longitudinal range, hence capable of exciting
non-axisymmetric dynamo modes, versus wedge simulations covering a partial
extent in longitude, where only axisymmetric modes are possible. The former
produce preferentially positive skewness, while the latter a negative one.

this paper, we propose a novel efficient network pruning method that is
suitable for both non-structured and structured channel-level pruning. Our
proposed method tightens a sparsity constraint by gradually removing network
parameters or filter channels based on a criterion and a schedule. The
attractive fact that the network size keeps dropping throughout the iterations
makes it suitable for the pruning of any untrained or pre-trained network.
Because our method uses a $L_0$ constraint instead of the $L_1$ penalty, it
does not introduce any bias in the training parameters or filter channels.
Furthermore, the $L_0$ constraint makes it easy to directly specify the desired
sparsity level during the network pruning process. Finally, experimental
validation on extensive synthetic and real vision datasets show that the
proposed method obtains better or competitive performance compared to other
states of art network pruning methods.

the dynamics of the high density interior of neutron stars. However, to do so,
realistic glitch models must be constructed and compared to the data. We take a
step towards this goal by testing non-linear models for the mutual friction
force, which is responsible for the exchange of angular momentum between the
neutron superfluid and the observable normal component in a glitch. In
particular, we consider a non-linear dependence of the drag force on the
relative velocity between superfluid vortices and the normal component, in
which the contributions of both kelvon and phonon excitations are included.
This non-linear model produces qualitatively new features, and is able to
reproduce the observed bimodal distribution of glitch sizes in the pulsar
population. The model also suggests that the differences in size distributions
in individual pulsars may be due to the glitches being triggered in regions
with different pinning strengths, as stronger pinning leads to higher vortex
velocities and a qualitatively different mutual friction coupling with respect
to the weak pinning case. Glitches in pulsars that appear to glitch
quasi-periodically with similar sizes may thus be due to the same mechanisms as
smaller events in pulsars that have no preferred glitch size, but simply
originate in stronger pinning regions, possibly in the core of the star.

of the more quick, environmentally friendly and less expensive when compared to
conventional methods. However, some challenges in EDXRF spectral data analysis
still demand more efficient methods capable of providing accurate outcomes.
Using Multi-target Regression (MTR) methods, multiple parameters can be
predicted, and also taking advantage of inter-correlated parameters the overall
predictive performance can be improved. In this study, we proposed the
Multi-target Stacked Generalisation (MTSG), a novel MTR method relying on
learning from different regressors arranged in stacking structure for a boosted

Results showed the superiority of MTR methods over the Single-target Regression

Particularly, MTSG obtained the lowest error for phosphorus, total organic
carbon and cation exchange capacity. When observing the relative performance of
Support Vector Machine with a radial kernel, the prediction of base saturation
percentage was improved in 19%. Finally, the proposed method was able to reduce
the average error from 0.67 (single-target) to 0.64 analysing all targets,

for calculating energy barriers in the magnetisation through variants of the
nudged elastic band method. This computer software has been developed with the
aim of creating a simple code structure that can be readily installed, tested,
and extended. An agile development approach was adopted, with a strong emphasis
on automated builds and tests, and reproducibility of results. The main code
and interface to specify simulations are written in Python, which allows simple
and readable simulation and analysis configuration scripts. Computationally
costly calculations are written in C and exposed to the Python interface as
Cython extensions. Docker containers are shipped for a convenient setup
experience. The code is freely available on GitHub and includes documentation
and examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

It has been observed that a naive application of fully connected neural

an attempt to circumvent this issue, a prior knowledge pertaining to what
features are relevant and their possible feature interactions can be encoded
into these networks. In this work, we use decision trees to capture such
relevant features and their interactions and define a mapping to encode
extracted relationships into a neural network. This addresses the

distribution, etc., it is desirable to learn non-linear models where a small
number of variables are selected and the interaction between them is explicitly
modeled to predict the response. In principle, neural networks (NNs) could
accomplish this task since they can model non-linear feature interactions very
well. However, NNs require large amounts of training data to have a good
generalization. In this paper we study the datastarved regime where a NN is
trained on a relatively small amount of training data. For that purpose we
study feature selection for NNs, which is known to improve generalization for
linear models. As an extreme case of data with feature selection and feature
interactions we study the XOR-like data with irrelevant variables. We
experimentally observed that the cross-entropy loss function on XOR-like data
has many non-equivalent local optima, and the number of local optima grows
exponentially with the number of irrelevant variables. To deal with the local
minima and for feature selection we propose a node pruning and feature
selection algorithm that improves the capability of NNs to find better local
minima even when there are irrelevant variables. Finally, we show that the
performance of a NN on real datasets can be improved using pruning, obtaining
compact networks on a small number of features, with good prediction and
interpretability.

observe conventional sedimentation, while the sedimentation profile becomes
inverted when their values are increased. For neutral squirmers we discover
convective rolls of circulating squirmers between both sedimentation states,

it destroys the intrinsic interconnections among datapoints in the
multidimensional space and, secondly, the number of parameters to be estimated
in a model increases exponentially. We develop a model that overcomes such

regression model that retains the intrinsic multidimensional structure of the

penalization is introduced to deal with over-fitting and collinearity. To
estimate the model parameters, an Alternating Least Squares algorithm is
developed. In order to validate the model performance and robustness, a
simulation exercise is produced. Moreover, we perform an empirical analysis

interpret their RC density fluctuations with the expected overdensities due to
the presence of the spiral arms beyond the bulge. In addition, we find a clear

pure states via the corresponding incoherent channels. It is especially found
that the coherence of a given state can be well characterized by the least
coherence of the input pure states, so a coherence monotone is established by
only effectively quantifying the input pure states. In particular, we show that
our proposed coherence monotone is the supremum of all the coherence monotones
that give the same coherence for any given pure state. Considering the
convexity, we prove that our proposed coherence measure is a subset of the

coherence of a pure state. We also give a thorough analysis on the states of

it has been argued that decision makers should provide explanations that help
individuals understand what would have to change for these decisions to be
beneficial ones. However, there has been little discussion on the possibility
that individuals may use the above counterfactual explanations to invest effort
strategically and maximize their chances of receiving a beneficial decision. In
this paper, our goal is to find policies and counterfactual explanations that
are optimal in terms of utility in such a strategic setting. We first show
that, given a pre-defined policy, the problem of finding the optimal set of
counterfactual explanations is NP-hard. Then, we show that the corresponding
objective is nondecreasing and satisfies submodularity and this allows a
standard greedy algorithm to enjoy approximation guarantees. In addition, we
further show that the problem of jointly finding both the optimal policy and
set of counterfactual explanations reduces to maximizing a non-monotone
submodular function. As a result, we can use a recent randomized algorithm to
solve the problem, which also offers approximation guarantees. Finally, we
demonstrate that, by incorporating a matroid constraint into the problem
formulation, we can increase the diversity of the optimal set of counterfactual
explanations and incentivize individuals across the whole spectrum of the
population to self improve. Experiments on synthetic and real lending and
credit card data illustrate our theoretical findings and show that the
counterfactual explanations and decision policies found by our algorithms
achieve higher utility than several competitive baselines.

surveys are revolutionizing our understanding of the Galaxy. Thanks to these
and the knowledge accumulated thus far, a more mature picture of the evolution
of the early Milky Way is emerging:
  * Two of the traditional Galactic components, i.e. the stellar halo and the
thick disk, appear to be intimately linked: stars with halo-like kinematics
originate in similar proportions, from a ""heated"" (thick) disk and from debris
from a system named Gaia-Enceladus. Gaia-Enceladus was the last big merger
event experienced by the Milky Way and probably completed around 10 Gyr ago.
The puffed-up stars now present in the halo as a consequence of the merger have
thus exposed the existence of a disk component at z ~ 1.8.
  * The Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos are amongst the newly uncovered or
better characterized merger events. Knowledge of their progenitor's properties,
star formation and chemical histories is still incomplete.
  * Debris' from different objects often overlap in phase-space. A task for the
next years will be to use spectroscopic surveys for chemical labelling and to
disentangle events from one another using dimensions other than only
phase-space, metallicity or [alpha/Fe].
  * These surveys will also provide line-of-sight velocities missing for faint
stars and more accurate distance determinations for distant objects. The
resulting samples of stars will cover a much wider volume of the Galaxy
allowing, for example, linking kinematic substructures in the inner halo to
spatial overdensities in the outer halo.
  * All the results obtained so far are in-line with expectations of current
cosmological models. Yet, tailored hydrodynamical simulations as well as
""constrained"" cosmological simulations are needed to push our knowledge of the
assembly of the Milky Way back to the earliest times. [abridged]

likelihood (ML) estimation of possibly non-invertible structural vector
autoregressive moving average (SVARMA) models driven by independent and
non-Gaussian shocks. In contrast to previous literature, the novel
representation of the MA polynomial matrix using the Wiener-Hopf factorisation
(WHF) focuses on the multivariate nature of the model, generates insights into
its structure, and uses this structure for devising optimisation algorithms. In
particular, it allows to parameterise the location of determinantal zeros
inside and outside the unit circle, and it allows for MA zeros at zero, which
can be interpreted as informational delays. This is highly relevant for
data-driven evaluation of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.
Typically imposed identifying restrictions on the shock transmission matrix as
well as on the determinantal root location are made testable. Furthermore, we
provide low level conditions for asymptotic normality of the ML estimator and
analytic expressions for the score and the information matrix. As application,
we estimate the Blanchard and Quah model and show that our method provides
further insights regarding non-invertibility using a standard macroeconometric
model. These and further analyses are implemented in a well documented

far, the focus of multi-messenger astronomy has been the search for
conventional signals from known fundamental forces and standard model
particles, like gravitational waves (GW). In addition to these known effects,
quantum sensor networks could be used to search for astrophysical signals
predicted by beyond-standard-model (BSM) theories. Exotic bosonic fields are
ubiquitous features of BSM theories and appear while seeking to understand the
nature of dark matter and dark energy and solve the hierarchy and strong CP
problems. We consider the case where high-energy astrophysical events could
produce intense bursts of exotic low-mass fields (ELFs). We propose to expand
the toolbox of multi-messenger astronomy to include networks of precision
quantum sensors that by design are shielded from or insensitive to conventional
standard-model physics signals. We estimate ELF signal amplitudes, delays,
rates, and distances of GW sources to which global networks of atomic
magnetometers and atomic clocks could be sensitive. We find that, indeed, such
precision quantum sensor networks can function as ELF telescopes to detect
signals from sources generating ELF bursts of sufficient intensity. Thus ELFs,
if they exist, could act as additional messengers for astrophysical events.

reach stable equilibria. When this ratio is larger than one, fixed-points are
either unstable or marginally stable, as expected by the competitive exclusion
principle. If they are unstable, the system is repelled from fixed points, and
abundances forever fluctuate. While marginally-stable fixed points are in

paper, we analyse the geometry of adversarial attacks in the large-data,
overparametrized limit for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We show that, in
the limit, vulnerability to gradient-based attacks arises as a result of
degeneracy in the data distribution, i.e., when the data lies on a
lower-dimensional submanifold of the ambient space. As a direct consequence, we
demonstrate that in the limit BNN posteriors are robust to gradient-based
adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST
datasets with BNNs trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational
Inference support this line of argument, showing that BNNs can display both
high accuracy and robustness to gradient based adversarial attacks.

equations to study the interaction between finite-size particles and near-wall
coherent structures. We consider horizontal plane Couette flow and focus on
Nagata's upper-branch equilibrium solution (Nagata, 1990) at low Reynolds
numbers where this solution is linearly stable. When adding a single heavy
particle with a diameter equivalent to 2.5 wall units, we observe that the
solution remains stable and is essentially unchanged away from the particle.
This result demonstrates that it is technically feasible to utilize exact
coherent structures in conjunction with particle-resolved DNS. While
translating in the streamwise direction, the particle migrates laterally under
the action of the quasi-streamwise vortices until it reaches the region
occupied by the low-speed streak, where it attains a periodic state of motion.
As a result of the ensuing preferential particle location, the time-average
streamwise particle velocity differs from the plane-average fluid-phase
velocity at the same wall-distance as the particle center, as previously
observed in experiments and in numerical data for fully turbulent wall-bounded
flows. Additional constrained simulations where the particle is maintained at a
fixed spanwise position while freely translating in the other two directions
reveal the existence of two equilibria located in the low-speed and in the
high-speed streak, respectively, the former being an unstable point. A
parametric study with different particle to fluid density ratios is conducted
which shows how inertia affects the spanwise fluctuations of the periodic
particle motion. Finally, we discuss a number of potential future
investigations of solid particle dynamics which can be conducted with the aid
of invariant solutions (exact coherent structures) of the Navier-Stokes
equations.

modelling of spatial extremes, with comparatively little consideration of
spatio-temporal extensions. This neglects an important feature of extreme
events: their evolution over time. Many existing models for the spatial case
are limited by the number of locations they can handle; this impedes extension
to space-time settings, where models for higher dimensions are required.
Moreover, the spatio-temporal models that do exist are restrictive in terms of
the range of extremal dependence types they can capture. Recently, conditional
approaches for studying multivariate and spatial extremes have been proposed,
which enjoy benefits in terms of computational efficiency and an ability to
capture both asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence. We extend this
class of models to a spatio-temporal setting, conditioning on the occurrence of
an extreme value at a single space-time location. We adopt a composite
likelihood approach for inference, which combines information from full
likelihoods across multiple space-time conditioning locations. We apply our
model to Red Sea surface temperatures, show that it fits well using a range of
diagnostic plots, and demonstrate how it can be used to assess the risk of
coral bleaching attributed to high water temperatures over consecutive days.

sampling from high dimensional target densities that are log-Lipschitz-smooth
and (strongly) log-concave. In particular, the Euclidean Langevin Monte Carlo
sampling algorithm has received much attention lately, leading to a detailed
understanding of its non-asymptotic convergence properties and of the role that
smoothness and log-concavity play in the convergence rate. Distributions that
do not possess these regularity properties can be addressed by considering a
Riemannian Langevin diffusion with a metric capturing the local geometry of the
log-density. However, the Monte Carlo algorithms derived from discretizations
of such Riemannian Langevin diffusions are notoriously difficult to analyze. In
this paper, we consider Langevin diffusions on a Hessian-type manifold and
study a discretization that is closely related to the mirror-descent scheme. We
establish for the first time a non-asymptotic upper-bound on the sampling error
of the resulting Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm. This bound
is measured according to a Wasserstein distance induced by a Riemannian metric
ground cost capturing the Hessian structure and closely related to a
self-concordance-like condition. The upper-bound implies, for instance, that
the iterates contract toward a Wasserstein ball around the target density whose
radius is made explicit. Our theory recovers existing Euclidean results and can
cope with a wide variety of Hessian metrics related to highly non-flat
geometries.

in understanding the electronic properties of topical metals and semi-metals,

we present a systematic high-field quantum oscillation study up to 35 T on
ZrSiS, a textbook example of a nodal-line semimetal with only linearly
dispersive bands crossing the Fermi energy. The topology of the Fermi surface
is determined with unprecedented precision and all pockets are identified by
comparing the measured angle dependence of the quantum oscillations to density
functional theory calculations. Comparison of the Shubnikov-de Haas and de
Haas-van Alphen oscillations at low temperatures and analysis of the respective
Dingle plots reveal the presence of significantly enhanced scattering on the
electron pocket. Above a threshold field that is aligned along the c-axis of
the crystal, the specific cage-like Fermi surface of ZrSiS allows for
electron-hole tunneling to occur across finite gaps in momentum space leading
to quantum oscillations with a complex frequency spectrum. Additional
high-frequency quantum oscillations signify magnetic breakdown orbits that
encircle the entire Dirac nodal loop. We suggest that the persistence of
quantum oscillations in the resistivity to high temperatures is caused by Stark
interference between orbits of nearly equal masses.

problems in computer vision, such as edge detection which finds the boundaries
of an image and salient object detection which finds the important object in an
image. This progress happened thanks to the rise of deep-learning and
convolutional neural networks (CNN) which allow to extract complex and abstract
features. However, edge detection and saliency are still two different fields
and do not interact together, although it is intuitive for a human to detect
salient objects based on its boundaries. Those features are not well merged in
a CNN because edges and surfaces do not intersect since one feature represents
a region while the other represents boundaries between different regions. In
the current work, the main objective is to develop a method to merge the edges
with the saliency maps to improve the performance of the saliency. Hence, we
developed the gradient-domain merging (GDM) which can be used to quickly
combine the image-domain information of salient object detection with the
gradient-domain information of the edge detection. This leads to our proposed
saliency enhancement using edges (SEE) with an average improvement of the
F-measure of at least 3.4 times higher on the DUT-OMRON dataset and 6.6 times
higher on the ECSSD dataset, when compared to competing algorithm such as
denseCRF and BGOF. The SEE algorithm is split into 2 parts, SEE-Pre for
preprocessing and SEE-Post pour postprocessing.

the structure and the electron and phonon transport properties of large

large enough flower densities, we find that electron transport is strongly
suppressed while, surprisingly, hole transport remains almost unaffected. These
results suggest possible applications of flowered graphene for electron energy
filtering. For the same defect densities, phonon transport is reduced by orders
of magnitude as elastic scattering by defects becomes dominant. Heat transport
by flexural phonons, key in graphene, is largely suppressed even for very low

statistics approach, we show that Andreev reflection can happen in two separate
channels that can be associated with the two spin states of the tunneling
electrons. In a low-energy model for the nanowire that is represented by two
overlapping Majorana bound states (MBSs) localized at the ends of the wire,
analytical formulas for conductance and noise reveal their crucial dependence
on the spin-canting angle difference of the two MBSs in the absence of the QD
if the spinful lead couples to both MBSs. We further investigate the influence
of a finite temperature on the observation of the coupling to both MBSs. In the
presence of the QD, the interference of different tunneling paths gives rise to
Fano resonances and the symmetry of those provide decisive information about
the coupling to both MBSs. We contrast the low-energy model with a
tight-binding model of the Majorana nanowire and treat the Coulomb interaction
on the QD with a self-consistent mean field approach. Using the scattering
matrix approach, we thereby extend the transport results obtained in the
low-energy model including also higher excited states in the nanowire.

therefore aim for a statistical determination of CMEs of solar-like stars by
using spectroscopic data from the ESO phase 3 and Polarbase archives. To
identify stellar CMEs we use the Doppler signal in optical spectral lines being
a signature of erupting filaments which are closely correlated to CMEs. We
investigate more than 3700 hours of on-source time of in total 425 dF-dK stars.
We find no signatures of CMEs and only few flares. To explain this low level of
activity we derive upper limits for the non detections of CMEs and compare
those with empirically modelled CME rates. To explain the low number of
detected flares we adapt a flare power law derived from EUV data to the
H{\alpha} regime, yielding more realistic results for H{\alpha} observations.
In addition we examine the detectability of flares from the stars by extracting
Sun-as-a-star H{\alpha} light curves. The extrapolated maximum numbers of
observable CMEs are below the observationally determined upper limits, which
indicates that the on-source times were mostly too short to detect stellar CMEs
in H{\alpha}. We conclude that these non detections are related to
observational biases in conjunction with a low level of activity of the
investigated dF-dK stars.

transport coefficients of HRG matter in the presence of a magnetic field were
studied previously by Dash et al. [Phys. Rev. D 102, 016016 (2020)] using the
standard relaxation time approximation in the Boltzmann equation. In the same
reference, the transition from isotropic transport coefficients to anisotropic
coefficients in the presence of a magnetic field was also estimated for
massless and HRG matter. This led to an upper limit or Stefan-Boltzmann (SB)
type limit to the nonperturbative domain transition of transport coefficients.
In a similar context, the present work has concentrated on the classical to
quantum transition of HRG transport from the domain of high temperature and low
magnetic field to that of low temperature and high magnetic field. We have also
compared the quantum modification of HRG results with that of massless quark
matter, where we observed an opposite trend. A similar kind of quantum effect
is also noticed between mesons and baryons due to their different particle
distribution functions. Despite the fact that HRG contains both mesons and
baryons, Landau quantization of its net magnetothermodynamic phase space
reveals meson- or boson-dominated quantum modification. That is why the quantum
modification of HRG results reveals the opposite trend from that of massless
quark matter, which faces fermionic quantum modification.

streams to detect patterns. Over time, the input event rate might fluctuate and
overshoot the system's capabilities. One way to reduce the overload on the
system is to use load shedding. In this paper, we propose a load shedding
strategy for CEP systems which drops a portion of the CEP operator's internal
state (a.k.a. partial matches) to maintain a given latency bound. The crucial
question here is how many and which partial matches to drop so that a given
latency bound is maintained while minimizing the degradation in the quality of
results. In the stream processing domain, different load shedding strategies
have been proposed that mainly depend on the importance of individual tuples.
However, as CEP systems perform pattern detection, the importance of events is
also influenced by other events in the stream. Our load shedding strategy uses
Markov chain and Markov reward process to predict the utility/importance of
partial matches to determine the ones to be dropped. In addition, we represent
the utility in a way that minimizes the overhead of load shedding. Furthermore,
we provide algorithms to decide when to start dropping partial matches and how
many partial matches to drop. By extensively evaluating our approach on three
real-world datasets and several representative queries, we show that the
adverse impact of our load shedding strategy on the quality of results is
considerably less than the impact of state-of-the-art load shedding strategies.

The source transmits the $n$ coded packets to its one-hop neighbours. Every
other node in the network follows a probabilistic forwarding protocol, in which
it forwards a previously unreceived packet to all its neighbours with a certain
probability $p$. We say that the information from the source undergoes a
``near-broadcast'' if the expected fraction of nodes that receive at least $k$

chosen so as to minimize the expected total number of transmissions needed for

results in an image, which opens a way to apply existing image processing
techniques on point cloud attributes. However, as this mapping process is lossy

mapped to the 2D grid with minimal distortion. Moreover, this approach can be
flexibly applied to point cloud patches in order to better adapt to local
geometric complexity. In this work, we consider point cloud attribute

computed efficiently using sparse raycasting. These optimisations along with

galaxy III Zw 2 using multi-epoch XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Suzaku observations.
The X-ray spectra exhibit a soft-excess below 1 keV and a prominent excess at
the location of the broad Fe K{\alpha} line at 6.4 keV. To account for these
spectral features, we have fitted the spectra with multiple models including an
ionized partially covering absorber and an accretion disk reflection model. To
fully resolve the reflection component, we analyzed jointly the XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR observations taken in 2017 and archival XMM-Newton data from 2000.
Assuming the reflection scenario, the resulting model fits support a rapidly
spinning black hole (a > 0.98) in this radio-intermediate source. The X-ray
spectra in 2000 and 2017 are remarkably similar with the only difference in the
reflection fraction, possibly due to a change in the geometry of the accretion
flow. However, the Suzaku observation is markedly different, and we suggest
this could be an effect of a jet contribution in the X-ray band, which is
supported by the elevated radio flux during this observation.

failure. Void nucleation, growth and coalescence is the mechanism of failure in
such metals. {\alpha}/{\beta} titanium alloys are ductile in nature and are
widely used for their unique set of properties like specific strength, fracture
toughness, corrosion resistance and resistance to fatigue failures. Voids in
these alloys were reported to nucleate on the phase boundaries between {\alpha}
and {\beta} phase. Based on the findings of crystal plasticity finite element
method (CPFEM) based investigation of the void growth at the interface of
{\alpha} and {\beta} phases [1], [2], a void nucleation, growth, and
coalescence model has been formulated. An existing single-phase crystal
plasticity theory is extended to incorporate underlying physical mechanisms of
deformation and failure in dual phase titanium alloys. Effects of various
factors (stress triaxiality, Lode parameter, deformation state (equivalent
strain), and phase boundary inclination) on void nucleation, growth and
coalescence are used to formulate the constitutive model while their
interaction with a conventional crystal plasticity theory is established. An
extensive parametric assessment of the model is carried out to quantify and
understand the effects of the material parameters on the overall material
response. Performance of the proposed model is then assessed and verified by
comparing the results of the proposed model with the RVE study results.
Application of the constitutive model for utilisation in the design and
optimisation of the forming process of {\alpha}/{\beta} titanium alloy
components is also demonstrated using experimental data.

crossings between the rings can slow down the translocation and are responsible
for a delay as the crossings pass through the pore. The results fall on a set
of relatively smooth curves for different link families with the translocation
time not always increasing with crossings number within the same family. When

parameter functions. In this paper, in order to obtain non-negative stable
approximate solutions to ill-posed linear operator equations in a Hilbert space
setting, we develop two novel non-negativity preserving iterative
regularization methods. They are based on fixed point iterations in combination
with preconditioning ideas. In contrast to the projected Landweber iteration,
for which only weak convergence can be shown for the regularized solution when
the noise level tends to zero, the introduced regularization methods exhibit
strong convergence. There are presented convergence results, even for a
combination of noisy right-hand side and imperfect forward operators, and for
one of the approaches there are also convergence rates results. Specifically
adapted discrepancy principles are used as a posteriori stopping rules of the
established iterative regularization algorithms. For an application of the
suggested new approaches, we consider a biosensor problem, which is modelled as
a two dimensional linear Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. Several
numerical examples, as well as a comparison with the projected Landweber
method, are presented to show the accuracy and the acceleration effect of the
novel methods. Case studies of a real data problem indicate that the developed
methods can produce meaningful featured regularized solutions.

from the rest of the systems involved. Up to now, this effect has predominantly
been analyzed in the case where the carrier-system interactions take the form

effect of incoherent dynamics acting alongside imperfect unitary interactions.
In particular, we determine the restrictions that need to be placed on the
interaction time, as well as the strength of the incoherent dynamics. We find
that with non-unitary errors, we can still successfully distribute
entanglement, provided we measure the carrier in a suitable basis. Introducing
imperfections in the unitary dynamics, we show that entanglement gain is
possible even with substantial unitary errors. Moreover, certain variations in
the strength of the unitary dynamics can allow for greater robustness against
non-unitary errors. Therefore, even in experimental settings where unitary
operations cannot be carried out without imperfections, it is still possible to
generate entanglement between two systems using a separable carrier.

case avoiding their formation can be challenging. This occurs e.g. with
dislocations, Stone-Wales defects, or atomic vacancies in graphene. Here we
address a defect that has been observed repeatedly since 2007 in epitaxial
graphene on metal surfaces like Ru(0001) and Re(0001), but whose nature has
remained elusive thus far. This defect has the appearance of a vacant hill in
the periodically nanorippled topography of graphene, which comes together with
a moir{\'e} pattern. Based on atomistic simulations and scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we argue that such defects are
topological in nature and that their core is a stacking fault patch, either in
graphene, surrounded by loops of non-hexagonal carbon rings, or in the
underlying metal. We discuss the possible origin of these defects in relation
with recent reports of metastable polycyclic carbon molecules forming upon
graphene growth. Like other defects, the vacant hills may be considered as
deleterious in the perspective of producing high quality graphene. However,
provided they can be organized in graphene, they might allow novel optical,

in order to optimize the data rate/energy consumption tradeoff. In modern
systems, the possibly large number of transmit/receive antennas and subcarriers
makes this task difficult. Designing pilot sequences of reasonable size
yielding good performance is thus critical. Classically, the number of pilots
is reduced by viewing the channel as a random vector and assuming knowledge of
its distribution. In practice, this requires estimating the channel covariance
matrix, which can be computationally costly and not adapted to scenarios with
high mobility. In this paper, an alternative view is considered, in which the
channel is a function of unknown deterministic parameters. In this setting, the
problem of designing optimal pilot sequences of smallest possible size is
studied for any parametric channel model. To do so, the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound
(CRB) for this general channel estimation problem is given, highlighting its
key dependency on the introduced variation space. Then, the minimal size of
pilot sequences and minimal value of the CRB are determined. Moreover, a
general strategy to build optimal minimal length power constrained pilots
sequences is given, based on an estimation of the variation space. The
theoretical results are finally illustrated in a massive MIMO system context.
They conveniently allow to retrieve well known previous results, but also to
exhibit minimal length optimal pilot sequences for a new strategy based on a

with gradient-based methods are observed to perform well in many supervised
classification tasks. Towards understanding this phenomenon, we analyze the
training and generalization behavior of infinitely wide two-layer neural
networks with homogeneous activations. We show that the limits of the gradient
flow on exponentially tailed losses can be fully characterized as a max-margin
classifier in a certain non-Hilbertian space of functions. In presence of
hidden low-dimensional structures, the resulting margin is independent of the
ambiant dimension, which leads to strong generalization bounds. In contrast,
training only the output layer implicitly solves a kernel support vector
machine, which a priori does not enjoy such an adaptivity. Our analysis of
training is non-quantitative in terms of running time but we prove
computational guarantees in simplified settings by showing equivalences with
online mirror descent. Finally, numerical experiments suggest that our analysis
describes well the practical behavior of two-layer neural networks with ReLU
activation and confirm the statistical benefits of this implicit bias.

this end, we propose a simple, yet robust solution for learning to segment
unknown objects grasped by a robot. Specifically, we exploit motion and
temporal cues in RGB video sequences. Using optical flow estimation we first
learn to predict segmentation masks of our given manipulator. Then, these
annotations are used in combination with motion cues to automatically
distinguish between background, manipulator and unknown, grasped object. In
contrast to existing systems our approach is fully self-supervised and
independent of precise camera calibration, 3D models or potentially imperfect
depth data. We perform a thorough comparison with alternative baselines and

training data for segmentation networks that generalize to novel environments

the equipartition principle. It states that the degrees of freedom of a

heat flow, which creates a highly non-uniform local temperature. We measure
independently the temperature profile of the object and the temperature yielded
from the mechanical thermometers, thus testing the validity of the
equipartition principle out of equilibrium. We demonstrate how the fluctuations
of the most energetic degrees of freedom are equivalent to the temperature at
the base of the cantilever, even when the average temperature is several

out a complete Z-track in the hardness intensity diagram (HID). The spectra at

of a thermal Comptonization component, a power-law and a relativistic iron line

both phenomenological models suggests that the power-law component is strong in
the horizontal branch (HB), becomes weaker as the source moves down the normal

branch (FB). However, we find that the strength of the power-law component is
model dependent, although the trend in the variation of the power-law strength
along the Z-track is similar. A simple model composed by a Comptonized emission

detection of pancreatic tumors using contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT)
is widely applied for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer.
Traditional hand-crafted methods only extract low-level features. Normal
convolutional neural networks, however, fail to make full use of effective
context information, which causes inferior detection results. In this paper, a
novel and efficient pancreatic tumor detection framework aiming at fully
exploiting the context information at multiple scales is designed. More
specifically, the contribution of the proposed method mainly consists of three
components: Augmented Feature Pyramid networks, Self-adaptive Feature Fusion
and a Dependencies Computation (DC) Module. A bottom-up path augmentation to
fully extract and propagate low-level accurate localization information is
established firstly. Then, the Self-adaptive Feature Fusion can encode much
richer context information at multiple scales based on the proposed regions.
Finally, the DC Module is specifically designed to capture the interaction
information between proposals and surrounding tissues. Experimental results
achieve competitive performance in detection with the AUC of 0.9455, which
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods to our best of knowledge,
demonstrating the proposed framework can detect the tumor of pancreatic cancer

been used as surrogate models for mapping inputs of an engineering system to
outputs of interest. Once trained, neural networks are computationally
inexpensive to evaluate and remove the need for repeated evaluations of
computationally expensive models in uncertainty quantification applications.
However, given the highly parameterized construction of neural networks,
especially deep neural networks, accurate training often requires large amounts
of simulation data that may not be available in the case of computationally
expensive systems. In this paper, to alleviate this issue for uncertainty
propagation, we explore the application of transfer learning techniques using
training data generated from both high- and low-fidelity models. We explore two
strategies for coupling these two datasets during the training procedure,
namely, the standard transfer learning and the bi-fidelity weighted learning.
In the former approach, a neural network model mapping the inputs to the
outputs of interest is trained based on the low-fidelity data. The
high-fidelity data is then used to adapt the parameters of the upper layer(s)
of the low-fidelity network, or train a simpler neural network to map the
output of the low-fidelity network to that of the high-fidelity model. In the
latter approach, the entire low-fidelity network parameters are updated using
data generated via a Gaussian process model trained with a small high-fidelity
dataset. The parameter updates are performed via a variant of stochastic
gradient descent with learning rates given by the Gaussian process model. Using
three numerical examples, we illustrate the utility of these bi-fidelity
transfer learning methods where we focus on accuracy improvement achieved by
transfer learning over standard training approaches.

non-linear way during the hearing process in ear and brain. We study this by
comparing the frequency spectrum of an input stimulus and its response spectrum
in the auditory processing stream using the frequency following response (FFR).
  Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigate whether the periodicity
pitches of complex harmonies (which are related to their missing fundamentals)
are added in the auditory brainstem by analyzing the FFR. While other
experiments focus on common musical harmonies like the major and the minor
triad and dyads, we also consider the suspended chord. The suspended chord
causes tension foreign to the common triads and therefore holds a special role
among the triads.
  While watching a muted nature documentary, the participants hear synthesized
classic piano triads and single tones with a duration of 300ms for the stimulus
and 100ms interstimulus interval. We acquired EEG data of 64 electrodes with a

  Applying a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) on the EEG response, starting
50ms after stimulus onset, the evaluation of the frequency spectra shows that
the periodicity pitch frequencies calculated beforehand +/-3Hz occur with some

generalize successful deep neural architectures to non-Euclidean structured

applications ranging from social science, biomedicine, and particle physics to
computer vision, graphics, and chemistry. One of the limitations of the
majority of current graph neural network architectures is that they are often
restricted to the transductive setting and rely on the assumption that the
underlying graph is {\em known} and {\em fixed}. Often, this assumption is not
true since the graph may be noisy, or partially and even completely unknown. In
such cases, it would be helpful to infer the graph directly from the data,
especially in inductive settings where some nodes were not present in the graph

the inferred structure may provide complementary insights next to the
downstream task. In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Graph Module (DGM),
a learnable function that predicts edge probabilities in the graph which are
optimal for the downstream task. DGM can be combined with convolutional graph
neural network layers and trained in an end-to-end fashion. We provide an
extensive evaluation of applications from the domains of healthcare (disease

can provide images of different contrasts (i.e., modalities). Fusing this
multi-modal data has proven particularly effective for boosting model
performance in many tasks. However, due to poor data quality and frequent
patient dropout, collecting all modalities for every patient remains a
challenge. Medical image synthesis has been proposed as an effective solution
to this, where any missing modalities are synthesized from the existing ones.
In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid-fusion Network (Hi-Net) for
multi-modal MR image synthesis, which learns a mapping from multi-modal source
images (i.e., existing modalities) to target images (i.e., missing modalities).
In our Hi-Net, a modality-specific network is utilized to learn representations
for each individual modality, and a fusion network is employed to learn the
common latent representation of multi-modal data. Then, a multi-modal synthesis
network is designed to densely combine the latent representation with
hierarchical features from each modality, acting as a generator to synthesize
the target images. Moreover, a layer-wise multi-modal fusion strategy is
presented to effectively exploit the correlations among multiple modalities, in
which a Mixed Fusion Block (MFB) is proposed to adaptively weight different
fusion strategies (i.e., element-wise summation, product, and maximization).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other

provide the energy required for sampling a motion sensor. Batteries, however,
have limited capacity and, once depleted, have to be replaced or recharged.
Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH) allows to convert ambient motion and vibration
into usable electricity and can enable batteryless, maintenance free operation
of motion sensors. The signal from a KEH transducer correlates with the
underlying motion and may thus directly be used for context detection, saving
space, cost and energy by omitting the accelerometer. Previous work uses the
open circuit or the capacitor voltage for sensing without using the harvested
energy to power a load. In this paper, we propose to use other sensing points
in the KEH circuit that offer information rich sensing signals while the energy
from the harvester is used to power a load. We systematically analyse multiple
sensing signals available in different KEH architectures and compare their
performance in a transport mode detection case study. To this end, we develop
four hardware prototypes, conduct an extensive measurement campaign and use the
data to train and evaluate different classifiers. We show that sensing the
harvesting current signal from a transducer can be energy positive, delivering
up to ten times as much power as it consumes for signal acquisition, while
offering comparable detection accuracy to the accelerometer signal for most of

equations. The presented method is based on the Theory of Functional
Connections, and is solved in two steps. First, the Theory of Functional
Connections analytically embeds the differential equation constraints into a
candidate function (called a $constrained \, expression$) that contains a
function that the user is free to choose. This expression always satisfies the
constraints, no matter what the free function is. Second, the free-function is
expanded as a linear combination of orthogonal basis functions with unknown
coefficients. The constrained expression (and its derivatives) are then
substituted into the eighth-order differential equation, transforming the
problem into an unconstrained optimization problem where the coefficients in
the linear combination of orthogonal basis functions are the optimization
parameters. These parameters are then found by linear/nonlinear least-squares.
The solution obtained from this method is a highly accurate analytical
approximation of the true solution. Comparisons with alternative methods

  The aliphatic component of the carbonaceous dust is of particular interest
because it produces a significant 3.4 $\mu$m absorption feature when viewed
against a background radiation source. The optical depth of the 3.4 $\mu$m
absorption feature is related to the number of aliphatic carbon C-H bonds along
the line of sight. It is possible to estimate the column density of carbon
locked up in the aliphatic hydrocarbon component of interstellar dust from
quantitative analysis of the 3.4 $\mu$m interstellar absorption feature
providing that the absorption coefficient of aliphatic hydrocarbons
incorporated in the interstellar dust is known.
  We generated laboratory analogues of interstellar dust by experimentally
mimicking interstellar/circumstellar conditions. The resultant spectra of these

measurements of the absorption coefficient of aliphatic hydrocarbons

strong focus on the behavior of individual tech artifacts. This discussion
argues for a more structured systems-level approach for assessing

propose a novel language dynamics model of interaction between Monolingual
Hindi speakers and Hindi/English Bilinguals, which captures the Indian census

like Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, on Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian is presented.
Here the role of Cooper pairs belongs to TI bipolarons which are pairs of
spatially delocalized electrons whose correlation length of a coupled state is
small. The presence of Fermi surface leads to stabilization of such states in
its vicinity and a possibility of their Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The
theory provides a natural explanation of the existence of a pseudogap phase
preceding the superconductivity and enables one to estimate the temperature of
a transition $T^*$ from a normal state to a pseudogap one. It is shown that the
temperature of BEC of TI bipolarons determines the temperature of a
superconducting transition $T_c$ which depends not on the bipolaron effective
mass but on the ordinary mass of a band electron. This removes restrictions on
the upper limit of $T_c$ for a strong electron-phonon interaction. A natural
explanation is provided for the angular dependence of the superconducting gap
which is determined by the angular dependence of the phonon spectrum. It is
demonstrated that a lot of experiments on thermodynamic and transport
characteristics, Josephson tunneling and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) of high-temperature superconductors does not contradict
the concept of a TI bipolaron mechanism of superconductivity in these

implemented as the fitness for the SSO to estimate the accuracy. To evaluate
the performance of the proposed CSVM, experiments were conducted to test five

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, a single composite application
instance can host multiple tenants, yielding the benefits of better service and
resource utilization, and reduced operational cost for the SaaS provider. An
SIMT application needs to share services and their aggregation (the
application) among its tenants while supporting variations in the functional
and performance requirements of the tenants. The SaaS provider requires a
middleware environment that can deploy, enact and manage a designed SIMT
application, to achieve the varied requirements of the different tenants in a
controlled manner. This paper presents the SDSN@RT (Software-Defined Service
Networks @ RunTime) middleware environment that can meet the aforementioned
requirements. SDSN@RT represents an SIMT composite cloud application as a
multi-tenant service network, where the same service network simultaneously
hosts a set of virtual service networks (VSNs), one for each tenant. A service
network connects a set of services, and coordinates the interactions between
them. A VSN realizes the requirements for a specific tenant and can be
deployed, configured, and logically isolated in the service network at runtime.
SDSN@RT also supports the monitoring and runtime changes of the deployed
multi-tenant service networks. We show the feasibility of SDSN@RT with a
prototype implementation, and demonstrate its capabilities to host SIMT
applications and support their changes with a case study. The performance study
of the prototype implementation shows that the runtime capabilities of our
middleware incur little overhead.

structure of the first-order equivalent material. The validity of the proposed
technique has been confirmed by the very good matching obtained between
dispersion curves of the homogenized medium and the lowest frequency ones
relative to the heterogeneous material. These lasts are computed from the
resolution of a quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem over the periodic cell
subjected to Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions. An illustrative benchmark is
conducted referring to a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)-like material, whose
microstructure can be modeled through the spatial tessellation of the domain
with a periodic cell subjected to thermo-diffusive phenomena.

of the input can lead Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to wrongly classify its
label, there has been an ongoing research to make DNNs more robust to such
malicious perturbations. In this work, we consider a poisoning attack called
Clean Labeling poisoning attack (CLPA). The goal of CLPA is to inject seemingly
benign instances which can drastically change decision boundary of the DNNs due
to which subsequent queries at test time can be mis-classified. We argue that a
strong defense against CLPA can be embedded into the model during the training
by imposing features of the network to follow a Large Margin Gaussian Mixture
distribution in the penultimate layer. By having such a prior knowledge, we can
systematically evaluate how unusual the example is, given the label it is
claiming to be. We demonstrate our builtin defense via experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR datasets. We train two models on each dataset: one trained via softmax,
another via LGM. We show that using LGM can substantially reduce the
effectiveness of CLPA while having no additional overhead of data sanitization.
The code to reproduce our results is available online.

Such attacks usually happen in public places with large crowds to cause the
most damage possible and get the most attention. Even though surveillance
cameras are assumed to be a powerful tool, their effect in preventing crime is
far from clear due to either limitation in the ability of humans to vigilantly
monitor video surveillance or for the simple reason that they are operating
passively. In this paper, we present a weapon detection system based on an
ensemble of semantic Convolutional Neural Networks that decomposes the problem
of detecting and locating a weapon into a set of smaller problems concerned
with the individual component parts of a weapon. This approach has
computational and practical advantages: a set of simpler neural networks
dedicated to specific tasks requires less computational resources and can be
trained in parallel; the overall output of the system given by the aggregation
of the outputs of individual networks can be tuned by a user to trade-off false
positives and false negatives; finally, according to ensemble theory, the
output of the overall system will be robust and reliable even in the presence
of weak individual models. We evaluated our system running simulations aimed at
assessing the accuracy of individual networks and the whole system. The results
on synthetic data and real-world data are promising, and they suggest that our
approach may have advantages compared to the monolithic approach based on a
single deep convolutional neural network.

the words in the input and output sequences. While this is quite useful for
machine translation where the correlation among the words is indeed quite
strong, it becomes problematic for conversation modelling where the correlation
is often at a much abstract level. In contrast, humans tend to focus on the
essential concepts discussed in the conversation context and generate responses
accordingly. In this paper, we attempt to mimic this response generating
mechanism by learning the essential concepts in the context and response in an
unsupervised manner. The proposed model, referred to as Mask \& Focus maps the
input context to a sequence of concepts which are then used to generate the
response concepts. Together, the context and the response concepts generate the
final response. In order to learn context concepts from the training data
automatically, we \emph{mask} words in the input and observe the effect of
masking on response generation. We train our model to learn those response
concepts that have high mutual information with respect to the context
concepts, thereby guiding the model to \emph{focus} on the context concepts.
Mask \& Focus achieves significant improvement over the existing baselines in
several established metrics for dialogues.
