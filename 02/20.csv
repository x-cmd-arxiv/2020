that we call {\sl semigroup-fication}, which allows to construct a continuous
semigroup $(\phi_t)$ of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc whose time one
map $\phi_1$ is, in a sense, very close to $f$. The semigrup-fication of $f$ is
of the same type as $f$ (elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic of positive step or
parabolic of zero step) and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
set of boundary regular fixed points of $f$ with a given multiplier and the
corresponding set for $\phi_1$. Moreover, in case $f$ (and hence $\phi_1$) has
no interior fixed points, the slope of the orbits converging to the
Denjoy-Wolff point is the same. The construction is based on holomorphic
models, localization techniques and Gromov hyperbolicity. As an application of
this construction, we prove that in the non-elliptic case, the orbits of $f$
converge non-tangentially to the Denjoy-Wolff point if and only if the Koenigs
domain of $f$ is ""almost symmetric"" with respect to vertical lines.

networks. First we provide a neural network generalisation bound based on
Rademacher complexity that uses the distance the weights have moved from their
initial values. This bound has no direct dependence on the number of weights
and compares favourably to other bounds when applied to convolutional networks.
Our bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with
a good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify
the weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this,
we develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the
hypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights,
thus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional
transfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well,
corroborating our theoretical results. It outperforms both state of the art
fine-tuning competitors, and penalty-based alternatives that we show do not
directly constrain the radius of the search space.

addressed by the remote sensing community. Usually, the basis of this task is
formed by (supervised) machine learning models. However, in spite of recent
growth in the availability of satellite observations, accurate training data
remains comparably scarce. On the other hand, numerous global land cover
products exist and can be accessed often free-of-charge. Unfortunately, these
maps are typically of a much lower resolution than modern day satellite
imagery. Besides, they always come with a significant amount of noise, as they
cannot be considered ground truth, but are products of previous
(semi-)automatic prediction tasks. Therefore, this paper seeks to make a case
for the application of weakly supervised learning strategies to get the most
out of available data sources and achieve progress in high-resolution
large-scale land cover mapping. Challenges and opportunities are discussed
based on the SEN12MS dataset, for which also some baseline results are shown.
These baselines indicate that there is still a lot of potential for dedicated
approaches designed to deal with remote sensing-specific forms of weak

over-parameterized network to improve its efficiency. Popular methods vary from
$\ell_1$-norm sparsification to Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work,
we propose a novel pruning method that optimizes the final accuracy of the
pruned network and distills knowledge from the over-parameterized parent
network's inner layers. To enable this approach, we formulate the network
pruning as a Knapsack Problem which optimizes the trade-off between the
importance of neurons and their associated computational cost. Then we prune
the network channels while maintaining the high-level structure of the network.
The pruned network is fine-tuned under the supervision of the parent network
using its inner network knowledge, a technique we refer to as the Inner
Knowledge Distillation. Our method leads to state-of-the-art pruning results on
ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using ResNet backbones. To prune complex
network structures such as convolutions with skip-links and depth-wise
convolutions, we propose a block grouping approach to cope with these

characterize the underlying physics of turbulent convection. For example, it
does not describe the non-Gaussianity in the horizontal flow divergence.
  Aims. Our aim is to statistically characterize the spatial pattern of solar
supergranulation beyond the power spectrum. The next-order statistic is the
bispectrum. It measures correlations of three Fourier components and is related
to the nonlinearities in the underlying physics.
  Methods. We estimated the bispectrum of supergranular horizontal surface
divergence maps that were obtained using local correlation tracking (LCT) and
time-distance helioseismology (TD) from one year of data from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory starting in May
2010.
  Results. We find significantly nonzero and consistent estimates for the
bispectrum. The strongest nonlinearity is present when the three coupling wave
vectors are at the supergranular scale. These are the same wave vectors that
are present in regular hexagons, which were used in analytical studies of solar
convection. At these Fourier components, the bispectrum is positive, consistent
with the positive skewness in the data and with supergranules preferentially
consisting of outflows surrounded by a network of inflows. We use the
bispectrum to generate synthetic divergence maps that are very similar to the
data by a model that consists of a Gaussian term and a weaker quadratic
nonlinear component. Thereby, we estimate the fraction of the variance in the
divergence maps from the nonlinear component to be of the order of 4-6%.
  Conclusions. We propose that bispectral analysis is useful for understanding
solar turbulent convection, for example for comparing observations and
numerical models of supergranular flows. This analysis may also be useful to
generate synthetic flow fields.

that can improve any graph neural network architecture simply by exploiting
correlation structure in the regression residuals. In particular, we model the
joint distribution of residuals on vertices with a parameterized multivariate
Gaussian, and estimate the parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood of
the observed labels. Our framework achieves substantially higher accuracy than
competing baselines, and the learned parameters can be interpreted as the
strength of correlation among connected vertices. Furthermore, we develop
linear time algorithms for low-variance, unbiased model parameter estimates,
allowing us to scale to large networks. We also provide a basic version of our
method that makes stronger assumptions on correlation structure but is painless
to implement, often leading to great practical performance with minimal
overhead.

The tangential component is left arbitrary in contrast with previous works. For

the total mass betwenn two probability distributions, requiring their mass to
be the same. This may be too restrictive in certain applications such as color
or shape matching, since the distributions may have arbitrary masses and/or
that only a fraction of the total mass has to be transported. Several
algorithms have been devised for computing partial Wasserstein metrics that
rely on an entropic regularization, but when it comes with exact solutions,
almost no partial formulation of neither Wasserstein nor Gromov-Wasserstein are
available yet. This precludes from working with distributions that do not lie
in the same metric space or when invariance to rotation or translation is
needed. In this paper, we address the partial Wasserstein and
Gromov-Wasserstein problems and propose exact algorithms to solve them. We
showcase the new formulation in a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning application.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of optimal
transport in this context and we first highlight that partial Wasserstein-based
metrics prove effective in usual PU learning settings. We then demonstrate that
partial Gromov-Wasserstein metrics is efficient in scenario where point clouds
come from different domains or have different features.

towards computer-aided diagnosis to alleviate the workload of doctors in recent
years. Deep learning techniques for natural image captioning are successfully
adapted to generating radiology reports. However, radiology image reporting is
different from the natural image captioning task in two aspects: 1) the
accuracy of positive disease keyword mentions is critical in radiology image
reporting in comparison to the equivalent importance of every single word in a
natural image caption; 2) the evaluation of reporting quality should focus more
on matching the disease keywords and their associated attributes instead of
counting the occurrence of N-gram. Based on these concerns, we propose to
utilize a pre-constructed graph embedding module (modeled with a graph
convolutional neural network) on multiple disease findings to assist the
generation of reports in this work. The incorporation of knowledge graph allows
for dedicated feature learning for each disease finding and the relationship
modeling between them. In addition, we proposed a new evaluation metric for
radiology image reporting with the assistance of the same composed graph.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the methods
integrated with the proposed graph embedding module on a publicly accessible
dataset (IU-RR) of chest radiographs compared with previous approaches using
both the conventional evaluation metrics commonly adopted for image captioning
and our proposed ones.

technique, which is known to be computationally inexpensive once it is trained,
to retrieve the metallicity and age from J-PAS-like narrow band images. The CNN
was trained using mock J-PAS data created from the CALIFA IFU survey and the
age and metallicity at each data point, which are derived using full spectral
fitting to the CALIFA spectra. We demonstrate that our CNN model can
consistently recover age and metallicity from each J-PAS-like spectral energy
distribution. The radial gradients of the age and metallicity for galaxies are
also recovered accurately, irrespective of their morphology. However, it is
demonstrated that the diversity of the dataset used to train the neural
networks has a dramatic effect on the recovery of galactic stellar population
parameters. Hence, future applications of CNNs to constrain stellar populations
will rely on the availability of quality spectroscopic data from samples
covering a wide range of population parameters.

coupling, i.e., photocarriers dressed by the macroscopic motion of charged
lattice, assisted by terahertz (THz) longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, has
been intensely studied yet still debated. This may be key for explaining the
remarkable properties of the perovskite materials, e.g., defect tolerance, long
charge lifetimes and diffusion length. Here we use the intense single-cycle THz
pulse with the peak electric field up to $E_{THz}=$1000\,kV/cm to drive
coherent band-edge oscillations at room temperature in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$. We
reveal the oscillatory behavior dominantly to a specific quantized lattice
vibration mode at $\omega_{\mathrm{LO}}\sim$4 THz, being both dipole and
momentum forbidden. THz-driven coherent dynamics exhibits distinguishing
features: the room temperature coherent oscillations at $\omega_{\mathrm{LO}}$
longer than 1 ps in both single crystals and thin films; the {\em
mode-selective} modulation of different band edge states assisted by
electron-phonon ($e$-$ph$) interaction; {\em dynamic mode splitting} controlled
by temperature due to entropy and anharmonicity of organic cations. Our results
demonstrate intense THz-driven coherent band-edge modulation as a powerful
probe of electron-lattice coupling phenomena and provide compelling

  simple model system of damage accumulation and death",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0233384",,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The risk of dying increases exponentially with age, in humans as well as in
many other species. This increase is often attributed to the ""accumulation of
damage"" known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of
this paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in
which mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation
process is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying
is a function of the accumulated damage, i.e. length of the queue. The model
has four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage
occurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired
at a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency
of the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a
function of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the
mathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential
dependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this
dependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is
modeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped
by the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage
accumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be
useful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in
real data. To examplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted
in the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born
in 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher
threshold to damage. This fits well with the many advances made in public
health during the 20th century.

distribution networks suggests to enable their potentials in better fulfilling
the restoration objective. The objective of the restoration problem is to
resupply the maximum energy of loads considering their priorities using minimum
switching operations. Basically, it is desired to provide a unique
configuration that is valid regarding the load and generation profiles along
the entire restorative period. However, this unique configuration may not
satisfy at the same time: I) the DG start-up requirements at the beginning of
the restoration plan and II) the topological conditions that would allow the DG
to provide later on the most efficient support for the supply of loads.
Therefore, it is proposed in this paper to allow a limited number of
reconfiguration steps according to the DG start-up requirements. In addition,
this paper presents a novel formulation for the reconfiguration problem that
accounts for partial restoration scenarios where the whole unsupplied area
cannot be restored. The decision variables of the proposed multi-step
restoration problem are: I) the line switching actions at each step of the
reconfiguration process, II) the load switching actions during the whole
restorative period and, III) the active/reactive power dispatch of DGs during
the whole restorative period. A relaxed AC power flow formulation is integrated
to the optimization problem in order to ensure the feasibility of the solution
concerning the operational safety constraints. The overall model is formulated
in terms of a mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Two simulation
scenarios are studied in order to illustrate different features of the proposed
strategy and to demonstrate its effectiveness particularly in the case of
large-scale outages in distribution networks.

is ``combed'' by the strong wind from a companion star, either a massive star

companion's wind that is otherwise opaque to induced Compton or Raman
scatterings for repeating FRB emission. The 4 day active window corresponds to
the time when the funnel points toward Earth. The interaction also perturbs the
magnetosphere of the FRB pulsar and may trigger emission of FRBs. We derive the
physical constraints on the comb and the FRB pulsar from the observations and
estimate the event rate of FRBs. In this scenario, a lower limit on the period
of observable FRBs is predicted. We speculate that both the intrinsic factors

is one such fundamental problem in analyzing massive graphs, with the main
algorithmic challenges centering on designing methods which are both scalable

  Given a graph $G=(V, E)$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $T$ triangles, our
first result is an algorithm that outputs a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to
$T$, with asymptotically \emph{optimal round and total space complexity}
provided any $S \geq \max{(\sqrt m, n^2/m)}$ space per machine and assuming
$T=\Omega(\sqrt{m/n})$. Our result gives a quadratic improvement on the bound

counting the number of triangles, whose total space usage is parametrized by

affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning
(30-40%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at
all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful
pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High
levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets,
leading to further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning BERT on a

question, we consider a natural coupling of SLE traces: for different values of
$\kappa$ we use the same Brownian motion. It is very natural to assume that
with probability one, $SLE_\kappa$ depends continuously on $\kappa$. It is
rather easy to show that $SLE$ is continuous in the Carath\'eodory sense, but
showing that $SLE$ traces are continuous in the uniform sense is much harder.
In this note we show that for a given sequence $\kappa_j\to\kappa \in (0,
8/3)$, for almost every Brownian motion $SLE_\kappa$ traces converge locally
uniformly. This result was also recently obtained by Friz, Tran and Yuan using
different methods. In our analysis, we provide a constructive way to study the
$SLE_{\kappa}$ traces for varying parameter $\kappa \in (0, 8/3)$. The argument
is based on a new dynamical view on the approximation of SLE curves by curves
driven by a piecewise square root approximation of the Brownian motion.

Theory. Using this theory, we prove that the solutions of the backward Loewner
Differential Equation driven by $\sqrt{\kappa}B_t$ when started away from the

graphs---a generalization of unit interval graphs where each interval has still
a unit length, but intervals of more than one type (open, closed, semi-closed)
are allowed. This small modification captures a much richer class of graphs. In
particular, mixed unit interval graphs are not claw-free, compared to unit
interval graphs.
  Heggernes, Meister, and Papadopoulos defined a representation of unit
interval graphs called the bubble model which turned out to be useful in
algorithm design. We extend this model to the class of mixed unit interval
graphs and demonstrate the advantages of this generalized model by providing a
subexponential-time algorithm for solving the MaxCut problem on mixed unit
interval graphs. In addition, we derive a polynomial-time algorithm for certain
subclasses of mixed unit interval graphs. We point out a substantial mistake in
the proof of the polynomiality of the MaxCut problem on unit interval graphs by
Boyaci, Ekim, and Shalom (2017). Hence, the time complexity of this problem on
unit interval graphs remains open. We further provide a better algorithmic
upper-bound on the clique-width of mixed unit interval graphs. Clique-width is
one of the most general structural graph parameters, where a large group of
natural problems is still solvable in the tractable time when an efficient
representation is given. Unfortunately, the exact computation of the
clique-width representation is \NP-hard. Therefore, good upper-bounds on
clique-width are highly appreciated, in particular, when such a bound is

systems. Many domains such as communication, citation, procurement, biology,
social media, and transportation can be modeled as a set of entities and their
relationships. Temporal networks are a specialization of general networks where
the temporal evolution of the system is as important to understand as the
structure of the entities and relationships. We present the Independent
Temporal Motif (ITeM) to characterize temporal graphs from different domains.
The ITeMs are edge-disjoint temporal motifs that can be used to model the
structure and the evolution of the graph. For a given temporal graph, we
produce a feature vector of ITeM frequencies and apply this distribution to the
task of measuring the similarity of temporal graphs. We show that ITeM has
higher accuracy than other motif frequency-based approaches. We define various
metrics based on ITeM that reveal salient properties of a temporal network. We
also present importance sampling as a method for efficiently estimating the
ITeM counts. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real temporal
networks.

backdoored neural networks (BadNets) that, repairs a BadNet both pre-deployment
and online in response to backdoored test inputs encountered in the field. In
the pre-deployment stage, NNoculation retrains the BadNet with random
perturbations of clean validation inputs to partially reduce the adversarial
impact of a backdoor. Post-deployment, NNoculation detects and quarantines
backdoored test inputs by recording disagreements between the original and
pre-deployment patched networks. A CycleGAN is then trained to learn
transformations between clean validation and quarantined inputs; i.e., it
learns to add triggers to clean validation images. Backdoored validation images
along with their correct labels are used to further retrain the pre-deployment
patched network, yielding our final defense. Empirical evaluation on a
comprehensive suite of backdoor attacks show that NNoculation outperforms all
state-of-the-art defenses that make restrictive assumptions and only work on
specific backdoor attacks, or fail on adaptive attacks. In contrast,
NNoculation makes minimal assumptions and provides an effective defense, even
under settings where existing defenses are ineffective due to attackers
circumventing their restrictive assumptions.

we consider a method allowing to embed the metric measure spaces in a common
Euclidean space and compute an optimal transport (OT) on the embedded

In addition to this novel proposal that generalizes several recent OT works,
our contributions stand on several theoretical analyses: (i) we characterize
the embedding spaces to define SERW distance for distribution alignment; (ii)
we prove that SERW mimics almost the same properties of GW distance, and we
give a cost relation between GW and SERW. The paper also provides some
numerical illustrations of how SERW behaves on matching problems.

this by helping users add imperceptible pixel-level changes (we call them

recognition models, these ""cloaked"" images produce functional models that
consistently cause normal images of the user to be misidentified. We
experimentally demonstrate that Fawkes provides 95+% protection against user
recognition regardless of how trackers train their models. Even when clean,
uncloaked images are ""leaked"" to the tracker and used for training, Fawkes can
still maintain an 80+% protection success rate. We achieve 100% success in

approaches exploit structure in the problem domain in different ways. Model
learning can make use of the rich transition structure present in sequences of
observations, but this approach is usually not sensitive to the reward
function. In contrast, model-free methods directly leverage the quantity of
interest from the future, but receive a potentially weak scalar signal (an
estimate of the return). We develop an approach for representation learning in
RL that sits in between these two extremes: we propose to learn what to model
in a way that can directly help value prediction. To this end, we determine
which features of the future trajectory provide useful information to predict
the associated return. This provides tractable prediction targets that are
directly relevant for a task, and can thus accelerate learning the value
function. The idea can be understood as reasoning, in hindsight, about which
aspects of the future observations could help past value prediction. We show
how this can help dramatically even in simple policy evaluation settings. We
then test our approach at scale in challenging domains, including on 57 Atari
2600 games.

batches of the dataset. Writing $f_\theta(x) = \big(f^{(n)}_{\theta_n}\circ
f^{(n-1)}_{\theta_{n-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ for the
functional representation of compositional structure of the ANN, the inner
layers outputs $h^{(i)}(x) = \big(f^{(i)}_{\theta_i}\circ
f^{(i-1)}_{\theta_{i-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ define a
hierarchy of feature maps and kernels $k^{(i)}(x,x')=\exp(- \gamma_i
\|h^{(i)}(x)-h^{(i)}(x')\|_2^2)$. When combined with a batch of the dataset
these kernels produce KF losses $e_2^{(i)}$ (the $L^2$ regression error
incurred by using a random half of the batch to predict the other half)
depending on parameters of inner layers $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_i$ (and
$\gamma_i$). The proposed method simply consists in aggregating a subset of
these KF losses with a classical output loss. We test the proposed method on
CNNs and WRNs without alteration of structure nor output classifier and report
reduced test errors, decreased generalization gaps, and increased robustness to
distribution shift without significant increase in computational complexity. We
suspect that these results might be explained by the fact that while
conventional training only employs a linear functional (a generalized moment)
of the empirical distribution defined by the dataset and can be prone to
trapping in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime (under over-parameterizations),
the proposed loss function (defined as a nonlinear functional of the empirical
distribution) effectively trains the underlying kernel defined by the CNN
beyond regressing the data with that kernel.

generalized to Lorentzian spacetimes and implement a sandwich approach to
obtain spatial average properties. The 3+1 topological approach supplies us
with a new equation linking evolution of scalar invariants of the expansion
tensor to the norm of the Weyl tensor. From this we derive general evolution
equations for averaged scalar curvature and kinematical backreaction, and we
discuss related evolution equations on this level of the hierarchy of averaged
equations. We also discuss the relation between topological properties of
cosmological manifolds and dynamical topology change, e.g. as resulting from

some of the tenets of planetary formation. Among the difficult-to-explain
observations, are systems with a giant planet orbiting a very-low mass star,
such as the recently discovered GJ~3512b planetary system, where a Jupiter-like
planet orbits an $M$-star in a tight and eccentric orbit. Systems such as this
one are not predicted by the core accretion theory of planet formation. Here we
suggest a novel mechanism, in which the giant planet is born around a more
typical Sun-like star ($M_{*,1}$), but is subsequently exchanged during a
dynamical interaction with a flyby low-mass star ($M_{*,2}$). We perform
state-of-the-art $N$-body simulations with $M_{*,1}=1M_\odot$ and
$M_{*,2}=0.1M_\odot$ to study the statistical outcomes of this interaction, and
show that exchanges result in high eccentricities for the new orbit around the
low-mass star, while about half of the outcomes result in tighter orbits than
the planet had around its birth star. We numerically compute the cross section
for planet exchange, and show that an upper limit for the probability per
planetary system to have undergone such an event is $\Gamma\sim 4.4(M_{\rm
c}/100M_\odot)^{-2}(a_{\rm p}/{\rm AU}) (\sigma/1\,{\rm km}\,{\rm

the birth star, $\sigma$ the velocity dispersion of the star cluster, and

could be relatively common for stars born in open clusters and groups, should
already be observed in the exoplanet database, and provide new avenues to

strong Spitzer IRS detections of PAH emission. All six galaxies are detected in
dust continuum and marginally resolved. We compare the properties of PAH and [C

due to redshift uncertainties and narrow ALMA bandpass windows. Our results are
consistent with the deficit in [C II]/LIR and PAH/LIR observed in the
literature. However, the ratio of [C II] to PAH emission at z ~ 2 is possibly
much lower than what is observed in nearby dusty star-forming galaxies. This
could be the result of enhanced cooling via [O I] at high-z, hotter gas and
dust temperatures, and/or a reduction in the photoelectric efficiency, in which
the coupling between interstellar radiation and gas heating is diminished.

Gyr main-sequence evolution, (3) by performing simulations throughout the giant
branch phases of evolution, and (4) by making assumptions about the belt's

the planetesimals' gravitational responses to analogues of the four solar

stellar flybys, and stellar radiation. We find that the imprint of stellar
cluster dynamics on the architecture of $\gtrsim 100$ km-sized exo-Kuiper belt
planetesimals is retained throughout all phases of stellar evolution unless
violent gravitational instabilities are triggered either (1) amongst the giant

itself. The GRAVITY instrument at the ESO VLTI has recently detected continuous
circular relativistic motion during infrared flares which has been interpreted
as orbital motion near the event horizon. Here we analyze the astrometric data
from these flares, taking into account the effects of out-of-plane motion and
orbital shear of material near the event horizon of the black hole. We have
developed a new code to predict astrometric motion and flux variability from
compact emission regions following particle orbits. Our code combines
semi-analytic calculations of timelike geodesics that allow for out-of-plane or
elliptical motions with ray tracing of photon trajectories to compute
time-dependent images and light curves. We apply our code to the three flares
observed with GRAVITY in 2018. We show that all flares are consistent with a
hotspot orbiting at R$\sim$9 gravitational radii with an inclination of
$i\sim140^\circ$. The emitting region must be compact and less than $\sim5$

that the velocity shift of these detected lines during the transit is

origin. We do not observe any significant net blueshift or redshift that can be
attributed to planetary winds. We use activity indicator lines as control but
find no excess absorption. However, we do notice signatures arising from the
Center-to-Limb variation (CLV) and the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect at these
control lines. This highlights the importance of the CLV+RM correction in
correctly deriving the transmission spectrum, which, if not corrected, could
resemble or cancel out planetary absorption in certain cases. WASP-52b is the

planetary orbits and a giant planet on an eccentric orbit within the system

processes. When gas falls in, a significant fraction of its gravitational
binding energy is either converted into radiation or flows outwards in the form
of black hole-driven jets and disk-driven winds. Recently, the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT), an Earth-size sub-millimetre radio interferometer, captured
the first images of M87's black hole. These images were analysed and
interpreted using general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) models of
accretion disks with rotation axes aligned with the black hole spin axis.
However, since infalling gas is often insensitive to the black hole spin
direction, misalignment between accretion disk and black hole spin may be a
common occurrence in nature. In this work, we use the general-relativistic
radiative transfer (GRRT) code \texttt{BHOSS} to calculate the first synthetic
radio images of (highly) tilted disk/jet models generated by our
GPU-accelerated GRMHD code \texttt{HAMR}. While the tilt does not have a
noticeable effect on the system dynamics beyond a few tens of gravitational
radii from the black hole, the warping of the disk and jet can imprint
observable signatures in EHT images on smaller scales. Comparing the images
from our GRMHD models to the 43 GHz and 230 GHz EHT images of M87, we find that
M87 may feature a tilted disk/jet system. Further, tilted disks and jets
display significant time variability in the 230 GHz flux that can be further
tested by longer-duration EHT observations of M87.

one tests whether these higher-pt functions are consistent with positivity

Element Distinctness) is well-understood, there is a polynomial gap between the
known upper and lower bounds for all constants k>2. Specifically, the best
known upper bound is O(N^{(3/4)-1/(2^{k+2}-4)}) (Belovs, FOCS 2012), while the

the analysis of the image formation mechanisms in band excitation (BE) SPM.
Compared to the point estimates in classical functional fit approaches,
Bayesian inference allows for the incorporation of extant knowledge of

generic to nonequilibrium collective systems. The phenomenon of flux-flow
instability (FFI), however, prevents its exploration and sets practical limits
for the use of vortices in various applications. To suppress the FFI, a
superconductor should exhibit a rarely achieved combination of properties: weak
volume pinning, close-to-depairing critical current, and fast heat removal from
heated electrons. Here, we demonstrate experimentally ultra-fast vortex motion
at velocities of 10-15 km/s in a directly written Nb-C superconductor in which
a close-to-perfect edge barrier orders the vortex motion at large current
values. The spatial evolution of the FFI is described using the edge-controlled
FFI model, implying a chain of FFI nucleation points along the sample edge and
their development into self-organized Josephson-like junctions (vortex rivers).
In addition, our results offer insights into the applicability of widely used
FFI models and suggest Nb-C to be a good candidate material for fast
single-photon detectors.

representations from pixel-wise annotations in biomedical image analysis. Under
this structure, the performance profoundly relies on the effectiveness of
feature extraction achieved by the encoding network. However, few models have
considered adapting the attention of the feature extractor even in different
kinds of tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy by adapting
the attention of the feature extractor according to different tasks for
effective representation learning. Specifically, the framework, named T-Net,
consists of an encoding network supervised by task-specific attention maps and
a posterior network that takes in the learned features to predict the
corresponding results. The attention map is obtained by the transformation from
pixel-wise annotations according to the specific task, which is used as the
supervision to regularize the feature extractor to focus on different locations
of the recognition object. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate
T-Net on two different tasks, i.e. , segmentation and localization. Extensive
results on three public datasets (BraTS-17, MoNuSeg and IDRiD) have indicated
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed supervision method, especially
over the conventional encoding-decoding network.

used to simplify downstream inference tasks. As such, it is widely used in
applications in density estimation, belief propagation, and Bayesian filtering.
In these applications, a finite Gaussian mixture provides an initial
approximation to density functions that are updated recursively. A challenge in
these recursions is that the order of the Gaussian mixture increases
exponentially, and the inference quickly becomes intractable. To overcome the
difficulty, the Gaussian mixture reduction, which approximates a high order
Gaussian mixture by one with a lower order, can be used. Existing methods such
as the clustering-based approaches are renowned for their satisfactory
performance and computationally efficiency. However, they have unknown
convergence and optimal targets. We propose a novel optimization-based Gaussian
mixture reduction method. We develop a majorization-minimization algorithm for
its numerical computation and establish its theoretical convergence under
general conditions. We show many existing clustering-based methods are special
cases of ours, thus bridging the gap between optimization-based and
clustering-based methods. The unified framework allows users to choose the most
suitable cost function to achieve superior performance in their specific
application. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed

rescue~(SAR) operation in indoor environments, where the GPS signals might not
be reliable. We consider a SAR scenario where the UAV tries to locate a victim
trapped in an indoor environment by sensing the RF signals emitted from a smart
device owned by the victim. To locate the victim as fast as possible, we
leverage tools from reinforcement learning~(RL). Received signal strength~(RSS)
at the UAV depends on the distance from the source, indoor shadowing, and
fading parameters, and antenna radiation pattern of the receiver mounted on the
UAV. To make our analysis more realistic, we model two indoor scenarios with
different dimensions using commercial ray-tracing software. Then, the
corresponding RSS values at each possible discrete UAV location are extracted
and used in a Q-learning framework. Unlike the traditional location-based
navigation approach that exploits GPS coordinates, our method uses the RSS to
define the states and rewards of the RL algorithm. We compare the performance
of the proposed method where directional and omnidirectional antennas are used.
The results reveal that the use of directional antennas provides faster
convergence rates than the omnidirectional antennas.

high-order numerical methods for systems of conservation laws that combine Fast

smoothness indicators that require a lower number of calculations than the
standard ones. OWENO reconstructions are based on a definition of the nonlinear
weights that allows one to unconditionally attain the optimal order of accuracy
regardless of the order of critical points. Approximate Taylor methods update
the numerical solutions by using a Taylor expansion in time in which, instead
of using the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure, the time derivatives are computed
by combining spatial and temporal numerical differentiation with Taylor
expansions in a recursive way. These new methods are compared between them and
against methods based on standard WENO implementations and/or SSP-RK time

linear 1d problems to nonlinear systems of conservation laws in 2d.

approaches is that it does not require a good first guess about the solution.
First, we eliminate the coefficient from the Helmholtz equation using a change
of variables. Next, using a truncated expansion with respect to a special
Fourier basis, we approximately reformulate the inverse problem as a system of
quasilinear elliptic PDEs, which can be numerically solved by a weighted
quasi-reversibility approach. The cost functional for the weighted
quasi-reversibility method is constructed as a Tikhonov-like functional that

forward an optimal allocation strategy in the storage of digital data by a kind
of restrictive water-filling. That is, it is a high efficient adaptive
compression strategy since it can make rational use of all the storage space.
It also characterizes the trade-off between the relative weighted
reconstruction error and the available storage size. Furthermore, this paper
also presents that both the users' preferences and the special characteristic
of data distribution can trigger the small-probability event scenarios where
only a fraction of data can cover the vast majority of users' interests.
Whether it is for one of the reasons above, the data with highly clustered
message importance is beneficial to compression storage. In contrast, the data
with uniform information distribution is incompressible, which is consistent
with that in information theory.

intermediate-scale model accurately described empirical data and could quantify
exchange rates elusive by other means, such as the byproduct secretions, even

cross-feeding interactions from experimental data, and highlights the
importance of metabolic exchanges in the dynamics and stability of microbial

prompted researchers to investigate unusual attack vectors. One particularly
powerful class of controlled-channel attacks abuses page-table modifications to
reliably track enclave memory accesses at a page-level granularity. In contrast
to noisy microarchitectural timing leakage, this line of deterministic
controlled-channel attacks abuses indispensable architectural interfaces and
hence cannot be mitigated by tweaking microarchitectural resources.
  We propose an innovative controlled-channel attack, named CopyCat, that
deterministically counts the number of instructions executed within a single
enclave code page. We show that combining the instruction counts harvested by
CopyCat with traditional, coarse-grained page-level leakage allows the accurate
reconstruction of enclave control flow at a maximal instruction-level
granularity. CopyCat can identify intra-page and intra-cache line branch
decisions that ultimately may only differ in a single instruction, underscoring
that even extremely subtle control flow deviations can be deterministically
leaked from secure enclaves. We demonstrate the improved resolution and
practicality of CopyCat on Intel SGX in an extensive study of single-trace and
deterministic attacks against cryptographic implementations, and give novel
algorithmic attacks to perform single-trace key extraction that exploit subtle
vulnerabilities in the latest versions of widely-used cryptographic libraries.
Our findings highlight the importance of stricter verification of cryptographic
implementations, especially in the context of TEEs.

alternative to full training in order to overcome the problem of scarce and

are usually kept unchanged, deeper layers are modified according to the new
dataset. This approach may not work for ultrasound images due to their
drastically different appearance. In this study, we investigated the effect of
fine-tuning different layers of a U-Net which was trained on segmentation of
natural images in breast ultrasound image segmentation. Tuning the contracting
part and fixing the expanding part resulted in substantially better results
compared to fixing the contracting part and tuning the expanding part.
Furthermore, we showed that starting to fine-tune the U-Net from the shallow
layers and gradually including more layers will lead to a better performance
compared to fine-tuning the network from the deep layers moving back to shallow
layers. We did not observe the same results on segmentation of X-ray images,
which have different salient features compared to ultrasound, it may therefore
be more appropriate to fine-tune the shallow layers rather than deep layers.
Shallow layers learn lower level features (including speckle pattern, and
probably the noise and artifact properties) which are critical in automatic
segmentation in this modality.

single-source single-cost nature: The robustness promotion tends to plateau
when the defenses are made increasingly stronger while the cost tends to
amplify. In this paper, we study principles of designing multi-source and
multi-cost schemes where defense performance is boosted from multiple defending
components. Based on this motivation, we propose a multi-source and multi-cost
defense scheme, Adversarially Trained Model Switching (AdvMS), that inherits
advantages from two leading schemes: adversarial training and random model

plasma approximation, where the wave damping is provided by the Cowling

a conclusion on the amount of neutrals in the partially ionised plasma, a

nebulosities to be the remains of the progenitor's red supergiant wind which
accumulated against the southern edge of a large extended H II region located
north of Cas A. Our findings are consistent with the view that Cas A's
progenitor underwent considerable mass-loss, first from a fast main-sequence

the semiconductor, and as high spin Ru$^{3+}$ in the metal, the driving force
behind the valence transition being the strong spin-charge coupling and
consequent large ionizaton energy in the low charge state. Metallic and

flexibility in various aspects. Although orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) remains as the waveform of the upcoming fifth-generation
(5G) standard, the new radio provides flexibility in waveform parametrization
(a.k.a. numerology) to address diverse requirements. However, managing the
peaceful coexistence of mixed numerologies is challenging due to
inter-numerology interference (INI). This paper proposes the utilization of
adaptive guards in both time and frequency domains as a solution along with a
multi-window operation in the physical (PHY) layer. The adaptive windowing
operation needs a guard duration to reduce the unwanted emissions, and a guard
band is required to handle the INI level on the adjacent band. The guards in
both domains are jointly optimized with respect to the subcarrier spacing, use
case (i.e., service requirement), and power offset between the numerologies.
Also, the multi-window approach provides managing each side of the spectrum
independently in case of an asymmetric interference scenario. Since the allowed
interference level depends on the numerologies operating in the adjacent bands,
the potential of adaptive guards is further increased and exploited with a
medium access control (MAC) layer scheduling technique. The proposed INI-based
scheduling algorithm decreases the need for guards by allocating the
numerologies to the available bands, considering their subcarrier spacing,
power level, and SIR requirements. Therefore, INI management is performed with
a cross-layer (PHY and MAC) approach in this study. The results show that the
precise design that accommodates such flexibility reduces the guards
significantly and improves the spectral efficiency of mixed numerology systems.

trade-off between notifying more volunteers for the current task and saving
them for future ones. Motivated by these applications, we introduce the online

NP-hard, i.e., the problem is hard to approximate. The hardness result on
perimeter guarding holds when each sensor may guard at most two disjoint
perimeter segments. On the side of computational methods, for the guarding
perimeters, we develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for
the special setting where each sensor may only guard a single continuous

immediately proved by means of logical relations, for instance program
continuity and differentiability in higher-order languages extended with
real-valued functions. Informally, the problem stems from the fact that these
properties are naturally expressed on terms of non-ground type (or,
equivalently, on open terms of base type), and there is no apparent good
definition for a base case (i.e. for closed terms of ground types). To overcome
this issue, we study a generalization of the concept of a logical relation,
called \emph{open logical relation}, and prove that it can be fruitfully

expressions of first-order type. Our setting is a simply-typed
$\lambda$-calculus enriched with real numbers and real-valued first-order

collection of functions including projection functions and closed under

function belonging to that collection. Then, we show by way of open logical

based on the quasi-static approximate equations that exclude radiation. The
plasma fields are then used to advance the laser or beam forward using a large
time step. The algorithm is many orders of magnitude faster than a 3D fully
explicit relativistic electromagnetic PIC algorithm. It has been shown to be
capable to accurately model the evolution of lasers and particle beams in a
variety of scenarios. At the same time, an algorithm in which the fields,
currents and Maxwell equations are decomposed into azimuthal harmonics has been
shown to reduce the complexity of a 3D explicit PIC algorithm to that of a 2D
algorithm when the expansion is truncated while maintaining accuracy for
problems with near azimuthal symmetry. This hybrid algorithm uses a PIC
description in r-z and a gridless description in $\phi$. We describe a novel

expands the fields, charge and current density into azimuthal harmonics. A set
of the quasi-static field equations are derived for each harmonic. The complex
amplitudes of the fields are then solved using the finite difference method.
The beam and plasma particles are advanced in Cartesian coordinates using the
total fields. Details on how this algorithm was implemented using a similar

the two larger of the three distance sums $d(u,v)+d(w,x)$, $d(u,w)+d(v,x)$, and
$d(u,x)+d(v,w)$ differ by at most $2\delta \geq 0$. Recent work shows that many
real-world graphs have small hyperbolicity $\delta$. This paper describes the
eccentricity terrain of a $\delta$-hyperbolic graph. The eccentricity function
$e_G(v)=\max\{d(v,u) : u \in V\}$ partitions the vertex set of $G$ into
eccentricity layers $C_{k}(G) = \{v \in V : e(v)=rad(G)+k\}$, $k \in
\mathbb{N}$, where $rad(G)=\min\{e_G(v): v\in V\}$ is the radius of $G$. The
paper studies the eccentricity layers of vertices along shortest paths,
identifying such terrain features as hills, plains, valleys, terraces, and
plateaus. It introduces the notion of $\beta$-pseudoconvexity, which implies
Gromov's $\epsilon$-quasiconvexity, and illustrates the abundance of
pseudoconvex sets in $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs. In particular, it shows that
all sets $C_{\leq k}(G)=\{v\in V : e_G(v) \leq rad(G) + k\}$, $k\in
\mathbb{N}$, are $(2\delta-1)$-pseudoconvex. Additionally, several bounds on
the eccentricity of a vertex are obtained which yield a few approaches to
efficiently approximating all eccentricities. An $O(\delta |E|)$ time
eccentricity approximation $\hat{e}(v)$, for all $v\in V$, is presented that
uses distances to two mutually distant vertices and satisfies $e_G(v)-2\delta
\leq \hat{e}(v) \leq {e_G}(v)$. It also shows existence of two eccentricity
approximating spanning trees $T$, one constructible in $O(\delta |E|)$ time and
the other in $O(|E|)$ time, which satisfy ${e}_G(v) \leq e_T(v) \leq
{e}_G(v)+4\delta+1$ and ${e}_G(v) \leq e_T(v) \leq {e}_G(v)+6\delta$,
respectively. Thus, the eccentricity terrain of a tree gives a good
approximation (up-to an additive error $O(\delta))$ of the eccentricity terrain
of a $\delta$-hyperbolic graph.

that are widely used in practice: edit distance (ED), longest common
subsequence (LCS), and longest increasing sequence (LIS). All three problems
can be solved exactly by standard algorithms that run in polynomial time with
roughly $\Theta(n)$ space, where $n$ is the input length, and our goal is to
design deterministic approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time with
significantly smaller space.
  Towards this, we design several algorithms that achieve $1+\epsilon$ or
$1-\epsilon$ approximation for all three problems, where $\epsilon>0$ can be
any constant and even slightly sub constant. Our algorithms are flexible and
can be adjusted to achieve the following two regimes of parameters: 1) space
$n^\delta$ for any constant $\delta>0$ with running time essentially the same
as or slightly more than the standard algorithms; and 2) space
$\mathsf{polylog}(n)$ with (a larger) polynomial running time, which puts the
approximation versions of the three problems in Steve's class (\textbf{SC}).
Our algorithms significantly improve previous results in terms of space
complexity, where all known results need to use space at least
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Some of our algorithms can also be adapted to work in the
asymmetric streaming model [SS13], and output the corresponding sequence.
Furthermore, our results can be used to improve a recent result by Farhadi et.
al. [FHRS20] about approximating ED in the asymmetric streaming model, reducing
the running time from being exponential in [FHRS20] to a polynomial.
  Our algorithms are based on the idea of using recursion as in Savitch's
theorem [Sav70], and a careful adaption of previous techniques to make the
recursion work. Along the way we also give a new logspace reduction from
longest common subsequence to longest increasing sequence, which may be of
independent interest.

discussing the kinetic and potential energy of a solitary wave in these
systems, and show that under certain circumstances the kinetic and potential
energy profiles in these systems (i.e., their spatial distribution) look
reasonably close to each other. While this and other features, such as the
connection between the amplitude and the total energy of the wave bear
similarities between the two models, there are also notable differences, such
as the width of the wave. We then study the dynamical behavior of these systems
in response to an initial velocity impulse. For the Toda lattice, we do so by
employing the inverse scattering transform, and we obtain analytically the
ratio between the energy of the resulting solitary wave and the energy of the
impulse, as a function of the impulse velocity; we then compare the dynamics of
the Toda system to that of the Hertz system, for which the corresponding
quantities are obtained through numerical simulations. In the latter system, we
obtain a universality in the fraction of the energy stored in the resulting
solitary traveling wave irrespectively of the size of the impulse. This
fraction turns out to only depend on the nonlinear exponent. Finally, we
investigate the relation between the velocity of the resulting solitary wave
and the velocity of the impulse. In particular, we provide an alternative proof
for the numerical scaling rule of Hertz type systems.

evidence of association between a set of rare variants (RVs) located on the
same genomic region and a disease outcome in the context of case-control
design. Marginal likelihoods are computed under the null and alternative
hypotheses assuming a binomial distribution for the RV count in the region and
a beta or mixture of Dirac and beta prior distribution for the probability of
RV. We derive the theoretical null distribution of the BF under our prior
setting and show that a Bayesian control of the False Discovery Rate (BFDR) can
be obtained for genome-wide inference. Informative priors are introduced using
prior evidence of association from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. We use
our simulation program, sim1000G, to generate RV data similar to the 1,000
genomes sequencing project. Our simulation studies showed that the new BF
statistic outperforms standard methods (SKAT, SKAT-O, Burden test) in
case-control studies with moderate sample sizes and is equivalent to them under
large sample size scenarios. Our real data application to a lung cancer
case-control study found enrichment for RVs in known and novel cancer genes. It
also suggests that using the BF with informative prior improves the overall
gene discovery compared to the BF with non-informative prior.

determine it observationally. However, the 3D distance is indefinite because it
is hard to determine the line-of-sight (LOS) distance by usual methods. We

image objects based on the positions of their most related words in the text.
In the same way as extracting the hidden features from word embeddings, the

joint information of semantically related objects, which benefit the retrieval

case studies, we look at various aspects of where metrics go wrong in practice
and aspects of how our online environment and current business practices are
exacerbating these failures. Finally, we propose a framework towards mitigating
the harms caused by overemphasis of metrics within AI by: (1) using a slate of
metrics to get a fuller and more nuanced picture, (2) combining metrics with
qualitative accounts, and (3) involving a range of stakeholders, including

optimization problems where the objective function is a summation of a
(probably nonconvex) smooth function and a (probably nonsmooth) convex
function. The model function of our trust-region subproblem is always quadratic

directions. Therefore, the trust-region subproblems can be easily constructed
as well as efficiently solved by cheap and standard methods. When the accuracy
of the model function at the solution of the subproblem is not sufficient, we
add a safeguard on the stepsizes for improving the accuracy. For a class of
functions that can be ""truncated"", an additional truncation step is defined and
a stepsize modification strategy is designed. The overall scheme converges
globally and we establish fast local convergence under suitable assumptions. In
particular, using a connection with a smooth Riemannian trust-region method, we
prove local quadratic convergence for partly smooth functions under a strict
complementary condition. Preliminary numerical results on a family of

queue, a non-preemptive server, and a stationary non-work-conserving scheduler.
New tasks enter the queue according to a Bernoulli process with a pre-specified
arrival rate. At each instant, the server is either busy working on a task or
is available. When the server is available, the scheduler either assigns a new
task to the server or allows it to remain available (to rest). In addition to
the aforementioned availability state, we assume that the server has an
integer-valued activity state. The activity state is non-decreasing during work
periods, and is non-increasing otherwise. In a typical application of our
framework, the server performance (understood as task completion probability)
worsens as the activity state increases. In this article, we build on and
transcend recent stabilizability results obtained for the same framework.
Specifically, we establish methods to design scheduling policies that not only
stabilize the queue but also reduce the utilization rate - understood as the
infinite-horizon time-averaged portion of time the server is working. This
article has a main theorem leading to two key results: (i) We put forth a
tractable method to determine, using a finite-dimensional linear program (LP),
the infimum of all utilization rates that can be achieved by scheduling
policies that are stabilizing, for a given arrival rate. (ii) We propose a
design method, also based on finite-dimensional LPs, to obtain stabilizing
scheduling policies that can attain a utilization rate arbitrarily close to the
aforementioned infimum. We also establish structural and distributional
convergence properties, which are used throughout the article, and are
significant in their own right.

polymer solutions is crucial in many applications such as the production of
film coatings. It is well known that solvent evaporation in polymer solutions
can lead to Rayleigh-B\'enard or Marangoni-type instabilities. Here we reveal
another mechanism, namely that evaporation can cause the interface to display
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities due to the build-up of a dense layer at the
air-liquid interface. We study experimentally the onset time ($t_p$) of the
instability as a function of the macroscopic properties of aqueous polymer
solutions, which we tune by varying the polymer concentration ($c_0$),
molecular weight and polymer type. In dilute solutions, $t_p$ shows two
limiting behaviors depending on the polymer diffusivity. For high diffusivity
polymers (low molecular weight), the pluming time scales as $c_0^{-2/3}$. This
result agrees with previous studies on gravitational instabilities in miscible
systems where diffusion stabilizes the system. On the other hand, in low
diffusivity polymers the pluming time scales as $c_0^{-1}$. The stabilizing
effect of an effective interfacial tension, similar to those in immiscible
systems, explains this strong concentration dependence. Above a critical
concentration, $\hat{c}$, viscosity delays the growth of the instability,
allowing time for diffusion to act as the dominant stabilizing mechanism. This
results in $t_p$ scaling as $(\nu/c_0)^{2/3}$.

study gas flows in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) at $z=2-3$. Combining the
power of a high-resolution VLT/UVES quasar spectrum, an HST/ACS image, and
integral field spectroscopy with Keck/KCWI, we detected Lya emission from a
$1.7L_{\ast}$ galaxy at $z_{\rm gal}=2.0711$ associated with a Lyman limit
system with weak MgII ($W_r(2796)=0.24$ Ang) in quasar field J143040$+$014939.
The galaxy is star-forming (${\rm SFR}_{\rm FUV}=37.8$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$)
and clumpy: either an edge-on disk ($i=85^{\circ}$) or, less likely, a major
merger. The background quasar probes the galaxy at an impact parameter of
$D=66$ kpc along the projected galaxy minor axis ($\Phi=89^{\circ}$). From
photoionization modeling of the absorption system, we infer a total
line-of-sight CGM metallicity of ${\rm [Si/H]}=-1.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$. The
absorption system is roughly kinematically symmetric about $z_{\rm gal}$, with
a full MgII velocity spread of $\sim210$ km s$^{-1}$. Given the galaxy-quasar
orientation, CGM metallicity, and gas kinematics, we interpret this gas as an
outflow that has likely swept-up additional material. By modeling the
absorption as a polar outflow cone, we find the gas is decelerating with
average radial velocity $V_{\rm out}=109-588$ km s$^{-1}$ for half opening
angles of $\theta_0=14^{\circ}-75^{\circ}$. Assuming a constant $V_{\rm out}$,
it would take on average $t_{\rm out}\sim111-597$ Myr for the gas to reach 66
kpc. The outflow is energetic, with a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm
out}<52{\pm37}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and mass loading factor of
$\eta<1.4{\pm1.0}$. We aim to build a sample of $\sim50$ MgII absorber--galaxy
pairs at this epoch to better understand gas flows when they are most actively
building galaxies.

laboratory to study the transition of turbulence from low Alfv{\'e}n Mach
number, $M_\mathrm{A}$, to high $M_\mathrm{A}$. The simultaneous observations
of magnetic field and plasma moments with unprecedented high temporal
resolution provided by NASA's \textit{Magnetospheric Multiscale} Mission enable
us to study the magnetosheath turbulence at both magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and
sub-ion scales. Based on 1841 burst-mode segments of MMS-1 from 2015/09 to
2019/06, comprehensive patterns of the spatial evolution of magnetosheath
turbulences are obtained: (1) from the sub-solar region to the flanks,
$M_\mathrm{A}$ increases from $<$ 1 to $>$ 5. At MHD scales, the spectral
indices of the magnetic-field and velocity spectra present a positive and
negative correlation with $M_\mathrm{A}$. However, no obvious correlations
between the spectral indices and $M_\mathrm{A}$ are found at sub-ion scales.
(2) from the bow shock to the magnetopause, the turbulent sonic Mach number,
$M_{\mathrm{turb}}$, generally decreases from $>$ 0.4 to $<$ 0.1. All spectra
steepen at MHD scales and flatten at sub-ion scales, representing a
positive/negative correlations with $M_\mathrm{turb}$. The break frequency
increases by 0.1 Hz when approaching the magnetopause for the magnetic-field
and velocity spectra, while it remains at 0.3 Hz for the density spectra. (3)
In spite of some differences, similar results are found for the quasi-parallel
and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath. In addition, the spatial evolution of
magnetosheath turbulence is found to be independent of the upstream solar wind
conditions, e.g., the Z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field and the
solar wind speed.

model should be investigated specifically. In the existing pulsar detection
researches based on ML methods, there are mainly two kinds of feature designs:
the empirical features and statistical features. Due to the combinational
effects from multiple features, however, there exist some redundancies and even
irrelevant components in the available features, which can reduce the accuracy
of a pulsar detection model. Therefore, it is essential to select a subset of
relevant features from a set of available candidate features and known as
{\itshape feature selection.} In this work, two feature selection algorithms
----\textit{Grid Search} (GS) and \textit{Recursive Feature Elimination}
(RFE)---- are proposed to improve the detection performance by removing the
redundant and irrelevant features. The algorithms were evaluated on the
Southern High Time Resolution University survey (HTRU-S) with five pulsar
detection models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed feature selection algorithms. By the GS, a model
with only two features reach a recall rate as high as 99\% and a false positive
rate (FPR) as low as 0.65\%; By the RFE, another model with only three features
achieves a recall rate 99\% and an FPR of 0.16\% in pulsar candidates
classification. Furthermore, this work investigated the number of features
required as well as the misclassified pulsars by our models.

the C$^{18}$O line emits from both the disk and the inner envelope, while
C$^{17}$O and $^{13}$C$^{18}$O lines are consistent with a disk origin. The
line ratios indicate that both C$^{18}$O and C$^{17}$O lines are optically
thick in the disk region, and only $^{13}$C$^{18}$O line is optically thin. The
line profiles of the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O emissions are best reproduced by
Keplerian gaseous disks at similar sizes as their mm-continuum emissions,
suggesting small radial separations between the gas and mm-sized grains in
these disks, in contrast to the large separation commonly seen in
protoplanetary disks. Assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we find that the CO
gas abundances in these protostellar disks are consistent with the ISM
abundance within a factor of 2, nearly one order of magnitude higher than the
average value of 1-10 Myr old disks. These results suggest that there is a

CO snowline. Here we report the first direct evidence of an elevated C/H ratio
in disk gas. We use two thermo-chemical codes to model the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O,
C$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O (2-1) line spectra of the HD 163296 disk. We show that
the gas inside the CO snowline ($\sim$70 au) has a C/H ratio of 1-2 times
higher than the stellar value. This ratio exceeds the expected value
substantially, as only 25-60% of the carbon should be in gas at these radii.
Although we cannot rule out the case of a normal C/H ratio inside 70 au, the
most probable solution is an elevated C/H ratio of 2-8 times higher than the
expectation. Our model also shows that the gas outside 70 au has a C/H ratio of
0.1$\times$ the stellar value. This picture of enriched C/H gas at the inner
region and depleted gas at the outer region is consistent with numerical
simulations of icy pebble growth and drift in protoplanetary disks. Our results
demonstrate that the large-scale drift of icy pebble can occur in disks and may
significantly change the disk gas composition for planet formation.

items, and categorical features via embeddings. A standard approach is to map
each unique feature value to an embedding vector. The size of the produced
embedding table grows linearly with the size of the vocabulary. Therefore, a
large vocabulary inevitably leads to a gigantic embedding table, creating two
severe problems: (i) making model serving intractable in resource-constrained
environments; (ii) causing overfitting problems. In this paper, we seek to
learn highly compact embeddings for large-vocab sparse features in recommender
systems (recsys). First, we show that the novel Differentiable Product
Quantization (DPQ) approach can generalize to recsys problems. In addition, to
better handle the power-law data distribution commonly seen in recsys, we
propose a Multi-Granular Quantized Embeddings (MGQE) technique which learns
more compact embeddings for infrequent items. We seek to provide a new angle to
improve recommendation performance with compact model sizes. Extensive
experiments on three recommendation tasks and two datasets show that we can
achieve on par or better performance, with only ~20% of the original model

develop a provably convergent adaptive projected variant of the TD(0) learning

to the TD(0), AdaTD(0) is robust or less sensitive to the choice of stepsizes.
Analytically, we establish that to reach an $\epsilon$ accuracy, the number of

$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\ln^4\frac{1}{\epsilon}/\ln^4\frac{1}{\rho})$ in the

important issue in many scientific fields. Quantifying quality and uncertainty
of a selection result via false discovery rate (FDR) control has been of recent
interest. This paper introduces a way of using data-splitting strategies to
asymptotically control the FDR while maintaining a high power. For each
feature, the method constructs a test statistic by estimating two independent
regression coefficients via data splitting. FDR control is achieved by taking
advantage of the statistic's property that, for any null feature, its sampling
distribution is symmetric about zero. Furthermore, we propose Multiple Data
Splitting (MDS) to stabilize the selection result and boost the power.
Interestingly and surprisingly, with the FDR still under control, MDS not only
helps overcome the power loss caused by sample splitting, but also results in a
lower variance of the false discovery proportion (FDP) compared with all other
methods in consideration. We prove that the proposed data-splitting methods can
asymptotically control the FDR at any designated level for linear and Gaussian
graphical models in both low and high dimensions. Through intensive simulation
studies and a real-data application, we show that the proposed methods are
robust to the unknown distribution of features, easy to implement and
computationally efficient, and are often the most powerful ones amongst
competitors especially when the signals are weak and the correlations or

uses dilated convolution and the corresponding atrous spatial pyramid pooling,
which enlarged the receptive field without sacrificing spatial resolution or
increasing memory usage. The second uses a scale attention mechanism to guide
the up-sampling of features from the coarse level by a learned weight map. In
implementation, the computational overhead against the original U-Net was only
a few convolutional layers. Experimental evaluations revealed that the proposed
method outperformed state-of-the-art general-purpose semantic segmentation

problem, however, it is extreamly time consuming even for state-of-the-art
commercial solvers. Aiming to alleviate this issue, we cast the problem into
binary integer programming, which omits the requirements for real value
parameters and is more efficient to be solved . Firstly, the bounding boxes of
the primitives are detected using the YOLOv3 architecture in real-time.
Secondly, the coordinates of the upper left corners and the sizes of the
bounding boxes are automatically clustered in a binary integer programming
optimization, which jointly considers the geometric fitness, regularity and
additional constraints; this step does not require \emph{a priori} knowledge,
such as the number of clusters or pre-defined grammars. Finally, the
regularized bounding boxes can be directly used to guide the fa\c{c}ade
reconstruction in an interactive envinronment. Experimental evaluations have
revealed that the accuracies for the extraction of primitives are above 0.82,
which is sufficient for the following 3D reconstruction. The proposed approach
only takes about $ 10\% $ to $ 20\% $ of the runtime than previous approach and
reduces the diversity of the bounding boxes to about $20\%$ to $50\%$.

Nevertheless, the neutrinos exchange energy and entropy with the photon,
electron-positron, and baryon component of the early universe only through the
ordinary weak interaction. We examine the effects of neutrino self-interaction
for the primordial helium and deuterium abundances and $N_{\rm eff}$, a measure
of relativistic energy density at photon decoupling. These quantities are
determined in, or may be influenced by, the physics in the weak decoupling
epoch. Self interacting neutrinos have been invoked to address a number of
anomalies, including as a possible means of ameliorating tension in the Hubble
parameter. Our calculations show that surprisingly subtle changes in BBN
accompany some of these neutrino self-interaction schemes. Such minute signals
require high-precision measurements, making deuterium the best abundance for
BBN constraints in the models explored here.

measured using mean square error (MSE), which suggests the use of orthogonal
transforms, such as the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Perceptual metrics
such as Structural Similarity (SSIM) are typically used after encoding, but not
tied to the encoding process. In this paper, we consider an alternative
framework where the goal is to optimize a weighted MSE metric, where different
weights can be assigned to each pixel so as to reflect their relative
importance in terms of perceptual image quality. For this purpose, we propose a
novel transform coding scheme based on irregularity-aware graph Fourier
transform (IAGFT), where the induced IAGFT is orthogonal, but the orthogonality
is defined with respect to an inner product corresponding to the weighted MSE.
We propose to use weights derived from local variances of the input image, such
that the weighted MSE aligns with SSIM. In this way, the associated IAGFT can
achieve a coding efficiency improvement in SSIM with respect to conventional
transform coding based on DCT. Our experimental results show a compression gain
in terms of multi-scale SSIM on test images.

We are particularly interested in the cases where the number of (scalar)
decision variables is much larger than the number of (scalar) measurements, and
each agent has limited memory or computing capacity such that it only knows a
small number of columns of a measurement matrix. These problems in
consideration are densely coupled and cannot be formulated as separable convex
programs using column partition. To overcome this difficulty, we consider their
dual problems which are separable or locally coupled. Once a dual solution is
attained, it is shown that a primal solution can be found from the dual of
corresponding regularized BP-like problems under suitable exact regularization
conditions. A wide range of existing distributed schemes can be exploited to
solve the obtained dual problems. This yields two-stage column partition based
distributed schemes for LASSO-like and BPDN-like problems; the overall
convergence of these schemes is established using sensitivity analysis
techniques. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed

the same statistical properties as the observed ones as long as the
dimensionless viscosity parameter $\alpha$, which is widely believed to be
controlled by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the accretion disk, is
about $0.01$---$0.2$. Moreover, our model can simultaneously explain the
larger-than-expected accretion disk sizes and the dependence of UV/optical
variability upon wavelength for NGC 5548. Our model also has the potential to
explain some other observational facts of AGN UV/optical variability, including
the timescale-dependent bluer-when-brighter color variability and the
dependence of UV/optical variability on AGN luminosity and black hole mass. Our
results also demonstrate a promising way to infer the black-hole mass, the

upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can
significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a base station (BS) unit can
act as a self-powered BS. In this paper, an effective energy dispatch mechanism
for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied.
First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the
goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while
fulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution
is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning
(MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays
the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy
consumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a
meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy
dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with
its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy
dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally,
the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic,
asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy
usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
MAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the
energy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline
methods.

  and Defenses (RAID), Donostia / San Sebastian, Spain, October 2020",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Seed scheduling is a prominent factor in determining the yields of hybrid
fuzzing. Existing hybrid fuzzers schedule seeds based on fixed heuristics that
aim to predict input utilities. However, such heuristics are not generalizable
as there exists no one-size-fits-all rule applicable to different programs.
They may work well on the programs from which they were derived, but not
others. To overcome this problem, we design a Machine learning-Enhanced hybrid
fUZZing system (MEUZZ), which employs supervised machine learning for adaptive
and generalizable seed scheduling. MEUZZ determines which new seeds are
expected to produce better fuzzing yields based on the knowledge learned from
past seed scheduling decisions made on the same or similar programs. MEUZZ's
learning is based on a series of features extracted via code reachability and
dynamic analysis, which incurs negligible runtime overhead (in microseconds).
Moreover, MEUZZ automatically infers the data labels by evaluating the fuzzing
performance of each selected seed. As a result, MEUZZ is generally applicable
to, and performs well on, various kinds of programs. Our evaluation shows MEUZZ
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art grey-box and hybrid fuzzers,
achieving 27.1% more code coverage than QSYM. The learned models are reusable
and transferable, which boosts fuzzing performance by 7.1% on average and
improves 68% of the 56 cross-program fuzzing campaigns. MEUZZ discovered 47
deeply hidden and previously unknown bugs--with 21 confirmed and fixed by the
developers--when fuzzing 8 well-tested programs with the same configurations as
used in previous work.

efficiency and preserve data privacy. Each computing node makes equal
contribution to collaboratively learn a Deep Learning model. The elimination of
centralized Parameter Servers (PS) can effectively address many issues such as
privacy, performance bottleneck and single-point-failure. However, how to
achieve Byzantine Fault Tolerance in decentralized learning systems is rarely
explored, although this problem has been extensively studied in centralized
systems.
  In this paper, we present an in-depth study towards the Byzantine resilience
of decentralized learning systems with two contributions. First, from the
adversarial perspective, we theoretically illustrate that Byzantine attacks are
more dangerous and feasible in decentralized learning systems: even one
malicious participant can arbitrarily alter the models of other participants by
sending carefully crafted updates to its neighbors. Second, from the defense
perspective, we propose UBAR, a novel algorithm to enhance decentralized
learning with Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Specifically, UBAR provides a Uniform
Byzantine-resilient Aggregation Rule for benign nodes to select the useful
parameter updates and filter out the malicious ones in each training iteration.
It guarantees that each benign node in a decentralized system can train a
correct model under very strong Byzantine attacks with an arbitrary number of
faulty nodes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard image classification
tasks and the results indicate that UBAR can effectively defeat both simple and
sophisticated Byzantine attacks with higher performance efficiency than
existing solutions.

model and the local model. The central model focuses on the machine learning
model and the local model focuses on the training data. In this paper, we study
the \textit{input perturbation} method in differentially private empirical risk
minimization (DP-ERM), preserving privacy of the central model. By adding noise
to the original training data and training with the `perturbed data', we
achieve ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differential privacy on the final model, along
with some kind of privacy on the original data. We observe that there is an
interesting connection between the local model and the central model: the
perturbation on the original data causes the perturbation on the gradient, and
finally the model parameters. This observation means that our method builds a
bridge between local and central model, protecting the data, the gradient and
the model simultaneously, which is more superior than previous central methods.
Detailed theoretical analysis and experiments show that our method achieves
almost the same (or even better) performance as some of the best previous
central methods with more protections on privacy, which is an attractive
result. Moreover, we extend our method to a more general case: the loss
function satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is more general than
strong convexity, the constraint on the loss function in most previous work.

of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model. Two
different model scenarios are compared: the cascade mode and the mean field

$v_{2}$ difference between protons and antiprotons obtained from the mean field

Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), which aims to recommend a set of herbs to
treat the symptoms of a patient. While several machine learning methods have
been developed for herb recommendation, they are limited in modeling only the
interactions between herbs and symptoms, and ignoring the intermediate process
of syndrome induction. When performing TCM diagnostics, an experienced doctor
typically induces syndromes from the patient's symptoms and then suggests herbs
based on the induced syndromes. As such, we believe the induction of syndromes,
an overall description of the symptoms, is important for herb recommendation
and should be properly handled. However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of
syndrome induction, most prescriptions lack the explicit ground truth of
syndromes. In this paper, we propose a new method that takes the implicit
syndrome induction process into account for herb recommendation. Given a set of
symptoms to treat, we aim to generate an overall syndrome representation by
effectively fusing the embeddings of all the symptoms in the set, to mimic how
a doctor induces the syndromes. Towards symptom embedding learning, we
additionally construct a symptom-symptom graph from the input prescriptions for
capturing the relations between symptoms; we then build graph convolution
networks(GCNs) on both symptom-symptom and symptom-herb graphs to learn symptom
embedding. Similarly, we construct a herb-herb graph and build GCNs on both
herb-herb and symptom-herb graphs to learn herb embedding, which is finally
interacted with the syndrome representation to predict the scores of herbs. In
this way, more comprehensive representations can be obtained. We conduct
extensive experiments on a public TCM dataset, showing significant improvements
over state-of-the-art herb recommendation methods.

soft faceted browsing, where the system also includes some possibly relevant

for applications such as e-commerce search where the user would like to explore
a larger space before finalizing a purchasing decision. We propose a

e-commerce search engines. Preliminary experiment results demonstrate the soft
faceted browsing scheme is better than the traditional faceted browsing scheme
in terms of its efficiency in helping users navigate in the information space.

adjacent vertices in $G$. The study of the orthogonality dimension of graphs is
motivated by various applications in information theory and in theoretical
computer science. The contribution of the present work is two-fold.
  First, we prove that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every
sufficiently large integer $t$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to decide whether the
orthogonality dimension of an input graph over $\mathbb{R}$ is at most $t$ or
at least $3t/2-c$. At the heart of the proof lies a geometric result, which
might be of independent interest, on a generalization of the orthogonality
dimension parameter for the family of Kneser graphs, analogously to a
long-standing conjecture of Stahl (J. Comb. Theo. Ser. B, 1976).
  Second, we study the smallest possible orthogonality dimension over finite
fields of the complement of graphs that do not contain certain fixed subgraphs.
In particular, we provide an explicit construction of triangle-free $n$-vertex
graphs whose complement has orthogonality dimension over the binary field at
most $n^{1-\delta}$ for some constant $\delta >0$. Our results involve
constructions from the family of generalized Kneser graphs and they are
motivated by the rigidity approach to circuit lower bounds. We use them to
answer a couple of questions raised by Codenotti, Pudl\'{a}k, and Resta (Theor.

various nonlinearities arise in the system resulting in superharmonic
resonances. Taking practically relevant numerical values of parameters, we
suitably order the parameters for their smallness. We then obtain the frequency
responses corresponding to primary and superharmonic resonances by applying the
method of multiple scales up to fourth and third orders for out-of-plane and
in-plane cases respectively. Comparisons are drawn with the results obtained
using the method of harmonic balance.

correspondences between two undirected and connected graphs, which is called
\textit{graph matching}, over multi-agent networks. Given two
\textit{isomorphic} and \textit{asymmetric} graphs, there is a unique
permutation matrix that maps the vertices in one graph to the vertices in the
other. Based on a convex relaxation of graph matching in Aflalo et al. (2015),
we propose a distributed computation of graph matching as a distributed convex
optimization problem subject to equality constraints and a global set
constraint, using a network of multiple agents whose interaction graph is
connected. Each agent in the network only knows one column of each of the
adjacency matrices of the two graphs, and all agents collaboratively learn the
graph matching by exchanging information with their neighbors. The proposed
algorithm employs a projected primal-dual gradient method to handle equality
constraints and a set constraint. Under the proposed algorithm, the agents'
estimates of the permutation matrix converge to the optimal permutation
globally and exponentially fast. Finally, simulation results are given to
illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

two-dimensional barotropic flow. An analytic estimate of the minimum value for
the zonal component has been derived. The energy, angular momentum,
circulation, as well as the total enstrophy are invoked as constraints for the
minimization of the zonal enstrophy. The corresponding variational principle
has an unusual mathematical structure (primarily because the target functional
is not a coercive form), by which the constraints work out in an interesting
way. A discrete set of zonal enstrophy levels is generated by the energy
constraint; each level is specified by an eigenvalue that represents the
lamination period of zonal flow. However, the value itself of the zonal
enstrophy level is a function of only angular momentum and circulation, being
independent of the energy (and total enstrophy). Instead, the energy works in
selecting the ""level"" (eigenvalue) of the relaxed state. The relaxation occurs
by emitting small-scale wavy enstrophy, and continues as far as the nonlinear
effect, scaled by the energy, can create wavy enstrophy. Comparison with
numerical simulations shows that the theory gives a proper estimate of the
zonal enstrophy in the relaxed state.

by those field lines of the small scale local surface field $\vec{B}_s$ that
join the last open field lines of $\vec{B}_d$ in a height of $\sim 10^5$ cm
above the cap. As the ratio of radii of the conventional and real polar cap
$R_{dip}/R_{pc}\sim 10$, flux conservation requires $B_s/B_d\sim 100$. For
rotational periods $P\sim 0.5$ s, $B_s\sim 10^{14}$ G creates a strong electric

consequence of a transition from a brittle to a ductile failure response.
Although this transition and the accompanying toughening effect have been
demonstrated in hydrogels first, the concept has been proven effective in
elastomers and in macroscopic composites as well. This suggests that the
transition is not caused by a specific molecular architecture, but rather by a
general physical principle related to the mechanical interplay between two
interpenetrating networks. Here we employ theory and computer simulations,

enables us to study the joined effect of initial disorder and network-induced

balance gives a good description of the brittle-to-ductile transition. In
addition, the inclusion of disorder in the spring model predicts four different

experimental findings. Finally, we show that the network structure can result
in stress concentration, diffuse damage and loss of percolation depending on

terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs are probably tidally
locked and have limited surface water inventories as a result of their host
stars' high early luminosities. Several previous climate simulations of such
planets have indicated that their remaining water would be transported to the
planet's permanent nightside and become trapped as surface ice, leaving the
dayside devoid of water. Here we use a three-dimensional general circulation
model with a water cycle and accurate radiative transfer scheme to investigate
the surface water evolution on slowly rotating tidally locked terrestrial
planets with limited surface water inventories. We show that there is a
competition for water trapping between the nightside surface and the substellar
tropopause in this type of climate system. Although under some conditions the
surface water remains trapped on the nightside as an ice sheet, in other cases
liquid water stabilizes in a circular area in the substellar region as a
wetland. Planets with 1 bar N$_2$ and atmospheric CO$_2$ levels greater than

channels. Fountain codes have low computational complexity and fast encoding
and decoding algorithms which makes them attractive for real time applications
such as streaming video over wireless channels. L T codes are known to perform
close to capacity on the binary erasure channel and it is envisaged that they
would have good performance on other channels such as mobile communication
channels and satellite links. This paper considers the development of a
test-bed to study the performance of fountain codes over such channels. The
performance of LT codes on the binary symmetric channel and Additive White
Gaussian Noise (A WGN) Channel is presented as examples of the testbed usage.

certain microframe, and \textit{microframe intensity} shows how actively a
certain microframe is used. Together, they offer a detailed characterization of

well align with sentiment, topic, and partisan spectrum by applying FrameAxis
to multiple datasets from restaurant reviews to political news.} The existing
domain knowledge can be incorporated into FrameAxis {by using custom

subpopulations based on multiple samples of cell surface or intracellular
marker expression level data obtained by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF).
Cell subpopulations are characterized by differences in expression patterns of
makers, and individual cells are clustered into the subpopulations based on the
patterns of their observed expression levels. A finite Indian buffet process is
used to model subpopulations as latent features, and a model-based method based
on these latent feature subpopulations is used to construct cell clusters
within each sample. Non-ignorable missing data due to technical artifacts in
mass cytometry instruments are accounted for by defining a static missing data
mechanism. In contrast to conventional cell clustering methods based on
observed marker expression levels that are applied separately to different
samples, the FAM based method can be applied simultaneously to multiple
samples, and can identify important cell subpopulations likely to be missed by
conventional clustering. The proposed FAM based method is applied to jointly
analyze three datasets, generated by CyTOF, to study natural killer (NK) cells.
Because the subpopulations identified by the FAM may define novel NK cell
subsets, this statistical analysis may provide useful information about the
biology of NK cells and their potential role in cancer immunotherapy which may
lead, in turn, to development of improved cellular therapies. Simulation
studies of the proposed method's behavior under two cases of known
subpopulations also are presented, followed by analysis of the CyTOF NK cell
surface marker data.

plausible effects of the dynamic post-merger environment differing from the
putative pre-merger cluster environment. The remnants of the pre-merger relaxed
cluster environment are realised through the existence of passive spiral
galaxies located in the central regions of the cluster between the two BCGs. We
discover A3376 to contain a population of massive $(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>10$) blue

exhibiting star formation rates similar to those in relaxed clusters at similar

blue PSBs which could either be formed as a result of rapid quenching of
low-mass spirals following the shock-induced star formation or due to the
intense surge in the ICM pressures at the beginning of the merger. With the
possibility of the merger shock affecting high- and low-mass spirals
differently, our results bridge the seemingly contradictory results observed in
known merging cluster systems so far and establish that different environmental
effects are at play right from pre- to post-merger stage.

metasurface (PMS) based transmitter. Taking into account of the
finite-resolution phase shifts of PMSs, a novel beam training approach is
proposed, which achieves comparable performance as the exhaustive beam
searching method but with much lower time overhead. Then, a closed-form
expression for the achievable multicast rate is presented, which is valid for
arbitrary system configurations. In addition, for certain asymptotic scenario,
simple approximated expressions for the multicase rate are derived. Closed-form
solutions are obtained for the optimal power allocation scheme, and it is shown
that equal power allocation is optimal when the pilot power or the number of
reflecting elements is sufficiently large. However, it is desirable to allocate
more power to weaker users when there are a large number of RF chains. The
analytical findings indicate that, with large pilot power, the multicast rate
is determined by the weakest user. Also, increasing the number of radio
frequency (RF) chains or reflecting elements can significantly improve the
multicast rate, and as the phase shift number becomes larger, the multicast
rate improves first and gradually converges to a limit. Moreover, increasing
the number of users would significantly degrade the multicast rate, but this
rate loss can be compensated by implementing a large number of reflecting
elements.

sequence-to-sequence modeling, typically, the output of the last layer of the
N-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last
decoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single
loss consisting of NxM losses, where each loss is computed from the output of
one of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a
model subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers,
and can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and
decoder layers. We then propose a mechanism to choose a priori the number of
encoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and also explore recurrent
stacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present
a cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine
translation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving

advantages of training kernel methods based on subsets made of diverse points.
In particular, if the dataset has a dense bulk and a sparser tail, we show that
Nystr\""om kernel regression with diverse landmarks increases the accuracy of
the regression in sparser regions of the dataset, with respect to a uniform
landmark sampling. A greedy heuristic is also proposed to select diverse

algebras had been introduced and applied to sketch P versus NP-complete
borderline for circuits satisfiability over algebras from congruence modular
varieties. However the problem for nilpotent (which had not been shown to be
NP-hard) but not supernilpotent algebras (which had been shown to be polynomial
time) remained open.
  In this paper we provide a broad class of examples, lying in this grey area,
and show that, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis and Strong Exponential
Size Hypothesis (saying that Boolean circuits need exponentially many modular
counting gates to produce boolean conjunctions of any arity), satisfiability
over these algebras have intermediate complexity between $\Omega(2^{c\log^{h-1}
n})$ and $O(2^{c\log^h n})$, where $h$ measures how much a nilpotent algebra
fails to be supernilpotent. We also sketch how these examples could be used as
paradigms to fill the nilpotent versus supernilpotent gap in general.
  Our examples are striking in view of the natural strong connections between
circuits satisfiability and Constraint Satisfaction Problem for which the
dichotomy had been shown by Bulatov and Zhuk.

advantages. AMP converges only in a limited class of sensing matrices while it
has low complexity. Orthogonal/vector AMP requires a high-complexity matrix
inversion while it is applicable for a wide class of sensing matrices. The key
feature of the proposed algorithm is the so-called Onsager correction via a
convolution of messages in all preceding iterations while the conventional
message-passing algorithms have correction terms that depend only on messages
in the latest iteration. Thus, the proposed algorithm is called convolutional
AMP (CAMP). Ill-conditioned sensing matrices are simulated as an example in

CAMP can improve the convergence property of AMP and achieve high performance
comparable to orthogonal/vector AMP in spite of low complexity comparable to

obtained as part of the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey (ASPECS) large program, we
measure the cosmic density of dust and implied gas (H$_{2}+$H I) mass in
galaxies as a function of look-back time. We do so by stacking the contribution
from all $H$-band selected galaxies above a given stellar mass in distinct
redshift bins, $\rho_{\rm dust}(M_\ast>M,z)$ and $\rho_{\rm gas}(M_\ast>M,z)$.
At all redshifts, $\rho_{\rm dust}(M_\ast>M,z)$ and $\rho_{\rm
gas}(M_\ast>M,z)$ grow rapidly as $M$ decreases down to $10^{10}\,M_\odot$, but
this growth slows down towards lower stellar masses. This flattening implies
that at our stellar mass-completeness limits ($10^8\,M_\odot$ and
$10^{8.9}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim0.4$ and $z\sim3$), both quantities converge
towards the total cosmic dust and gas mass densities in galaxies. The cosmic
dust and gas mass densities increase at early cosmic time, peak around
$z\sim2$, and decrease by a factor $\sim4$ and 7, compared to the density of
dust and molecular gas in the local universe, respectively. The contribution of
quiescent galaxies -- i.e., with little on-going star-formation -- to the
cosmic dust and gas mass densities is minor ($\lesssim10\%$). The redshift
evolution of the cosmic gas mass density resembles that of the star-formation
rate density, as previously found by CO-based measurements. This confirms that
galaxies have relatively constant star-formation efficiencies (within a factor
$\sim2$) across cosmic time. Our results also imply that by $z\sim0$, a large
fraction ($\sim90\%$) of dust formed in galaxies across cosmic time has been
destroyed or ejected to the intergalactic medium.

completely described by a mask function. This allows solving the governing

massively parallel computers allows us to perform high resolution computations

approach, thus modeling the different mechanical behaviors of the veins and the
membranes of the wing. We perform a series of numerical simulations of a
flexible revolving bumblebee wing at a Reynolds number Re = 1800. In order to
assess the influence of wing flexibility on the aerodynamics, we vary the

via an unsupervised approach, is an attractive topic in recent years. To
improve the representative ability, several graph auto-encoder (GAE) models,
which are based on semi-supervised graph convolution networks (GCN), have been
developed and they achieve good results compared with traditional clustering
methods. However, all existing methods either fail to utilize the orthogonal
property of the representations generated by GAE, or separate the clustering
and the learning of neural networks. We first prove that the relaxed k-means
will obtain an optimal partition in the inner-products used space. Driven by
theoretical analysis about relaxed k-means, we design a specific GAE-based
model for graph clustering to be consistent with the theory, namely Embedding
Graph Auto-Encoder (EGAE). Meanwhile, the learned representations are well
explainable such that the representations can be also used for other tasks. To
further induce the neural network to produce deep features that are appropriate
for the specific clustering model, the relaxed k-means and GAE are learned
simultaneously. Therefore, the relaxed k-means can be equivalently regarded as
a decoder that attempts to learn representations that can be linearly
constructed by some centroid vectors. Accordingly, EGAE consists of one encoder
and dual decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority
of EGAE and the corresponding theoretical analyses.

components of $\Omega$ are non-degenerate and their diameters have a finite
sum; (2) either the degenerate boundary components of $\Omega$ or those of $U$
form a set of sigma-finite linear measure. We prove that $\varphi$ continuously
extends to the closure of $U$ if and only if every boundary component of
$\Omega$ is locally connected. This generalizes the Carath\'eodory's Continuity
Theorem and leads us to a new generalization of the well known
Osgood-Taylor-Carath\'eodory Theorem. There are three issues that are
noteworthy. Firstly, none of the above conditions (1) and (2) can be removed.
Secondly, %no further requirements concerning $U$ or $\Omega$ are needed. So
our results remain valid for non-cofat domains and do not follow from the
extension results, of a similar nature, that are obtained in very recent
studies on the conformal rigidity of circle domains. Finally, when $\varphi$
does extend continuously to the closure of $U$, the boundary of $\Omega$ is a
Peano compactum. Therefore, we also show that the following properties are
equivalent for any planar domain $\Omega$:
  (1) The boundary of $\Omega$ is a Peano compactum.
  (2) $\Omega$ has Property S.
  (3) Every point on the boundary of $\Omega$ is locally accessible.
  (4) Every point on the boundary of $\Omega$ is locally sequentially
accessible.
  (5) $\Omega$ is finitely connected at the boundary.
  (6) The completion of $\Omega$ under the Mazurkiewicz distance is compact.

restricted to special cases, when additional assumptions on the topology of $U$

quality of the results, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to
minimize simultaneously the number of points in the set and the classification
error. Experimental results on non-trivial benchmarks show that the proposed
approach is able to deliver results that allow a classifier to obtain lower
error and better ability of generalizing on unseen data than state-of-the-art
coreset discovery techniques.

studies about graph convolution neural networks have achieved impressive
success on graph type data. However, in general clustering tasks, the graph
structure of data does not exist such that the strategy to construct a graph is
crucial for performance. Therefore, how to extend graph convolution networks
into general clustering tasks is an attractive problem. In this paper, we
propose a graph auto-encoder for general data clustering, which constructs the
graph adaptively according to the generative perspective of graphs. The
adaptive process is designed to induce the model to exploit the high-level
information behind data and utilize the non-Euclidean structure sufficiently.
We further design a novel mechanism with rigorous analysis to avoid the
collapse caused by the adaptive construction. Via combining the generative
model for network embedding and graph-based clustering, a graph auto-encoder
with a novel decoder is developed such that it performs well in weighted graph
used scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our model.

model with a critical end point at finite baryon density. Firstly we consider
the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) of this hQCD model in a spherical
shaped region and a strip shaped region, respectively, and find that the HEE of
this hQCD model in both regions can reflect QCD phase transition. What is more
is that although the area formulas and minimal area equations of the two
regions are quite different, the HEE have very similar behavior on the QCD
phase diagram. So we argue that the behavior of HEE on the QCD phase diagram is
independent of the shape of subregions. However, as we know that HEE is not a
good quantity to characterize the entanglement between different subregions of
a thermal system. So we then study the mutual information (MI), conditional
mutual information (CMI) and the entanglement of purification (Ep) in different
strip shaped regions. We find that the three entanglement quantities have very
similar behavior: their values do not change so much in the hadronic matter
phase and then rise up quickly with the increase of $T$ and $\m$ in the QGP
phase. Near the phase boundary, these three entanglement quantities change
smoothly in the crossover region, continuously but not smoothly at CEP and show
discontinuity behavior in the first phase transition region. And all of them
can be used to distinguish different phases of strongly coupled matter.

to adopt deep learning for code clone detection to automatically learn latent

several approaches used abstract syntax trees (AST) as input and achieved
significant progress on code clone benchmarks in various programming languages.
However, these AST-based approaches still can not fully leverage the structural
information of code fragments, especially semantic information such as control
flow and data flow. To leverage control and data flow information, in this
paper, we build a graph representation of programs called flow-augmented
abstract syntax tree (FA-AST). We construct FA-AST by augmenting original ASTs
with explicit control and data flow edges. Then we apply two different types of
graph neural networks (GNN) on FA-AST to measure the similarity of code pairs.

  Expression Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel stroke constrained attention network (SCAN)
which treats stroke as the basic unit for encoder-decoder based online
handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER). Unlike previous methods
which use trace points or image pixels as basic units, SCAN makes full use of
stroke-level information for better alignment and representation. The proposed
SCAN can be adopted in both single-modal (online or offline) and multi-modal
HMER. For single-modal HMER, SCAN first employs a CNN-GRU encoder to extract
point-level features from input traces in online mode and employs a CNN encoder
to extract pixel-level features from input images in offline mode, then use
stroke constrained information to convert them into online and offline
stroke-level features. Using stroke-level features can explicitly group points
or pixels belonging to the same stroke, therefore reduces the difficulty of
symbol segmentation and recognition via the decoder with attention mechanism.
For multi-modal HMER, other than fusing multi-modal information in decoder,
SCAN can also fuse multi-modal information in encoder by utilizing the stroke
based alignments between online and offline modalities. The encoder fusion is a
better way for combining multi-modal information as it implements the
information interaction one step before the decoder fusion so that the
advantages of multiple modalities can be exploited earlier and more adequately
when training the encoder-decoder model. Evaluated on a benchmark published by
CROHME competition, the proposed SCAN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance.

essential element in constructing large-sale quantum processors with a quantum

through an N-node quantum network in a highly-entangled box-cluster state or

an arbitrary finite number N and applicable to arbitrary size of modules. The
protocol based on a box-cluster state is implemented on a 14-qubit IBM quantum

that the elements on real devices required for the networking teleportation
process are all qualified for achieving teleportation task, we quantify
quantum-mechanical processes using a generic classical-process model through
which any classical strategies of mimicry of teleportation can be ruled out.
From the viewpoint of achieving a genuinely quantum-mechanical process, the
present work provides a novel toolbox consisting of the networking
teleportation protocols and the criteria for identifying faithful teleportation

further improvements in the reliability of quantum-information processing.

the hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are risky to the intrinsic

the description of the global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold

criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second issue;
such approximation is also memory-saving. The manifold metric alignment is
exploited to be compatible with the embedding space. A theoretical error bound
is derived to facilitate the alignment. Extensive experiments have been

(SOC), is the sensitivity of the electrical resistance in magnetic systems to
the direction of spin magnetization. Although this phenomenon has been
experimentally reported for several nanoscale junctions, a clear understanding
of the physical mechanism behind it is still elusive. Here we discuss a novel
concept based on orbital symmetry considerations to attain a significant AMR of
up to 95\% for a broad class of $\pi$-type molecular spin-valves. It is
illustrated at the benzene-dithiolate molecule connected between two monoatomic
nickel electrodes. We find that SOC opens, via spin-flip events at the
ferromagnet-molecule interface, a new conduction channel, which is fully
blocked by symmetry without SOC. Importantly, the interplay between main and
new transport channels turns out to depend strongly on the magnetization
direction in the nickel electrodes due to the tilting of molecular orbital.
Moreover, due to multi-band quantum interference, appearing at the band edge of
nickel electrodes, a transmission drop is observed just above the Fermi energy.
Altogether, these effects lead to a significant AMR around the Fermi level,
which even changes a sign. Our theoretical understanding, corroborated in terms
of \textit{ab initio} calculations and simplified analytical models, reveals
the general principles for an efficient realization of AMR in molecule-based
spintronic devices.

Disagreement (MCSD) divergence is presented by aggregating the absolute margin

fully characterize the relations between any pair of multi-class scoring
hypotheses. By using MCSD as a measure of domain distance, we develop a new
domain adaptation bound for multi-class UDA; its data-dependent, probably

adversarial learning objectives to align conditional feature distributions
across source and target domains. Consequently, an algorithmic framework of
Multi-class Domain-adversarial learning Networks (McDalNets) is developed, and
its different instantiations via surrogate learning objectives either coincide

their practical effectiveness. Based on our identical theory for multi-class

model (with a square pulse protocol characterized by a time period $T$) is
known to exhibit transitions from dynamical regimes with long-time coherent

from a regime where the periodic drive leads to rapid thermalization, a random
drive, which consists of a random sequence of square pulses with period
$T+\alpha dT$, where $\alpha=\pm 1$ is a random number and $dT$ is the

quasi-classical approximation. By other words, we study the dynamics of a
quantum small anisotropy evolving on a de Sitter background and in the presence
of a kinetic term of the inflaton field. We demonstrate that the quantum
anisotropy exponentially decays during the Universe expansion, approaching a
finite and small value. This result suggests that the quantum isotropization of
the Universe during a de Sitter phase is much weaker than the corresponding
classical evolution, favouring the survival of certain degree of anisotropy to
the de Sitter phase. Finally we analyze the case when also the scalar field is
considered as quantum variable, by showing how its variance naturally spreads
because of no potential term significantly affects its dynamics. This behaviour
results to be different from the anisotropy which is subjected to the potential
coming out from the spatial curvature.

Earth transit by tracing the solar spectrum during the total lunar eclipse of
January 21, 2019. Time series spectra of the Tycho crater were taken with the
Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) at the Large
Binocular Telescope (LBT) in its polarimetric mode in Stokes IQUV at a spectral
resolution of 130000 (0.06 \AA). In particular, the spectra cover the red parts
of the optical spectrum between 7419-9067 \AA . The spectrograph's exposure
meter was used to obtain a light curve of the lunar eclipse. The brightness of
the Moon dimmed by 10.75 mag during umbral eclipse. We found both branches of
the O$_2$ A-band almost completely saturated as well as a strong increase of
H$_2$O absorption during totality. The deep penumbral spectra show significant
excess absorption from the NaI 5890 \AA doublet, the CaII infrared triplet
around 8600 \AA, and the KI line at 7699 \AA in addition to several
hyper-fine-structure lines of MnI and even from BaII. The detections of the
latter two elements are likely due to an untypical solar center-to-limb effect
rather than Earth's atmosphere. The absorption in CaII and KI remained visible
throughout umbral eclipse. A small continuum polarization of the O$_2$ A-band
of 0.12\% during umbral eclipse was detected at 6.3$\sigma$. No line
polarization of the O$_2$ A-band, or any other spectral-line feature, is
detected outside nor inside eclipse. It places an upper limit of $\approx$0.2\%
on the degree of line polarization during transmission through Earth's
atmosphere and magnetosphere.

variation, which causes difficulties in anatomical structure learning and
consistent skin lesion delineation. In this paper, we propose a novel
bi-directional dermoscopic feature learning (biDFL) framework to model the
complex correlation between skin lesions and their informative context. By
controlling feature information passing through two complementary directions, a
substantially rich and discriminative feature representation is achieved.
Specifically, we place biDFL module on the top of a CNN network to enhance
high-level parsing performance. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale
consistent decision fusion (mCDF) that is capable of selectively focusing on
the informative decisions generated from multiple classification layers. By
analysis of the consistency of the decision at each position, mCDF
automatically adjusts the reliability of decisions and thus allows a more
insightful skin lesion delineation. The comprehensive experimental results show
the effectiveness of the proposed method on skin lesion segmentation, achieving
state-of-the-art performance consistently on two publicly available dermoscopic

compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects.
Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important
loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout
machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem
and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular.
However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain
a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down first-order methods to
minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In
this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this
problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in
the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and
optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from
samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing
so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that
this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of
Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the
performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data.

models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques
have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce
computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs
which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their
lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural
network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our
experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes,
making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level
libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer,
based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and
CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent
choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a
reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial
size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2x slowdown. On
the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves
the intended results, with performance speedups of 3x with cuDNN and above 10x
with Arm Compute Library and TVM. Our findings expose the need for
hardware-instructed neural network pruning.

permeability in a horizontal magnetic field is considered in the framework of a
one-dimensional weakly nonlinear model. In the limit of a strong magnetic
field, the surface waves under study can propagate without distortions along or
against the direction of external field, i.e., similar to Alfv\'en waves in a
perfectly conducting fluid. The interaction of counter-propagating nonlinear
waves leads to the development of wave turbulence on the surface of the liquid.
The computational data show that the spectrum of turbulence is divided into two
parts: a low-frequency dispersionless region, where the magnetic forces
dominate and a high-frequency dispersive one, in which the influence of
capillary forces becomes significant. In the first region, the spectrum of the
surface elevation has the same exponent in $k$ and $\omega$ domains and its
value is close to $-3.5$, what is in a good agreement with the estimation
obtained from the dimensional analysis of the weak turbulence spectra. At the
high frequencies, the computed spatial spectrum of the surface waves is close
to $k^{-5/2}$ which corresponds to $\omega^{-5/3}$ in terms of the frequency.
This spectrum does not coincide with the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum obtained
for pure capillary waves. A possible explanation of this fact is in the
influence of coherent structures (like shock waves) usually arising in media
with weak dispersion.

destined to multiple WIT users by exploiting the power-domain NOMA, while WPT
users are capable of harvesting the energy carried by the superposition
symbols. In order to maximise the amount of energy transferred to the WPT
users, we propose a joint design of the energy interleaver and the
constellation rotation based modulator in the symbol-block level by
constructively superimposing the symbols destined to the WIT users in the power
domain. Furthermore, a transmit power allocation scheme is proposed to
guarantee the symbol-error-ratio (SER) of all the WIT users. By considering the
sensitivity of practical energy harvesters, the simulation results demonstrate
that our scheme is capable of substantially increasing the WPT performance
without any remarkable degradation of the WIT performance.

stars on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical
simulations of a turbulent cloud impinged by a plane-parallel ionization front.
We find that the ionizing radiation forms pillars of neutral gas reminiscent of
those seen in observations. We quantify the driving mode of the turbulence in
the neutral gas by calculating the driving parameter $b$, which is
characterised by the relation $\sigma_s^2 = \ln({1+b^2\mathcal{M}^2})$ between
the variance of the logarithmic density contrast $\sigma_s^2$ (where $s =
\ln({\rho/\rho_0})$ with the gas density $\rho$ and its average $\rho_0$), and
the turbulent Mach number $\mathcal{M}$. Previous works have shown that
$b\sim1/3$ indicates solenoidal (divergence-free) driving and $b\sim1$
indicates compressive (curl-free) driving, with $b\sim1$ producing up to ten
times higher star formation rates than $b\sim1/3$. The time variation of $b$ in
our study allows us to infer that ionizing radiation is inherently a
compressive turbulence driving source, with a time-averaged $b\sim 0.76 \pm
0.08$. We also investigate the value of $b$ of the pillars, where star
formation is expected to occur, and find that the pillars are characterised by
a natural mixture of both solenoidal and compressive turbulent modes
($b\sim0.4$) when they form, and later evolve into a more compressive turbulent
state with $b\sim0.5$--$0.6$. A virial parameter analysis of the pillar regions
supports this conclusion. This indicates that ionizing radiation from massive

compressive turbulent gas in the pillars.

with zero \emph{training error}. Even after memorization, the \emph{training
loss} continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test
performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid
zero training loss, it is hard to tune their hyperparameters in order to
maintain a fixed/preset level of training loss. We propose a direct solution
called \emph{flooding} that intentionally prevents further reduction of the
training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the
\emph{flood level}. Our approach makes the loss float around the flood level by
doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the
training loss is below the flood level. This can be implemented with one line
of code and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers.
With flooding, the model will continue to ""random walk"" with the same non-zero
training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss
landscape that leads to better generalization. We experimentally show that
flooding improves performance and, as a byproduct, induces a double descent

measure the process $pp\to\nu X$ at the LHC and search for feebly interacting
particles (FIPs) in an unexplored domain. The TI18 tunnel has been identified
as a suitable site to perform these measurements due to very low
machine-induced background. The detector will be off-axis with respect to the
ATLAS interaction point (IP1) and, given the pseudo-rapidity range accessible,
the corresponding neutrinos will mostly come from charm decays: the proposed
experiment will thus make the first test of the heavy flavour production in a
pseudo-rapidity range that is not accessible by the current LHC detectors. In
order to efficiently reconstruct neutrino interactions and identify their
flavour, the detector will combine in the target region nuclear emulsion
technology with scintillating fibre tracking layers and it will adopt a muon
identification system based on scintillating bars that will also play the role
of a hadronic calorimeter. The time of flight measurement will be achieved
thanks to a dedicated timing detector. The detector will be a small-scale
prototype of the scattering and neutrino detector (SND) of the SHiP experiment:
the operation of this detector will provide an important test of the neutrino
reconstruction in a high occupancy environment.

the homogeneous-local-spin-orientation approximation, that is with
unidirectional local magnetization. By analytically calculating the exact
effective dipole-dipole interaction, we derive a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation for the dissipative condensate magnetization dynamics, and show how it
leads to the Stoner-Wohlfarth model of a uni-axial ferro-magnetic particle,
where the latter model determines the stable magnetization patterns and
hysteresis curves for switching between them. For an external magnetic field
pointing along the axial, long direction, we analytically solve the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The solution explicitly demonstrates that the
magnetic dipole-dipole interaction {\it accelerates} the dissipative dynamics
of the magnetic moment distribution and the associated dephasing of the
magnetic moment direction. Under suitable conditions, dephasing of the
magnetization direction due to dipole-dipole interactions occurs within time
scales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the lifetime of currently
experimentally realized dipolar spinor condensates, e.g., produced with the
large magnetic-dipole-moment atoms ${}^{166} \textrm{Er}$. This enables
experimental access to the dissipation parameter $\Gamma$ in the
Gross-Pitaevski\v\i~mean-field equation, for a system currently lacking a
complete quantum kinetic treatment of dissipative processes and, in particular,
an experimental check of the commonly used assumption that $\Gamma$ is a single
scalar independent of spin indices.

merging the frameworks of generalized sampling and functional principal

driven approach, which models the function of interest as a realization of a
random field and leverages a training set of observations generated via the
same underlying random process. We study the performance of the resulting
estimation procedure and show that high-resolution recovery is indeed possible
provided appropriate low-rank and angle conditions hold and provided the
training set is sufficiently large relative to the desired resolution.
Moreover, we show that the size of the training set can be reduced by
leveraging sparse representations of the functional principal components.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction procedure is
illustrated by various numerical examples.

medical image analysis and in particular for computational pathology
applications. We propose a framework to encode the geometric structure of the
special Euclidean motion group SE(2) in convolutional networks to yield
translation and rotation equivariance via the introduction of SE(2)-group
convolution layers. This structure enables models to learn feature
representations with a discretized orientation dimension that guarantees that
their outputs are invariant under a discrete set of rotations. Conventional
approaches for rotation invariance rely mostly on data augmentation, but this
does not guarantee the robustness of the output when the input is rotated. At
that, trained conventional CNNs may require test-time rotation augmentation to
reach their full capability. This study is focused on histopathology image
analysis applications for which it is desirable that the arbitrary global
orientation information of the imaged tissues is not captured by the machine
learning models. The proposed framework is evaluated on three different
histopathology image analysis tasks (mitosis detection, nuclei segmentation and
tumor classification). We present a comparative analysis for each problem and
show that consistent increase of performances can be achieved when using the
proposed framework.

can apply methods devised in preceding papers, but since we loose control on
higher order derivatives of $h$ we are forced to rework the bilinear method for
wave packets that are only slowly decaying. Another problem lies in the passage

originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the
stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal
structure, mass ejections, space-weather conditions around the planets (Schwenn
2006). Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have only detected
a single active flare-star (Lynch et al. 2017) that is not representative of
the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency
radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151--- a member of the most common
stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics
of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions (Zarka
1998) (e.g. Jupiter's decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure
dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show
that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of
mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to
main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio
emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151's slow rotation, but can originate in a
sub-Alfv\'{e}nic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period
exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations
(Zarka 2007; Lanza 2009; Saur et al. 2013; Turnpenney et al. 2018) for

10m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Low Resolution Spectrograph-2 (LRS2) at
McDonald Observatory. We apply the SYN++ code to model the spectra taken at -4
days, +5 days and +29 days from maximum light. We examine the chemical
evolution and ejecta composition of the SLSN by identifying the elements and
ionization states in its spectra. Our analysis confirms that SN 2019neq is a
fast evolving SLSN-I. We derive the number density of each ionization state at
the epoch of the three observations. Finally, we give constraints on the lower

programming models have been devised to approximate the relationship between
cell features and tumour malignancy. However, these models are less capable in
handling non-linear correlations. Neural networks instead are powerful in
processing complex non-linear correlations. It is thus certainly beneficial to
approach this cancer diagnosis problem with a model based on neural network.
Particularly, introducing bias to neural network training process is deemed as
an important means to increase training efficiency. Out of a number of popular
proposed methods for introducing artificial bias, Bimodal Distribution Removal
(BDR) presents ideal efficiency improvement results and fair simplicity in
implementation. However, this paper examines the effectiveness of BDR against
the target cancer diagnosis classification problem and shows that BDR process
in fact negatively impacts classification performance. In addition, this paper
also explores genetic algorithm as an efficient tool for feature selection and

main results are that for such an SFT, a locally legal pattern of convex shape

Our approach to convexity is axiomatic, and only requires an abstract convex

different devices have various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, ranging

maximizing network energy efficiency (EE) and guaranteeing different QoS

interesting for several reasons, including the long-term dynamical evolution of
few-body systems. Although the secular evolution of triples and quadruples has
been explored before, a systematic study of the systems in the MSC including
also quintuples and sextuples has not been carried out. Here, we explore the
main-sequence (MS) evolution of stars from the MSC based on approximately
2x10^5 secular dynamical integrations. We estimate statistical probabilities
for strong interactions during the MS such as tidal evolution and mass
transfer, and the onset of dynamical instability. Depending on the assumed
model for the unknown orbital elements, we find that the fraction of
noninteracting systems is largest for triples (~0.9), and decreases to ~0.6-0.8
for sextuples. The fraction of strong interactions increases from ~0.1 to ~0.2
from triples to sextuples, and the fraction of dynamically unstable systems
increases from ~0.001 to ~0.1-0.2. The larger fractions of strong interactions
and dynamical instability in systems with increasing multiplicity can be
attributed to increasingly complex secular evolution in these systems. Our
results indicate that a significant fraction of high-multiplicity systems
interact or become dynamically unstable already during the MS, with an
increasing importance as the number of stars increases.

Majorana fermions. A relation between these two phenomena can be derived once
the mechanism of neutrino mass generation is specified. We first derive the
constraints on the Majorana phases by minimising the effective neutrino mass in
neutrinoless double beta decay with respect to the smallest mass among the
light neutrinos. Given these phases, we derive a lower bound on $M_{1}$ (the
mass of the lightest of the heavy neutrinos) in the framework of Type-I seesaw
mechanism, subject to the constraint that the CP asymmetry required for
adequate leptogenesis is larger than $10^{-8}$. We find that $M_{1} \geq
10^{10}\,(10^{9})$ GeV for the case of Normal (Inverted) hierarchy. We extend
our analysis to the case when one of the heavy neutrinos decouples (two right
handed neutrino models). In this case we find $M_{1} \geq 10^{10}\,(10^{11})$
GeV for the case of Normal (Inverted) hierarchy.

form of compositionality. In interface theory and model-based testing with
inputs and outputs, conjunctive operators have been introduced: the behaviour
allowed by composed specification s1 $\wedge$ s2 is the behaviour allowed by
both partial models s1 and s2. The models at hand are non-deterministic
interface automata, but the interaction between non-determinism and conjunction
is not yet well understood. On the other hand, in the theory of alternating
automata, conjunction and non-determinism are core aspects. Alternating
automata have not been considered in the context of inputs and outputs, making
them less suitable for modelling software interfaces. In this paper, we combine
the two modelling paradigms to define alternating interface automata (AIA). We
equip these automata with an observational, trace-based semantics, and define
testers, to establish correctness of black-box interfaces with respect to an
AIA specification.

unprecedented up-close imaging of a small Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)
propagating in the forming slow solar wind. The CME originated as a cavity
imaged in extreme ultraviolet that moved very slowly ($<50$ km/s) to the 3-5
solar radii (R$_\odot$) where it then accelerated to supersonic speeds. We
present a new model of an erupting Flux Rope (FR) that computes the forces
acting on its expansion with a computation of its internal magnetic field in
three dimensions. The latter is accomplished by solving the Grad-Shafranov
equation inside two-dimensional cross sections of the FR. We use this model to
interpret the kinematic evolution and morphology of the CME imaged by PSP. We
investigate the relative role of toroidal forces, momentum coupling, and
buoyancy for different assumptions on the initial properties of the CME. The
best agreement between the dynamic evolution of the observed and simulated FR
is obtained by modeling the two-phase eruption process as the result of two
episodes of poloidal flux injection. Each episode, possibly induced by magnetic
reconnection, boosted the toroidal forces accelerating the FR out of the
corona. We also find that the drag induced by the accelerating solar wind could
account for about half of the acceleration experienced by the FR. We use the
model to interpret the presence of a small dark cavity, clearly imaged by PSP
deep inside the CME, as a low-density region dominated by its strong axial
magnetic fields.

as well as for nonlinear models and/or models with discrete data. For these
complex settings, we propose to use a general simulation-based approach and
show that the resulting estimator has a bias of order $\mathcal{O}(0)$, hence
providing an asymptotically optimal bias reduction. It is based on an initial
estimator that can be slightly asymptotically biased, making the approach very
generally applicable. This is particularly relevant when classical estimators,
such as the maximum likelihood estimator, can only be (numerically)
approximated. We show that the iterative bootstrap of Kuk (1995) provides a
computationally efficient approach to compute this bias reduced estimator. We
illustrate our theoretical results in simulation studies for which we develop
new bias reduced estimators for the logistic regression, with and without
random effects. These estimators enjoy additional properties such as robustness

  The first, like [26], uses a weak common coin (i.e. one that can return
different values at different processes with a constant probability) to ensure
termination. The algorithm consists of $5$ to $7$ message broadcasts per round.
An optimization is described that reduces this to $4$ to $5$ broadcasts per

cohesive forces. The flow behavior of powders depends on the flow states and
stress and is therefore difficult to measure/quantify with only one experiment.
In this study, the most commonly used characterization tests that cover a wide
range of states are compared: (static, free surface) angle of repose, the
(quasi-static, confined) ring shear steady state angle of internal friction,
and the (dynamic, free surface) rotating drum flow angle are considered for
free flowing, moderately and strongly cohesive limestone powders. The free
flowing powder gives good agreement among all different situations (devices),
while the moderately and strongly cohesive powders behave more interestingly.
Starting from the flow angle in the rotating drum and going slower, one can
extrapolate to the limit of zero rotation rate, but then observes that the
angle of repose measured from the heap is considerably larger, possibly due to
its special history. When we stretch the ring shear test to its lowest
confining stress limit, the steady state angle of internal friction of the
cohesive powder coincides with the flow angle (at free surface) in the zero

is observed as reported here for the first time. Consequently, for certain
intervals of $Ro$ and $\lambda$, energy is no longer accumulated at arbitrarily
large scales, rather it stops at some characteristic intermediate length-scales
from where it is then redistributed forward in Fourier space, leading to a
flux-loop mechanism where the flow is out of equilibrium with vanishing net
flux, and non-vanishing heterochiral and homochiral sub-fluxes. The system is
further characterized by the presence of metastability and critical slowing

in the entropy-pressure $(S,P)$-plane (or equivalently in the
temperature-volume ($T,V$)-plane). Analysis of $R$ empirically reveals that
dark energy parameterized by $\alpha$, significantly alters the dominant
interactions of neutral, charged and slowly rotating black hole
microstructures. In the Schwarzschild-AdS case: black holes smaller than a
certain size continue to have attractive interactions whereas larger black
holes are completely dominated by repulsive interactions which arise to due
dark energy. For charged or rotating AdS black holes with quintessence, $R$ can
change sign at multiple points depending upon the relation between $\alpha$ and
charge $q$ or angular momentum $J$. In particular, above a threshold value of
$\alpha$, $R$ is never negative at all, suggesting heuristically that the
repulsive interactions due to quintessence are long ranged as opposed to the
previously known short ranged repulsion in charged AdS black holes. A mean
field interaction potential is proposed whose extrema effectively capture the

built from a single crystal in various orientations. Previous work gave a
complete characterization for crystals with orthotropic symmetry. Specifically,
bounds were derived separately on the effective bulk and shear moduli, thus
confining the effective moduli to lie within a rectangle in the (bulk, shear)
plane. It was established that every point in this rectangle could be realized
by an appropriate hierarchical laminate microgeometry, with the crystal taking
different orientations in the layers, and the layers themselves being in
different orientations. The bounds are easily extended to crystals with no
special symmetry, but the path to constructing microgeometries that achieve
every point in the rectangle defined by the bounds is considerably more
difficult. We show that the two corners of the box having minimum bulk modulus
are always attained by hierarchical laminates. For the other two corners we
present algorithms for generating hierarchical laminates that attain them.
Numerical evidence strongly suggests that the corner having maximum bulk and
maximum shear modulus is always attained. For the remaining corner, with
maximum bulk modulus and minimum shear modulus, it is not yet clear whether the
algorithm always succeeds, and hence whether all points in the rectangle are
always attained. The microstructures we use are hierarchical laminate
geometries that at their core have a self-similar microstructure, in the sense
that the microstructure on one length scale is a rotation and rescaling of that
on a smaller length scale.

11-year solar cycle is one of the manifestations of solar magnetic activity.
There is a strong evidence that the SSI variability has an effect on the
Earth's atmosphere. The faster rotation of the Sun in the past lead to a more
vigorous action of solar dynamo and thus potentially to larger amplitude of the
SSI variability on the timescale of the solar activity cycle. This could led to
a stronger response of the Earth's atmosphere as well as other solar system
planets' atmospheres to the solar activity cycle. We calculate the amplitude of
the SSI and TSI variability over the course of the solar activity cycle as a
function of solar age. We employ the relationship between the stellar magnetic
activity and the age based on observations of solar twins. Using this relation
we reconstruct solar magnetic activity and the corresponding solar disk area
coverages by magnetic features (i.e. spots and faculae) over the last four
billion years. These disk coverages are then used to calculate the amplitude of
the solar-cycle SSI variability as a function of wavelength and solar age. Our
calculations show that the young Sun was significantly more variable than the
present Sun. The amplitude of the solar-cycle Total Solar Irradiance (TSI)
variability of the 600 Myr old Sun was about 10 times larger than that of the
present Sun. Furthermore, the variability of the young Sun was spot-dominated
(the Sun being brighter at the activity minimum than in the maximum), i.e. the
Sun was overall brighter at activity minima than at maxima. The amplitude of
the TSI variability decreased with solar age until it reached a minimum value
at 2.8 Gyr. After this point, the TSI variability is faculae-dominated (the Sun
is brighter at the activity maximum) and its amplitude increases with age.

defined over k, we consider a variant of Linnik's problem for abelian varieties
that asks for an upper bound on the least norm of a prime whose normalized
Frobenius trace lies in a given interval. Second, for an elliptic curve defined
over k with complex multiplication, we determine (up to multiplication by a
nonzero constant) the asymptotic number of primes whose Frobenius trace attain
the integral part of the Hasse-Weil bound. Third, for a pair of abelian
varieties defined over k with no common factors up to k-isogeny, we find an
upper bound on the least norm of a prime at which the respective Frobenius
traces have opposite sign.

improve convergence and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing

hyperbolic model for two-phase flow with surface tension. In the model, the
tracking of phase boundaries is achieved by using a vector interface field,
rather than a scalar tracer, so that the surface-force stress tensor can be
expressed as an algebraic function of the state variables, without requiring
the computation of gradients of the tracer. An interesting and important
feature of the model is that this interface field obeys a curl involution
constraint, that is, the vector field is required to be curl-free at all times.
  The proposed modifications are intended to restore the strong hyperbolicity
of the model, and are closely related to divergence-preserving numerical
approaches developed in the field of numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The
first strategy is based on the theory of Symmetric Hyperbolic and
Thermodynamically Compatible (SHTC) systems forwarded by Godunov in the 60s and
70s and yields a modified system of governing equations which includes some
symmetrisation terms, in analogy to the approach adopted later by Powell et al
for the ideal MHD equations. The second technique is an extension of the
hyperbolic Generalized Lagrangian Multiplier (GLM) divergence cleaning
approach, forwarded by Munz et al in applications to the Maxwell and MHD
equations.
  We solve the resulting nonconservative hyperbolic PDE systems with high order
ADER Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with a posteriori Finite Volume
subcell limiting and carry out a set of numerical tests concerning flows
dominated by surface tension as well as shock-driven flows. We also provide a
new exact solution to the equations, show convergence of the schemes for orders
of accuracy up to ten in space and time, and investigate the role of
hyperbolicity and of curl constraints in the long-term stability of the
computations.

non-invasive approach for estimation of intra-voxel tissue microarchitecture

A well-known advanced method for reconstruction of white matter microstructure
that uses multi-shell data is multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution
(MT-CSD). MT-CSD substantially improves the resolution of intra-voxel structure
over the traditional single shell version, constrained spherical deconvolution
(CSD). Herein, we explore the possibility of using deep learning on single
shell data (using the b=1000 s/mm2 from the Human Connectome Project (HCP)) to
estimate the information content captured by 8th order MT-CSD using the full
three shell data (b=1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm2 from HCP). Briefly, we examine
two network architectures: 1.) Sequential network of fully connected dense
layers with a residual block in the middle (ResDNN), 2.) Patch based
convolutional neural network with a residual block (ResCNN). For both networks
an additional output block for estimation of voxel fraction was used with a
modified loss function. Each approach was compared against the baseline of
using MT-CSD on all data on 15 subjects from the HCP divided into 5 training, 2
validation, and 8 testing subjects with a total of 6.7 million voxels. The
fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) can be recovered with high

  Fault Slip during Hydraulic Fracturing",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hydraulic fracturing increases reservoir permeability by opening fractures
and triggering slip on natural fractures and faults. While seismic slip of
small faults or fault patches is detectable as microseismic events, the role of
aseismic slip is poorly understood. From a modeling standpoint, geomechanical
analysis using the Coulomb criterion can determine if faults slip but not
whether slip is seismic or aseismic. Here we propose a computational
methodology to predict fault slip, and whether slip is seismic or aseismic,
using rate-and-state friction. To avoid computational costs associated with
resolving small faults, we use the spring-slider idealization that treats
faults as points. Interaction between faults is neglected. The method is
applied to study fault slip from a hydraulic fracture that grows past a fault,
without intersecting it. We represent the hydraulic fracture stressing using an
asymptotic expansion of stresses around the tip of a tensile crack. We
investigate the effect of fault length, orientation, and distance from the
hydraulic fracture. For velocity-weakening faults with stiffness smaller than a
critical stiffness, slip is seismic, whereas faults with stiffness greater than
the critical stiffness slip aseismically. Furthermore, we compare the
spring-slider idealization with a finite element analysis that resolves
spatially variable slip. The spring-slider idealization provides reasonably
accurate predictions of moment and even moment-rate history, especially for
faults having stiffness close to or larger than the critical stiffness.
Differences appear for large faults where rupture propagation is important,
though differences might still be negligible for many applications.

of V-formation in a flock of birds as one of Model Predictive Control (MPC).
The V-formation-MPC marriage can be understood in terms of the problem of
synthesizing an optimal plan for a continuous-space and continuous-time Markov
decision process (MDP), where the goal is to reach a target state that
minimizes a given cost function. First, we consider ARES, an approximation
algorithm for generating optimal plans (action sequences) that take an initial
state of an MDP to a state whose cost is below a specified (convergence)
threshold. ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both
the receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting,
the length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at
least one particle reaches a next-level state. ARES can alternatively be viewed
as a model-predictive control (MPC) algorithm that utilizes an adaptive
receding horizon, aka Adaptive MPC (AMPC). We next present Distributed AMPC
(DAMPC), a distributed version of AMPC that works with local neighborhoods. We
introduce adaptive neighborhood resizing, whereby the neighborhood size is
determined by the cost-based Lyapunov function evaluated over a global system
state. Our experiments show that DAMPC can perform almost as well as
centralized AMPC, while using only local information and a form of distributed
consensus in each time step. Finally, inspired by security attacks on
cyber-physical systems, we introduce controller-attacker games (CAG), where two
players, a controller and an attacker, have antagonistic objectives. We
formulate a special case of CAG called V-formation games, where the attacker's
goal is to prevent the controller from attaining V-formation. We demonstrate
how adaptation in the design of the controller helps in overcoming certain
attacks.

patients, especially depression patients, has grown rapidly and become a

common practice of depression diagnosis is based on interviews and clinical

time-consuming. One important reason is due to the lack of physiological
indicators for mental disorders. With the rising of tools such as data mining

quality physiological data for mental disorder patients are hard to acquire. We
present a multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. The dataset
includes EEG and audio data from clinically depressed patients and matching
normal controls. All our patients were carefully diagnosed and selected by
professional psychiatrists in hospitals. The EEG dataset includes not only data
collected using traditional 128-electrodes mounted elastic cap, but also a
novel wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive applications. The
128-electrodes EEG signals of 53 subjects were recorded as both in resting
state and under stimulation; the 3-electrode EEG signals of 55 subjects were
recorded in resting state; the audio data of 52 subjects were recorded during

Indeed, convolution is a signal operation that are defined on euclidean spaces.

Wightman framework of relativistic quantum field theories which incorporates a

ETCR are not justified in general (because the interacting fields cannot in
general be restricted to sharp times, as is known from model studies), the
condition $Z=0$ is not of general validity in interacting theories. We
conjecture that it characterizes either unstable (composite) particles or the
charge-carrying particles, which become infraparticles in the presence of
massless particles. In the case of QED, such ""dressed"" electrons are not

positivity-preserving, energy dissipating, and implicit finite difference
schemes for solving the multi-dimensional PNP equations with multiple ionic
species. A central-differencing discretization based on harmonic-mean
approximations is employed for the Nernst--Planck (NP) equations. The backward
Euler discretization in time is employed to derive a fully implicit nonlinear
system, which is efficiently solved by a newly proposed Newton's method. The
improved computational efficiency of the Newton's method originates from the
usage of the electrostatic potential as the iteration variable, rather than the
unknowns of the nonlinear system that involves both the potential and
concentration of multiple ionic species. Numerical analysis proves that the
numerical schemes respect three desired analytical properties (conservation,
positivity preserving, and energy dissipation) fully discretely. Based on
advantages brought by the harmonic-mean approximations, we are able to
establish estimate on the upper bound of condition numbers of coefficient
matrices in linear systems that are solved iteratively. The solvability and
stability of the linearized problem in the Newton's method are rigorously
established as well. Numerical tests are performed to confirm the anticipated
numerical accuracy, computational efficiency, and structure-preserving

further efficiency improvement. Finally, the proposed numerical approaches are

ensemble approaches were developed to overcome well-known problems of classical
clustering approaches, that each rely on a different theoretical model and can
thus identify in the data space only clusters corresponding to this model.
Clustering ensemble approaches combine multiple clustering results, each from a
different algorithmic configuration, for generating more robust consensus
clusters corresponding to agreements between initial clusters. We present a new
clustering ensemble multi-objective optimization-based framework developed for
analyzing Amadeus customer search data and improve personalized
recommendations. This framework optimizes diversity in the clustering ensemble
search space and automatically determines an appropriate number of clusters
without requiring user's input. Experimental results compare the efficiency of
this approach with other existing approaches on Amadeus customer search data in
terms of internal (Adjusted Rand Index) and external (Amadeus business metric)
validations.

solution of fractional order nonlocal plates under both Mindlin and Kirchoff
formulations. By employing consistent definitions for fractional-order
kinematic relations, the governing equations and the associated boundary
conditions are derived based on variational principles. Remarkably, the
fractional-order nonlocal model gives rise to a self-adjoint and
positive-definite system that accepts a unique solution. Further, owing to the
difficulty in obtaining analytical solutions to this fractional-order
differ-integral problem, a 2D finite element model for the fractional-order
governing equations is presented. Following a thorough validation with
benchmark problems, the 2D fractional finite element model is used to study the
static as well as the free dynamic response of fractional-order plates subject
to various loading and boundary conditions. It is established that the
fractional-order nonlocality leads to a reduction in the stiffness of the plate
structure thereby increasing the displacements and reducing the natural
frequency of vibration of the plates. Further, it is seen that the effect of
nonlocality is stronger on the higher modes of vibration when compared to the
fundamental mode. These effects of the fractional-order nonlocality are noted
irrespective of the nature of the boundary conditions. More specifically, the
fractional-order model of nonlocal plates is free from boundary effects that
lead to paradoxical predictions such as hardening and absence of nonlocal
effects in classical integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity. This
consistency in the predictions is a result of the well-posed nature of the
fractional-order governing equations that accept a unique solution.

subtractive approach. We primarily target multi-axis CNC milling approaches but
the method should generalize to other subtractive methods as well. To this end,
we take as user input: the radius of curvature of the tool bit, a coarse model
of the tool head and optionally a set of milling directions. This allows us to
enforce the following manufacturability conditions: 1) surface smoothness such
that the radius of curvature of the part does not exceed the milling bit
radius, 2) orientation such that every part of the surface to be milled is
visible from at least one milling direction, 3) accessibility such that every
surface patch can be reached by the tool bit without interference with the tool
or head mount. We will show how to efficiently enforce the constraint during
level set-based topology optimization modifying the advection velocity such
that at each iteration the topology optimization maintains a descent
optimization direction and does not violate any of the manufacturability
conditions. This approach models the actual subtractive process by carving away
material accessible to the machine at each iteration until a local optimum is
achieved.

e-commerce and applications. Beside customers' purchase behavior analysis,
there is also attempt to analyze the customer behavior in relation to the
quality of web or application design. In general, clickstream data can be
considered as a sequence of log events collected at different levels of web/app
usage. The analysis of clickstream data can be performed directly as sequence
analysis or by extracting features from sequences. In this work, we show how
representing and saving the sequences with their underlying graph structures
can induce a platform for customer behavior analysis. Our main idea is that
clickstream data containing sequences of actions of an application, are walks
of the corresponding finite state automaton (FSA) of that application. Our
hypothesis is that the customers of an application normally do not use all
possible walks through that FSA and the number of actual walks is much smaller
than total number of possible walks through the FSA. Sequences of such a walk
normally consist of a finite number of cycles on FSA graphs. Identifying and
matching these cycles in the classical sequence analysis is not straight
forward. We show that representing the sequences through their underlying graph
structures not only groups the sequences automatically but also provides a
compressed data representation of the original sequences.

Optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning, in particular, the effective learning

we propose a novel MDA framework to address these challenges. Specifically, we
design an end-to-end Multi-source Adversarial Domain Aggregation Network

semantic consistency while aligning towards the target at the pixel-level
cycle-consistently. Second, sub-domain aggregation discriminator and
cross-domain cycle discriminator are proposed to make different adapted domains
more closely aggregated. Finally, feature-level alignment is performed between
the aggregated domain and the target domain while training the task network.
For the segmentation adaptation, we further enforce category-level alignment
and incorporate context-aware generation, which constitutes MADAN+. We conduct
extensive MDA experiments on digit recognition, object classification, and
simulation-to-real semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate that the

attention for reconfigurable integrated nanophotonics. Here, we introduce a
microheater platform that employs optically transparent and electrically
conductive indium-tin-oxide (ITO) bridges for the fast and reversible
electrical switching of the GST phase between crystalline and amorphous states.
By the proper assignment of electrical pulses applied to the ITO microheater,
we show that our platform allows for the registration of virtually any
intermediate crystalline state into the GST film integrated on the top of the
designed microheaters. More importantly, we demonstrate the full reversibility
of the GST phase between amorphous and crystalline states. To show the
feasibility of using this hybrid GST/ITO platform for miniaturized integrated
nanophotonic structures, we integrate our designed microheaters into the arms
of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to realize electrically reconfigurable optical
phase shifters with orders of magnitude smaller footprints compared to existing
integrated photonic architectures. We show that the phase of optical signals
can be gradually shifted in multiple intermediate states using a structure that
can potentially be smaller than a single wavelength. We believe that our study
showcases the possibility of forming a whole new class of miniaturized
reconfigurable integrated nanophotonics using beyond-binary reconfiguration of
optical functionalities in hybrid PCM-photonic devices.

Many supervised and unsupervised approaches have been proposed in the past for
detecting and analyzing the sentiment of aspect terms. In this paper, a
graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for aspect term extraction is
proposed. In this approach, every identified token in the review document is
classified as aspect or non-aspect term from a small set of labeled tokens
using label spreading algorithm. The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) for graph
sparsification is employed in the proposed approach to make it more time and
memory efficient. The proposed work is further extended to determine the
polarity of the opinion words associated with the identified aspect terms in
review sentence to generate visual aspect-based summary of review documents.
The experimental study is conducted on benchmark and crawled datasets of
restaurant and laptop domains with varying value of labeled instances. The
results depict that the proposed approach could achieve good result in terms of
Precision, Recall and Accuracy with limited availability of labeled data.

ventilation. Among them, the Ionic liquids (ILs) as the relatively new
solvents, are known for their proven eco-friendly characteristics. In this
research, a comprehensive literature review was carried out to deliver an
insight into the ILs and the prediction models used for estimating the ammonia
solubility in ILs. Furthermore, a number of advanced machine learning methods,
i.e. multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a combination of particle swarm
optimization (PSO) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models are
used to estimate the solubility of ammonia in various ionic liquids. Affecting
parameters were molecular weight, critical temperature and pressure of ILs.
Furthermore, the salability is also predicted using the two-equation of states.
Down the line, some comparisons were drawn between experimental and modeling
results which is rarely done. The study shows that the equations of states are
not able estimate the solubility of ammonia accurately, by contrast, artificial
intelligence methods have produced promising results.
