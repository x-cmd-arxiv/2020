characterized by a critical strain amplitude $\gamma_c$ between an absorbing
state where particle trajectories are reversible and an active state where
trajectories are chaotic and diffusive. Repulsive non-hydrodynamic interactions
between ""colliding"" particles' surfaces have been proposed as a source of this
broken time reversal symmetry. A simple toy model called Random Organization
qualitatively reproduces the dynamical features of this transition. Random
Organization and other absorbing state models exhibit hyperuniformity, a strong
suppression of density fluctuations on long length-scales quantified by a
structure factor $S(q \rightarrow 0) \sim q^\alpha$ with $\alpha > 0$, at
criticality. Here we show experimentally that the particles in periodically
sheared suspensions organize into structures with anisotropic short-range order
but isotropic, long-range hyperuniform order when oscillatory shear amplitudes
approach $\gamma_c$.

ground base station (BS) is susceptible to adversarial jamming. In such
situations, it is important for the UAV to indicate a new channel to the BS.
This paper describes a method of creating spatial codes that map the chosen
channel to the motion and location of the UAVs in space, wherein the latter
physically traverses the space from a given so called ""constellation point'' to
another. These points create patterns in the sky, analogous to modulation
constellations in classical wireless communications, and are detected at the BS
through a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor. A constellation point
represents a distinct n-bit field mapped to a specific channel, allowing
simultaneous frequency switching at both ends without any RF transmissions. The
main contributions of this paper are: (i) We conduct experimental studies to
demonstrate how such constellations may be formed using COTS UAVs and mmWave
sensors, given realistic sensing errors and hovering vibrations, (ii) We
develop a theoretical framework that maps a desired constellation design to
error and band switching time, considering again practical UAV movement
limitations, and (iii) We experimentally demonstrate jamming resilient
communications and validate system goodput for links formed by UAV-mounted
software defined radios.

Monte Carlo Tree Search. We implement a Monte Carlo Tree Search planner and

modification or by controlling the hierarchical structures of surfaces. Here we
report a phenomenon whereby the wetting properties of vermiculite laminates are
controlled by the hydrated cations on the surface and in the interlamellar
space. We find that by exploiting this mechanism, vermiculite laminates can be
tuned from superhydrophillic to hydrophobic simply by exchanging the cations;
hydrophilicity decreases with increasing cation hydration free energy, except
for lithium. Lithium, which has a higher hydration free energy than potassium,
is found to provide a superhydrophilic surface due to its anomalous hydrated

demonstrate the potential application of superhydrophilic lithium exchanged

  Control, PMLR 120:761-770, 2020",,,"cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful
framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent
work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators
and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this
paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework -- what
we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one
objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric
will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective
mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t.~the likelihood of
the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on
a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the
realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not
necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate
models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control
performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective
mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead
predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation
highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require
further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial
method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training.
Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions
of research for addressing this issue.

of the hubs of the structural connectivity (in terms of degree strength) peaks
before the critical temperature, and can thus be considered as a precursor of a
critical transition. Conversely the greatest amount of synergy goes into
explaining the dynamics of more central nodes. We also find that the aging of
the structural connectivity is associated to significant changes in the
simulated dynamics: there are brain regions whose synergy decreases with age,
in particular the frontal pole, the Subcallosal area and the Supplementary
Motor area; these areas could then be more likely to show a decline in terms of
the capability to perform higher order computation (if structural connectivity
was the sole variable). On the other hand, several regions in the temporal
cortex show a positive correlation with age in the first 30 years of life, i.e.

The proper design of half adder results in no need to increase the intensity of
the input optical signal for the appearance of the nonlinear Kerr effect, which
leads to diverting the incoming light toward the desired output. The proposed
device consists of four optical waveguides and a defect in a square lattice
PhC. Two famous plane wave expansion and finite difference time domain methods
are used to study and analyze photonic band structure and light propagation
inside the PhC, respectively. The presented structure, the ON-OFF contrast
ratios for Sum and Carry, are 16dB and 14dB, respectively. Our simulation
results reveal the proposed half adder has a maximum delay time of 0.7 ps with
a total footprint of 158 um2. Due to very low delay time, high contrast ratio,
and small footprint that they are more crucial in modern optoelectronic
technologies, this structure can be used in the next generation of all-optical
high-speed central processing units.

sensors at different viewpoints. The acquired measurements are typically both
coarse in precision and corrupted by noise. To improve quality, previous works
denoise a synthesized 3D point cloud a posteriori after projecting the
imperfect depth data onto 3D space. Instead, we enhance depth measurements on
the sensed images a priori, exploiting inherent 3D geometric correlation across
views, before synthesizing a 3D point cloud from the improved measurements. By
enhancing closer to the actual sensing process, we benefit from optimization
targeting specifically the depth image formation model, before subsequent
processing steps that can further obscure measurement errors. Mathematically,
for each pixel row in a pair of rectified viewpoint depth images, we first
construct a graph reflecting inter-pixel similarities via metric learning using
data in previous enhanced rows. To optimize left and right viewpoint images
simultaneously, we write a non-linear mapping function from left pixel row to
the right based on 3D geometry relations. We formulate a MAP optimization
problem, which, after suitable linear approximations, results in an
unconstrained convex and differentiable objective, solvable using fast gradient
method (FGM). Experimental results show that our method noticeably outperforms
recent denoising algorithms that enhance after 3D point clouds are synthesized.

in the study of random networks, as an alternative indicator of the percolation
phase transition. We apply the proposed approach to the investigation of
real-world networks describing infrastructures (US power grid). Curiously,
although no notion of phase transition can be given for such networks, the
fractality of the median potential displays signatures of criticality. We also
show that standard techniques (such as the scaling features of the largest
connected component) do not detect any signature or remnant of criticality.

the sunspot. The IEF channels exhibit brightenings in the penumbra, where the
supersonic IEF descends to the photosphere causing shock fronts with localized
heating. We used an 1-hr time-series of spectroscopic observations of the
chromospheric spectral lines of CaIIIR at 854nm and H$\alpha$ at 656nm taken
with IBIS at the DST to investigate the temporal evolution of IEF channels.
Complementary information on the photospheric magnetic field was obtained from
observations with FIRS at 1083\nm and HMI. We find that individual IEF channels
are long-lived (10-60min) and only show minor changes in position and flow
speed during their life time. Initiation and termination of IEF channels takes
several minutes. The IEF channels with line-of-sight velocities of about 10km/s
show no lasting impact from transient or oscillatory phenomena with maximal
velocity amplitudes of only about 1km/s that run along them. We could not
detect any clear correlation of the location and evolution of IEF channels to
local magnetic field properties in the photosphere in the penumbra or moving
magnetic features in the sunspot moat. Our results support a picture of the IEF
as a field-aligned siphon flow along arched loops. From our data we cannot
determine if their evolution is controlled by events at the outer end in the
moat or at the inner end in the penumbra.

existence of imbalanced classes. When sample sizes of different classes are
imbalanced in training data, naively implementing a classification method often
leads to unsatisfactory prediction results on test data. Multiple resampling
techniques have been proposed to address the class imbalance issues. Yet, there
is no general guidance on when to use each technique. In this article, we
provide a paradigm-based review of the common resampling techniques for binary
classification under imbalanced class sizes. The paradigms we consider include
the classical paradigm that minimizes the overall classification error, the
cost-sensitive learning paradigm that minimizes a cost-adjusted weighted type I
and type II errors, and the Neyman-Pearson paradigm that minimizes the type II
error subject to a type I error constraint. Under each paradigm, we investigate
the combination of the resampling techniques and a few state-of-the-art
classification methods. For each pair of resampling techniques and
classification methods, we use simulation studies and a real data set on credit
card fraud to study the performance under different evaluation metrics. From
these extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate under each classification
paradigm, the complex dynamics among resampling techniques, base classification
methods, evaluation metrics, and imbalance ratios. We also summarize a few
takeaway messages regarding the choices of resampling techniques and base
classification methods, which could be helpful for practitioners.

FRB 180916.J0158+65. In a popular class of models, the fast radio bursts (FRBs)
are created by giant magnetic flares of a hyper-active magnetar driven by fast
ambipolar diffusion in the core. We point out that in this scenario the
magnetar is expected to precess freely with a period of hours to weeks. The
internal magnetic field $B\sim 10^{16}$G deforms the star, and magnetic flares
induce sudden changes in magnetic stresses. The resulting torques and
displacements of the principal axes of inertia are capable of pumping a
significant amplitude of precession. The anisotropy of the flaring FRB
activity, combined with precession, implies a strong periodic modulation of the
visible bursting rate. The ultra-strong field invoked in the magnetar model
provides: (1) energy for the frequent giant flares, (2) the high rate of
ambipolar diffusion, releasing the magnetic energy on the timescale $\sim
10^9$s, (3) the core temperature $T\approx 10^9$K, likely above the critical
temperature for neutron superfluidity, (4) strong magnetospheric torques, which
efficiently spin down the star, and (5) deformation with ellipticity $\epsilon>
10^{-6}$, much greater than the rotational deformation. These conditions result
in a precession with negligible viscous damping, and can explain the observed
16 day period in FRB 180916.J0158+65.

For systems with first neighbors exclusion (1NN), we confirm previous results

Exclusion up to second neighbors (2NN) lead the system to a two-step melting
process where, first, a high density columnar phase undergoes a first order
phase transition with non-standard scaling to a solid-like phase with short
range ordered domains and, then, to fluid-like configurations with no sign of a
second phase transition. 3NN exclusion, surprisingly, shows no phase transition
to an ordered phase as density is increased, staying disordered even to packing
fractions up to 0.98. The 4NN model undergoes a continuous phase transition
with critical exponents close to the 3-state Potts model. The 5NN system
undergoes two first order phase transitions, both with non-standard scaling.

phase transition for systems with exclusion regions further than 5NN based on

computing gain over the conventional processors. To investigate the feasibility
of the architecture, we examine non-idealities and their impact on the
performance. Specifically, we study the impact of failed cells due to the
initialization process of the resistive memory based cross-bar array. Unlike
the conventional memory array, individual memory elements cannot be rerouted
and, thus, may have a critical impact on model accuracy. We categorize the
possible failures and propose hardware implementation that minimizes
catastrophic failures. Such hardware optimization bounds the possible logical
value of the failed cells and gives us opportunities to compensate for the loss
of accuracy via off-line training. By introducing the random weight defects
during the training, we show that the model becomes more resilient on the
device initialization failures, therefore, less prone to degrade the inference
performance due to the failed devices. Our study sheds light on the hardware

nontrivial sign structure. We tackle this problem by proposing a neural network
architecture with a simple, explicit, and interpretable phase ansatz, which can
robustly represent such states and achieve state-of-the-art variational
energies for both conventional and frustrated antiferromagnets. In the latter
case, our approach uncovers low-energy states that exhibit the Marshall sign
rule and are therefore inconsistent with the expected ground state. Such states
are the likely cause of the obstruction for NQS-based variational Monte Carlo
to access the true ground states of these systems. We discuss the implications
of this observation and suggest potential strategies to overcome the problem.

sideways-expanding top-hat jet geometry and use the relatively large number of
measurements under the assumption that they represent a statistically unbiased
sample. This allows us to constrain the ratio between the maximum predicted
polarization and the measured one, which is an indicator of the geometry of the
magnetic field in the downstream region of the external shock. We find that the
measured polarization is substantially suppressed with respect to the maximum
possible for either a completely ordered magnetic field parallel to the shock
normal or to a field that is entirely contained in the shock plane. The
measured polarization is limited, on average, to between 25 and 30% of the
maximum theoretically possible value. This reduction requires the perpendicular
component of the magnetic field to be dominant in energy with respect to the
component parallel to the shock front, as expected for a shock generated and/or
shock compressed field. We find, however, that the data only marginally support
the assumption of a simple top-hat jet, pointing towards a more complex

distant from its birth radius for two reasons: either its orbit has become
eccentric through radial heating, which increases its radial action $J_R$
(`blurring'); or merely its angular momentum $L_z$ has changed and thereby its
guiding radius (`churning'). We know that radial orbit migration is strong in
the Galactic low-$\alpha$ disk and set out to quantify the relative importance
of these two effects, by devising and applying a parameterized model for the
distribution $p(L_z, J_R, \tau, \mathrm[Fe/H])$ in the stellar disk. This model
describes the orbit evolution for stars of age $\tau$ and metallicity [Fe/H],
presuming coeval stars were initially born on (near-)circular orbits, and with
a unique [Fe/H] at a given birth angular momentum and age. We fit this model to
APOGEE red clump stars, accounting for the complex selection function of the
survey. The best fit model implies changes of angular momentum of
$\sqrt{\langle \Delta L_z \rangle^2} \approx 619\,
\mathrm{kpc~km/s~}(\tau/\mathrm{6~Gyr})^{0.5}$, and changes of radial action as
$\sqrt{\langle \Delta J_R \rangle^2} \approx 63\, \mathrm{kpc~km/s~}

physics and engineering, many processes are modeled with non-differentiable
simulators with intractable likelihoods. Optimization of these forward models
is particularly challenging, especially when the simulator is stochastic. To
address such cases, we introduce the use of deep generative models to
iteratively approximate the simulator in local neighborhoods of the parameter
space. We demonstrate that these local surrogates can be used to approximate
the gradient of the simulator, and thus enable gradient-based optimization of
simulator parameters. In cases where the dependence of the simulator on the
parameter space is constrained to a low dimensional submanifold, we observe
that our method attains minima faster than baseline methods, including Bayesian
optimization, numerical optimization, and approaches using score function
gradient estimators.

hybrid-Lenstool combines a parametric approach to model the core of the

hybrid-Lenstool optimizes both strong- and weak-lensing constraints
simultaneously (Joint-Fit), providing a self-consistent reconstruction of the
cluster mass distribution on all scales. In order to demonstrate the
capabilities of the new algorithm, we tested it on a simulated cluster.
hybrid-Lenstool yields more accurate reconstructed mass distributions than the
former Sequential-Fit approach where the parametric and the non-parametric
models are optimized successively. Indeed, we show with the simulated cluster
that the mass density profile reconstructed with a Sequential-Fit deviates form
the input by $2-3\sigma$ at all scales while the Joint-Fit gives a profile that
is within $1-1.5\sigma$ of the true value. This gain in accuracy is
consequential for recovering mass distributions exploiting cluster lensing and
therefore for all applications of clusters as cosmological probes. Finally we
found that the Joint-Fit approach yields shallower slope of the inner density
profile than the Sequential-Fit approach, thus revealing possible biases in
previous lensing studies.

with an external light stimulus. These optically controlled molecules have been
used in the development of smart polymers, optical writing of grating films,
and even controllable in-vivo drug release. Being the simplest class of
photoswitches in terms of structure, azobenzenes have become the most
ubiquitous, well-characterized, and implemented organic molecular switch. Given
their predictable response, they are ideally suited to create an all-optically
controlled switch. However, fabricating a monolithic optical device comprised
solely from azobenzene while maintaining the photoswitching functionality is
challenging. In this work, we combine integrated photonics with optically
switchable organic molecules to create an optically controlled integrated
device. A silica toroidal resonant cavity is functionalized with a monolayer of
an azobenzene derivative. After functionalization, the loaded cavity Q is above
100,000. When 450 nm light is coupled into cavity resonance, the azobenzene
isomerizes from trans-isomer to cis-isomer, inducing a refractive index change.
Because the resonant wavelength of the cavity is governed by the index, the
resonant wavelength changes in parallel. At the probe wavelength of 1300 nm,
the wavelength shift is determined by the duration and intensity of the 450 nm
light and the density of azobenzene functional groups on the device surface,
providing multiple control mechanisms. Using this photoswitchable device,
resonance frequency tuning as far as sixty percent of the cavity free spectral
range in the near-IR is demonstrated. The kinetics of the tuning are in
agreement with spectroscopic and ellipsometry measurements coupled with finite
element method calculations.

Zoom-in Cluster Simulation, and the star formation rate (SFR) from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 10 to study how quickly star formation
of disk galaxies is quenched in cluster environments. We first confirm that
both simulated and observed galaxies are consistently distributed in phase
space. We then hypothesize that the TSI and SFR are causally connected; thus,
both the TSI and SFR of galaxies at each position of phase space can be
associated through abundance matching. Using a flexible model, we derive the
star formation history (SFH) of cluster galaxies that best reproduces the
relationship between the TSI and SFR at $z\sim 0.08$. According to this SFH, we
find that the galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ generally follow the
so-called ""delayed-then-rapid"" quenching pattern. Our main results are as
following: (i) Part of the quenching takes place outside clusters through mass
quenching and pre-processing. The e-folding timescale of this ""$ex\text{-}situ$
quenching phase"" is roughly 3 Gyr with a strong inverse mass dependence. (ii)
The pace of quenching is maintained roughly for 2 Gyr (""delay time"") during the
first crossing time into the cluster. During the delay time, quenching remains
gentle probably because gas loss happens primarily on hot and neutral gases.
(iii) Quenching becomes more dramatic (e-folding timescale of roughly 1 Gyr)
after delay time, probably because ram pressure stripping is strongest near the
cluster center. Counter-intuitively, more massive galaxies show shorter
quenching timescales mainly because they enter their clusters with lower gas
fractions due to $ex\text{-}situ$ quenching.

the H$\alpha$ emission line could hint at a spiral structure in the decretion

confirmed in data from the early 2000s. A higher frequency of 2.48 d$^{-1}$ is
present in the data from 2015 to 2019 and possibly also in the early 2000s. A
third frequency at 1.25 d$^{-1}$ is proposed to exist in both SMEI and BRITE
data. The only explanation covering all three rapid variations seems to be
nonradial pulsation. The two higher frequencies are incompatible with rotation.

(AoI) in network theory, information uncertainty in information theory, and
detection delay in time series analysis. We consider a dynamic system whose
state changes at discrete time points, and a state change won't be detected
until an update generated after the change point is delivered to the
destination for the first time. We introduce an information theoretic metric to
measure the information freshness at the destination, and name it as
generalized Age of Information (GAoI). We show that under any state-independent
online updating policy, if the underlying state of the system evolves according
to a stationary Markov chain, the GAoI is proportional to the AoI. Besides, the
accumulative GAoI and AoI are proportional to the expected accumulative
detection delay of all changes points over a period of time. Thus, any
(G)AoI-optimal state-independent updating policy equivalently minimizes the
corresponding expected change point detection delay, which validates the
fundamental role of (G)AoI in real-time status monitoring. Besides, we also
investigate a Bayesian change point detection scenario where the underlying
state evolution is not stationary. Although AoI is no longer related to
detection delay explicitly, we show that the accumulative GAoI is still an
affine function of the expected detection delay, which indicates the
versatility of GAoI in capturing information freshness in dynamic systems.

interstellar inheritance and gas and grain surface chemical reactions within
the disk. The survival of inherited molecules, as well as the disk in situ
chemistry depends on the local temperature, density and irradiation
environment, which can change over time due to stellar and disk evolution, as
well as transport in the disk. We address one aspect of this coupling between
the physical and chemical evolution in disks by following accretion streamlines
of gas and small grains in the disk midplane, while simultaneously taking the
evolving star into account. This approach is computationally efficient and
enables us to take into account changing physical conditions without reducing
the chemical network. We find that many species are enhanced in the inner disk
midplane in the dynamic model due to inward transport of cosmic-ray driven
chemical products, resulting in, e.g., orders-of magnitude hydrocarbon
enhancements at 1 au, compared to a static disk. For several other chemical
families, there is no difference between the static and dynamic models,
indicative of a robust chemical reset, while yet others show differences
between static and dynamic models that depend on complex interactions between
physics and chemistry during the inward track. The importance of coupling
dynamics and chemistry when modeling the chemical evolution of protoplanetary
disks is thus depends on what chemistry is of interest.

inner accretion disks in black-hole X-ray binaries. It follows from considering
the irradiating flux and the effective temperature of the inner parts of the
disk, which implies that a strong quasi-thermal component with the average
energy higher than that of a blackbody at the effective temperature has to be
present whenever relativistic Fe K fluorescence and reflection features are
observed. The apparent absence of such quasi-thermal component with the color
temperature of $\sim$1 keV in high-luminosity hard states is not compatible
with a strongly irradiated disk extending close to the innermost stable
circular orbit. Instead, the disk should be either truncated at a relatively
large radius or irradiated by a corona at a large height, which would reduce
the effective temperature and bring it to an agreement with the data. We also
study constraints on disk/corona models following from comparing the disk
densities fitted in literature using variable-density reflection codes with
those calculated by us from the ionization parameter, the luminosity and the
disk inner radius. We find that the fitted densities are much higher/lower in
the hard/soft state of binaries, implying significant problems with the used
assumptions and methods.

discretizations constructed from summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. Notably,
the discretizations assemble global SBP operators and use continuous solutions,
unlike previous efforts that use discontinuous SBP discretizations.
Derivative-based dissipation and local-projection stabilization (LPS) are
investigated as options for stabilizing the baseline discretization. These
stabilizations are equal up to a multiplicative constant in one dimension, but
only LPS remains well conditioned for general, multidimensional SBP operators.
Furthermore, LPS is able to take advantage of the additional nodes required by
degree $2p$ diagonal-norms, resulting in an element-local stabilization with a
bounded spectral radius. An entropy-stable version of LPS is easily obtained by
applying the projection on the entropy variables. Numerical experiments with
the linear-advection and Euler equations demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency,
and robustness of the stabilized discretizations, and the continuous approach
compares favorably with the more common discontinuous SBP methods.

solution to long standing problem in spintronics -- how to describe
spin-transfer torque (STT) between flowing spins of conduction electrons and
localized spins within a magnetic material by treating the dynamics of both
spin species fully quantum-mechanically. In contrast to conventional
Slonczewski-Berger STT, where the localized spins are viewed as classical
vectors obeying the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and where their STT-driven
dynamics is initiated only when the spin-polarization of flowing electrons and
localized spins are noncollinear, quantum STT can occur when these vectors are
collinear but antiparallel. Using tDMRG, we simulate the time evolution of a
many-body quantum state of electrons and localized spins, where the former are
injected as a spin-polarized current pulse while the latter comprise a quantum
Heisenberg ferromagnetic metallic (FM) spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain initially
in the ground state with spin-polarization antiparallel to that of injected
electrons. The quantum STT reverses the direction of localized spins, but
without rotation from the initial orientation, when the number of injected
electrons exceeds the number of localized spins. Such nonclassical reversal,
which is absent from LLG dynamics, is strikingly inhomogeneous across the FM
chain and it can be accompanied by reduction of the magnetization associated
with localized spins, even to zero at specific locations. This is because
quantum STT generates a highly entangled nonequilibrium many-body state of all
flowing and localized spins, despite starting from the initially unentangled
ground state of a mundane FM. Furthermore, the mutual information between
localized spins at the FM edges remains nonzero even at infinite separation as
the signature of dynamical buildup of long-range entanglement.

Anderson model with a power-law pseudogap in the density of states. In
equilibrium, the model is known to display a quantum phase transition from a
generalized Kondo to a local moment phase. In the present work, we focus on the
extension of these phases beyond equilibrium, i.e. under the influence of a
bias voltage. Within the auxiliary master equation approach combined with a
scheme based on matrix product states (MPS) we are able to directly address the
current-carrying steady state. Starting with the equilibrium situation, we
first corroborate our results by comparing with a direct numerical evaluation
of ground state spectral properties of the system by MPS. Here, a scheme to
locate the phase boundary by extrapolating the power-law exponent of the self
energy produces a very good agreement with previous results obtained by the
numerical renormalization group. Our nonequilibrium study as a function of the
applied bias voltage is then carried out for two points on either side of the
phase boundary. In the Kondo regime the resonance in the spectral function is
splitted as a function of the increasing bias voltage. The local moment regime,
instead, displays a dip in the spectrum near the position of the chemical
potentials. Similar features are observed in the corresponding self energies.
The Kondo split peaks approximately obey a power-law behavior as a function of
frequency, whose exponents depend only slightly on voltage. Finally, the
differential conductance in the Kondo regime shows a peculiar maximum at finite
voltages, whose height, however, is below the accuracy level.

increases (0.4%) for all TM dopants, while c-lattice decreases (-0.2%) for
TM=Cu, barely moves (0.05%) for Au, and increases (0.2%) for Ag. Despite the
naive expectation that the noble elements of group 11 should affect the quantum
properties of 122 similarly, they produce significant differences extending to
the character of the ground state. For the Ag-122 crystal, evidence of only a
filamentary superconductivity is noted with pressure. However, for Au and Cu
doping (x=0.03) we find a substantial improvement in the superconductivity,

calculations corroborate these results and find evidence of strong electronic

modern convolutional object detectors. However, the potentially large number

scenes makes constituting complete annotations a challenging task; objects
missing annotations can be observed in a variety of popular object detection
datasets. These missing annotations can be problematic, as the standard
cross-entropy loss employed to train object detection models treats
classification as a positive-negative (PN) problem: unlabeled regions are
implicitly assumed to be background. As such, any object missing a bounding box
results in a confusing learning signal, the effects of which we observe
empirically. To remedy this, we propose treating object detection as a
positive-unlabeled (PU) problem, which removes the assumption that unlabeled

of label missingness, as well as on Visual Genome and DeepLesion with full

Leippold and Vasiljevi\'c (2019). In particular, we believe that quantifying
market risk by strictly relying on point-in-time measures cannot be deemed a
satisfactory approach in general. Instead, we argue that complementing this
approach by studying measures of risk that capture the magnitude of losses
potentially incurred at any time of a trading horizon is necessary when dealing
with (m)any financial position(s). To address this issue, we propose an
intra-horizon analogue of the expected shortfall for general profit and loss

is well-defined for (m)any popular class(es) of L\'evy processes encountered
when modeling market dynamics and constitutes a coherent measure of risk, as
introduced in Cheridito, Delbaen and Kupper (2004). On the computational side,
we provide a simple method to derive the intra-horizon risk inherent to popular
L\'evy dynamics. Our general technique relies on results for
maturity-randomized first-passage probabilities and allows for a derivation of
diffusion and single jump risk contributions. These theoretical results are
complemented with an empirical analysis, where popular L\'evy dynamics are
calibrated to S&P 500 index data and an analysis of the resulting intra-horizon

Towards this end, we develop a task-oriented dialogue system to investigate

successfully modeled so far. In this work we propose an effective model capable
of efficiently capturing the essence of the near field hydrodynamic
interactions, validated numerically by a pedagogic model system consisting of
an E. coli and a spherical tracer. The proposed model effectively captures all
the details of near field hydrodynamics through only a tensorial coefficient of
resistance, which is fundamentally different from, and thus cannot be replaced
by, an effective interaction of conservative nature. In a critical test case
that studies the scattering angle of the bacterium-tracer pair dynamics,
calculations based on the proposed model reveals a region in parameter space
where the bacterium is trapped by the spherical tracer, a phenomenon that is
regularly observed in experiments but cannot be explained by any existing
model.

of gait, which is widely adopted for joint correction and assessing any lower
limb or spinal problem. On the hardware side, we design a novel marker-less
gait analysis device using a low-cost RGB camera mounted on a mobile

specifically, based on the output of two state-of-the-art human pose estimation

parameters: inversion/eversion, dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, ankle and foot
progression angles. We thereby classify walking patterns into normal,
supination, pronation and limp. We also illustrate how to run the purposed
machine learning models in low-resource environments such as a single

decision making. While these analyses help policy analysts and economists
determine coverage, inform policy, and guide resource allocation, they are
statistically challenging for several reasons. Cost and effectiveness are
correlated and follow complex joint distributions which are difficult to
capture parametrically. Effectiveness (often measured as increased survival
time) and accumulated cost tends to be right-censored in many applications.
Moreover, CEAs are often conducted using observational data with non-random
treatment assignment. Policy-relevant causal estimation therefore requires
robust confounding control. Finally, current CEA methods do not address
cost-effectiveness heterogeneity in a principled way - often presenting
population-averaged estimates even though significant effect heterogeneity may
exist. Motivated by these challenges, we develop a nonparametric Bayesian model
for joint cost-survival distributions in the presence of censoring. Our
approach utilizes a joint Enriched Dirichlet Process prior on the covariate
effects of cost and survival time, while using a Gamma Process prior on the
baseline survival time hazard. Causal CEA estimands, with policy-relevant
interpretations, are identified and estimated via a Bayesian nonparametric
g-computation procedure. Finally, we outline how the induced clustering of the
Enriched Dirichlet Process can be used to adaptively detect presence of
subgroups with different cost-effectiveness profiles. We outline an MCMC

minima in linear neural networks trained with a quadratic loss. First, we show
that linear ResNets with zero initialization necessarily converge to the

we show that consecutive layers in flat minima solutions are coupled. That is,
one of the left singular vectors of each weight matrix, equals one of the right

Bjorken flow beyond the earlier studies. We show that the power series solution
at late times is not unique and is accompanied by an exact solution of the form
$1/\tau$, which becomes unphysical if taken on shell. In contrast to the
M\""uller-Israel-Stewart formalism, a matching between $\NFSYM$ results and the
hydro expansion is only possible up to the first order, which gives rise to
$\eta/s=1/4\pi$. Matching the results to the next order gives rise to
causality/stability-violating values. Furthermore, we show that the pressure
anisotropy in the general frame cannot capture the hydrodynamization, and we
introduce an alternative measure to find the attractor. Using slow-roll
expansion, we find an analytical approximation form for the attractor. We also
show that the early-time behavior of attractors is related to stability and
causality conditions. The attractor solutions outside the stable and causal
regime give rise to reheating and negative longitudinal pressures in early
times, in contrast to the stable and causal ones. We also comment on the
violation of the second law of thermodynamics by the off-shell parameters. We
show that for the stable and causal choice of parameters, the off-shell
canonical entropy of the attractors, which is not a physical quantity, has a
negative divergence in early times before tending to its on-shell limit. On the
other hand, the unstable and acausal attractors have non-negative entropy
divergence. We speculate that the violation of the second law by stable and
causal off-shell parameters is required for stability of the first-order
hydrodynamics. We investigate the analytical structure of the Borel-transformed
series and find the proper relation between the poles and nonhydro modes.

filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets
are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to
maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A
simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples
since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We
demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and

previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in
absolute gain. Finally, we show that our approach is useful in other domains as
well, such as program synthesis.

between binary variables and focused on frequencies of boolean operators which
could explain outcomes correctly. We determined trends of boolean operators by
chi-square test. As an application, we performed this method for a dataset
which included patient's age, body mass index (BMI), mean arterial pressure

to each variable and considered these as binary variables. Interactions of age,

often use adversarial training to learn models that are robust against such
attacks at the cost of higher generalization error on unperturbed test sets.
The conventional wisdom is that more training data should shrink the gap
between the generalization error of adversarially-trained models and standard
models. However, we study the training of robust classifiers for both Gaussian
and Bernoulli models under $\ell_\infty$ attacks, and we prove that more data
may actually increase this gap. Furthermore, our theoretical results identify
if and when additional data will finally begin to shrink the gap. Lastly, we

These inflated beam robots tend to buckle under compressive loads, producing
extremely tight local curvature at difficult-to-control buckle point locations.
In this paper, we present an inflated beam robot that uses distributed
stiffness changing sections enabled by positive pressure layer jamming to
control or prevent buckling. Passive valves are actuated by an electromagnet
carried by an electromechanical device that travels inside the main inflated
beam robot body. The valves themselves require no external connections or
wiring, allowing the distributed stiffness control to be scaled to long beam
lengths. Multiple layer jamming elements are stiffened simultaneously to
achieve global stiffening, allowing the robot to support greater cantilevered
loads and longer unsupported lengths. Local stiffening, achieved by leaving
certain layer jamming elements unstiffened, allows the robot to produce
""virtual joints"" that dynamically change the robot kinematics. Implementing
these stiffening strategies is compatible with growth through tip eversion and
tendon-steering, and enables a number of new capabilities for inflated beam
robots and tip-everting robots.

We sample four different spin distributions (random, aligned, anti-aligned, and

large-scale benchmarks. However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often
difficult or expensive for real-world applications, which restricts the power
of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans can detect new
objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior
knowledge to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and
subsequently generalize this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images.
Inspired by this procedure of learning to detect, we propose a novel
Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically, we make
three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object
supervision of different domains effectively into a progressive detection
procedure. Via such human-like learning, one can boost a target detection task
with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two delicate transfer stages,
i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer
Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source
detector to enhance target detector with few annotations. It can effectively
warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design a recurrent object labelling
mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly, we
exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance
the robustness of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform
extensive experiments on a number of challenging detection benchmarks with
different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms the
recent state-of-the-art approaches.

of fluid dynamics is investigated for the scalar tensor (ST) theory of gravity.
The description of ST gravity, in both Einstein and Jordan frames, is analyzed
from fluid-gravity viewpoint. In the Einstein frame the dynamical equation for
the metric leads to the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation with an external
forcing term, coming from the scalar field in ST gravity. In the Jordan frame
the situation is more subtle. We observe that finding the DNS equation in this
frame can lead to two pictures. In one picture, the usual DNS equation is
modified by a Coriolis-like force term, which originates completely from the
presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field ($\phi$) on the gravity side.
Moreover, the identified fluid variables are no longer conformally equivalent
with those in the Einstein frame. However, this picture is consistent with the
saturation of Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound. In the other picture, we find
the standard DNS equation (i.e. without the Coriolis-like force), with the
fluid variables conformally equivalent with those in Einstein frame. But, the
second picture, may not agree with the KSS bound for some values of $\phi$. We
conclude by rewriting the Raychaudhuri equation and the tidal force equation in
terms of the relevant parameters to demonstrate how the expansion scalar and
the shear-tensor evolve in the spacetime. Although, the area law of entropy is
broken in ST gravity, we show that the rewritten form of Raychaudhuri's
equation correctly results in the generalized second law of black hole
thermodynamics.

To train
a Transformer however, one usually needs a carefully designed learning rate
warm-up stage, which is shown to be crucial to the final performance but will
slow down the optimization and bring more hyper-parameter tunings. In this
paper, we first study theoretically why the learning rate warm-up stage is
essential and show that the location of layer normalization matters.
Specifically, we prove with mean field theory that at initialization, for the
original-designed Post-LN Transformer, which places the layer normalization
between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the
output layer are large. Therefore, using a large learning rate on those
gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful
for avoiding this problem. On the other hand, our theory also shows that if the
layer normalization is put inside the residual blocks (recently proposed as
Pre-LN Transformer), the gradients are well-behaved at initialization. This
motivates us to remove the warm-up stage for the training of Pre-LN
Transformers. We show in our experiments that Pre-LN Transformers without the
warm-up stage can reach comparable results with baselines while requiring
significantly less training time and hyper-parameter tuning on a wide range of
applications.

that asteroid belts and planetary systems around main-sequence stars with mass
$M_{\rm MS}\gtrsim 3\,\rm M_\odot$ may not form because of the intense

one-dimensional edge, and zero-dimensional corner states. In particular,
multiple topological eigenstates are generated in a hierarchical manner with no
bulk multipole moment. The unit cell of the topological PhC structure is a
tetramer composed of four identical air holes perforated into an InGaAsP
multiple-quantum-well epilayer slab. A square area of a topologically
nontrivial PhC structure is surrounded by a topologically trivial counterpart,
resulting in multidimensional eigenstates of one bulk, four side edges, and
four corners within and at the boundaries. Spatially resolved optical
excitation spontaneously results in lasing actions at all nine hierarchical
topological states. Our experimental findings may provide insight into the

on sensitive data, e.g., text typed by users on their smartphones. FL is
expressly designed for training on data that are unbalanced and non-iid across
the participants. To ensure privacy and integrity of the fedeated model, latest
FL approaches use differential privacy or robust aggregation.
  We look at FL from the \emph{local} viewpoint of an individual participant
and ask: (1) do participants have an incentive to participate in FL? (2) how
can participants \emph{individually} improve the quality of their local models,
without re-designing the FL framework and/or involving other participants?
  First, we show that on standard tasks such as next-word prediction, many
participants gain no benefit from FL because the federated model is less
accurate on their data than the models they can train locally on their own.
Second, we show that differential privacy and robust aggregation make this
problem worse by further destroying the accuracy of the federated model for
many participants.
  Then, we evaluate three techniques for local adaptation of federated models:
fine-tuning, multi-task learning, and knowledge distillation. We analyze where
each is applicable and demonstrate that all participants benefit from local
adaptation. Participants whose local models are poor obtain big accuracy
improvements over conventional FL. Participants whose local models are better
than the federated model\textemdash and who have no incentive to participate in
FL today\textemdash improve less, but sufficiently to make the adapted
federated model better than their local models.

range of applications, their large size and complexity render them unsuitable
for tasks such as remote monitoring on edge devices with limited storage and
computational power. A naive approach to resolve this on the model level is to
use simpler architectures, but this sacrifices prediction accuracy and is
unsuitable for monitoring applications requiring accurate detection of the
onset of adverse events. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to
this problem by decomposing the predictive model as the sum of a simple
function which serves as a local monitoring tool, and a complex correction term
to be evaluated on the server. A sign requirement is imposed on the latter to
ensure that the local monitoring function is safe, in the sense that it can
effectively serve as an early warning system. Our analysis quantifies the
trade-offs between model complexity and performance, and serves as a guidance
for architecture design. We validate our proposed framework on a series of
monitoring experiments, where we succeed at learning monitoring models with
significantly reduced complexity that minimally violate the safety requirement.
More broadly, our framework is useful for learning classifiers in applications
where false negatives are significantly more costly compared to false
positives.

rapidly learn new tasks. However, these methods only aim to perform well in
expectation over tasks coming from some particular distribution that is

of ""task-robustness"" by reformulating the popular Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) objective [Finn et al. 2017] such that the goal is to minimize the
maximum loss over the observed meta-training tasks. The solution to this novel
formulation is task-robust in the sense that it places equal importance on even

over all distributions of the observed tasks, making it robust to shifts in the
task distribution between meta-training and meta-testing. We present an
algorithm to solve the proposed min-max problem, and show that it converges to
an $\epsilon$-accurate point at the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$

complex multiplication by the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of an imaginary
quadratic field $K$ in which $p$ is ramified. Namely, letting $r_p =
\mathrm{corank}_{\mathbb{Z}_p}\mathrm{Sel}_{p^{\infty}}(E/\mathbb{Q})$, we show
that $r_p \le 1 \implies \mathrm{rank}_{\mathbb{Z}}E(\mathbb{Q}) =

problems. First, it resolves Sylvester's conjecture on rational sums of cubes,
showing that for all primes $\ell \equiv 4,7,8 \pmod{9}$, there exists $(x,y)
\in \mathbb{Q}^{\oplus 2}$ such that $x^3 + y^3 = \ell$. Second, combined with
work of Smith, it resolves the congruent number problem in 100\% of cases and
establishes Goldfeld's conjecture on ranks of quadratic twists for the
congruent number family. The method for showing the above $p$-converse theorem
relies on new interplays between Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields
at nonsplit primes and relative $p$-adic Hodge theory. In particular, we show
that a certain de Rham period $q_{\mathrm{dR}}$ can be used to construct
anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions for Hecke characters and newforms,
interpolating anticyclotomic twists of positive Hodge-Tate weight in the
central critical range. Moreover, one can relate the Iwasawa module of elliptic
units to these anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions via a new ""Coleman map"",
which is, roughly speaking, the $q_{\mathrm{dR}}$-expansion of the Coleman
power series map. Using this, we formulate and prove a new Rubin-type main
conjecture for elliptic units, which is eventually related to Heegner points in
order to prove the $p$-converse theorem.

The knowledge of crystalline electric-field (CEF) excitations is an essential
step to explore the fundamental magnetism of rare-earth spin systems. Here we
employed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and Raman scattering (RS) to carry
out a comprehensive CFE investigation on $NaYbSe_{2}$, a promising
representative of the family. By comparison with its nonmagnetic compound
$NaLuSe_{2}$, we are able to identify the CEF excitations at 15.8, 24.3 and
30.5 meV at 5K. The selected cuts of the INS spectra are well re-produced with
a large anisotropy of $g$ factors ($g_{ab}:g_{c}\sim3:1$). Further, the CEF
excitations are explained well by our calculations based on the point charge
model. Interestingly, $NaYbSe_{2}$ exhibits an unusual CEF shift to higher
energies with increasing temperatures, and the Raman mode close to the first
CEF excitation shows an anomalously large softening with decreasing
temperatures. The absence of the anomalies in $NaLuSe_{2}$ clearly demonstrates
a CEF-phonon coupling not reported in the family. It can be understood in term
of the weaker electronegativity of Se. The fact that the smallest first CEF
excitation in the sub-family of $NaYbCh_{2}$ is $\sim$ 180K (Ch=O, S, Se),
guarantees that the sub-family can be strictly described with an effective

interaction as an example, we find that the strong electron correlation effect
can induce the ferrovalley to half-valley-metal transition. Due to the
valley-dependent optical selection rules, such system could be transparent to,
e.g., left-circularly polarized light, yet the right-circularly polarized light
will be reflected, which can in turn be used as a crucial method to detect
half-valley-metal state. In addition, we find that in the so obtained
half-valley-metal state, the conduction valley demonstrates Dirac cone-like
linear energy dispersion. Interestingly, with the increase of the correlation
effect, the system becomes insulating again with all valleys follow same
optical selection rule. We confirm that in this specific case, the valence
bands, which consist of single spin, possess non-zero Chern number and
consequently intrinsic quantum anomalous valley Hall effect emerges. Our
findings open an appealing route toward functional 2D materials design of
valleytronics.

separable states and those entangled states in the single-spin-excitation

degeneracy of the separable states, the resulting Bethe ansatz equations are
found to be non-unique. In the case of $s_0=1/2$ we show that all the separable

only on the quality of the research but also on its nature and direction. The
consequence is that published studies may not be truly representative of all
valid studies undertaken, and this bias may threaten the validity of systematic
reviews and meta-analyses - on which evidence-based medicine increasingly
relies. Multivariate meta-analysis has recently received increasing attention
for its ability reducing potential bias and improving statistical efficiency by
borrowing information across outcomes. However, detecting and accounting for
publication bias are more challenging in multivariate meta-analysis setting
because some studies may be completely unpublished whereas some studies may
selectively report part of multiple outcomes. In this paper, we propose a score
test for jointly testing publication bias for multiple outcomes, which is novel
to the multivariate setting. The proposed test is a natural multivariate
extension of the univariate Egger's test, and can handle the above mentioned
scenarios simultaneously, It accounts for correlations among multivariate
outcomes, while allowing different types of outcomes, and can borrow
information across outcomes. The proposed test is shown to be more powerful
than the Egger's test, Begg's test and Trim and Fill method through simulation
studies. Two data analyses are given to illustrate the performance of the
proposed test in practice.

  Algorithms","16 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, due to the genomic sequence analysis in several types of cancer,
the genomic data based on {\em copy number profiles} ({\em CNP} for short) are
getting more and more popular. A CNP is a vector where each component is a
non-negative integer representing the number of copies of a specific gene or
segment of interest.
  In this paper, we present two streams of results. The first is the negative
results on two open problems regarding the computational complexity of the
Minimum Copy Number Generation (MCNG) problem posed by Qingge et al. in 2018.
It was shown by Qingge et al. that the problem is NP-hard if the duplications
are tandem and they left the open question of whether the problem remains
NP-hard if arbitrary duplications are used. We answer this question
affirmatively in this paper; in fact, we prove that it is NP-hard to even
obtain a constant factor approximation. We also prove that the parameterized
version is W[1]-hard, answering another open question by Qingge et al.
  The other result is positive and is based on a new (and more general) problem
regarding CNP's. The \emph{Copy Number Profile Conforming (CNPC)} problem is
formally defined as follows: given two CNP's $C_1$ and $C_2$, compute two
strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ with $cnp(S_1)=C_1$ and $cnp(S_2)=C_2$ such that the
distance between $S_1$ and $S_2$, $d(S_1,S_2)$, is minimized. Here,
$d(S_1,S_2)$ is a very general term, which means it could be any genome
rearrangement distance (like reversal, transposition, and tandem duplication,
etc). We make the first step by showing that if $d(S_1,S_2)$ is measured by the
breakpoint distance then the problem is polynomially solvable.

degrading processes that limit performance and device lifetime. We develop a
nonequilibrium Green's function based transport theory in which the central
region atoms and, more importantly, atoms on molecule-electrode interfaces are
allowed to move. The separation of time-scales of slow nuclear motion and fast
electronic dynamics enables the algebraic solution of the Kadanoff-Baym
equations in the Wigner space. As a result, analytical expressions for
dynamical corrections to the adiabatically computed Green's functions are
produced. These dynamical corrections depend not only on the instantaneous
molecular geometry but also on the nuclear velocities. To make the theoretical
approach fully self-consistent, the same time-separation approach is used to
develop expressions for the adiabatic, dissipative, and stochastic components
of current-induced forces in terms of adiabatic Green's functions. Using these
current induced forces, the equation of motion for the nuclear degrees of
freedom is cast in the form of a Langevin equation. The theory is applied to
model molecular electronic junctions. We observe that the interplay between the
value of the spring constant for the molecule-electrode chemical bond and
electronic coupling strength to the corresponding electrode is critical for the
appearance of structural instabilities and, consequently, telegraphic switching
in the electric current. The range of model parameters is identified to observe
structurally stable molecular junctions as well as various different kinds of
current-induced telegraphic switching. The interfacial structural instabilities
are also quantified based on current noise calculations.

simulated or Lytro datasets, where popular methods perform very similar. To
compare their performance on images with defocus spread effect, this paper
constructs a new dataset called MFF in the wild (MFFW). It contains 19 pairs of
multi-focus images collected on the Internet. We register all pairs of source
images, and provide focus maps and reference images for part of pairs. Compared
with Lytro dataset, images in MFFW significantly suffer from defocus spread
effect. In addition, the scenes of MFFW are more complex. The experiments
demonstrate that most state-of-the-art methods on MFFW dataset cannot robustly
generate satisfactory fusion images. MFFW can be a new baseline dataset to test
whether an MMF algorithm is able to deal with defocus spread effect.

With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar
investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that
adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in
a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from
a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a
few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through
flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found
for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad
actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them.
Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the
anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the
intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success
rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor
nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other

decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional

solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds

group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-task learning, difficulty levels of different tasks are varying.
There are many works to handle this situation and we classify them into five
categories, including the direct sum approach, the weighted sum approach, the
maximum approach, the curriculum learning approach, and the multi-objective
optimization approach. Those approaches have their own limitations, for
example, using manually designed rules to update task weights, non-smooth
objective function, and failing to incorporate other functions than training
losses. In this paper, to alleviate those limitations, we propose a Balanced
Multi-Task Learning (BMTL) framework. Different from existing studies which
rely on task weighting, the BMTL framework proposes to transform the training
loss of each task to balance difficulty levels among tasks based on an
intuitive idea that tasks with larger training losses will receive more
attention during the optimization procedure. We analyze the transformation
function and derive necessary conditions. The proposed BMTL framework is very
simple and it can be combined with most multi-task learning models. Empirical
studies show the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed BMTL framework.

(2020)","10.1007/s40509-020-00225-7",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum state smoothing is a technique for estimating the quantum state of a
partially observed quantum system at time $\tau$, conditioned on an entire
observed measurement record (both before and after $\tau$). However, this
smoothing technique requires an observer (Alice, say) to know the nature of the
measurement records that are unknown to her in order to characterize the
possible true states for Bob's (say) systems. If Alice makes an incorrect
assumption about the set of true states for Bob's system, she will obtain a
smoothed state that is suboptimal, and, worse, may be unrealizable (not
corresponding to a valid evolution for the true states) or even unphysical (not
represented by a state matrix $\rho\geq0$). In this paper, we review the
historical background to quantum state smoothing, and list general criteria a
smoothed quantum state should satisfy. Then we derive, for the case of linear
Gaussian quantum systems, a necessary and sufficient constraint for
realizability on the covariance matrix of the true state. Naturally, a
realizable covariance of the true state guarantees a smoothed state which is
physical. It might be thought that any putative true covariance which gives a
physical smoothed state would be a realizable true covariance, but we show
explicitly that this is not so. This underlines the importance of the
realizabilty constraint.

the exploration of bosonic tight-binding models in unconventional situations

situations, in which excitations are driven and damped by pairs, leading to
pattern formation and exotic bosonic states emerged from a non-equilibrium
quantum many-body system. Focusing on a two-dimensional driven-dissipative
Bose-Hubbard model, we find that its steady states are characterized by the
condensation of bosons around momenta lying on a ""Bose surface"", a bosonic
analogue of the Fermi surface in solid-state systems. The interplay between
instabilities generated by the driving, the nonlinear dissipative
mode-coupling, and the underlaying lattice effect, allows the system to
equilibrate into an exotic superfluid state of bosons condensed on a closed
ring in momentum space instead of discrete points. Such an unconventional state
with a spatially uniform density distribution goes beyond the traditional scope
of pattern formation, and thus has no counterpart in the classical literature.
In addition, it is a state connected to several open problems in modern
condensed-matter physics, and here we provide the means to stabilize it,
opening the way to its experimental study. Moreover, we also provide a concrete
experimental implementation of our model in currently-available
superconducting-circuit arrays. We also investigate the relaxation spectrum
around the condensate, which shows a characteristic purely diffusive behavior.

achieves good performance in many applications. Feature learning is important
to deep multi-task learning for sharing common information among tasks. In this
paper, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to learn augmented
features for deep multi-task learning. The HGNN consists of two-level graph
neural networks. In the low level, an intra-task graph neural network is
responsible of learning a powerful representation for each data point in a task
by aggregating its neighbors. Based on the learned representation, a task
embedding can be generated for each task in a similar way to max pooling. In
the second level, an inter-task graph neural network updates task embeddings of
all the tasks based on the attention mechanism to model task relations. Then
the task embedding of one task is used to augment the feature representation of
data points in this task. Moreover, for classification tasks, an inter-class
graph neural network is introduced to conduct similar operations on a finer
granularity, i.e., the class level, to generate class embeddings for each class
in all the tasks use class embeddings to augment the feature representation.
The proposed feature augmentation strategy can be used in many deep multi-task
learning models. we analyze the HGNN in terms of training and generalization
losses. Experiments on real-world datastes show the significant performance
improvement when using this strategy.

lifetime of the second 2+ state in neutron-rich 20O, tau(2+_2 ) = 150(+80-30)
fs, and an estimate for the lifetime of the second 2+ state in 16C have been
obtained, for the first time. The results were achieved via a novel Monte Carlo
technique that allowed us to measure nuclear state lifetimes in the
tens-to-hundreds femtoseconds range, by analyzing the Doppler-shifted
gamma-transition line shapes of products of low-energy transfer and
deep-inelastic processes in the reaction 18O (7.0 MeV/u) + 181Ta. The requested
sensitivity could only be reached owing to the excellent performances of the
AGATA gamma-tracking array, coupled to the PARIS scintillator array and to the
VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer. The experimental lifetimes agree with
predictions of ab initio calculations using two- and three-nucleon
interactions, obtained with the valence-space in-medium similarity
renormalization group for 20O, and with the no-core shell model for 16C. The
present measurement shows the power of electromagnetic observables, determined
with high-precision gamma spectroscopy, to assess the quality of
first-principles nuclear structure calculations, complementing common
benchmarks based on nuclear energies. The proposed experimental approach will
be essential for short lifetimes measurements in unexplored regions of the

which studies a form, $f$, by the action of polynomial differential operators

annihilate $f$ is called the apolar algebra of $f$. In general, the apolar
algebra of a form is useful for determining its Waring rank, which can be seen
as the problem of decomposing the supersymmetric tensor, associated to the
form, minimally as a sum of rank one supersymmetric tensors. In this article we
study the apolar algebra of a product of linear forms, which generalizes the
case of monomials and connects to the geometry of hyperplane arrangements. In
the first part of the article we provide a bound on the Waring rank of a
product of linear forms under certain genericity assumptions; for this we use
the defining equations of so-called star configurations due to Geramita,
Harbourne, and Migliore. In the second part of the article we use the computer
algebra system Bertini, which operates by homotopy continuation methods, to
solve certain rank equations for catalecticant matrices. Our computations
suggest that, up to a change of variables, there are exactly six homogeneous
polynomials of degree six in three variables which factor completely as a
product of linear forms defining an irreducible multi-arrangement and whose
apolar algebras have dimension six in degree three. As a consequence of these
calculations, we find six cases of such forms with cactus rank six, five of
which also have Waring rank six. Among these are products defining
subarrangements of the braid and Hessian arrangements.

Recent studies have proved that blood pumping by the heart is highly correlated

this task, but making it work in realistic situations is still a challenging
problem in computer vision community. Furthermore, learning to solve such a
complex task on a dataset with very limited annotated samples is not
reasonable. Consequently, researchers do not prefer to use the deep learning
approaches for this problem. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient
approach to benefit the advantages of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) by
simplifying HR estimation from a complex task to learning from very correlated
representation to HR. Inspired by previous work, we learn a component called
Front-End (FE) to provide a discriminative representation of face videos,
afterward a light deep regression auto-encoder as Back-End (BE) is learned to
map the FE representation to HR. Regression task on the informative
representation is simple and could be learned efficiently on limited training
samples. Beside of this, to be more accurate and work well on low-quality
videos, two deep encoder-decoder networks are trained to refine the output of
FE. We also introduce a challenging dataset (HR-D) to show that our method can
efficiently work in realistic conditions. Experimental results on HR-D and
MAHNOB datasets confirm that our method could run as a real-time method and
estimate the average HR better than state-of-the-art ones.

affect the correlated nature of the system. In the absence of Hund's coupling,
the system shows a Fermi liquid behavior over the entire range of temperatures
we consider. We confirm that the Fermi liquid persists at zero temperature even
with nonzero Hund's coupling; however, at sufficient temperatures Hund's
coupling significantly reduces the Fermi liquid regime and the system evolves
into a typical Hund's metal. At the bare electronic occupancy of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
($t_{2g}^4$), a stronger Hund's metallicity accompanies a larger long-time
correlator. Remarkably, electron doping further destabilizes the Fermi liquid
even though the long-time correlator and magnetic fluctuations decrease upon
doping. This suppression of the Fermi liquid is driven by the van Hove
singularity above the Fermi level in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, combined with an enhanced
Van Vleck susceptibility by spin-orbit coupling. Such findings point to the
important role that electronic structure plays in the behavior of Hund's
metals, in addition to magnetic fluctuations.

data manifold. Along the learned geodesic, our method can generate high-quality
interpolations between two given data samples. Specifically, we use an
autoencoder network to map data samples into latent space and perform
interpolation via an interpolation network. We add prior geometric information
to regularize our autoencoder for the convexity of representations so that for
any given interpolation approach, the generated interpolations remain within
the distribution of the data manifold. Before the learning of a geodesic, a
proper Riemannianmetric should be defined. Therefore, we induce a Riemannian
metric by the canonical metric in the Euclidean space which the data manifold
is isometrically immersed in. Based on this defined Riemannian metric, we
introduce a constant speed loss and a minimizing geodesic loss to regularize
the interpolation network to generate uniform interpolation along the learned
geodesic on the manifold. We provide a theoretical analysis of our model and
use image translation as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

semidefinite programs (SDPs) with polylogarithmic dependence on width. Mixed
packing and covering SDPs constitute a fundamental algorithmic primitive with
recent applications in combinatorial optimization, robust learning, and quantum
complexity. The current approximate solvers for positive semidefinite
programming can handle only pure packing instances, and technical hurdles
prevent their generalization to a wider class of positive instances. For a
given multiplicative accuracy of $\epsilon$, our algorithm takes
$O(\log^3(nd\rho) \cdot \epsilon^{-3})$ parallelizable iterations, where $n$,
$d$ are dimensions of the problem and $\rho$ is a width parameter of the
instance, generalizing or improving all previous parallel algorithms in the
positive linear and semidefinite programming literature. When specialized to
pure packing SDPs, our algorithm's iteration complexity is $O(\log^2 (nd) \cdot
\epsilon^{-2})$, a slight improvement and derandomization of the
state-of-the-art (Allen-Zhu et. al. '16, Peng et. al. '16, Wang et. al. '15).
For a wide variety of structured instances commonly found in applications, the
iterations of our algorithm run in nearly-linear time.
  In doing so, we give matrix analytic techniques for overcoming obstacles that
have stymied prior approaches to this open problem, as stated in past works
(Peng et. al. '16, Mahoney et. al. '16). Crucial to our analysis are a
simplification of existing algorithms for mixed positive linear programs,
achieved by removing an asymmetry caused by modifying covering constraints, and
a suite of matrix inequalities whose proofs are based on analyzing the Schur
complements of matrices in a higher dimension. We hope that both our algorithm
and techniques open the door to improved solvers for positive semidefinite

pixel segmentation of facial parts (such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc.), providing
a basis for further face analysis, modification, and other applications.
Interlinked Convolutional Neural Networks (iCNN) was proved to be an effective
two-stage model for face parsing. However, the original iCNN was trained
separately in two stages, limiting its performance. To solve this problem, we
introduce a simple, end-to-end face parsing framework: STN-aided
iCNN(STN-iCNN), which extends the iCNN by adding a Spatial Transformer Network
(STN) between the two isolated stages. The STN-iCNN uses the STN to provide a
trainable connection to the original two-stage iCNN pipeline, making end-to-end
joint training possible. Moreover, as a by-product, STN also provides more
precise cropped parts than the original cropper. Due to these two advantages,
our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the original model. Our
model achieved competitive performance on the Helen Dataset, the standard face
parsing dataset. It also achieved superior performance on CelebAMask-HQ

unifying formalism - as a reward-rational choice that the human is making,
often implicitly. The formalism offers both a unifying lens with which to view
past work, as well as a recipe for interpreting new sources of information that

a new feedback type, and reading into how the choice of feedback itself leaks

Other models are based on the approximation of the pairwise infection rate. Two
of them, one for subcritical networks and another for supercritical networks,
use the pairwise infection rate as a function of the number of infected nodes.
The other model uses pairwise infection rate as a function of time, and can be
applied for both subcritical and supercritical networks achieving good
accuracy. The model for subcritical networks is accurate when density is not
close to the percolation critical density. Moreover, the models that target
only supercritical regime are accurate.

large-scale magnetic flux rope (MFR) in active region NOAA~12371 that erupts
with a major flare and coronal mass ejection on 2015 June 21. A data-driven
numerical magnetohydrodynamic model is employed to simulate three-dimensional
coronal magnetic field evolution of one-day duration before the eruption.
Comparison between the observed features and our modeled magnetic field
discloses how the pre-eruption MFR forms. Initially, the magnetic field lines
were weakly twisted as being simple sheared arcades. Then a long MFR was formed
along the polarity inversion line due to the complex photospheric motion, which
is mainly shearing rather than twisting. The presence of the MFR is evidenced
by a coherent set of magnetic field lines with twist number above unity. Below
the MFR a current sheet is shown in the model, suggesting that tether-cutting
reconnection plays a key role in the MFR formation. The MFR's flux grows as
more and more field lines are twisted due to continuous injection of magnetic
helicity by the photospheric motions. Meanwhile, the height of the MFR's axis
increases monotonely from its formation. By an analysis of the decay index of
its overlying field, we suggest that it is because the MFR runs into the torus
instability regime and becomes unstable that finally triggers the eruption.

Even in the presence of mild label noise, i.e. $\eta$ is a small constant, this
is a challenging problem and only recently have label complexity bounds of the
form $\tilde{O}\big(s \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(d, \frac{1}{\epsilon})\big)$ been
established in [Zhang, 2018] for computationally efficient algorithms. In
contrast, under high levels of label noise, the label complexity bounds
achieved by computationally efficient algorithms are much worse: the best known
result of [Awasthi et al., 2016] provides a computationally efficient algorithm
with label complexity $\tilde{O}\big((\frac{s \ln
d}{\epsilon})^{2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/(1-2\eta))}} \big)$, which is label-efficient
only when the noise rate $\eta$ is a fixed constant. In this work, we
substantially improve on it by designing a polynomial time algorithm for active

$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{s}{(1-2\eta)^4} \mathrm{polylog} (d, \frac 1 \epsilon)

relabelling edges of the LTS such that differently labelled edges remain
different. With an appropriate label splitting, we can always obtain a solution
for the synthesis or embedding problem. Using the label splitting, we can
construct a labelled Petri net with the intended bahaviour (e.g. embedding the
given LTS in its reachability graph). As the labelled Petri net can have a
large number of transitions, an optimisation may be desired, limiting the
number of labels produced by the label splitting. We show that such a

taking the patient's characteristics and other selected services into account,
the model is able to indicate the overall effectiveness of a combination of

Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to determine optimal combinations of services

the primary ES. The dynamic selection between the two offloading schemes has
not been well studied yet. In this paper, we investigate a dynamic offloading
framework in a multi-user scenario. Each UE can decide who partitions a task
according to the network status, e.g., channel quality and allocated
computation resource. Based on the framework, we model the latency to complete
a task, and formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average latency

the allocation of the communication and computation resources. The numerical
results show that, compared with the static offloading schemes, the proposed

interaction between supernova explosions and the natal molecular cloud. We also
consider the cases with and without previous feedback from the high-mass star
in the form of ionising radiation and stellar winds. The supernova is able to
find weak points in the cloud and create channels through which it can escape,
leaving much of the well shielded cloud largely unaffected. This effect is
increased when the channels are pre-existing due to the effects of previous
stellar feedback. The expanding supernova deposits its energy in the gas that
is in these exposed channels, and hence sweeps up less mass when feedback has
already occurred, resulting in faster outflows with less radiative losses. The
full impact of the supernova explosion is then able to impact the larger scale
of the galaxy in which it abides. We conclude that supernova explosions only
have moderate effects on their dense natal environments but that with
pre-existing feedback, the energetic effects of the supernova are able to
escape and affect the wider scale medium of the galaxy.

forcefully reducing the domain discrepancy in the latent space will result in
the destruction of intrinsic data structure. To balance the mitigation of

Bi-Directional Generation domain adaptation model with consistent classifiers
interpolating two intermediate domains to bridge source and target domains.
Specifically, two cross-domain generators are employed to synthesize one domain
conditioned on the other. The performance of our proposed method can be further
enhanced by the consistent classifiers and the cross-domain alignment
constraints. We also design two classifiers which are jointly optimized to
maximize the consistency on target sample prediction. Extensive experiments

versions of the $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) problem, and show new lower
bounds under a standard indivisibility assumption:
  - Polynomial space indexing schemes for high-dimensional $k$-NN in Hamming
space cannot take advantage of block transfers: $\Omega(k)$ block reads are
needed to to answer a query.
  - For the $\ell_\infty$ metric the lower bound holds even if we allow
$c$-appoximate nearest neighbors to be returned, for $c \in (1, 3)$.
  - The restriction to $c < 3$ is necessary: For every metric there exists an
indexing scheme in the indexability model of Hellerstein et al.~using space
$O(kn)$, where $n$ is the number of points, that can retrieve $k$ 3-approximate
nearest neighbors using $\lceil k/B\rceil$ I/Os, which is optimal.
  - For specific metrics, data structures with better approximation factors are
possible. For $k$-NN in Hamming space and every approximation factor $c>1$
there exists a polynomial space data structure that returns $k$ $c$-approximate
nearest neighbors in $\lceil k/B\rceil$ I/Os.
  To show these lower bounds we develop two new techniques: First, to handle
that approximation algorithms have more freedom in deciding which result set to
return we develop a relaxed version of the $\lambda$-set workload technique of
Hellerstein et al. This technique allows us to show lower bounds that hold in
$d\geq n$ dimensions. To extend the lower bounds down to $d = O(k \log(n/k))$
dimensions, we develop a new deterministic dimension reduction technique that
may be of independent interest.

arbitrary space curve with an external electric and magnetic field applied.
With the aid of gauge theory, we successfully decouple the tangential and
normal dynamics and derive the effective Hamiltonian. A new type of quantum
potential called SU(2) Zeeman interaction appears, which is induced by the
electric field and couples spin and intrinsic orbital angular momentum. Based
on the Hamiltonian, we discuss the spin precession for zero intrinsic orbital
angular momentum case and the energy splitting caused by the SU(2) Zeeman
interaction for a helix as examples, showing the combined effect of geometry
and external field. The new interaction may bring new approaches to manipulate
quantum states in spintronics.

wave sources in the coming years, while the future Einstein Telescope could
observe hundreds of lensed events. It is, therefore, crucial to develop
methodologies to distinguish between lensed from unlensed gravitational-wave
observations. A lensed signal not identified as such will lead to biases during
the interpretation of the source. In particular, sources will appear to have
intrinsically higher masses. No robust method currently exists to distinguish
between the magnification bias caused by lensing and intrinsically high-mass
sources. In this work, we show how to recognize lensed and unlensed binary
neutron star systems through the measurement of their tidal effects for highly
magnified sources as a proof-of-principle. The proposed method could be used to
identify lensed binary neutron stars, which are the chief candidate for lensing
cosmography studies. We apply our method on GW190425, finding no evidence in
favor of lensing, mainly due to the poor measurement of the event's tidal
effects. However, we expect that future detections with better tidal
measurements can yield better constraints.

The findings reveal the increasing participation of these organizations in this

Regarding the topics, health (especially in developing countries), women and

  Network",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the existing cellular networks, it remains a challenging problem to
communicate with and control an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm with both
high reliability and low latency. Due to the UAV swarm's high working altitude
and strong ground-to-air channels, it is generally exposed to multiple ground
base stations (GBSs), while the GBSs that are serving ground users (occupied
GBSs) can generate strong interference to the UAV swarm. To tackle this issue,
we propose a novel two-phase transmission protocol by exploiting cellular plus
device-to-device (D2D) communication for the UAV swarm. In Phase I, one swarm
head is chosen for ground-to-air channel estimation, and all the GBSs that are
not serving ground users (available GBSs) transmit a common control message to
the UAV swarm simultaneously, using the same cellular frequency band, to combat
the strong interference from occupied GBSs. In Phase II, all the UAVs that have
decoded the common control message in Phase I further relay it to the other
UAVs in the swarm via D2D communication, by exploiting the less interfered D2D
frequency band and the proximity among UAVs. In this paper, we aim to
characterize the reliability performance of the above two-phase protocol, i.e.,
the expected percentage of UAVs in the swarm that can decode the common control
message, which is a non-trivial problem due to the complex system setup and the
intricate coupling between the two phases. Nevertheless, we manage to obtain an
approximated expression of the reliability performance of interest, under
reasonable assumptions and with the aid of the Pearson distributions. Numerical
results validate the accuracy of our analytical results and show the
effectiveness of our protocol over other benchmark protocols. We also study the
effect of key system parameters on the reliability performance, to reveal
useful insights on the practical system design.

The derived model relies on simple absorption line shape functions that are
fitted to the actual response given by complex but exact database approach. The
model is also reducible for particular sub-bands within the full range of
100-450 GHz, further simplifying the absorption loss estimate. The proposed
model is shown to be very accurate by benchmarking it against the exact
response and the similar models given by International Telecommunication Union

from the exact response for one kilometer link in highly humid environment.

is validated calculating potential energy surfaces and obtaining fundamental
excitation energies for three moderate-size chain-like molecular systems. The
results are compared to other approaches, which utilize static grid

our methodology leads to considerable computational savings for potential

investigated in the strong field approximation where the lowest Landau level
(LLL) becomes relevant. We work in the limit $g\sqrt{eB}\ll T\ll \sqrt{eB}$
which is relevant for heavy ion collisions. Effects of the magnetic field are
incorporated through the resummed gluon propagator in which the dominant
contribution arises from the quark loop. We also take the approximation
$\sqrt{eB}\ll M$, M being the HQ mass, so that the HQ is not Landau quantized.
It turns out that there are only two types of scatterings that contribute to
the energy loss of HQ; the Coulomb scattering of HQ with light
quarks/anti-quarks and the t-channel Compton scattering. It is observed that
for a given magnetic field, the dominant contribution to the collisional energy
loss arises from Compton scattering process i.e., $Qg\rightarrow Qg$. On the
other hand, of the two processes, the Coulomb scattering i.e., $Qq\rightarrow
Qq$ is more sensitive to the magnetic field. The net collisional energy loss is
seen to increase with increase in the magnetic field. For a reasonable strength
of the magnetic field, the field dependent contribution to the collisional
energy loss is of the same order as to the case without magnetic field which
can be important for the jet quenching phenomena in the heavy ion collision

inflation with a canonically normalized field do not obey this constraint, it
has been claimed recently in the literature that models of warm inflation can
be made compatible with it in the case of large dissipation. The de Sitter
constraint is known to be derived from entropy considerations. Since warm
inflation necessary involves entropy production, it becomes necessary to
determine how this entropy production will affect the constraints imposed by
the swampland conditions. Here, we generalize these entropy considerations to
the case of warm inflation and show that the condition on the slope of the

  Clustering",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent demands on data privacy have called for federated learning (FL) as a
new distributed learning paradigm in massive and heterogeneous networks.
Although many FL algorithms have been proposed, few of them have considered the
matrix factorization (MF) model, which is known to have a vast number of signal
processing and machine learning applications. Different from the existing FL
algorithms that are designed for smooth problems with single block of
variables, in federated MF (FedMF), one has to deal with challenging non-convex
and non-smooth problems (due to constraints or regularization) with two blocks
of variables. In this paper, we address the challenge by proposing two new
FedMF algorithms, namely, FedMAvg and FedMGS, based on the model averaging and
gradient sharing principles, respectively. Both FedMAvg and FedMGS adopt
multiple steps of local updates per communication round to speed up
convergence, and allow only a randomly sampled subset of clients to communicate
with the server for reducing the communication cost. Convergence analyses for
the two algorithms are respectively presented, which delineate the impacts of
data distribution, local update number, and partial client communication on the
algorithm performance. By focusing on a data clustering task, extensive
experiment results are presented to examine the practical performance of both
algorithms, as well as demonstrating their efficacy over the existing
distributed clustering algorithms.

in a knowledge base. The named entity linking is challenging, given the fact
that there are multiple candidate entities for a mention in a document. It is
difficult to link a mention when it appears multiple times in a document, since
there are conflicts by the contexts around the appearances of the mention. In
addition, it is difficult since the given training dataset is small due to the
reason that it is done manually to link a mention to its mapping entity. In the

To address these issues, we focus on how to link entity for mentions at a

show that `direct' interactions between the three orbits only occur starting at
a high expansion order of the Hamiltonian (hexadecupole order), and that the
backreaction of the outer orbit on the inner two orbits at lower expansion
orders is weak. Therefore, to good approximation, one can obtain the changes of
each orbit by using previously-known analytic results for binary-single
interactions, and replacing the mass of the third body with the total mass of
the companion binary. Nevertheless, we find some dependence of the `binarity'
of the companion binary, and derive explicit analytic expressions for the
secular changes that are consistent with numerical integrations. In particular,
the eccentricity and inclination changes of orbit 1 due to orbit 2 scale as
\eps_{SA1} (a_2/Q)^2 [m_3 m_4/(m_3+m_4)^2], where \eps_{SA1} is the approximate
quadrupole-order change, and a_2 and (m_3,m_4) are the companion binary orbital
semimajor axis and component masses, respectively. Our results are implemented
in several Python scripts that are freely available.

Stokes problem results in a point-wise divergence-free approximate velocity on
cells. However, the approximate velocity is not H(div)-conforming and it can be
shown that this is the reason that the EDG method is not pressure-robust, i.e.,
the error in the velocity depends on the continuous pressure. In this paper we
present a local reconstruction operator that maps discretely divergence-free
test functions to exactly divergence-free test functions. This local
reconstruction operator restores pressure-robustness by only changing the right
hand side of the discretization, similar to the reconstruction operator
recently introduced for the Taylor--Hood and mini elements by Lederer et al.
(SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 55 (2017), pp. 1291--1314). We present an a priori error
analysis of the discretization showing optimal convergence rates and
pressure-robustness of the velocity error. These results are verified by
numerical examples. The motivation for this research is that the resulting EDG
method combines the versatility of discontinuous Galerkin methods with the
computational efficiency of continuous Galerkin methods and accuracy of
pressure-robust finite element methods.

throughput in systems designed for solving these rearrangement problems, it is
essential to minimize the number of atomic operations, e.g., the pick-n-places
of individual objects. However, this optimization task poses a rather difficult
challenge due to complex inter-dependency between objects, especially in
high-density settings.
  In tackling the aforementioned challenges, we develop a novel algorithmic
tool, Rubik Tables, that provides a clean abstraction of object rearrangement
problems as the proxy problem of shuffling items stored in a table or lattice.
In its basic form, a Rubik Table is an $n\times n$ table containing $n^2$
items. We show that the reconfiguration of items in such a Rubik Table can be
achieved using at most $2n$ column/row shuffles in the partially labeled
setting, where each column (resp., row) shuffle may arbitrarily permute the
items stored in a column (resp., row) of the table. When items are fully
distinguishable, additional $n$ shuffles are needed. Rubik Tables allow many
generalizations, e.g., to higher dimensions.
  Using Rubik Table, we have designed a first constant-factor optimal algorithm
for stack rearrangement problems. We show that, for $nd$ items stored in $n$
stacks of depth $d$ each, using one empty stack as the swap space, $O(nd)$
stack pop-push operations are sufficient for an arbitrary reconfiguration of
the stacks where $d \le n^{\frac{m}{2}}$ for arbitrary fixed $m >0$. Rubik
Table results also allow the development of constant-factor optimal solutions
for solving multi-robot motion planning problems under extreme robot density.
These algorithms based on Rubik Table results run in low-polynomial time.

impurity by a Gaussian repulsive potential coupled to the condensate. For weak
coupling, we obtain analytical expressions for the forces acting on the
impurity, and compare them with those computed through direct numerical
simulations of the dGPE and with the corresponding expressions for classical
forces. For non-steady flows, there is a time-dependent force dominated by
inertial effects and which has a correspondence in the Maxey-Riley theory for
particles in classical fluids. In the steady-state regime, the force is
dominated by a self-induced drag. Unlike at zero temperature, where the drag
force vanishes below a critical velocity, at low temperatures the impurity
experiences a net drag even at small velocities, as a consequence of the energy
dissipation through interactions of the condensate with the thermal cloud. This
dissipative force due to thermal drag is similar to the classical Stokes' drag.
There is still a critical velocity above which steady-state drag is dominated
by acoustic excitations and behaves non-monotonically with impurity's speed.

dense star clusters. For a wide range of cluster properties and orbital radii
the resonant relaxation times in these clusters are much shorter than the
Hubble time. Since resonant relaxation conserves semimajor axes, these clusters
should be in the maximum-entropy state consistent with the given semimajor axis
distribution. We determine these maximum-entropy equilibria in a simplified
model in which all of the stars have the same semimajor axes. We find that the
cluster exhibits a phase transition from a disordered, spherical,
high-temperature equilibrium to an ordered low-temperature equilibrium in which
the stellar orbits have a preferred orientation or line of apsides. Here
`temperature' is a measure of the non-Keplerian or self-gravitational energy of
the cluster; in the spherical state, temperature is a function of the rms

black-hole star clusters -- the two parameters are semimajor axis and
black-hole mass --- and find that clusters are susceptible to the lopsided
phase transition over a range of ~100 in semimajor axis, mostly for black-hole

ever-rising increase in complexity of the underlying formalisms used to solve
the stationary Schr\""odinger equation. The associated working equations at play
in state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body methods can be analytically
reduced with respect to angular-momentum, i.e. $SU(2)$, quantum numbers
whenever they are effectively employed in a symmetry-restricted context. The
corresponding procedure constitutes a tedious and error-prone but yet an
integral part of the implementation of those many-body frameworks. Indeed, this
symmetry reduction is a key step to advance modern simulations to higher
accuracy since the use of symmetry-adapted tensors can decrease the
computational complexity by orders of magnitude.
  While attempts have been made in the past to automate the (anti-) commutation
rules linked to Fermionic and Bosonic algebras at play in the derivation of the
working equations, there is no systematic account to achieve the same goal for
their symmetry reduction. In this work, the first version of an automated tool
performing graph-theory-based angular-momentum reduction is presented. Taking
the symmetry-unrestricted expressions of a generic tensor network as an input,
the code provides their angular-momentum-reduced form in an error-safe way in a
matter of seconds. Several state-of-the-art many-body methods serve as examples
to demonstrate the generality of the approach and to highlight the potential
impact on the many-body community.

This is an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model wherein the (real) scalar field
couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet curvature squared combination. The BH
solutions constructed are stationary, axially symmetric and asymptotically
flat. They possess a non-trivial scalar field outside their regular event
horizon; thus they have scalar hair. The scalar ""charge"" is not, however, an
independent macroscopic degree of freedom. It is proportional to the Hawking
temperature, as in the static limit, wherein the BHs reduce to the spherical
solutions found by Sotirou and Zhou. The spinning BHs herein are found by
solving non-perturbatively the field equations, numerically. We present an
overview of the parameter space of the solutions together with a study of their
basic geometric and phenomenological properties. These solutions are compared
with the spinning BHs in the Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet model and the Kerr
BH of vacuum General Relativity. As for the former, and in contrast with the
latter, there is a minimal BH size and small violations of the Kerr bound.
Phenomenological differences with respect to either the former or the latter,
however, are small for illustrative observables, being of the order of a few

function. Assuming the investment is time distributed we can use the linear
chain trick technique to transform delay differential equation system to
equivalent system of ordinary differential system (ODE). The time delay
parameter is a mean time delay of gamma distribution. We reduce the system with
distribution delay to both three and four-dimensional ODEs. We study the Hopf
bifurcation in these systems with respect to two parameters: the time delay
parameter and the rate of growth parameter. We derive the results from the
analytical as well as numerical investigations. From the former we obtain the
sufficient criteria on the existence and stability of a limit cycle solution
through the Hopf bifurcation. In numerical studies with the Dana and Malgrange
investment function we found two Hopf bifurcations with respect to the rate
growth parameter and detect the existence of stable long-period cycles in the
economy. We find that depending on the time delay and adjustment speed
parameters the range of admissible values of the rate of growth parameter
breaks down into three intervals. First we have stable focus, then the limit
cycle and again the stable solution with two Hopf bifurcations. Such behaviour
appears for some middle interval of admissible range of values of the rate of
growth parameter.

reproduce the complex features observed in real-world data, leading to research
on more complicated complex contagion models. A noted feature of complex
contagion is social reinforcement that individuals require multiple exposures
to information before they begin to spread it themselves. Here we show that the
quoter model, a model of the social flow of written information over a network,
displays features of complex contagion, including the weakness of long ties and
that increased density inhibits rather than promotes information flow.
Interestingly, the quoter model exhibits these features despite having no

results highlight the need to complement contagion models with an

their capacities, to reduce latencies and optimize their resource management in
order to remain competitive and adapted to the market. Today, the way consumers
use networks has changed and more heterogeneous services with their own
requirements have emerged. This has led network operators to define the network
slicing paradigm. Network slicing creates multiple partitions in the network,
each partition can be dedicated to a particular service allowing vertical
markets and multiple services with different requirements to run on top of a
single infrastructure. To allow the flexibility level required by network
slicing, satellite technologies have to evolve. Satcoms actors have therefore
been working on improving satellite equipments. Testbeds followed the
theoretical analysis and ESA's current project SATis5 is making it its core
topic. The work presented in the full-paper of this extend abstract is the next
step we propose to those initiatives. It focuses on the network slicing concept
applied to satellite networks which, we believe, is a mandatory requirement for
a full integrated satellite into 5G networks. We first start by describing the
main challenges associated to the satellite slice definition. We then highlight
a set of requirements for such a satellite slice. Based on those requirements,
we construct and propose a complete Satellite Slice as a Service (S3) framework
which mutualizes the satellite infrastructure to provide a seamless integration
into 5G networks.

disease of interest, association between markers and the disease status is
often tested by comparing the marker minor allele frequencies (MAFs) between
cases and controls. For most common allele-based tests the statistical power is
highly dependent on the actual values of these MAFs, where associated markers
with low MAFs have less power to be detected compared to associated markers
with high MAFs. Therefore, the popular strategy of selecting markers for
follow-up studies based primarily on their p-values is likely to preferentially
select markers with high MAFs. We propose a new test which does not favor
markers with high MAFs and improves the power for markers with low to moderate
MAFs without sacrificing performance for markers with high MAFs and is
therefore superior to most existing tests in this regard. An explicit formula
for the asymptotic power function of the proposed test is derived
theoretically, which allows for fast and easy computation of the corresponding
p-values. The performance of the proposed test is compared with several
existing tests both in the asymptotic and the finite sample size settings.

pooling scans from independent studies. However, simple pooling is often
ill-advised as selection, measurement, and confounding biases may creep in and
yield spurious correlations. In this work, we combine 35,320 magnetic resonance
images of the brain from 17 studies to examine bias in neuroimaging. In the
first experiment, Name That Dataset, we provide empirical evidence for the
presence of bias by showing that scans can be correctly assigned to their
respective dataset with 71.5% accuracy. Given such evidence, we take a closer
look at confounding bias, which is often viewed as the main shortcoming in
observational studies. In practice, we neither know all potential confounders
nor do we have data on them. Hence, we model confounders as unknown, latent
variables. Kolmogorov complexity is then used to decide whether the confounded
or the causal model provides the simplest factorization of the graphical model.
Finally, we present methods for dataset harmonization and study their ability
to remove bias in imaging features. In particular, we propose an extension of
the recently introduced ComBat algorithm to control for global variation across
image features, inspired by adjusting for population stratification in
genetics. Our results demonstrate that harmonization can reduce
dataset-specific information in image features. Further, confounding bias can
be reduced and even turned into a causal relationship. However, harmonziation
also requires caution as it can easily remove relevant subject-specific
information. Code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/Dataset-Bias.

naturally obtained from the PHS approach as Lyapunov function and using the
modularity of passive systems, we provide sufficient conditions under which the
designed VSC controllers achieve microgrid-wide asymptotic voltage stability.
Integral action (IA), which preserves the passive PHS structure, robustifies
the design against unknown disturbances and ensures zero voltage errors in the
steady-state. Numerical simulations illustrate the functionality of the

within the broad line region (BLR), flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) were
believed not to emit photons with energies above few tens of GeV because of the
absorption with the optical-UV photons from the BLR. However, photons with
observed energies up to about $300 \, \rm GeV$ have been detected for few
FSRQs, whose most iconic example is PKS 1441+25 at redshift $z = 0.94$. The
most conservative explanation for these observations is that the emission
occurs at distances comparable to the size of the dusty torus. In this case,
absorption of high-energy gamma-ray photons for energies above $200-300 \, {\rm
GeV}$ is dominated by the interaction with infrared radiation emitted by the
torus. We investigate if current observational data about FSRQs in flaring
state can give us information about: (i) the importance of the torus absorption
and (ii) the properties of the torus i.e. its temperature and its geometry. We
find that present data do not arrive at energies where the torus influence is
prominent and as a result it is currently hardly possible to infer torus
properties from observations. However, with dedicated simulations, we
demonstrate that observations with the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array

generation units (DGUs) with intermittent supply behavior requires local
voltage-source inverters (VSIs) to be controlled in a distributed or
decentralized manner at primary level. In (Strehle et al., 2019), we use
passivity theory to design decentralized, plug-and-play voltage and frequency
controllers for such VSIs. However, the stability analysis of the closed-loop
system requires a load-connected topology, in contrast to real grids where
loads are arbitrarily located. In this paper, we expand our former approach by
considering the more realistic and general case of nonlinear static AC loads
(ZIP and exponential) at arbitrary locations within an AC microgrid.
Investigating the monotonicity of differentiable mappings, we derive sufficient
inequality conditions for the strict passivity of these nonlinear static AC
loads. Together with our plug-and-play VSI controller, this allows us to use
passivity arguments to infer asymptotic voltage and frequency stability for AC
microgrids with arbitrary topologies. An illustrative simulation validating our
theoretical findings concludes our work.

NLG models with sample-level comparison results with skill rating system. While
able to be trained in a fully self-supervised fashion, our model can be further
fine-tuned with a little amount of human preference annotation to better
imitate human judgment. In addition to evaluating trained models, we propose to
apply our model as a performance indicator during training for better
hyperparameter tuning and early-stopping. We evaluate our approach on both
story generation and chit-chat dialogue response generation. Experimental
results show that our model correlates better with human preference compared
with previous automated evaluation approaches. Training with the proposed

a few realistic model choices or assumptions are made. First, in order to

L-systems, whereas the detailed geometry of branches, sub-branches and leaves

astonishingly narrow range from 81--86\%. Moreover, visualizations and analyses
indicated that both approaches used similar aspects of the data, e.g., delta

accuracies of current binary EEG pathology decoders could saturate near 90\%

such decoders are already clinically useful, such as in areas where clinical

data-driven personalized pricing algorithms: sellers attempt to maximize their
revenue by estimating the consumer's willingness-to-pay and pricing
accordingly. Our objective is to develop algorithms that protect consumer
interests against personalized pricing schemes. In this paper, we consider a
consumer who learns more and more about a potential purchase across time, while
simultaneously revealing more and more information about herself to a potential
seller. We formalize a strategic consumer's purchasing decision when
interacting with a seller who uses personalized pricing algorithms, and
contextualize this problem among the existing literature in optimal stopping
time theory and computational finance. We provide an algorithm that consumers
can use to protect their own interests against personalized pricing algorithms.
This algorithmic stopping method uses sample paths to train estimates of the
optimal stopping time. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
works that provides computational methods for the consumer to maximize her
utility when decision making under surveillance. We demonstrate the efficacy of
the algorithmic stopping method using a numerical simulation, where the seller
uses a Kalman filter to approximate the consumer's valuation and sets prices
based on myopic expected revenue maximization. Compared to a myopic purchasing
strategy, we demonstrate increased payoffs for the consumer in expectation.

autoencoder (AE) inspired neural networks (NN) to generalize the GFT sampling

During offloading, (part of) the application underpinned by the services may be

work aimed at building models to allow prediction of such down time based on
metrics (operational data) of the underlying and surrounding infrastructure.
Such prediction would be invaluable in the context of automated Fog offloading

head (AVNFH), accurately staging AVNFH from a plain radiograph is critical yet
challenging for orthopedists. Thus, we propose a deep learning-based AVNFH
diagnosis system (AVN-net). The proposed AVN-net reads plain radiographs of the
pelvis, conducts diagnosis, and visualizes results automatically. Deep
convolutional neural networks are trained to provide an end-to-end diagnosis
solution, covering tasks of femoral head detection, exam-view identification,
side classification, AVNFH diagnosis, and key clinical notes generation.
AVN-net is able to obtain state-of-the-art testing AUC of 0.97 (95% CI:
0.97-0.98) in AVNFH detection and significantly greater F1 scores than
less-to-moderately experienced orthopedists in all diagnostic tests (p<0.01).
Furthermore, two real-world pilot studies were conducted for diagnosis support
and education assistance, respectively, to assess the utility of AVN-net. The
experimental results are promising. With the AVN-net diagnosis as a reference,
the diagnostic accuracy and consistency of all orthopedists considerably
improved while requiring only 1/4 of the time. Students self-studying the AVNFH
diagnosis using AVN-net can learn better and faster than the control group. To
the best of our knowledge, this study is the first research on the prospective
use of a deep learning-based diagnosis system for AVNFH by conducting two pilot
studies representing real-world application scenarios. We have demonstrated
that the proposed AVN-net achieves expert-level AVNFH diagnosis performance,
provides efficient support in clinical decision-making, and effectively passes
clinical experience to students.

equation method, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the scattered field as
the size of the holes goes to zero. Under certain geometrical constraints on
the size and the minimum distance of the holes, we show that the scattered
field is approximated by a linear combination of point-sources where the
weights are given by the capacitance of each hole and the causal signals (of
these point-sources) can be computed by solving a, retarded in time, linear
algebraic system. A rigorous justification of the asymptotic expansion and the
unique solvability of the linear algebraic system are shown under natural
conditions on the cluster of holes. As an application of the asymptotic
expansion, we derive, in the limit case when the holes are densely distributed
and occupy a bounded domain, the equivalent effective acoustic medium (an
equivalent mass density characterized by the capacitance of the holes) that
generates, approximately, the same scattered field as the cluster of holes.
Conversely, given a locally variable, smooth and positive mass density,
satisfying a certain subharmonicity condition, we can design a perforated
material with holes, having appropriate capacitances, that generates
approximately the same acoustic field as the acoustic medium modelled by the
given mass density (and constant speed of propagation). Finally, we numerically
verify the asymptotic expansions by comparing the asymptotic approximations
with the numerical solutions of the scattered fields via the finite element
method.

mark a new era for scientific, industrial, and military underwater
applications. To mitigate the hostile underwater channel characteristics, this
paper hybridizes underwater acoustic and optical wireless communications to
achieve a ubiquitous control and high-speed low-latency networking performance,
respectively. Since underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC) suffers
from limited range, it requires effective multi-hop routing solutions. In this
regard, we propose a Sector-based Opportunistic Routing (SectOR) protocol.
Unlike the traditional routing (TR) techniques which unicast packets to a
unique relay, opportunistic routing (OR) targets a set of candidate relays by
leveraging the broadcast nature of the UOWC channel. OR improves the packet
delivery ratio as the likelihood of having at least one successful packet
reception is much higher than that in conventional unicast routing. Contingent
upon the performance characterization of a single-hop link, we obtain a variety
of local and global metrics to evaluate the fitness of a candidate set (CS) and
prioritize the members of a CS. Since rate-error and range-beamwidth tradeoffs
yield different candidate set diversities, we develop a candidate filtering and
searching algorithm to find the optimal sector-shaped coverage region by
scanning the feasible search space. Moreover, a hybrid acoustic/optic
coordination mechanism is considered to avoid duplicate transmission of the
relays. Numerical results show that SectOR protocol can perform even better
than an optimal unicast routing protocol in well-connected UOWNs.

Nevertheless, computational efficiency is a challenging issue. Direct Monte
Carlo simulation is unlikely to be feasible especially for a complex structure
with large number of degrees of freedom. In this research, we develop a new
probabilistic framework built upon Gaussian process meta-modeling architecture
to analyze mode shape variation. To expedite the generation of input dataset
for meta-model establishment, a multi-level strategy is adopted which can blend
a large amount of low-fidelity data acquired from order-reduced analysis with a
small amount of high-fidelity data produced by high-dimensional full finite

distribution of mode shape, a multi-response strategy is incorporated to
predict mode shape variation at different locations simultaneously. These yield
a multi-level, multi-response Gaussian process that can efficiently and
accurately quantify the effect of structural uncertainty to mode shape
variation. Comprehensive case studies are carried out for demonstration and

candidate for 5G that can replace orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM). However, channel estimation (CE) is a big challenge in FBMC because it
suffers from intrinsic interference which is due to the orthogonality of the
subcarrier functions in the real field only. In this paper, we investigate a
proposed modified interference approximation scheme (M-IAM) by approximating
the intrinsic interference from the neighboring pilots to accommodate the
complex channel frequency and thus improving CE performance besides simplifying
its processing. The M-IAM scheme has larger pseudo pilot magnitude than other
conventional preamble schemes, namely the interference approximation method
(IAM) with its versions (IAM-C) and (E-IAM-C); in addition to the novel
preamble design (NPS). In addition, the proposed (M-IAM) scheme is
characterized by the lower transmitted power needed. The CE performance of the
M-IAM is investigated through 512 and 2048 subcarriers via different types of
outdoor and indoor multipath fading channels that are time-invariant such as
IEEE 802.22, IEEE 802.11, Rician, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), as
well as time varying channels such as Rayleigh and Vehicular A (Veh-A).
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed M-IAM scheme achieves a lower
bit error rate (BER), lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) and lower
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) over the conventional preamble schemes under
the aforementioned channel models. The proposed scheme has the advantage of
saving the transmitted power, a requirement that could match 5G low power
requirements.

the treatment in \cite{P1} suitable for a Minkowski spacetime, the discrete

Schroedinger equation in a non-inertial frame. The frame is moving relative to
an inertial frame with an acceleration. The formulation has been developed
using Lagrangian formalism as discussed in Classical Mechanics book by Landau
and Lifshitz [1]. Hence we have obtained the Hamiltonian of the nucleons. Then
using the standard form of canonical quantization rule, we have setup the
Schroedinger equation in non-inertial frame. In the present study we have
considered only the accelerated rectilinear motion of the non-inertial frame.
The rotation will be considered in some future work based on quantum field
theory [2] (see also [3, 4]). We therefore drop the rotation part of the
Hamiltonian in our calculation. The physically acceptable result on our work is
basically the solution obtained by Fowler and Nordheim for the emission of
electrons from cold metal surface induced by strong electric field [5] known as
cold field emission of electrons. However in the present formulation, it is the
gravity which acts on mass of the particle and causes emission. The centrifugal
force acts like gravity. Hence we have got some flavor of Hawking radiation [6]
and also Unruh effect [7] within the limited scope of our non-relativistic
approach. We have also shown that relative motion of a two body quantum
mechanical system does not depend on the nature of the frame of reference.

generating ground truth with CALVIS to train a small CNN. After having trained

upon an variational encoder which transforms the input video into a latent
feature space and a Luenberger-type observer which captures the dynamic
evolution of the latent features. This enables the decomposition of videos into
static features and dynamics in an unsupervised manner. By deriving the
stability theory of the nonlinear Luenberger-type observer, the hidden states
in the feature space become insensitive with respect to the initial values,
which improves the robustness of the overall model. Furthermore, the
variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood can be derived to obtain the
tractable posterior prediction distribution based on the variational principle.
Finally, the experiments such as the Bouncing Balls dataset and the Pendulum
dataset are provided to demonstrate the proposed model outperforms concurrent

marginal area of a rainfed farm versus rye, the annual crop sowed traditionally
in the marginal area of the farm. The cited farm owned 300 ha of which about 13
percent was marginal. The methodology was based on the use of the profit margin

LCA as technique for the energy and the environmental evaluations. Results of
the economic analysis showed a slight enhancement of the profit margin for tall
wheatgrass 156 Euro ha-1 y-1 compared to rye 145 Euro ha-1 y-1. Environmental
LCA was driven by CO2 fixation due to soil organic matter increase and reduced
inputs consumption for tall wheatgrass that produced a Global Warming Potential
GWP of -1.9 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 y-1 versus 1.6 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 y-1 obtained for rye.
Tall wheatgrass cultivation primary energy consumption was less than 40 percent
of rye s consumption. According to the results achieved it was concluded that
tall wheatgrass is better option than rye from the energy and the environmental
point of views and slight better option from the economic view. Considering
these results, monetarization of the CO2 eq reductions of tall wheatgrass
