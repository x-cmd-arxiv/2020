and can therefore provide important insight into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).
Quarkonia are proposed as crucial probes to study the QGP. The extent of the
medium modification for heavy-quark quarkonium production in heavy-ion
collisions is measured in terms of a nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$,
defined as the quarkonium yield in heavy-ion collisions divided by the relative
quarkonium cross section in pp collisions scaled by the nuclear overlap
function. A possible path-length dependent quarkonium dissociation, as well as
a contribution of (re-)generation of quarkonia from heavy quarks in the medium,
would lead to an azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonium production relative to the
reaction plane. In this contribution, the recent ALICE measurements of
quarkonium in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be
discussed for both mid- and forward rapidity. The dependence of $R_{\rm AA}$ on
centrality and $p_{\rm T}$ for J/$\psi$, $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S), as
well as the J/$\psi$ elliptic flow $v_{2}$ will be shown. The experimental data

plasmon modes. We have found that the radiation does not induce a significant
coupling among the different quasi-electrostatic plasmon modes for particles of
size up to the plasma wavelength, but causes a frequency shift and an
exponential decay in time of the modes. By solving the equations governing the
expectation values of the plasmon creation and annihilation operators, we
obtain a new closed-form full-wave expression for the decay rate and for the
frequency shift of the plasmon modes. It is non-perturbative and it only
depends on the surface charge distribution of the quasi-electrostatic plasmon

analyses such as segmentation can be performed successfully. Currently, QC is
predominantly performed visually at significant time and operator cost. We aim
to automate the process by formulating a probabilistic network that estimates
uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model, hence providing a proxy
measure of task-specific image quality that is learnt directly from the data.
By augmenting the training data with different types of simulated k-space
artefacts, we propose a novel cascading CNN architecture based on a
student-teacher framework to decouple sources of uncertainty related to
different k-space augmentations in an entirely self-supervised manner. This
enables us to predict separate uncertainty quantities for the different types
of data degradation. While the uncertainty measures reflect the presence and
severity of image artefacts, the network also provides the segmentation
predictions given the quality of the data. We show models trained with
simulated artefacts provide informative measures of uncertainty on real-world
images and we validate our uncertainty predictions on problematic images
identified by human-raters.

neutral particles, by enabling the emulation of exotic phenomena once thought
to be exclusive to charged particles. In particular, pseudo-magnetic fields
generated by nonuniform strain in artificial lattices have attracted
considerable interest because of their simple geometrical origin. However, to
date, these strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields have failed to emulate the
tunability of real magnetic fields because they are dictated solely by the
strain configuration. Here, we overcome this apparent limitation for polaritons
supported by strained metasurfaces, which can be realized with classical dipole
antennas or quantum dipole emitters. Without altering the strain configuration,
we unveil how one can tune the pseudo-magnetic field by modifying the
electromagnetic environment via an enclosing photonic cavity which modifies the
nature of the interactions between the dipoles. Remarkably, due to the
competition between short-range Coulomb interactions and long-range
photon-mediated interactions, we find that the pseudo-magnetic field can be
entirely switched off at a critical cavity height for any strain configuration.
Consequently, by varying only the cavity height, we demonstrate a tunable
Lorentz-like force that can be switched on/off and an unprecedented collapse
and revival of polariton Landau levels. Unlocking this tunable pseudo-magnetism
for the first time poses new intriguing questions beyond the paradigm of

$F_0$, i.e., the summed weights of the elements in the data set, that are
small, differentially private, and computationally efficient. Let a weight
vector $w\in(0,1]^u$ be given. For $x\in\{0,1\}^u$ we are interested in
estimating $\Vert x\circ w\Vert_1$ where $\circ$ is the Hadamard product
(entrywise product). Building on a technique of Kushilevitz et al.~(STOC 1998),
we introduce a sketch (depending on $w$) that is linear over GF(2), mapping a
vector $x\in \{0,1\}^u$ to $Hx\in\{0,1\}^\tau$ for a matrix $H$ sampled from a
suitable distribution $\mathcal{H}$. Differential privacy is achieved by using
randomized response, flipping each bit of $Hx$ with probability $p<1/2$. We
show that for every choice of $0<\beta < 1$ and $\varepsilon=O(1)$ there exists
$p<1/2$ and a distribution $\mathcal{H}$ of linear sketches of size $\tau =
O(\log^2(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$ such that: 1) For random
$H\sim\mathcal{H}$ and noise vector $\varphi$, given $Hx + \varphi$ we can
compute an estimate of $\Vert x\circ w\Vert_1$ that is accurate within a factor
$1\pm\beta$, plus additive error $O(\log(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$, with
probability $1-1/u$, and 2) For every $H\sim\mathcal{H}$, $Hx + \varphi$ is
$\varepsilon$-differentially private over the randomness in $\varphi$. The
special case $w=(1,\dots,1)$ is unweighted $F_0$. Our results both improve the
efficiency of existing methods for unweighted $F_0$ estimating and extend to a
weighted generalization. We also give a distributed streaming implementation
for estimating the size of the union between two input streams.

numerically that the proposed substrates modify substantially the out-of-plane

staggered anisotropy, combined with a proper band inversion, leads to the
opening of a topological gap of the magnon spectrum. Since the gap is opened
non-symmetrically at the K+ and K- points of the Brillouin zone, an imbalance
in the magnon population between these two valleys can be created under a
driving force. This phenomenon is in close analogy to the so-called valley Hall
effect (VHE), and thus termed as magnon valley Hall effect (MVHE). In linear
response to a temperature gradient we quantify this effect by the evaluation of
the temperature-dependence of the magnon thermal Hall effect. These findings
open a different avenue by adding the valley degrees of freedom besides the
spin, in the study of magnons.

of constant negative curvature using generalized Bowen-Series boundary maps and
their natural extensions associated to cocompact torsion-free Fuchsian groups.
If the boundary map parameters are extremal, that is, each is an endpoint of a
geodesic that extends a side of the fundamental polygon, then the natural
extension map has a domain with finite rectangular structure, and the
associated arithmetic cross-section is parametrized by this set. This
construction allows us to represent the geodesic flow as a special flow over a
symbolic system of coding sequences. Moreover, each extremal parameter has a
corresponding dual parameter choice such that the ""past"" of the arithmetic code
of a geodesic is the ""future"" for the code using the dual parameter. This
duality was observed for two classical parameter choices by Adler and Flatto;
here we show constructively that every extremal parameter set has a dual.

$u$ belongs to $H^{2s-t,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ as long as $2s-t < 1$.
  The increase in differentiability is independent of the H\""older coefficient
of $K$. For example, our result shows that if $f\in L^{p}_{loc}$ then $u\in
H^{2s-\delta,p}_{loc}$ for any $\delta\in (0, s]$ as long as $2s-\delta < 1$.
This is different than the classical analogue of divergence-form equations
${\rm div}(\bar{K} \nabla u) = f$ (i.e. $s=1$) where a $C^\gamma$-H\""older
continuous coefficient $\bar{K}$ only allows for estimates of order
$H^{1+\gamma}$. In fact, it is another appearance of the differential stability
effect observed in many forms by many authors for this kind of nonlocal
equations -- only that in our case we do not get a ""small"" differentiability
improvement, but all the way up to $\min\{2s-t,1\}$.
  The proof argues by comparison with the (much simpler) equation \[

(-\Delta)^{\frac{2s-t}{2}} \varphi(z)\, dz = \langle g,\varphi\rangle \quad

H\""older continuous and $s,t, 2s-t \in (0,1)$ then the ""commutator"" \[
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} K(z,z) (-\Delta)^{\frac{t}{2}} u(z) \,

has been widely used for reporting outcomes of hypothesis tests. However,
p-value is often misinterpreted, misused or miscommunicated in practice. Part
of the issue is that existing definitions of p-value are often derived from
constructions under specific settings, and a general definition that directly
reflects the evidence of the null hypothesis is not yet available. In this
article, we first propose a general and rigorous definition of p-value that
fulfills two performance-based characteristics. The performance-based
definition subsumes all existing construction-based definitions of the p-value,
and justifies their interpretations. The paper further presents a specific
approach based on confidence distribution to formulate and calculate p-values.
This specific way of computing p values has two main advantages. First, it is
applicable for a wide range of hypothesis testing problems, including the
standard one- and two-sided tests, tests with interval-type null,
intersection-union tests, multivariate tests and so on. Second, it can
naturally lead to a coherent interpretation of p-value as evidence in support
of the null hypothesis, as well as a meaningful measure of degree of such
support. In particular, it places a meaning of a large p-value, e.g. p-value of
0.8 has more support than 0.5. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the
wide applicability and computational feasibility of our approach. We show that
our proposal is effective and can be applied broadly, without further
consideration of the form/size of the null space. As for existing testing
methods, the solutions have not been available or cannot be easily obtained.

Fashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream
classification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated
samples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit
D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate
typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and
samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these
limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression
factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a
lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how
generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28
images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed
to recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification
problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from a
quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with an
MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as
an MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder
approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current
RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even
more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system.

the class of commutative dynamics. The use of the damping-basis formalism

terminals) with minimal infrastructure cost and throughput constraints. This
so-called middle-mile network optimization, which includes topology

  In this paper, we provide the first polynomial time approximation solution
for a generalized version of the middle-mile network optimization problem,
wherein point-to-point (i.e., WiFi p2p) links are deployed to bridge last-mile

$O(\ln{|A|}+\frac{|B|}{|A|}+\frac{|A|+|B|}{\gamma})$, where A and B

state-of-the-art atom-ion experiments is represented by the micromotion
component of the ions' dynamics in a Paul trap, as the presence of micromotion
in atom-ion collisions results in a heating mechanism that prevents atom-ion
mixtures from undergoing a coherent evolution. Here we report the design and
the simulation of a novel ion trapping setup especially conceived for the
integration with an ultracold atoms experiment. The ion confinement is realized
by using an electro-optical trap based on the combination of an optical and an
electrostatic field, so that no micromotion component will be present in the
ions' dynamics. The confining optical field is generated by a deep optical
lattice created at the crossing of a bow-tie cavity, while a static electric
quadrupole ensures the ions' confinement in the plane orthogonal to the optical
lattice. The setup is also equipped with a Paul trap for cooling the ions
produced by photoionization of a hot atomic beam, and the design of the two ion
traps facilitates the swapping of the ions from the Paul trap to the
electro-optical trap.

process. However, even in presence of clear incentives, the dynamics involved
can be incredibly complex. Specifically, formations of large groups of
similarly opinionated individuals could create a condition of `support-bubbles'
or spontaneous polarization that renders consensus virtually unattainable
(e.g., the question of the UK exiting the EU). There have been earlier attempts
in capturing the dynamics of consensus formation in societies through simple
$Z_2$-symmetric models hoping to capture the essential dynamics of average
behaviorof a large number of individuals in a statistical sense. However, in
absence of external noise, they tend to reach a frozen state with fragmented
and polarized states i.e., two or more groups of similarly opinionated groups
with frozen dynamics. Here we show in a kinetic exchange opinion model (KEM)
considered on $L \times L$ square lattices, that while such frozen states could
be avoided, an exponentially slow approach to consensus is manifested.
Specifically, the system could either reach consensus in a time that scales as
$L^2$ or a long lived metastable state (termed a domain-wall state) for which
formation of consensus takes a time scaling as $L^{3.6}$. The latter behavior
is comparable to some voter-like models with intermediate states studied
previously. The late-time anomaly in the time scale is reflected in the
persistence probability of the model. Finally, the interval of zero-crossing of
the average opinion i.e., the time interval over which the average opinion does
not change sign is shown to follow a scale free distribution, which is compared
with that seen in the opinion surveys regarding Brexit and associated issues in
the last 40 years. The issue of minority spreading is also addressed by
calculating the exit probability.

The system is presented with several choices of quantizers, along with the cost
of operating each quantizer. The objective is to jointly select the quantizers

performance and quantization cost. Under certain assumptions, this problem can
be decoupled into two optimization problems: one for optimal controller
synthesis and the other for optimal quantizer selection. We show that,
similarly to the classical LQG problem, the optimal controller synthesis
subproblem is characterized by Riccati equations. On the other hand, the
optimal quantizer selection policy is found by solving a certain

uncovers missing annotations by transferring functional knowledge between
species' sequence-conserved regions. Because SA is imperfect, network alignment
(NA) complements SA by transferring functional knowledge between conserved
biological network, rather than just sequence, regions of different species.
Existing NA assumes that it is topological similarity (isomorphic-like
matching) between network regions that corresponds to the regions' functional
relatedness. However, we recently found that functionally unrelated proteins
are almost as topologically similar as functionally related proteins. So, we
redefined NA as a data-driven framework, TARA, which learns from network and
protein functional data what kind of topological relatedness (rather than
similarity) between proteins corresponds to the proteins' functional
relatedness. TARA used topological information (within each network) but not
sequence information (between proteins across networks). Yet, its alignments
yielded higher protein functional prediction accuracy than alignments of
existing NA methods, even those that used both topological and sequence
information. Here, we propose TARA++ that is also data-driven, like TARA and
unlike other existing methods, but that uses across-network sequence
information on top of within-network topological information, unlike TARA. To
deal with the within-and-across-network analysis, we adapt social network

Our sample includes a robust sub-sample of 61 objects for which we confidently
exclude low-redshift and star-forming solutions. We identify 10 robust objects
at $z>3$, of which 2 are at $z>4$. We report formation redshifts, demonstrating
that the oldest objects formed at $z > 6$, however individual ages from our

demonstrate that the UVJ colours of the quiescent population evolve with
redshift at $z>3$, becoming bluer and more similar to post-starburst galaxies
at lower redshift. Based upon this we construct a model for the time-evolution
of quiescent galaxy UVJ colours, concluding that the oldest objects are
consistent with forming the bulk of their stellar mass at $z\sim6-7$ and
quenching at $z\sim5$. We report spectroscopic redshifts for two of our objects

$>10$ per cent respectively. We finally report that our highest-redshift robust
object exhibits a continuum break at $\lambda\sim7000$A in a spectrum from
VUDS, consistent with our photometric redshift of
$z_\mathrm{phot}=4.72^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$. If confirmed as quiescent this object
would be the highest-redshift known quiescent galaxy. To obtain stronger
constraints on the times of the earliest quenching events, high-SNR
spectroscopy must be extended to $z\gtrsim3$ quiescent objects.

non-intersecting loops on the hexagonal lattice, parameterized by $(n,x)$,
where $n$ is a loop weight and $x$ is an edge weight. Nienhuis predicts that,
for $0 \leq n \leq 2$, the model exhibits two regimes: one with short loops
when $x < x_c(n)$, and another with macroscopic loops when $x \geq x_c(n)$,
where $x_c(n) = 1/\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2-n}}$.
  In this paper, we prove three results regarding the existence of long loops
in the loop $O(n)$ model. Specifically, we show that, for some $\delta >0$ and
any $(n,x) \in [1,1+\delta) \times (1- \delta, 1]$, there are arbitrarily long
loops surrounding typical faces in a finite domain. If $n \in [1,1+\delta)$ and
$x \in (1-\delta,1/\sqrt{n}]$, we can conclude the loops are macroscopic. Next,
we prove the existence of loops whose diameter is comparable to that of a
finite domain whenever $n=1, x \in (1,\sqrt{3}]$; this regime is equivalent to
part of the antiferromagnetic regime of the Ising model on the triangular
lattice. Finally, we show the existence of non-contractible loops on a torus
when $n \in [1,2], x=1$.
  The main ingredients of the proof are: (i) the `XOR trick': if $\omega$ is a
collection of short loops and $\Gamma$ is a long loop, then the symmetric
difference of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$ necessarily includes a long loop as well;
(ii) a reduction of the problem of finding long loops to proving that a
percolation process on an auxiliary graph, built using the Chayes--Machta and
Edwards--Sokal geometric expansions, has no infinite connected components; and
(iii) a recent result on the percolation threshold of Benjamini--Schramm limits
of planar graphs.

any binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel and any epsilon > 2
epsilon*, where epsilon^* = \frac{1}{6}-\frac{5}{3}\log{\frac{4}{3}} \approx
0.085, we show an explicit sequence of capacity-achieving codes with all the

strategy for free-breathing pulmonary MRI by combining a motion compensation
reconstruction with a UTE acquisition, called iMoCo UTE. Methods, An optimized
golden angle ordering radial UTE sequence was used to continuously acquire data
for 5 minutes. All readouts were grouped to different respiratory motion states
based on self-navigator signals, then motion resolved data was reconstructed by
XD Golden angle RAdial Sparse Parallel reconstruction (XD GRASP). One state
from the motion resolved images was selected as a reference, and motion fields
from the other states to the reference were derived via non-rigid registration.
Finally, all motion resolved data and motion fields were reconstructed by using
an iterative motion compensation reconstruction with a total generalized
variation sparse constraint. Results, The iMoCo UTE strategy was evaluated in
volunteers and non-sedated pediatric patient(4-6 y/o) studies. Images
reconstructed with iMoCo UTE provided sharper anatomical lung structures, and
higher apparent SNR and CNR, compared to using other motion correction
strategies, such as soft-gating, motion resolved reconstruction, and non-rigid
motion compensation(MoCo). iMoCo UTE also showed promising results in an infant
study. Conclusions, The proposed iMoCo UTE combines self-navigation, motion
modeling, and a compressed sensing reconstruction to increase scan efficiency,
SNR, and reduce respiratory motion in lung MRI. This proposed strategy shows
improvements in free breathing lung MRI scans, especially in very challenging

degree greedy algorithm for this problem. This algorithm iteratively chooses a
minimum degree vertex in the graph, adds it to the solution and removes its
neighbors, until the remaining graph is empty. The approximation ratios of this
algorithm have been very widely studied, where it is augmented with an advice
that tells the greedy which minimum degree vertex to choose if it is not
unique. Our main contribution is a new mathematical theory for the design of
such greedy algorithms with efficiently computable advice and for the analysis
of their approximation ratios. With this new theory we obtain the ultimate
approximation ratio of 5/4 for greedy on graphs with maximum degree 3, which
completely solves the open problem from the paper by Halldorsson and Yoshihara
(1995). Our algorithm is the fastest currently known algorithm with this
approximation ratio on such graphs. We apply our new algorithm to the minimum
vertex cover problem on graphs with maximum degree 3 to obtain a substantially
faster 6/5-approximation algorithm than the one currently known. We complement
our positive, upper bound results with negative, lower bound results which
prove that the problem of designing good advice for greedy is computationally
hard and even hard to approximate on various classes of graphs. These results
significantly improve on such previously known hardness results. Moreover,
these results suggest that obtaining the upper bound results on the design and
analysis of greedy advice is non-trivial.

spectroscopically find two ranges of average sizes of Ar, Kr, and Xe

research for decades due to their richness as a nonlinear dynamical system and
their relevance to applications in transportation, aeronautics, and energy
conversion. Recently, it has been observed that turbulent bluff-body wakes
exhibit a subharmonic resonant response when excited with specific spatial
symmetries at twice the natural vortex shedding frequency, which is
hypothesized to be caused by triadic interactions. The focus of this paper is
to provide new physical insight into the dynamics of turbulent oscillator
flows, based on improved mechanistic models informed by a comprehensive
experimental study of the turbulent wake behind a D-shaped body under periodic
forcing. We confirm for the first time the role of resonant triadic
interactions in the forced flow by studying the dominant components in the
power spectra across multiple excitation frequencies and amplitudes. We then
develop an extended Stuart-Landau model for the forced global wake mode,
incorporating parametric and non-harmonic forcing. This model captures the
system dynamics and reveals the boundaries of multiple synchronization regions.
Further, it is possible to identify model coefficients from sparse measurement
data, making it applicable to a wide range of turbulent oscillator flows. We
believe these generalized synchronization models will be valuable for
prediction, control, and understanding of the underlying physics in this
ubiquitous class of flows.

  None of the existing decomposition methods and algorithms, including the most

  In order to meet the AHM formulation and to extract the IFs of the decomposed

to an analytic function in the upper half of the complex plane via the Hilbert

  Unfortunately, this approach most often fails to resolve the inverse problem
satisfactorily.
  More recently, to resolve the inverse problem, the notion of synchrosqueezed

  Our method is localized, as illustrated by a number of numerical examples,
including components with different signal arrival and departure times.

and F814W images taken with Hubble Space Telescope as part of the GHOSTS
survey. The constructed CMDs of stars reach down to two magnitudes below the
tip of the red giant branch. We derived radial number density profiles of the
bright red giant branch (RGB) stars. The mean color of the RGB stars at $R
\sim$ 40 -- 60 kpc is similar to those of metal-poor globular clusters in the
Milky Way. We also derived radial surface brightness profiles using the public
image data provided by the Dragonfly team. Both the radial number density and
surface brightness profiles were converted to radial mass density profiles and
combined. We find that the mass density profiles show a weak upturn at the very
outer region, where surface brightness is as faint as $\mu_g\approx 34$ mag
arcsec$^{-1}$. An exponential disk + power-law halo model on the mass density
profiles finds the total stellar halo mass of $M_{halo}=8.2_{-2.2}^{+3.5}\times
10^7M_\odot$. The total stellar halo mass does not exceed $M_{halo} = 3.2
\times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$ when strongly truncated disk models are considered.
Combining the halo mass with the total stellar mass of M101, we obtain the
stellar halo mass fraction of $M_{halo}/M_{gal} = 0.20_{-0.08}^{+0.10}\%$ with
an upper limit of 0.78\%. We compare the halo properties of M101 with those of
six GHOSTS survey galaxies as well as the Milky Way and M31 and find that M101
has an anemic stellar halo.

tangential velocity vectors obtained from 3D morpho-kinematic models and the
observed proper motion vectors to estimate the distance. We applied the DMT to
four PNe (NGC 6702, NGC 6543, NGC 6302, and BD+30 3639) and one nova remnant

New simple morpho-kinematic shape models were generated for NGC 6543, NGC 6302,

We demonstrate that the DMT is a useful tool to obtain distance values of PNe,

Distances are also derived from the trigonometric Gaia parallaxes. The effect
of the non-negligible parallax offset in the second Gaia data release is also

periodicity $L$, we derive a $1/L$ expansion of the matrix element through
$\mathcal O(1/L^5)$ and find that it is governed by two universal
current-dependent parameters, the scalar charge and the threshold two-particle
form factor. We confirm the result through a numerical study of the general
formalism and additionally through an independent perturbative calculation. We
further demonstrate a consistency with the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, which can
be used to relate the $1/L$ expansions of the ground-state energy and matrix
element. The latter gives a simple insight into why the leading volume
corrections to the matrix element have the same scaling as those in the energy,
$1/L^3$, in contradiction to earlier work, which found a $1/L^2$ contribution
to the matrix element. We show here that such a term arises at intermediate
stages in the perturbative calculation, but cancels in the final result.

complex temporal structure. However, training RNNs has traditionally proved
challenging due to exploding or vanishing of gradients. RNN models such as
LSTMs and GRUs (and their variants) significantly mitigate these issues
associated with training by introducing various types of gating units into the
architecture. While these gates empirically improve performance, how the
addition of gates influences the dynamics and trainability of GRUs and LSTMs is
not well understood. Here, we take the perspective of studying randomly
initialized LSTMs and GRUs as dynamical systems, and ask how the salient
dynamical properties are shaped by the gates. We leverage tools from random
matrix theory and mean-field theory to study the state-to-state Jacobians of
GRUs and LSTMs. We show that the update gate in the GRU and the forget gate in
the LSTM can lead to an accumulation of slow modes in the dynamics. Moreover,
the GRU update gate can poise the system at a marginally stable point. The
reset gate in the GRU and the output and input gates in the LSTM control the
spectral radius of the Jacobian, and the GRU reset gate also modulates the
complexity of the landscape of fixed-points. Furthermore, for the GRU we obtain
a phase diagram describing the statistical properties of fixed-points. We also
provide a preliminary comparison of training performance to the various
dynamical regimes realized by varying hyperparameters. Looking to the future,
we have introduced a powerful set of techniques which can be adapted to a broad
class of RNNs, to study the influence of various architectural choices on
dynamics, and potentially motivate the principled discovery of novel
architectures.

by synchronous integrators and variable dimming frequency, to achieve both high
efficiency and high performance dimming. By using the proposed variable dimming
frequency scheme, high dimming frequency is applied to a string with high
dimming ratio, which helps to maintain the deviation of LED string current in
an acceptable range, while low dimming frequency is applied to a string with
low dimming ratio, which helps to achieve rectangular LED current waveform.
Meanwhile, the new time multiplexing control scheme automatically optimizes the
LED string's bus voltages, thus minimizes each string's power loss. A three

problem of seismic imaging. PDE-constrained optimization is used to determine
unknown parameters in a wave equation that represent geophysical properties.
The objective function measures the misfit between the observed data and the
calculated synthetic data, and it has traditionally been the least-squares
norm. In a sequence of papers, we introduced the Wasserstein metric from
optimal transport as an alternative misfit function for mitigating the
so-called cycle skipping, which is the trapping of the optimization process in
local minima. In this paper, we first give a sharper theorem regarding the
convexity of the Wasserstein metric as the objective function. We then focus on
two new issues. One is the necessary normalization of turning seismic signals
into probability measures such that the theory of optimal transport applies.
The other, which is beyond cycle skipping, is the inversion for parameters
below reflecting interfaces. For the first, we propose a class of
normalizations and prove several favorable properties for this class. For the
latter, we demonstrate that FWI using optimal transport can recover geophysical
properties from domains where no seismic waves travel through. We finally
illustrate these properties by the realistic application of imaging salt
inclusions, which has been a significant challenge in exploration geophysics.

  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a semi-structured interview to collect
feedback and preferences in six key areas of PGx CDS design, from clinicians
who had prior experience with live PGx CDS tools. Eight clinicians from
Northwestern Medicine's (NM) General Internal Medicine clinic participated in
the study.
  RESULTS: Clinicians expressed preference for interruptive pop-up alerts
during order entry, brief descriptions of relevant drug-gene interactions, and
a clear and specific recommended alternative course of action when a medication
is contraindicated. They did not wish to see detailed genetic data, preferring
phenotypic information predicted from the genotype. Nor did they wish to be
interrupted when genetic test results do not indicate a change in treatment
plan. Clinicians reported little familiarity with Clinical Pharmacogenetic
Implementation Consortium prescribing recommendations but reported trusting
recommendations of their professional societies and resources like UpToDate.
Analysis of unstructured comments concurred with structured results, indicating
a general uncertainty among participants around how to interpret and apply PGx
information in practice.
  DISCUSSION: Results point to several underlying principles that can inform
future PGx CDS alert designs: Be Specific and Actionable; Be Brief; Display
Phenotypes not Genotypes; Rely on Sources Clinicians Already Trust; and, Be
Adaptable to Learning Effects.
  CONCLUSION: This study is part of a broader socio-technical design approach
to PGx CDS design underway at NM and provides a baseline for future PGx CDS
development. Designs based on these results have the potential to improve
clinician education and adherence levels, and to improve patient outcomes.

stellar origin black hole (BH) mergers. A promising channel for accelerated BH
merger lies in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks of gas around super-masssive
black holes. Here we investigate the relative number of compact object mergers
in AGN disk models, including BH, neutron stars (NS) and white dwarfs, via
Monte Carlo simulations. We find the number of all merger types in the bulk
disk grows $\propto t^{1/3}$ which is driven by the Hill sphere of the more
massive merger component. Median mass ratios of NS-BH mergers in AGN disks are
$\tilde{q}=0.07\pm 0.06(0.14\pm 0.07)$ for mass functions (MF) $M^{-1(-2)}$. If
a fraction $f_{AGN}$ of the observed rate of BH-BH mergers
(${\cal}{R}_{BH-BH}$) come from AGN, we expect a rate of NS-BH (NS-NS) mergers
from the AGN channel of ${\cal}{R}_{BH-NS} \sim f_{AGN}[10,300]\rm{Gpc}^{-3}
\rm{yr}^{-1}$,(${\cal}{R}_{NS-NS} \leq f_{AGN}400\rm{Gpc}^{-3} \rm{yr}^{-1}$).
Allowing for the ratio of NS-NS/BH-BH LIGO search volumes, from preliminary O3
results we can rule out the AGN channel as a dominant contribution to observed
NS-NS mergers. The number of lower mass gap events in this channel is a strong
function of the nuclear MF and mass segregation efficiency. Compact object
merger ratios derived from LIGO can restrict models of MF, mass segregation and
populations embedded in AGN disks. The expected number of EM counterparts to
NS-BH mergers in AGN disks at $z<1$ is $\sim
[30,900]{\rm{yr}}^{-1}(f_{AGN}/0.1)$. EM searches for flaring due to embedded
events in large AGN surveys will complement LIGO constraints on AGN models and
the embedded populations that must live in them.

support (CDS) alerts, built to adhere to PGx CDS design principles developed
through socio-technical approaches.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on previously identified design principles, we
created 11 new PGx CDS alert designs and developed an interactive web
application containing realistic clinical scenarios and user workflows that
mimicked a real-world EHR system. We recruited General Internal Medicine and
Cardiology clinicians from Northwestern Medicine and recorded their
interactions with the original and new designs. We measured clinician response,
satisfaction, speed, and confidence through questionnaires and analysis of the
recordings.
  RESULTS: The study included 12 clinicians. Participants were significantly
more satisfied (p=0.0000001), faster (p=0.009), and more confident (p<.05) with
the new designs than the original ones. The study lacked statistical power to
determine whether prescribing accuracy was improved, but participants were no
less accurate, and clinical actions were more concordant with alert
interactions (p=0.004) with the new designs. We found a significant learning
curve associated with the original designs, which was eliminated with the new
designs.
  DISCUSSION: This study successfully demonstrates that socio-technical and
user-centered design techniques can improve PGx CDS alert designs. Best
practices for PGx CDS design are limited in the literature, with few
effectiveness studies available. These results can help guide future PGx CDS
implementations to be more clinician friendly and less time-consuming.
  CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the PGx CDS design principles
we proposed in previous work. As a next step, the new designs should be
implemented in a live setting for further validation.

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes consider Langevin dynamics for the particle

However, experiments show that migrating cells may present a varying speed as

insight that makes this practical is the use of Fourier series approximations
to the logarithm that allows the entropy component of the free-energy to be
estimated through a sequence of simpler measurements that can be combined
together using classical post processing. We further show that this approach is
efficient for generating high-temperature Gibbs states, within constant error,

quantum circuit are sufficiently close to a global optima. Finally, we examine
the procedure numerically and show the viability of our approach for five-qubit

be extended at extra cost. This problem plays an important role in stochastic
environments such as in surgery scheduling: Patients must be assigned to
operating rooms beforehand, such that the regular capacity is fully utilized
while the amount of overtime is as small as possible.
  This paper focuses on essential ratios between different classes of policies:
First, we consider the price of non-splittability, in which we compare the
optimal non-anticipatory policy against the optimal fractional assignment
policy. We show that this ratio has a tight upper bound of $2$. Moreover, we
develop an analysis of a fixed assignment variant of the LEPT rule yielding a
tight approximation ratio of $(1+e^{-1}) \approx 1.368$.
  Furthermore, we prove that the price of fixed assignments, related to the
benefit of adaptivity, which describes the loss when restricting to fixed
assignment policies, is within the same factor. This shows that in some sense,
LEPT is the best fixed assignment policy we can hope for. We also provide a
lower bound on the performance of this policy comparing against an optimal
fixed assignment policy. Finally, we obtain improved bounds for the case where
the processing times are drawn from a particular family of distributions, with
either a bounded Pietra index or when the familly is stochastically dominated

found in the Extremely Low Mass (ELM) Survey, a spectroscopic survey targeting
<0.3 Msun He-core WDs completed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint. Over
the course of the survey we observed ancillary low mass WD candidates like
GD278, which we show is a P=0.19 d double WD binary, as well as candidates that
turn out to be field blue straggler/subdwarf A-type stars with luminosities too
large to be WDs given their Gaia parallaxes. Here, we define a clean sample of
ELM WDs that is complete within our target selection and magnitude range
15<g_0<20 mag. The measurements are consistent with 100% of ELM WDs being
0.0089 < P < 1.5 d double WD binaries, 35% of which belong to the Galactic
halo. We infer these are mostly He+CO WD binaries given the measurement
constraints. The merger rate of the observed He+CO WD binaries exceeds the
formation rate of stable mass transfer AM CVn binaries by a factor of 25, and
so the majority of He+CO WD binaries must experience unstable mass transfer and
merge. The shortest-period systems like J0651+2844 are signature {\it LISA}
verification binaries that can be studied with gravitational waves and light.

impostor and genuine distributions for women shifting closer towards each other
is general across datasets of African-American, Caucasian, and Asian faces. We
show that the distribution of facial expressions may differ between
male/female, but that the accuracy difference persists for image subsets rated
confidently as neutral expression. The accuracy difference also persists for
image subsets rated as close to zero pitch angle. Even when removing images
with forehead partially occluded by hair/hat, the same impostor/genuine
accuracy difference persists. We show that the female genuine distribution
improves when only female images without facial cosmetics are used, but that
the female impostor distribution also degrades at the same time. Lastly, we
show that the accuracy difference persists even if a state-of-the-art deep
learning method is trained from scratch using training data explicitly balanced

based on the Bayesian approximation error approach to compensate for source

compute a low-order estimate for the actual skull conductivity value. By using
simulated EEG data that corresponds to focal source activity, we demonstrate
the potential of the method to reconstruct the underlying focal sources and

estimated errors are used to approximate the skull conductivity. The results
indicate clear improvements in the source localization accuracy and feasible

the batteries of such edge nodes. In this work, we study the effects of a
variety of battery draining attacks against edge nodes. Through simulation, we
clarify the extent to which such attacks are able to increase the usage and
hence waste the power resources of edge nodes. Specifically, we implement hello
flooding, packet flooding, selective forwarding, rank attack, and versioning
attack in ContikiOS and simulate them in the Cooja simulator, and measure and
report a number of time and power resource usage metrics including CPU time,
low power mode time, TX/RX time, and battery consumption. Besides, we test the

extensive measurements enable us to compare the effectiveness of these attacks.
Our results show that Versioning attack is the most severe attack in terms of
draining the power resources of the network, followed by Packet Flooding and
Hello Flood attacks. Furthermore, we confirm that Selective Forwarding and Rank
attacks are not able to considerably increase the power resource usage in our
scenarios. By quantifying the effects of these attacks, we demonstrate that
under specific scenarios, Versioning attack can be three to four times as
effective as Packet Flooding and Hello Flood attacks in wasting network
resources, while Packet Flooding is generally comparable to Hello Flood in CPU
and TX time usage increase but twice as powerful in draining device batteries.

because of its connections to the Brascamp-Lieb inequality in analysis. We use
this connection, together with novel results on quantum expanders, to show that

is biased toward predicting the most frequent class in the training data. In
the case of histopathologic images (HIs), both low-level and high-level data
augmentation (DA) techniques still present performance issues when applied in
the presence of inter-patient variability; whence the model tends to learn
color representations, which is related to the staining process. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach capable of not only augmenting HI dataset but also
distributing the inter-patient variability by means of image blending using the
Gaussian-Laplacian pyramid. The proposed approach consists of finding the
Gaussian pyramids of two images of different patients and finding the Laplacian
pyramids thereof. Afterwards, the left-half side and the right-half side of
different HIs are joined in each level of the Laplacian pyramid, and from the
joint pyramids, the original image is reconstructed. This composition combines
the stain variation of two patients, avoiding that color differences mislead
the learning process. Experimental results on the BreakHis dataset have shown
promising gains vis-a-vis the majority of DA techniques presented in the
literature.

Dirac points with the same Berry curvature in both valleys. For CrI$_3$

propose the MD-CRT and robust MD-CRT for integer vectors. Specifically, by
rephrasing the abstract CRT for rings in number-theoretic terms, we first
derive the MD-CRT for integer vectors with respect to a general set of integer

we derive the robust MD-CRT for integer vectors when the remaining integer

feature dependencies across scales and (ii) mutual beneficial relations
building bridges for the cooperation between counting and localization. Thus,
through message passing, HyGnn can distill rich relations between the nodes to
obtain more powerful representations, leading to robust and accurate results.
Our HyGnn performs significantly well on four challenging datasets:

populations, which display rhythmic dynamics that support interareal
communication. Understanding how stimulation of a particular brain area impacts
such concerted activity is important for gaining basic insights into brain
function and for developing neuromodulation as a therapeutic tool. However, it
remains difficult to predict the downstream effects of focal stimulation.
Specifically, little is known about how the collective oscillatory regime of
network activity may affect the outcomes of regional perturbations on
cooperative dynamics. Here, we combine connectome data and biophysical modeling
to begin filling these gaps. By tuning parameters that control the collective
dynamics of the network, we identify distinct states of simulated brain
activity, and investigate how the distributed effects of stimulation manifest
in different states. When baseline oscillations are weak, the stimulated area
exhibits enhanced power and frequency, and due to network interactions, nearby
regions develop phase locked activity in the excited frequency band.
Importantly, we find that focal stimulation also causes more distributed
modifications to network coherence at regions' baseline oscillation
frequencies, and that these effects are better predicted by functional rather
than structural connectivity. In contrast, when the network operates in a
regime of stronger endogenous oscillations, stimulation causes only slight
shifts in power and frequency, and network averaged changes in coherence are
more homogenous across the choice of the stimulated area. In sum, this work
builds upon and extends previous computational studies investigating the
impacts of stimulation, and highlights that both the stimulation site, and,
crucially, the regime of brain network dynamics, can influence the network wide
responses to local perturbations.

  School Vouchers",,,,,"econ.GN econ.EM q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop new robust discrete choice tools to learn about the average
willingness to pay for a price subsidy and its effects on demand given
exogenous, discrete variation in prices. Our starting point is a nonparametric,
nonseparable model of choice. We exploit the insight that our welfare
parameters in this model can be expressed as functions of demand for the
different alternatives. However, while the variation in the data reveals the
value of demand at the observed prices, the parameters generally depend on its
values beyond these prices. We show how to sharply characterize what we can
learn when demand is specified to be entirely nonparametric or to be
parameterized in a flexible manner, both of which imply that the parameters are
not necessarily point identified. We use our tools to analyze the welfare
effects of price subsidies provided by school vouchers in the DC Opportunity
Scholarship Program. We robustly find that the provision of the status quo
voucher and a wide range of counterfactual vouchers of different amounts have
positive benefits net of costs. This positive effect can be explained by the
popularity of low-tuition schools in the program; removing them from the
program can result in a negative net benefit. Relative to our bounds, we also
find that comparable logit estimates potentially understate the benefits for
certain voucher amounts, and provide a misleading sense of robustness for
alternative amounts.

deep neural networks on resource-limited devices. Post-training quantization is
highly desirable since it does not require retraining or access to the full
training dataset. The well-established uniform scheme for post-training
quantization achieves satisfactory results by converting neural networks from
full-precision to 8-bit fixed-point integers. However, it suffers from
significant performance degradation when quantizing to lower bit-widths. In
this paper, we propose a piecewise linear quantization (PWLQ) scheme to enable
accurate approximation for tensor values that have bell-shaped distributions
with long tails. Our approach breaks the entire quantization range into
non-overlapping regions for each tensor, with each region being assigned an
equal number of quantization levels. Optimal breakpoints that divide the entire
range are found by minimizing the quantization error. Compared to
state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods, experimental results show
that our proposed method achieves superior performance on image classification,
semantic segmentation, and object detection with minor overhead.

  Mutual Learning","Accepted to appear in AAAI'20",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Domain-adapted sentiment classification refers to training on a labeled
source domain to well infer document-level sentiment on an unlabeled target
domain. Most existing relevant models involve a feature extractor and a
sentiment classifier, where the feature extractor works towards learning
domain-invariant features from both domains, and the sentiment classifier is
trained only on the source domain to guide the feature extractor. As such, they
lack a mechanism to use sentiment polarity lying in the target domain. To
improve domain-adapted sentiment classification by learning sentiment from the
target domain as well, we devise a novel deep adversarial mutual learning
approach involving two groups of feature extractors, domain discriminators,
sentiment classifiers, and label probers. The domain discriminators enable the
feature extractors to obtain domain-invariant features. Meanwhile, the label
prober in each group explores document sentiment polarity of the target domain
through the sentiment prediction generated by the classifier in the peer group,
and guides the learning of the feature extractor in its own group. The proposed
approach achieves the mutual learning of the two groups in an end-to-end
manner. Experiments on multiple public datasets indicate our method obtains the
state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of mutual learning
through label probers.

and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. A typical mmWave link experiences more than
an order-of-magnitude larger path loss and is more susceptible to blockages
than a traditional sub-6 GHz link. Therefore, extensive measurement campaigns
with efficient channel sounders are needed for a complete understanding of the
mmWave propagation channel characteristics. In addition, solutions should be
sought to overcome the outage problems associated with the mmWave bands and to
achieve acceptable communication performance. In this paper, our 28 GHz channel
sounder is introduced that can be used with horn antennas as well as phased
array antennas. The two antenna types are then compared in terms of speed they
switch from one direction to another and extracted multipath component (MPC)
properties, such as path gain. We then propose the use of passive reflectors
and an active repeater for coverage enhancement by improving the received
signal strength. In particular, ECHO reflector and TURBO repeater are
introduced, and measurement results using them are presented.

input can outperform traditional beam-forming algorithms for automatic speech

preferable to have a multi-channel audio input over a single channel audio
input given limited bandwidth. Our results show that for the best WER, when one
of the two channels can be encoded with a bitrate higher than 32kbps, its
optimal to encode the other channel with the highest bitrate possible. For
bitrates lower than that, its preferable to distribute the bitrate equally
between the two channels. We further show that by training the acoustic model
on mixed bitrate input, up to 50% of the degradation can be recovered using a

a new model, whose performance is equivalent to that of a target model, via
query access to the target model efficiently, i.e., fewer datasets and
computational resources than those of the target model. Existing works have
dealt with only simple deep neural networks (DNNs), e.g., only three layers, as
targets of model extraction attacks, and hence are not aware of the
effectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with time-series
data. In this work, we shed light on the threats of model extraction attacks
against RNNs. We discuss whether a model with a higher accuracy can be
extracted with a simple RNN from a long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a
more complicated and powerful RNN. Specifically, we tackle the following
problems. First, in a case of a classification problem, such as image
recognition, extraction of an RNN model without final outputs from an LSTM
model is presented by utilizing outputs halfway through the sequence. Next, in
a case of a regression problem. such as in weather forecasting, a new attack by
newly configuring a loss function is presented. We conduct experiments on our
model extraction attacks against an RNN and an LSTM trained with publicly
available academic datasets. We then show that a model with a higher accuracy
can be extracted efficiently, especially through configuring a loss function
and a more complex architecture different from the target model.

Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) scenarios. We report the results from the Major
Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) observations in 2016 along with the
multi-wavelength data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift
instruments. MAGIC observed 1ES 1959+650 with different emission levels in the
very-high-energy (VHE, E >100 GeV) gamma-ray band during 2016. In the long-term
data, the X-ray spectrum becomes harder with increasing flux and a hint of a
similar trend is also visible in the VHE band. An exceptionally high VHE flux
reaching ~ 3 times the Crab Nebula flux was measured by MAGIC on the 13th, 14th
of June and 1st July 2016 (the highest flux observed since 2002). During these
flares, the high-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) lies in
the VHE domain and extends up to several TeV. The spectrum in the gamma-ray
(both Fermi-LAT and VHE bands) and the X-ray bands are quite hard. On 13th June
and 1st July 2016, the source showed rapid variations of the VHE flux within
timescales of less than an hour. A simple one-zone SSC model can describe the
data during the flares requiring moderate to high values of the Doppler factors
(>=30-60). Alternatively, the high-energy peak of the SED can be explained by a
purely hadronic model attributed to proton-synchrotron radiation with jet power
L_{jet}~10^{46} erg/s and under high values of the magnetic field strength
(~100 G) and maximum proton energy (~few EeV). Mixed lepto-hadronic models
require super-Eddington values of the jet power. We conclude that it is
difficult to get detectable neutrino emission from the source during the
extreme VHE flaring period of 2016.

paramagnetic (PM) - ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at T$_{c}$ = 220.5 K,
followed at lower temperature (T$_{g}$ = 7.7 K) by a transition to the cluster
spin glass (CSG) state. Analysis of the low-field Arrott plot isotherms, in the
critical region near T$_{c}$, in terms of the Aharony-Pytte scaling equation of
state clearly establishes that the PM-FM transition is basically driven by
random magnetic anisotropy (RMA). For temperatures below $\approx$ 30 K, large
enough RMA destroys long-range FM order by breaking up the infinite FM network
into FM clusters of finite size and leads to the formation of a CSG state at
temperatures T $\lesssim$ 8 K by promoting freezing of finite FM clusters in
random orientations. Increasing strength of the single-ion magnetocrystalline
anisotropy (and hence RMA) with decreasing temperature is taken to reflect an
increase in the number of low-spin (LS) Co$^{3+}$ ions at the expense of that
of high-spin (HS) Co$^{3+}$ ions. At intermediate temperatures (30 K $\lesssim

network (fast relaxation governed by a single anisotropy energy barrier) and
finite FM clusters (extremely slow stretched exponential relaxation due to

for both models is studied. Based on the numerical analysis, comparison of
cluster-level statistical properties between the proposed BDCM and existing
GBSM has shown that there exists little difference in the space, time, and
frequency correlation properties for two models. Also, based on the simulation,
coherence bandwidths of the two models in different scenarios are almost the
same. The computational complexity of the novel BDCM is much lower than the
existing GBSM. It can be observed that the proposed novel BDCM has similar
statistical properties to the existing GBSM at the clusterlevel. The proposed
BDCM has less complexity and is therefore more convenient for information
theory and signal processing research than the conventional GBSMs.

achieved convincing performance when a large amount of training data is
available. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting sufficient labeled
training data is expensive and sometimes impossible (e.g. for traffic collision
detection). Moreover, the conventional 2D representation of surveillance views
is easily affected by occlusions and different camera views in nature. To deal
with the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a training-free
monocular 3D event detection system for traffic surveillance. Our system
firstly projects the vehicles into the 3D Euclidean space and estimates their
kinematic states. Then we develop multiple simple yet effective ways to
identify the events based on the kinematic patterns, which need no further
training. Consequently, our system is robust to the occlusions and the
viewpoint changes. Exclusive experiments report the superior result of our
method on large-scale real-world surveillance datasets, which validates the
effectiveness of our proposed system.

Verification systems. Several recently organized challenges focus on handling
novel acoustic environments. Deep learning based speech enhancement is a modern
solution for this. Recently, a study proposed to optimize the enhancement
network in the activation space of a pre-trained auxiliary network. This
methodology, called deep feature loss, greatly improved over the
state-of-the-art conventional x-vector based system on a children speech
dataset called BabyTrain. This work analyzes various facets of that approach
and asks few novel questions in that context. We first search for optimal
number of auxiliary network activations, training data, and enhancement feature
dimension. Experiments reveal the importance of Signal-to-Noise Ratio filtering
that we employ to create a large, clean, and naturalistic corpus for
enhancement network training. To counter the ""mismatch"" problem in enhancement,
we find enhancing front-end (x-vector network) data helpful while harmful for
the back-end (Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA)). Importantly,
we find enhanced signals contain complementary information to original.
Established by combining them in front-end, this gives ~40% relative
improvement over the baseline. We also do an ablation study to remove a noise
class from x-vector data augmentation and, for such systems, we establish the
utility of enhancement regardless of whether it has seen that noise class
itself during training. Finally, we design several dereverberation schemes to
conclude ineffectiveness of deep feature loss enhancement scheme for this task.

available on the internet. Often, people use other people's pictures on their
own profile. Perceptual hashing is often used to detect whether two images are
identical. Therefore, it can be used to detect whether people are misusing
others' pictures. In perceptual hashing, a hash is calculated for a given
image, and a new test image is mapped to one of the existing hashes if
duplicate features are present. Therefore, it can be used as an image filter to
flag banned image content or adversarial attacks --which are modifications that
are made on purpose to deceive the filter-- even though the content might be
changed to deceive the filters. For this reason, it is critical for perceptual
hashing to be robust enough to take transformations such as resizing, cropping,
and slight pixel modifications into account. In this paper, we would like to
propose to experiment with effect of gaussian blurring in perceptual hashing
for detecting misuse of personal images specifically for face images. We
hypothesize that use of gaussian blurring on the image before calculating its
hash will increase the accuracy of our filter that detects adversarial attacks
which consist of image cropping, adding text annotation, and image rotation.

Some theoretical studies have suggested that the thermal conductivity of a

However, recent experiments on SWCNT bundles show that fullerene encapsulation
leads to a reduction rather than an increase in thermal conductivity. Here, we
employ three different molecular dynamics methods to study the influence of
C$_{60}$ encapsulation on heat transport in a $(10,10)$ SWCNT. All the three

experimental results on bundles of SWCNTs. We demonstrate that there is a
simulation artifact in the Green-Kubo method which gives anomalously large
thermal conductivity from artificial convection. Our results show that the
C$_{60}$ molecules conduct little heat compared to the outer SWCNT and reduce
the phonon mean free paths of the SWCNT by inducing extra phonon scattering. We
also find that the thermal conductivity of a $(10,10)$ SWCNT monotonically
decreases with increasing filling ratio of C$_{60}$ molecules.

related to the thermal properties of the materials on the surface. We describe
a numerical model for studying the thermal conductivity of particulate regolith
in vacuum. Heat diffusion and surface-to-surface radiation calculations are
performed using the finite element (FE) method in three-dimensional meshed
geometries of randomly packed spherical particles. We validate the model for
test cases where the total solid and radiative conductivity values of
particulates with monodisperse particle size frequency distributions (SFDs) are
determined at steady-state thermal conditions. Then, we use the model to study
the bulk radiative thermal conductivity of particulates with polydisperse,
cumulative power-law particle SFDs. We show that for each polydisperse
particulate geometry tested, there is a corresponding monodisperse geometry
with some effective particle diameter that has an identical radiative thermal
conductivity. These effective diameters are found to correspond very well to
the Sauter mean particle diameter, which is essentially the
surface-area-weighted mean. Next, we show that the thermal conductivity of the
particle material can have an important effect on the radiative component of
the thermal conductivity of particulates, especially if the particle material
conductivity is very low or the spheres are relatively large, owing to
non-isothermality in each particle. We provide an empirical correlation to
predict the effects of non-isothermality on radiative thermal conductivity in
both monodisperse and polydisperse particulates.

structure, several kinds of atoms can be intercalated into T-carbon, making it
a versatile candidate in various applications such as hydrogen storage,
perovskite solar cells, lithium ion batteries, thermoelectrics, photocatalyst,
etc. Here we show that superconductivity can appear in Na-doped T-carbon with
superconducting transition temperature Tc of 11 K at ambient pressure, and Tc
can be enhanced to 19 K under pressure of 14 GPa, which results from an
enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling due to the shift of the phonon
spectral weight to lower frequencies with the increase of pressure. The
calculations on specific heat and electrical and thermal conductivities show
that the normal state of the Na-doped T-carbon superconductor reveals a
non-Fermi liquid behavior. The prediction of superconductivity in Na-doped
T-carbon would spur great interest both experimentally and theoretically to
explore novel carbon-based superconductors.

increasing need for faster execution and lower energy consumption for neural
model inference. Historically, the models run on mobile devices have been
smaller and simpler in comparison to large state-of-the-art research models,
which can only run on the cloud. However, cloud-only inference has drawbacks
such as increased network bandwidth consumption and higher latency. In
addition, cloud-only inference requires the input data (images, audio) to be
fully transferred to the cloud, creating concerns about potential privacy
breaches. We demonstrate an alternative approach: shared mobile-cloud
inference. Partial inference is performed on the mobile in order to reduce the
dimensionality of the input data and arrive at a compact feature tensor, which
is a latent space representation of the input signal. The feature tensor is
then transmitted to the server for further inference. This strategy can improve
inference latency, energy consumption, and network bandwidth usage, as well as
provide privacy protection, because the original signal never leaves the
mobile. Further performance gain can be achieved by compressing the feature
tensor before its transmission.

with the help of a multi-element IRS in the presence of interference generated
by a multi-antenna BS serving its own single-antenna user. The signal and
interference links via the IRS are modeled with Rician fading. To reduce phase
adjustment cost, we adopt quasi-static phase shift design where the phase
shifts do not change with the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). We
investigate two cases of CSI at the BSs, namely, the instantaneous CSI case and
the statistical CSI case, and apply Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) based on
the complete CSI and the CSI of the Line-of-sight (LoS) components,
respectively. Different costs on channel estimation and beamforming adjustment
are incurred in the two CSI cases. First, we obtain a tractable expression of
the average rate in the instantaneous CSI case and a tractable expression of
the ergodic rate in the statistical CSI case. We also provide sufficient
conditions for the average rate in the instantaneous CSI case to surpass the
ergodic rate in the statistical CSI case, at any phase shifts. Then, we
maximize the average rate and ergodic rate, both with respect to the phase
shifts, leading to two non-convex optimization problems. For each problem, we
obtain a globally optimal solution under certain system parameters, and propose
an iterative algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent (PCD) to obtain a
stationary point under arbitrary system parameters. Next, in each CSI case, we
provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal quasi-static phase shift
design is beneficial, compared to the system without IRS. Finally, we
numerically verify the analytical results and demonstrate notable gains of the

multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data.
Therefore, we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash
learning field, and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model, which
has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper,
we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view

networks, RiFa embeds the subject and object respectively to distinguish their
semantic differences and meanwhile preserve their underlying semantic
properties. Then, it further predicts subject-object relations based on both
the visual and semantic features of entities under certain contextual area, and
fairly ranks the relation predictions for those with a few annotations.
Experiments on the popular Visual Genome dataset show that RiFa achieves
state-of-the-art performance under several challenging settings of scene graph

semantic properties of relations, and obtains the best overall per relation

only an impedance analyzer and a copper strip coil to detect L-band EPR (f =
1-3 GHz) in the standard EPR marker 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Our
method relies on measuring the magnetoimpedance (MI) response of DPPH through a
copper strip coil that encloses DPPH. In contrast to commercial EPR which
measures only the field derivative of power absorption, our method enables us
to deduce both absorption and dispersion. Changes in resistance (R) and
reactance (X) of the copper strip while sweeping an external dc magnetic field,
were measured for different frequencies (f = 0.9 to 2.5 GHz) of radio-frequency
current in the coil. R exhibits a sharp peak at a critical value of the dc
magnetic field, which is identified as the resonance field and X shows a
dispersion at the same frequency. The data were analyzed to obtain line width
and resonance field parameters. The resonance field increased linearly with
frequency and the obtained Land\'e g factor of 1.999 is close to the accepted
value of 2.0036, measured in X-band. The simplicity of this technique can be
exploited to study paramagnetic centers in catalysis and other materials.

perform better, especially in image classification tasks. However, they are
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adding small perturbations on examples
causes a good-performance model to misclassify the crafted examples, without
category differences in the human eyes, and fools deep models successfully.
There are two requirements for generating adversarial examples: the attack
success rate and image fidelity metrics. Generally, perturbations are increased
to ensure the adversarial examples' high attack success rate; however, the
adversarial examples obtained have poor concealment. To alleviate the tradeoff
between the attack success rate and image fidelity, we propose a method named
AdvJND, adding visual model coefficients, just noticeable difference
coefficients, in the constraint of a distortion function when generating
adversarial examples. In fact, the visual subjective feeling of the human eyes
is added as a priori information, which decides the distribution of
perturbations, to improve the image quality of adversarial examples. We tested
our method on the FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and MiniImageNet datasets. Adversarial
examples generated by our AdvJND algorithm yield gradient distributions that
are similar to those of the original inputs. Hence, the crafted noise can be
hidden in the original inputs, thus improving the attack concealment

and describe a wide variety of object instances in a video/image collection.
Due to the lack of proper mechanism in locating instances and deriving feature
representation, instance search is generally only effective for retrieving
instances of known object categories. In this paper, a simple but effective
instance-level feature representation is presented. Different from other
approaches, the issues in class-agnostic instance localization and distinctive
feature representation are considered. The former is achieved by detecting
salient instance regions from an image by a layer-wise back-propagation
process. The back-propagation starts from the last convolution layer of a
pre-trained CNN that is originally used for classification. The
back-propagation proceeds layer-by-layer until it reaches the input layer. This
allows the salient instance regions in the input image from both known and
unknown categories to be activated. Each activated salient region covers the
full or more usually a major range of an instance. The distinctive feature
representation is produced by average-pooling on the feature map of certain
layer with the detected instance region. Experiments show that such kind of
feature representation demonstrates considerably better performance over most
of the existing approaches. In addition, we show that the proposed feature
descriptor is also suitable for content-based image search.

the emotional patterns of speech, while preserving the speaker identity and

emotional patterns, which is not practical in real life. Moreover, they often
model the conversion of fundamental frequency (F0) with a simple linear
transform. As F0 is a key aspect of intonation that is hierarchical in nature,
we believe that it is more adequate to model F0 in different temporal scales by
using wavelet transform. We propose a CycleGAN network to find an optimal
pseudo pair from non-parallel training data by learning forward and inverse
mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. We also
study the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to decompose F0 into ten
temporal scales, that describes speech prosody at different time resolution,
for effective F0 conversion. Experimental results show that our proposed
framework outperforms the baselines both in objective and subjective
evaluations.

the treatment assignment mechanism (i) is neither designed nor implemented by

non-categorical errors are not considered. To model these non-categorical

categorical phone set. We apply a phonetic segment classifier to generate
segmental phonetic posterior-grams (SPPGs) to represent phone segment-level
information. And then we explore the non-categories by looking for the SPPGs
with more than one peak. Compared with the baseline system, this approach
explores more non-categorical patterns, and also perceptual experimental
results show that the explored non-categories are more accurate with increased

series data, commonly used in the social and biological sciences. Typical
operationalizations of Granger causality make a strong assumption that every
time point of the effect time series is influenced by a combination of other
time series with a fixed time delay. The assumption of fixed time delay also
exists in Transfer Entropy, which is considered to be a non-linear version of
Granger causality. However, the assumption of the fixed time delay does not
hold in many applications, such as collective behavior, financial markets, and
many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we develop Variable-lag Granger
causality and Variable-lag Transfer Entropy, generalizations of both Granger
causality and Transfer Entropy that relax the assumption of the fixed time
delay and allow causes to influence effects with arbitrary time delays. In
addition, we propose methods for inferring both variable-lag Granger causality
and Transfer Entropy relations. In our approaches, we utilize an optimal
warping path of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to infer variable-lag causal
relations. We demonstrate our approaches on an application for studying

T1 (T1free) and concentration (\r{ho}free). The proposed strategy was compared
with the dehydration technique in seven bovine cortical bone samples. The
agreement between the two methods was quantified by using Bland and Altman

agreement between the two methods along with the suggestion of 0.99% bias

that Transformers can be more easily aware of the beat-bar-phrase hierarchical

signatures, while allowing for a stable false detection rate over the data cube
and providing in the same time an automated and reliable estimation of the
purity.
  Results on simulated data cubes providing ground truth show that the method
reaches its aims in terms of purity and completeness. When applied to the deep
30-hour exposure MUSE datacube in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the algorithms
allows for the confirmed detection of 133 intermediate redshifts galaxies and
248 Lyman Alpha Emitters, including 86 sources with no HST counterpart.

by semilinear partial parabolic differential equations of the form $u_t =

equilibria $v\in\mathcal{E}\subset\mathcal{A}$ of the semiflow are the
stationary solutions of the PDE, hence they are solutions of the corresponding
second order ODE boundary value problem. Assuming hyperbolicity of all
equilibria, the dynamic decomposition of $\mathcal{A}$ into unstable manifolds
of equilibria provides a geometric and topological characterization of Sturm
global attractors $\mathcal{A}$ as finite regular signed CW-complexes, the
Sturm complexes, with cells given by the unstable manifolds of equilibria.
Concurrently, the permutation $\sigma=\sigma_f$ derived from the ODE boundary
value problem by ordering the equilibria according to their values at the
boundaries $x=0,1$, respectively, completely determines the Sturm global
attractor $\mathcal{A}$. Equivalently, we use a planar curve, the meander
$\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_f$, associated to the the ODE boundary value problem

  The main objective of this paper is to derive a minimax property which
identifies the equilibria on the cell boundary of $\mathcal{O}$ which are
closest or most distant from $\mathcal{O}$ at the boundaries $x=0,1$, directly
from the permutation $\sigma$, the Sturm permutation, or equivalently from the
meander $\mathcal{M}$, the Sturm meander, based on the Sturm nodal properties
of the solutions of the ODE boundary value problem. We emphasize the local
aspect of this result by applying it to an example for which the identification
of the equilibria in the cell boundary of $\mathcal{O}$ is obtained from the
knowledge of only a section of the Sturm meander $\mathcal{M}$.

performance of the controller during the start-up, the load change, or the

varying the operating point. The heuristic dynamic programming controller
optimally controls the boost converter by following the approximate dynamic

In previous work by the second- and third-named authors, the double Hurwitz

governed by the topological recursion, analogous to existing results concerning
single Hurwitz numbers. In this paper, we resolve these conjectures by a
careful analysis of the semi-infinite wedge representation for double Hurwitz

We deduce a preliminary version of an ELSV-like formula for double Hurwitz

framework for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization
problems, derived from an approximation to the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm
(QAA). In solving combinatorial optimization problems with constraints in the
context of QAOA or QAA, one needs to find a way to encode problem constraints
into the scheme. In this paper, we formalize different constraint types to
linear equalities, linear inequalities, and arbitrary form. Based on this, we
propose constraint-encoding schemes well-fitting into the QAOA framework for
solving NP combinatorial optimization problems. The implemented algorithms
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme by the
testing results of varied instances of some well-known NP optimization
problems. We argue that our work leads to a generalized framework for finding,
in the context of QAOA, high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial
problems with various types of constraints.

leads to unsatisfiable instances. To remedy such limitation, the paper
introduces the Privacy-Preserving Stackelberg Mechanism (PPSM), a framework
that enforces the notions of feasibility and fidelity of the privacy-preserving

differential privacy and ensures that the outcomes of the privacy-preserving
coordination mechanism are close-to-optimality for each agent. Experimental
results on several gas and electricity market benchmarks based on a real case

executing time is determined by the time-of-flight of the signal through this

  Thesis",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An artificial general intelligence (AGI) might have an instrumental drive to
modify its utility function to improve its ability to cooperate, bargain,
promise, threaten, and resist and engage in blackmail. Such an AGI would
necessarily have a utility function that was at least partially observable and
that was influenced by how other agents chose to interact with it. This
instrumental drive would conflict with the orthogonality thesis since the
modifications would be influenced by the AGI's intelligence. AGIs in highly
competitive environments might converge to having nearly the same utility
function, one optimized to favorably influencing other agents through game
theory.
