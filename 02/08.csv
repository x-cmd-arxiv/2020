quantum information, which has found widespread attention from high energy
physics to quantum computing. In the present analysis we propose a possible
starting point for the development of a comprehensive framework for the
thermodynamics of scrambling. To this end, we prove that the growth of
entanglement as quantified by the mutual information is lower bounded by the
time-dependent change of Out-Of-Time-Ordered Correlator. We further show that
the rate of increase of the mutual information can be upper bounded by the sum
of local entropy productions, and the exchange entropy arising from the flow of
information between separate partitions of a quantum system. Our results are
illustrated for the ion trap system, that was recently used to verify
information scrambling in an experiment, and for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

optimization problems in designing deep neural networks to encode constraints
that conventional layers cannot capture. However, these methods are still in
their infancy and require special treatments, such as analyzing the KKT
condition, for deriving the backpropagation formula. In this paper, we propose
a new layer formulation called the fixed-point iteration (FPI) layer that
facilitates the use of more complicated operations in deep networks. The
backward FPI layer is also proposed for backpropagation, which is motivated by
the recurrent back-propagation (RBP) algorithm. But in contrast to RBP, the
backward FPI layer yields the gradient by a small network module without an
explicit calculation of the Jacobian. In actual applications, both the forward
and backward FPI layers can be treated as nodes in the computational graphs.
All components in the proposed method are implemented at a high level of
abstraction, which allows efficient higher-order differentiations on the nodes.
In addition, we present two practical methods of the FPI layer, FPI_NN and
FPI_GD, where the update operations of FPI are a small neural network module
and a single gradient descent step based on a learnable cost function,
respectively. FPI\_NN is intuitive, simple, and fast to train, while FPI_GD can
be used for efficient training of energy networks that have been recently
studied. While RBP and its related studies have not been applied to practical
examples, our experiments show the FPI layer can be successfully applied to
real-world problems such as image denoising, optical flow, and multi-label
classification.

solve this task by leveraging machine learning algorithms. ECG datasets

Data augmentation is a popular solution to tackle this problem.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of various data augmentation

Adversarial Networks (GANs), on solving the class imbalance problem. These
algorithms are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated, compared and

first to a ballistic motion due to their persistence, and later, through
consecutive tumbles, to a diffusive process. Here we investigate how long it
takes for a dilute swimmer suspension to reach the diffusive regime as well as
what is the amplitude of the deviations from the diffusive dynamics. A linear
time dependence of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) is insufficient to
characterize diffusion and thus we also focus on the excess kurtosis of the
displacement distribution. Four swimming strategies are considered: (i) the
conventional RT model with complete reorientation after tumbling, (ii) the case
of partial reorientation, characterized by a distribution of tumbling angles,
(iii) a run-and-reverse model with rotational diffusion, and (iv) a RT particle
where the tumbling rate depends on the stochastic concentration of an internal
protein. By analyzing the associated kinetic equations for the probability
density function and simulating the models, we find that for models (ii),
(iii), and (iv) the relaxation to diffusion can take much longer than the mean
time between tumble events, evidencing the existence of large tails in the
particle displacements. Moreover, the excess kurtosis can assume large positive
values. In model (ii) it is possible for some distributions of tumbling angles
that the MSD reaches a linear time dependence but, still, the dynamics remains
non-Gaussian for long times. This is also the case in model (iii) for small
rotational diffusivity. For all models, the long-time diffusion coefficients
are also obtained. The theoretical approach, which relies on eigenvalue and
angular Fourier expansions of the van Hove function, is in excellent agreement
with the simulations.

of this method when the gradients are sampled from Markov processes, and hence
biased and dependent from time step to time step; in contrast, the analysis in
existing work relies heavily on the stochastic gradients being independent and
sometimes unbiased. Our main contributions show that under certain (standard)
assumptions on the underlying Markov chain generating the gradients, ASGD
converges at the nearly the same rate with Markovian gradient samples as with
independent gradient samples. The only difference is a logarithmic factor that
accounts for the mixing time of the Markov chain. One of the key motivations
for this study are complicated control problems that can be modeled by a Markov
decision process and solved using reinforcement learning. We apply the
accelerated method to several challenging problems in the OpenAI Gym and
Mujoco, and show that acceleration can significantly improve the performance of
the classic temporal difference learning and REINFORCE algorithms.

problem reduces to solving independently the writer and the buyer's hedging
problem with zero initial capital. By further imposing that the risk measures
decompose in a way that satisfies a Markovian property, we provide dynamic

the case of European and American options. All of our results are general
enough to accommodate situations where the risk is measured according to a
worst-case risk measure as is typically done in robust optimization. Our
numerical study illustrates the advantages of equal risk pricing over schemes
that only account for a single party, pricing based on quadratic hedging (i.e.
$\epsilon$-arbitrage pricing), or pricing based on a fixed equivalent
martingale measure (i.e. Black-Scholes pricing). In particular, the numerical
results confirm that when employing an equal risk price both the writer and the

smaller than what they would experience with the other approaches.

big-data-driven platform. As such, the ad-tech industry relies on historical
engagement logs (clicks or purchases) to identify potentially interested users
for the advertisement campaign of a partner (a seller who wants to target users

and hence the historical campaign data available for a partner depends upon the
budget constraints of the partner. Thus, enough data can be collected for the
high-budget partners to make accurate predictions, while this is not the case
with the low-budget partners. This skewed distribution of the data leads to
""preferential attachment"" of the targeted display advertising platforms towards

By 2024, Pbps-level OTNs are expected, far exceeding the capacity limit of

newly designed OTNs called spatial channel networks (SCNs), which achieve high
cost efficiency by means of practical hierarchical optical cross-connects, have
recently been proposed. However, the evolution of OTNs will simultaneously
present challenges related to resource allocation in networking. For instance,
with the evolution from WDM-OTNs to EONs, the resource allocation problem was
transformed from the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem to the
routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem due to the additionally
introduced constraint of spectrum contiguity. Similarly, specially designed

methods are preferred to sample average approximation (SAA) methods because of
large data sets as well as generalization properties. Additionally, due to
perceived costs of forming and factorizing Hessians, second order methods are
not used for these problems. In this work we motivate the extension of Newton
methods to the SA regime, and argue for the use of the scalable low rank saddle
free Newton (LRSFN) method, which avoids forming the Hessian in favor of making
a low rank approximation. Additionally, LRSFN can facilitate fast escape from
indefinite regions leading to better optimization solutions. In the SA setting,
iterative updates are dominated by stochastic noise, and stability of the
method is key. We introduce a continuous time stability analysis framework, and
use it to demonstrate that stochastic errors for Newton methods can be greatly
amplified by ill-conditioned Hessians. The LRSFN method mitigates this
stability issue via Levenberg-Marquardt damping. However, generally the
analysis shows that second order methods with stochastic Hessian and gradient
information may need to take small steps, unlike in deterministic problems.
Numerical results show that LRSFN can escape indefinite regions that other
methods have issues with; and even under restrictive step length conditions,
LRSFN can outperform popular first order methods on large scale deep learning
tasks in terms of generalizability for equivalent computational work.

detection. We look at how six different artifact classes, and their location in
an image, affect the performance of a RetinaNet based polyp detection model. We
found that, depending on the artifact class, they can either benefit or harm
the polyp detector. For instance, bubbles are often misclassified as polyps,
while specular reflections inside of a polyp region can improve detection
capabilities. We then investigated different strategies, such as a learning

how to efficiently share limited training resources among a diverse set of
model training tasks becomes a crucial issue. To achieve better utilization of
the shared resources, we explore the idea of jointly training multiple neural
network models on a single GPU in this paper. We realize this idea by proposing
a primitive, called pack. We further present a comprehensive empirical study of
pack and end-to-end experiments that suggest significant improvements for
hyperparameter tuning. The results suggest: (1) packing two models can bring up
to 40% performance improvement over unpacked setups for a single training step
and the improvement increases when packing more models; (2) the benefit of the
pack primitive largely depends on a number of factors including memory
capacity, chip architecture, neural network structure, and batch size; (3)
there exists a trade-off between packing and unpacking when training multiple
neural network models on limited resources; (4) a pack-aware Hyperband is up to
2.7x faster than the original Hyperband, with this improvement growing as
memory size increases and subsequently the density of models packed.

conventional cloud-based paradigms, running deep learning on devices offers
several advantages including data privacy preservation and low-latency response
for both model inference and update. Since data collection is costly in
reality, Google's Federated Learning offers not only complete data privacy but
also better model robustness based on multiple user data. However, personal
mobile sensing applications are mostly user-specific and highly affected by
environment. As a result, continuous local changes may seriously affect the
performance of a global model generated by Federated Learning. In addition,
deploying Federated Learning on a local server, e.g., edge server, may quickly
reach the bottleneck due to resource constraint and serious failure by attacks.

regression analysis remains a challenge in data science, especially in terms of
its potential of scaling to ever-enlarging data and finding a group of
scientifically meaningful features. For example, to develop new, responsive
drug targets for ovarian cancer, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) of a
practical feature selection procedure must also match the target FDR. The
popular approach to feature selection, when true features are sparse, is to use
a penalized likelihood or a shrinkage estimation, such as a LASSO, SCAD,
Elastic Net, or MCP procedure (call them benchmark procedures). We present a
different approach using a new subsampling method, called the Subsampling
Winner algorithm (SWA). The central idea of SWA is analogous to that used for
the selection of US national merit scholars. SWA uses a ""base procedure"" to
analyze each of the subsamples, computes the scores of all features according
to the performance of each feature from all subsample analyses, obtains the
""semifinalist"" based on the resulting scores, and then determines the
""finalists,"" i.e., the most important features. Due to its subsampling nature,
SWA can scale to data of any dimension in principle. The SWA also has the
best-controlled actual FDR in comparison with the benchmark procedures and the
randomForest, while having a competitive true-feature discovery rate. We also
suggest practical add-on strategies to SWA with or without a penalized
benchmark procedure to further assure the chance of ""true"" discovery. Our
application of SWA to the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma specimens from the
Broad Institute revealed functionally important genes and pathways, which we
verified by additional genomics tools. This second-stage investigation is
essential in the current discussion of the proper use of P-values.

that the two stellar populations of NGC330, if they exist, share similar
original He abundances.
  If we consider stellar rotation velocity in our analysis, a coeval (30 Myr)
stellar population, experiencing different values of rotation, cannot be
excluded. In this case, the mean helium abundance < $\epsilon(He)$ >rot
obtained in our analysis is 11.00 $\pm$ 0.05 dex. We also verified that
possible NLTE effects cannot be identified with our analysis because of the
spectral resolution and they are within our derived abundance He uncertainties.
  Moreover, the analysis of the He abundance as a function of the distance from
the cluster center of the observed stars do not show any correlation.

range of phenomena. Our understanding of physical laws, from cosmology to local
scales, cannot be properly formulated without taking into account it. It is
based on one of the most fundamental principles of Nature, the Equivalence
Principle, which represents the core of the Einstein theory of gravity. The
confirmation of its validity at different scales and in different contexts
represents one of the main challenges of modern physics both from the
theoretical and the experimental points of view. A major issue related to this
principle is the fact that we actually do not know if it is valid at quantum
level. Furthermore, recent progress on relativistic theories of gravity have to
take into account new issues like Dark Matter and Dark Energy, as well as the
validity of fundamental principles like local Lorentz and position invariance.
Experiments allow to set stringent constraints on well established symmetry
laws, on the physics beyond the Standard Model of particles and interactions,
and on General Relativity and its possible extensions. In this review, we
discuss precision tests of gravity in General Relativity and alternative
theories and their relation with the Equivalence Principle. In the first part,
we discuss the Einstein Equivalence Principle according to its weak and strong
formulation. We recall some basic topics of General Relativity and the
necessity of its extension. Some models of modified gravity are presented in
some details. The second part of the paper is devoted to the experimental tests
of the Equivalence Principle in its weak formulation. We present the results
and methods used in high-precision experiments, and discuss the potential and
prospects for future experimental tests.

acting non-trivially on $U$ and trivially on the complement $X \setminus U$. We
show that, under suitable assumptions, the existence of certain commensurated

$\Gamma$-action: the space $X$ has compressible open subsets, and it is an
almost $\Gamma$-boundary. Those properties yield in turn restrictions on the
structure of $\Gamma$: $\Gamma$ is neither amenable nor residually finite.
Among the applications, we show that the (alternating subgroup of the)
topological full group associated to a minimal and expansive Cantor action of a
finitely generated amenable group has no commensurated subgroups other than the
trivial ones. Similarly, every commensurated subgroup of a finitely generated
branch group is commensurate to a normal subgroup; the latter assertion relies
on an appendix by Dominik Francoeur, and generalizes a result of Phillip
Wesolek on finitely generated just-infinite branch groups. Other applications

rely, in an essential way, on recent results on the structure of tdlc groups,
on the dynamics of their micro-supported actions, and on the notion of

cells by tracking characteristics curves highly accurately. In the SLDG method,
depending on the velocity field, upstream cells could be of arbitrary shape.
Thus, a more sophisticated approximation to sides of the upstream cells is
required to get high order approximation. For example, quadratic-curved (QC)
quadrilaterals were proposed to approximate upstream cells for a third-order
spatial accuracy in a swirling deformation example. In this paper, for linear
advection problems, we propose a more general formulation, named the ELDG
method. The scheme is formulated based on a {\em modified} adjoint problem for
which the upstream cells are always quadrilaterals, which avoids the need to
use QC quadrilaterals in the SLDG algorithm. The newly proposed ELDG method can
be viewed as a new general framework, in which both the classical Eulerian
Runge-Kutta DG formulation and the SL DG formulation can fit in. Numerical
results on linear transport problems, as well as the nonlinear Vlasov and
incompressible Euler dynamics using the exponential RK time integrators, are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ELDG method.

essentially performed upon steric sieving principles, we explore the concept of
dynamic osmosis through active membranes. A partially permeable membrane
presents a time-tuneable feature that changes the effective pore interaction
with the solute and thus actively changes permeability with time. In general we
find that slow flickering frequencies effectively decrease the osmotic
pressure, and large flickering frequencies do not change it. In the presence of
an asymmetric membrane, we find a resonant frequency where pumping of solute is
performed and can be analyzed in terms of ratchet transport. We discuss and
highlight the properties of this resonant osmotic transport. Furthermore, we
show that dynamic osmosis allows to pump solute at the nanoscale using less
energy than reverse osmosis. This opens new possibilities to build advanced
filtration devices and design artificial ionic machinery.

precisely we do so in two directions. First we drop the diffeomorphism
hypothesis. Secondly we give estimates in global Sobolev and Zygmund spaces.
Thus we fully generalize Bony's classic paralinearasition theorem giving sharp
estimates for composition in Sobolev and Zygmund spaces. In order to prove that
the new class of operations benefits of symbolic calculus properties when
composed by a paradifferential operator, we discuss the pull-back of

operators if and only if they are pulled-back by a diffeomorphism that is a

top surface of a topological insulator (TI). Outside the structure there is a
uniform layer of ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), leading to a positive effective
mass for the Dirac electrons. The mass inside can be engineered to be negative,
leading to a skyrmion structure. The geometric shape of the structure can be
circular or deformed, leading to integrable or chaotic dynamics, respectively,
in the classical limit. For a circular structure, the relativistic quantum
scattering characteristics can be calculated analytically. For a deformed
structure, we develop an efficient numerical method, the multiple multipole
method, to solve the scattering wavefunctions. We find that anomalous Hall
effect as characterized by strong skew scattering can arise, which is robust
against structural deformation due to the resonant modes. In the short (long)
wavelength regime, the resonant modes manifest themselves as confined vortices
(excited edge states). The origin of the resonant states is the spin phase
factor of massive Dirac electrons at the skyrmion boundary. Further, in the
short wavelength regime, for a circular skyrmion, a large number of angular
momentum channels contribute to the resonant modes. In this regime, in
principle, classical dynamics are relevant, but we find that geometric
deformations, even those as severe as leading to fully developed chaos, have
little effect on the resonant modes. The vortex structure of the resonant
states makes it possible to electrically ``charge'' the skyrmion, rendering
feasible to manipulate its motion electrically. In the long wavelength regime,
only the lowest angular momentum channels contribute to the resonant modes,
making the skew scattering sharply directional. These phenomena may find
applications for information storage and in Hall devices based on dynamic
skyrmion.

blue to red in the optical part of the spectrum, and muted gas absorption
features throughout. Retrieval studies seeking to constrain the composition of
exoplanet atmospheres must therefore account for the presence of aerosols.
However, clouds and hazes are complex physical phenomena, and the transit
spectra that are currently available allow us to constrain only some of their

that they are described by only a few parameters, and this has been done in a
variety of ways within the literature. Here, I investigate a range of

regression. We derive lower bounds with logarithmic regret under $L_1$, $L_2$,
and $L_\infty$ constraints on the parameter values. The bounds are dominated by
$d/2 \log T$, where $T$ is the horizon and $d$ is the dimensionality of the
parameter space. We show their achievability for $d=o(T^{1/3})$ in all these
cases with Bayesian methods, that achieve them up to a $d/2 \log d$ term.
Interesting different behaviors are shown for larger dimensionality.
Specifically, on the negative side, if $d = \Omega(\sqrt{T})$, any algorithm is
guaranteed regret of $\Omega(d \log T)$ (greater than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$) under
$L_\infty$ constraints on the parameters (and the example features). On the
positive side, under $L_1$ constraints on the parameters, there exist
algorithms that can achieve regret that is sub-linear in $d$ for the
asymptotically larger values of $d$. For $L_2$ constraints, it is shown that
for large enough $d$, the regret remains linear in $d$ but no longer
logarithmic in $T$. Adapting the redundancy-capacity theorem from information
theory, we demonstrate a principled methodology based on grids of parameters to
derive lower bounds. Grids are also utilized to derive some upper bounds. Our
results strengthen results by Kakade and Ng (2005) and Foster et al. (2018) for
upper bounds for this problem, introduce novel lower bounds, and adapt a
methodology that can be used to obtain such bounds for other related problems.
They also give a novel characterization of the asymptotic behavior when the
dimension of the parameter space is allowed to grow with $T$. They additionally
establish connections to the information theory literature, demonstrating that
the actual regret for logistic regression depends on the richness of the
parameter class, where even within this problem, richer classes lead to greater
regret.

through the Chern-Simons term. This results in a strong gauge field production
during inflation, which backreacts on the inflaton equation of motion. Here we
show that this strongly non-linear system generically experiences a resonant
enhancement of the gauge field production, resulting in oscillatory features in
the inflaton velocity as well as in the gauge field spectrum. The gauge fields
source a strongly enhanced scalar power spectrum at small scales, exceeding
previous estimates. For appropriate parameter choices, the collapse of these
over-dense regions can lead to a large population of (light) primordial black
holes with remarkable phenomenological consequences.

as it allows access to bistable states needed for all-optical memories and
switches. A common technique is to use the Kerr shift to control the resonance
frequency of a resonator and use it as a bistable, optically-tunable filter.
However, this approach works only in a narrow power and frequency range or
requires the use of an auxiliary laser. An alternative approach is to use the
asymmetric bistability between counterpropagating light states resulting from
the interplay between self- and cross-phase modulation, which allows light to
enter a ring resonator in just one direction. Logical HIGH and LOW states can
be represented and stored as the direction of circulation of light, and
controlled by modulating the input power. Here we study the switching speed,
operating laser frequency and power range, and contrast ratio of such a device.
We reach a bitrate of 2 Mbps in our proof-of-principle device over an optical
frequency range of 1 GHz and an operating power range covering more than one
order of magnitude. We also calculate that integrated photonic circuits could
exhibit bitrates of the order of Gbps, paving the way for the realization of
robust and simple all-optical memories, switches, routers and logic gates that
can operate at a single laser frequency with no additional electrical power.

deep learning with this success at least partially attributable to the efficacy
of spatial invariance as an inductive bias. Locally connected layers, which
differ from convolutional layers only in their lack of spatial invariance,
usually perform poorly in practice. However, these observations still leave
open the possibility that some degree of relaxation of spatial invariance may
yield a better inductive bias than either convolution or local connectivity. To
test this hypothesis, we design a method to relax the spatial invariance of a
network layer in a controlled manner; we create a \textit{low-rank} locally
connected layer, where the filter bank applied at each position is constructed
as a linear combination of basis set of filter banks with spatially varying
combining weights. By varying the number of basis filter banks, we can control
the degree of relaxation of spatial invariance. In experiments with small
convolutional networks, we find that relaxing spatial invariance improves
classification accuracy over both convolution and locally connected layers
across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets, thus suggesting that spatial
invariance may be an overly restrictive prior.

they are standard candles and give precise distances even at large distances.
However, it is difficult to cleanly select red clumps stars because they can
have the same T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ as red giant branch stars.
Recently, it was shown that the asteroseismic parameters, $\rm{\Delta}$P and
$\rm{\Delta\nu}$, which are used to accurately select red clump stars, can be
derived from spectra using the change in the surface carbon to nitrogen ratio
([C/N]) caused by mixing during the red giant branch. This change in [C/N] can
also impact the spectral energy distribution. In this study, we predict the
$\rm{\Delta}$P, $\rm{\Delta\nu}$, T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ using 2MASS,
AllWISE, \gaia, and Pan-STARRS data in order to select a clean sample of red
clump stars. We achieve a contamination rate of $\sim$20\%, equivalent to what
is achieved when selecting from T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ derived from low
resolution spectra. Finally, we present two red clump samples. One sample has a
contamination rate of $\sim$ 20\% and $\sim$ 405,000 red clump stars. The other
has a contamination of $\sim$ 33\% and $\sim$ 2.6 million red clump stars which
includes $\sim$ 75,000 stars at distances $>$ 10 kpc. For |b|>30 degrees we
find $\sim$ 15,000 stars with contamination rate of $\sim$ 9\%. The scientific
potential of this catalog for studying the structure and formation history of

and whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of
particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution
of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated
to addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity
symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and
seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory
underlying the standard model.
  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE
physics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE
liquid argon TPC far detector modules. This TDR is intended to justify the
technical choices for the far detector that flow down from the high-level
physics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. Volume I
contains an executive summary that introduces the DUNE science program, the far
detector and the strategy for its modular designs, and the organization and
management of the Project. The remainder of Volume I provides more detail on
the science program that drives the choice of detector technologies and on the
technologies themselves. It also introduces the designs for the DUNE near
detector and the DUNE computing model, for which DUNE is planning design
reports.
  Volume II of this TDR describes DUNE's physics program in detail. Volume III
describes the technical coordination required for the far detector design,
construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure.
Volume IV describes the single-phase far detector technology. A planned Volume
V will describe the dual-phase technology.

studying the rest-frame optical properties of z>7 galaxies. Many such high
redshift galaxies display a red [3.6] - [4.5] micron colour, often referred to
as the ""IRAC excess"", which has conventionally been interpreted as arising from
intense [OIII]+Hbeta emission within the [4.5] micron bandpass. An appealing
aspect of this interpretation is similarly intense line emission seen in
star-forming galaxies at lower redshift as well as the redshift-dependent
behaviour of the IRAC colours beyond z~7 modelled as the various nebular lines
move through the two bandpasses. In this paper we demonstrate that, given the
photometric uncertainties, established stellar populations with Balmer (4000 A,
rest-frame) breaks, such as those inferred at z>9 where line emission does not
contaminate the IRAC bands, can equally well explain the redshift-dependent
behaviour of the IRAC colours in 7<z<9 galaxies. We discuss possible ways of
distinguishing between the two hypotheses using ALMA measures of [OIII] 88
micron and dust continuum fluxes. Prior to further studies with JWST, we show
that the distinction is important in determining the assembly history of
galaxies in the first 500 Myr.

reasonable doubt, despite their potential role as massive seeds for quasars and
sources of tidal disruption events, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, dwarf galaxy
feedback, and hypervelocity stars. Gravitational wave (GW) observations can
help to find and confirm the existence of IMBHs. Current and upcoming
detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, LISA, ET, and DECIGO promise to identify
the full range from stellar-mass to supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this
paper, we address the question of whether IMBHs can produce GWs in galactic
nuclei. We consider the possibility that stellar black holes (SBHs) form bound
systems and later coalesce with an IMBH through gravitational captures in the
dense nucleus. We show that this mechanism is efficient for IMBH masses in the
range $\sim 3\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$--$2\times 10^4$ M$_\odot$. We find that the
typical distributions of peak frequencies and merger timescales depend mainly
on the IMBH mass. In particular, the typical peak frequency is about $0.2\,$Hz,
$0.1\,$Hz, $0.09\,$Hz, and $0.05\,$Hz for $M_{\rm IMBH}=5\times 10^3$
M$_\odot$, $8\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$, $1\times 10^4$ M$_\odot$, and $2\times

both DECIGO and ET should be able to detect these IMBH--SBH mergers.
Furthermore, most of the mergers will appear eccentric ($e \gtrsim 0.1$),
providing an indication of their dynamical origin.

analogues of high-redshift galaxies. These high-redshift analogue galaxies are
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Located in the same region on the
BPT diagram as the ultra-violet selected galaxies at $z\sim2$, these
high-redshift analogue galaxies provide an ideal local benchmark to study the
offset between the local and high-redshift galaxies on the BPT diagram. We
compare the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (N/O), the shape of the ionising radiation
field, and ionisation parameters between the high-redshift analogues and a
sample of local reference galaxies. The higher ionisation parameter in the
high-redshift analogues is the dominant physical mechanism driving the BPT
offset from low- to high-redshift, particularly at high {\nii/\ha}.
Furthermore, the N/O ratio enhancement also plays a minor role to cause the BPT
offset. However, the shape of the ionising radiation field is unlikely to cause
the BPT offset because the high-redshift analogues have a similar hard ionising
radiation field as local reference galaxies. This hard radiation field cannot
be produced by the current standard stellar synthesis models. The stellar
rotation and binarity may help solve the discrepancy.

onto Earth-like planets with thin atmospheres, using 3D smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations with sufficient resolution to directly model the fate
of low-mass atmospheres. We present a simple scaling law to estimate the
fraction lost for any impact angle and speed in this regime. In the canonical
Moon-forming impact, only around 10% of the atmosphere would have been lost
from the immediate effects of the collision. There is a gradual transition from
removing almost none to almost all of the atmosphere for a grazing impact as it
becomes more head-on or increases in speed, including complex, non-monotonic
behaviour at low impact angles. In contrast, for head-on impacts, a slightly
greater speed can suddenly remove much more atmosphere. Our results broadly
agree with the application of 1D models of local atmosphere loss to the ground
speeds measured directly from our simulations. However, previous analytical
models of shock-wave propagation from an idealised point-mass impact
significantly underestimate the ground speeds and hence the total erosion. The
strong dependence on impact angle and the interplay of multiple non-linear and
asymmetrical loss mechanisms highlight the need for 3D simulations in order to
make realistic predictions.

the radio lobe adjacent to the hole and use it to argue that the hole is
excavated from the radio lobe. The surface brightness profile of the hole
implies a depth at least 1.7 $\pm$ 0.3 times greater than its projected width,
requiring a minimum depth of 13.3 $\pm$ 2.3 kpc. A similar hole observed in the
5 GHz VLA radio map reinforces the argument for a cavity lying within the lobe.
We argue that the jet encounters the shock compressed intracluster medium at
hotspot E, passing through one or more shocks as it is deflected back into the
radio lobe. The orientation of Cygnus A allows the outflow from hotspot E to
travel almost directly away from us, creating an elongated cavity, as observed.
These results favor models for multiple hotspots in which an FR II jet is
deflected at a primary hotspot, then travels onward to deposit the bulk of its
power at a secondary hotspot, rather than the dentist drill model.

AGN selected on the CDFS and UDS fields and makes use of new and ancillary data
available to the VANDELS collaboration. Our results indicate that the mass of
the host galaxy is a fundamental quantity which determines the level of AGN
activity at the various wavelengths. Indeed large stellar masses are found to
be connected with AGN radio emission, as virtually all radio-active AGN reside
within galaxies of M*>10^{10} Msun. Large stellar masses also seem to favour
AGN activity in the X-ray, even though X-ray AGN present a mass distribution
which is more spread out and with a non-negligible tail at M*<10^{9} Msun.
Stellar mass alone is also observed to play a fundamental role in simultaneous
radio and X-ray emission: the percentage of AGN active at both wavelengths
increases from around 1% of all X-ray AGN residing within hosts of M*<10^{11}
Msun to about 13% in more massive galaxies. In the case of radio-selected AGN,
such a percentage moves from about 15% to about 45% (but up to 80% in the
deepest fields). Neither cosmic epoch, nor radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity,
Eddington ratio or star-formation rate of the hosts are found to be connected
to an enhanced probability for joint radio+X-ray emission of AGN origin.
Furthermore, only a loose relation is observed between X-ray and radio
luminosity in those AGN which are simultaneously active at both frequencies.

We perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the measurements of chirp signals from

parameter as $\alpha$. Taking into account the bias that could be introduced by
the uncertainty of measurements and by the selection effect, we carried out the
numerical tests and find that only one thousand of GW events registered by ET
($\sim1\%$ amount of its yearly detection rate) could accurately infer the
$\alpha$ with a precision of $\alpha\sim0.1$. Furthermore, we investigate the
validity of our method to recover a scenario where $\alpha$ evolves with
redshift as $\alpha(z) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1\frac{z}{1+z}$. Taking a thousand

theory, it is often difficult to solve large SDP instances in practice. One
technique to address this issue is to relax the global
positive-semidefiniteness (PSD) constraint and only enforce PSD-ness on smaller
$k\times k$ principal submatrices --- we call this the sparse SDP relaxation.
Surprisingly, it has been observed empirically that in some cases this approach
appears to produce bounds that are close to the optimal objective function
value of the original SDP. In this paper, we formally attempt to compare the
strength of the sparse SDP relaxation vis-\`a-vis the original SDP from a
theoretical perspective.
  In order to simplify the question, we arrive at a data independent version of
it, where we compare the sizes of SDP cone and the $k$-PSD closure, which is
the cone of matrices where PSD-ness is enforced on all $k\times k$ principal
submatrices. In particular, we investigate the question of how far a matrix of
unit Frobenius norm in the $k$-PSD closure can be from the SDP cone. We provide
two incomparable upper bounds on this farthest distance as a function of $k$
and $n$. We also provide matching lower bounds, which show that the upper
bounds are tight within a constant in different regimes of $k$ and $n$. Other
than linear algebra techniques, we extensively use probabilistic methods to
arrive at these bounds. One of the lower bounds is obtained by observing a
connection between matrices in the $k$-PSD closure and matrices satisfying the
restricted isometry property (RIP).

parallel codes is notoriously imprecise. Even for applications with extremely
regular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication
time to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of
parallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern
caused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load
imbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and
spontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and
hybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that
although desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it
does not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an
increase in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication
overhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic
overlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to
solution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain
required to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this
process and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid
MPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating
the bandwidth bottleneck among processes. A Chebyshev filter diagonalization
application is used to demonstrate some of the observed effects in a realistic
setting.

current that flows due to changes in polarization when the system is switched

systems has been enabled by the modern theory of polarization, where it is
expressed in terms of a change in Berry phase as the material switches. It is
straightforward to compute this change of phase, but only modulo $2\pi$,
requiring a branch choice from among a lattice of values separated by $2\pi$.
The measured switching polarization depends on the actual path along which the
material switches, which in general involves nucleation and growth of domains
and is therefore quite complex. In this work, we present a physically motivated
approach for predicting the experimentally measured switching polarization that
involves separating the change in phase between two states into as many
gauge-invariant smaller phase changes as possible. As long as the magnitudes of
these smaller phase changes remain smaller than $\pi$, their sum forms a phase
change which corresponds to the change one would find along any path involving
minimal evolution of the atomic and electronic structure. We show that for
typical ferroelectrics, including those that would have otherwise required a
densely sampled path, this technique allows the switching polarization to be

vibrational field unperturbed by its presence, so to achieve its invisibility,
is a thoroughly analyzed, but still unchallenged, mechanical problem. The
'cloaking transformation' concept, originally developed in electromagnetism and
optics, is not directly applicable to elastic waves, displaying a complex
vectorial nature. Consequently, all examples of elastic cloaking presented so
far involve complex design and thick coating skins. These cloakings often work
only for problems of unidirectional propagation, within narrow ranges of
frequency, and considering only one colaked object. Here, a new method based on
the concept of reinforcement, achieved via elastic stiffening and mass
redistribution, is introduced to cloak multiple voids in an elastic plate. This
simple technique produces invisibility of the voids to flexural waves within an
extremely broad range of frequencies and thus surpassing in many aspects all
existing cloaking techniques. The proposed design principle is applicable in
mechanical problems ranging from the micro-scale to the scale of civil
engineering. For instance, our results show how to design a perforated
load-bearing building wall, vibrating during an earthquake exactly as the same
wall, but unperforated, a new finding for seismic protection.

convolutional layers than in fully connected layers. This is due to the fact
that dropout drops features randomly. When features are spatially correlated as
in the case of convolutional layers, information about the dropped pixels can
still propagate to the next layers via neighboring pixels. In order to address
this problem, more structured forms of dropout have been proposed. A drawback
of these methods is that they do not adapt to the data. In this work, we
introduce a novel structured regularization for convolutional layers, which we
call DropCluster. Our regularizer relies on data-driven structure. It finds
clusters of correlated features in convolutional layer outputs and drops the
clusters randomly at each iteration. The clusters are learned and updated
during model training so that they adapt both to the data and to the model
weights. Our experiments on the ResNet-50 architecture demonstrate that our
approach achieves better performance than DropBlock or other existing
structured dropout variants. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach
when the size of training data is limited and when there is corruption in the
data at test time.

successfully deceive models trained with transfer learning via end-to-end

contrast, models trained with random initialization without transfer are much
more robust to such attacks, although these models often exhibit much lower

space of a system of two coupled, non-resonantly driven exciton-polariton

with increasing external pumping consists of (i) formation of
$\pi$-synchronized condensates at low pumping, (ii) symmetry breaking pitchfork
bifurcation leading to unequal occupations of the condensates with non-trivial
phase difference between them, (iii) loss of the stability of all fixed points
in the system resulting in chaotic dynamics, (iv) limit cycle dynamics of the
order parameter, which ends up in (v) in-phase synchronized condensates via the
Hopf bifurcation from a limit cycle. The chaotic dynamics of the order
parameter is evidenced by calculating the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The
presence of a chaotic domain is studied as a function of polariton-polariton
interaction and the Josephson coupling between the condensates. At some values
of the parameters the bifurcation route is more complex and the strange
attractor can coexist with the stable fixed-point lasing. We also investigate
how the chaotic dynamics is reflected in the light emission spectrum from the
microcavity.

  Blackbox Optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an improved evolution strategy (ES) using a novel nonlocal
gradient operator for high-dimensional black-box optimization. Standard ES
methods with $d$-dimensional Gaussian smoothing suffer from the curse of
dimensionality due to the high variance of Monte Carlo (MC) based gradient
estimators. To control the variance, Gaussian smoothing is usually limited in a
small region, so existing ES methods lack nonlocal exploration ability required
for escaping from local minima. We develop a nonlocal gradient operator with
directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) to address this challenge. The DGS
conducts 1D nonlocal explorations along $d$ orthogonal directions in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each of which defines a nonlocal directional derivative as a 1D
integral. We then use Gauss-Hermite quadrature, instead of MC sampling, to
estimate the $d$ 1D integrals to ensure high accuracy (i.e., small variance).
Our method enables effective nonlocal exploration to facilitate the global
search in high-dimensional optimization. We demonstrate the superior
performance of our method in three sets of examples, including benchmark
functions for global optimization, and real-world science and engineering
applications.

close to 1.1$^\circ$, features isolated flat electronic bands that host a rich
phase diagram of correlated insulating, superconducting, ferromagnetic, and
topological phases. The origins of the correlated insulators and
superconductivity, and the interplay between them, are particularly elusive.
Both states have been previously observed only for angles within $\pm0.1^\circ$
from the magic-angle value and occur in adjacent or overlapping electron
density ranges; nevertheless, it is still unclear how the two states are
related. Beyond the twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase
diagram on the alignment and thickness of insulating hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) used to encapsulate the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the
microscopic dielectric environment. Here we show that adding an insulating
tungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer between hBN and TBG stabilizes
superconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the established magic-angle
value. For the smallest angle of $\theta$ = 0.79$^\circ$, we still observe
clear superconducting signatures, despite the complete absence of the
correlated insulating states and vanishing gaps between the dispersive and flat
bands. These observations demonstrate that, even though electron correlations
may be important, superconductivity in TBG can exist even when TBG exhibits
metallic behaviour across the whole range of electron density.
Finite-magnetic-field measurements further reveal breaking of the four-fold
spin-valley symmetry in the system, consistent with large spin-orbit coupling
induced in TBG via proximity to WSe$_2$. Our results highlight the importance
of symmetry breaking effects in stabilizing electronic states in TBG and open
new avenues for engineering quantum phases in moir\'e systems.

dynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life,
and whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of
particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution
of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. DUNE is an
international world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as
it searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to
capture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a
signature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model.
  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE
physics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE
liquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume II of this TDR, DUNE Physics,
describes the array of identified scientific opportunities and key goals.
Crucially, we also report our best current understanding of the capability of
DUNE to realize these goals, along with the detailed arguments and
investigations on which this understanding is based.
  This TDR volume documents the scientific basis underlying the conception and
design of the LBNF/DUNE experimental configurations. As a result, the
description of DUNE's experimental capabilities constitutes the bulk of the
document. Key linkages between requirements for successful execution of the
physics program and primary specifications of the experimental configurations
are drawn and summarized.
  This document also serves a wider purpose as a statement on the scientific
potential of DUNE as a central component within a global program of frontier
theoretical and experimental particle physics research. Thus, the presentation
also aims to serve as a resource for the particle physics community at large.

the fundamental building block for forming spherically imploding plasma liners
as a potential standoff compression driver for mangeto-inertial fusion. Jets
are formed and launched by contoured-gap coaxial plasma guns mounted at the six
spherical chamber. First, from experiments with two and three merging jets of
four different species (N, Ar, Kr, Xe), we show that (1) density spatial
non-uniformities can be large (with electron-density jumps ranging from 2.9 for
N to 6.6 for Xe) when shocks form upon jet merging, but smaller (density jumps
<2) when shocks do not form; (2) jet impurities (20% Ti in these experiments)
can increase the level of density spatial non-uniformity by increasing the
collisionality of jet merging; and (3) the liner Mach number can remain high
(>10), as required for plasma liners to be an effective compression driver.
Second, from experiments with six and seven merging jets using Ar, we present
results with improved jet-to-jet balance of <2% across jets, including (1)
evidence of substantially increased balance in the jet merging and symmetry of
the liner structure, and (2) potentially favorable changes in the jet-merging
morphology with the addition of the seventh jet. For both experiments, we
present comparison between experimental and synthetic data from
three-dimensional hydrodynamic codes.

  with Information Borrowing across Cancer Types","22 pages, 8 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research in oncology has changed the focus from histological properties of
tumors in a specific organ to a specific genomic aberration potentially shared
by multiple cancer types. This motivates the basket trial, which assesses the
efficacy of treatment simultaneously on multiple cancer types that have a
common aberration. Although the assumption of homogeneous treatment effects
seems reasonable given the shared aberration, in reality, the treatment effect
may vary by cancer type, and potentially only a subgroup of the cancer types
respond to the treatment. Various approaches have been proposed to increase the
trial power by borrowing information across cancer types, which, however, tend
to inflate the type I error rate. In this paper, we review some representative
Bayesian information borrowing methods for the analysis of early-phase basket
trials. We then propose a novel method called the Bayesian hierarchical model
with a correlated prior (CBHM), which conducts more flexible borrowing across
cancer types according to sample similarity. We did simulation studies to
compare CBHM with independent analysis and three information borrowing
approaches: the conventional Bayesian hierarchical model, the EXNEX approach
and Liu's two-stage approach. Simulation results show that all information
borrowing approaches substantially improve the power of independent analysis if
a large proportion of the cancer types truly respond to the treatment. Our
proposed CBHM approach shows an advantage over the existing information
borrowing approaches, with a power similar to that of EXNEX or Liu's approach,
but the potential to provide substantially better control of type I error rate.

dynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life,
and whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of
particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution
of our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated
to addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity
symmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and
seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory
underlying the standard model.
  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE
physics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE
liquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume III of this TDR describes how the
activities required to design, construct, fabricate, install, and commission
the DUNE far detector modules are organized and managed.
  This volume details the organizational structures that will carry out and/or
oversee the planned far detector activities safely, successfully, on time, and
on budget. It presents overviews of the facilities, supporting infrastructure,
and detectors for context, and it outlines the project-related functions and
methodologies used by the DUNE technical coordination organization, focusing on
the areas of integration engineering, technical reviews, quality assurance and
control, and safety oversight. Because of its more advanced stage of
development, functional examples presented in this volume focus primarily on
the single-phase (SP) detector module.

"2002.03009","Ryan McCarty","Ryan J. McCarty, Nimish Ronghe, Mandy Woo, Todd M. Alam","Blind Source Separation for NMR Spectra with Negative Intensity","28 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  NMR spectral datasets, especially in systems with limited samples, can be
difficult to interpret if they contain multiple chemical components (phases,
polymorphs, molecules, crystals, glasses, etc...) and the possibility of
overlapping resonances. In this paper, we benchmark several blind source
separation techniques for analysis of NMR spectral datasets containing negative
intensity. For benchmarking purposes, we generated a large synthetic datasbase
of quadrupolar solid-state NMR-like spectra that model spin-lattice T1
relaxation or nutation tip/flip angle experiments. Our benchmarking approach
focused exclusively on the ability of blind source separation techniques to
reproduce the spectra of the underlying pure components. In general, we find
that FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis), SIMPLISMA
(SIMPLe-to-use-Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis), and NNMF
(Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) are top-performing techniques. We
demonstrate that dataset normalization approaches prior to blind source
separation do not considerably improve outcomes. Within the range of noise
levels studied, we did not find drastic changes to the ranking of techniques.
The accuracy of FastICA and SIMPLISMA degrades quickly if excess (unreal) pure
components are predicted. Our results indicate poor performance of SVD
(Singular Value Decomposition) methods, and we propose alternative techniques
for matrix initialization. The benchmarked techniques are also applied to real
solid state NMR datasets. In general, the recommendations from the synthetic
datasets agree with the recommendations and results from the real data
analysis. The discussion provides some additional recommendations for
spectroscopists applying blind source separation to NMR datasets, and for
future benchmark studies.

  Central to achieving DUNE's physics program is a far detector that combines
the many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass necessary for rare event searches with
sub-centimeter spatial resolution in its ability to image those events,
allowing identification of the physics signatures among the numerous
backgrounds. In the single-phase liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC)
technology, ionization charges drift horizontally in the liquid argon under the
influence of an electric field towards a vertical anode, where they are read
out with fine granularity. A photon detection system supplements the TPC,
directly enhancing physics capabilities for all three DUNE physics drivers and
opening up prospects for further physics explorations.
  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE
physics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE
liquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume IV presents an overview of the
basic operating principles of a single-phase LArTPC, followed by a description
of the DUNE implementation. Each of the subsystems is described in detail,
connecting the high-level design requirements and decisions to the overriding
physics goals of DUNE.

importance to understand the physics of the accretion process in magnetized
neutron star systems. We investigate the magnetic field formation, evolution
and distribution for several High- Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs). We focus our
attention on the cyclotron lines that have been detected in HMXB classes in
their X-ray spectra. As has been correctly pointed out, several sources show
variation in cyclotron lines, this can result due to the effect of accretion
dynamics, and hence that would reflect the magnetic field characteristics.
Besides, the difference in time scales of variation of accretion rate and

neutrinos from the decay of charm and bottom hadrons produced at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). In the kinematical region of very forward rapidities,
heavy-flavor production and decay is a source of tau neutrinos that leads to
thousands of { charged-current} tau neutrino events in a 1 m long, 1 m radius
lead neutrino detector at a distance of 480 m from the interaction region. In
our computation, next-to-leading order QCD radiative corrections are accounted
for in the production cross-sections. Non-perturbative intrinsic-$k_T$ effects
are approximated by a simple phenomenological model introducing a Gaussian
$k_T$-smearing of the parton distribution functions, which might also mimic
perturbative effects due to multiple initial-state soft-gluon emissions. The
transition from partonic to hadronic states is described by phenomenological
fragmentation functions. To study the effect of various input parameters,
theoretical predictions for $D_s^\pm$ production are compared with LHCb data on
double-differential cross-sections in transverse momentum and rapidity. The
uncertainties related to the choice of the input parameter values, ultimately
affecting the predictions of the tau neutrino event distributions, are
discussed. We consider a 3+1 neutrino mixing scenario to illustrate the
potential for a neutrino experiment to constrain the 3+1 parameter space using
tau neutrinos and antineutrinos. We find large theoretical uncertainties in the
predictions of the neutrino fluxes in the far-forward region. Untangling the
effects of tau neutrino oscillations into sterile neutrinos and distinguishing
a 3+1 scenario from the standard scenario with three active neutrino flavours,
will be challenging due to the large theoretical uncertainties from QCD.

125 GeV, no solid signal for physics beyond the Standard Model has emerged so
far at LHC or at WIMP seach experiments. For the case of weak scale
supersymmetry (SUSY), LHC has found rather generally that gluinos are beyond
about 2.2 TeV whilst top squark must lie beyond 1.1 TeV. These limits
contradict older simplistic notions of naturalness that emerged in the
1980s-1990s, leading to the rather pessimistic view that SUSY is now excluded
except for perhaps some remaining narrow corners of parameter space. Yet, this
picture ignores several important developments in SUSY/string theory that
emerged in the 21st century: 1. the emergence of the string theory landscape
and its solution to the cosmological constant problem, 2. a more nuanced view
of naturalness including the notion of ""stringy naturalness"", 3. the emergence
of anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries and their connection to R-parity,
Peccei-Quinn symmetry, the SUSY mu problem and proton decay and 4. the
importance of including a solution to the strong CP problem. Rather general
considerations from the string theory landscape favor large values of soft
terms, subject to the vacuum selection criteria that electroweak symmetry is
properly broken (no CCB minima) and the resulting magnitude of the weak scale
is not too far from our measured value. Then stringy naturalness predicts a
Higgs mass m_h~ 125 GeV whilst sparticle masses are typically lifted beyond
present LHC bounds. In light of these refinements in theory perspective
confronted by LHC and dark matter search results, we review the most likely
LHC, ILC and dark matter signatures that are expected to arise from weak scale
SUSY as we understand it today.

party of its output bipartite state is used to herald a single photon or a
single photon added coherent state. From the heralded state and linear optics
the HER is created. In the proposed teleportation protocol Bob uses the HER to
teleport qubits with different spectral properties. Bob makes a Bell
measurement in the single photon basis and characterizes the scheme with its
average quantum teleportation fidelity. Fidelities close to one are expected
for qubits in a wide spectral range. The work also includes a discussion about
the fidelity dependence on the geometrical properties of the medium through

includes a certification that its prediction would be the same had some number

previously been used to guarantee---with high probability---test-time
robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to a classifier; we derive
a variant which provides a deterministic, analytical bound, sidestepping the
probabilistic certificates that traditionally result from the sampling
subprocedure. Further, we obtain these certified bounds with minimal additional
runtime complexity over standard classification and no assumptions on the train

some applications to discrete structures as graphs, ordered sets and transition
systems. Results in that direction started in the middle eighties based on the
impulse given by Quilliot (1983). Graphs and ordered sets were considered as
kind of metric spaces, where - instead of real numbers - the values of the
distance functions $d$ belong to an ordered semigroup equipped with an
involution. In this frame, maps preserving graphs or posets are exactly the
nonexpansive mappings (that is the maps $f$ such that $d(f(x),f(y))\leq
d(x,y)$, for all $x,y$). It was observed that many known results on retractions
and fixed point property for classical metric spaces (whose morphisms are the
nonexpansive mappings) are also valid for these spaces. For example, the
characterization of absolute retracts, by Aronszajn and Panitchpakdi (1956),
the construction of the injective envelope by Isbell (1965) and the fixed point
theorem of Sine and Soardi (1979) translate into the Banaschewski-Bruns theorem
(1967), the MacNeille completion of a poset (1933) and the famous Tarski fixed
point theorem (1955). This prompted an analysis of several classes of discrete
structures from a metric point of view. In this paper, we report the results
obtained over the years with a particular emphasis on the fixed point property.

charm quark mass m_c have been estimated using interpolation between the m_c=0

differential equations in z=m_c^2/m_b^2 that are being numerically solved.

probability measures (i.e., the Wasserstein space). This objective is typically
a divergence w.r.t. a fixed target distribution. In recent years, these
continuous time dynamics have been used to study the convergence of machine
learning algorithms aiming at approximating a probability distribution.
However, the discrete-time behavior of these algorithms might differ from the

that can tackle the case where the objective function is the sum of a smooth

optimization and optimal transport, we analyze the FB scheme as a minimization
algorithm on the Wasserstein space. More precisely, we show under mild

vehicles in a multi-agent system as particles of a deformable body. A desired
continuum deformation is defined based on leaders' trajectories and acquired by
followers in real-time through local communication. The existing continuum
deformation theory requires followers to be placed inside the convex simplex
defined by leaders. This constraint is relaxed in this paper. We prove that
under suitable assumptions any (n+1)(n=1,2,3) vehicles forming an n-D simplex
can be selected as leaders while followers, arbitrarily positioned inside or
outside the leading simplex, can acquire a desired continuum deformation in a
decentralized fashion. The paper's second contribution is to assign a
one-to-one mapping between leaders' smooth trajectories and homogeneous
deformation features obtained by continuum deformation eigen-decomposition.
Therefore, a safe and smooth continuum deformation coordination can be planned
either by shaping homogeneous transformation features or by choosing
appropriate leader trajectories. This is beneficial to efficiently plan and
guarantee inter-agent collision avoidance in a large-scale group. A simulation
case study is reported in which a virtual convex simplex contains a quadcopter
vehicle team at any time t; A* search is applied to optimize quadcopter team

common underlying representation between arbitrary languages means detecting
clones requires one of the following solutions: 1) a static analysis framework
replicated across each targeted language with annotations matching language
features across all languages, or 2) a dynamic analysis framework that detects
clones based on runtime behavior.
  In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the latter solution, a
dynamic analysis approach called SLACC for cross-language clone detection. Like
prior clone detection techniques, we use input/output behavior to match clones,
though we overcome limitations of prior work by amplifying the number of inputs
and covering more data types; and as a result, achieve better clusters than
prior attempts. Since clusters are generated based on input/output behavior,
SLACC supports cross-language clone detection. As an added challenge, we target
a static typed language, Java, and a dynamic typed language, Python. Compared
to HitoshiIO, a recent clone detection tool for Java, SLACC retrieves 6 times
as many clusters and has higher precision (86.7% vs. 30.7%).
  This is the first work to perform clone detection for dynamic typed languages
(precision = 87.3%) and the first to perform clone detection across languages

first step towards the larger goal of scalable language migration tools.

access (URA) problem, by leveraging the rich spatial dimensionality offered by
large-scale antenna arrays. This paper makes an observation that spatial
signature is key to URA in massive connectivity setups. The proposed scheme
relies on a slotted transmission framework but eliminates the need for
concatenated coding that was introduced in the context of the coupled
compressive sensing (CCS) paradigm. Indeed, all existing works on CCS-based URA
rely on an inner/outer tree-based encoder/decoder to stitch the slot-wise
recovered sequences. This paper takes a different path by harnessing the
nature-provided correlations between the slotwise reconstructed channels of
each user in order to put together its decoded sequences. The required
slot-wise channel estimates and decoded sequences are first obtained through
the hybrid generalized approximate message passing (HyGAMP) algorithm which
systematically accommodates the multiantenna-induced group sparsity. Then, a
channel correlation-aware clustering framework based on the
expectation-maximization (EM) concept is used together with the Hungarian
algorithm to find the slotwise optimal assignment matrices by enforcing two
clustering constraints that are very specific to the problem at hand. Stitching
is then accomplished by associating the decoded sequences to their respective
users according to the ensuing assignment matrices. Exhaustive computer
simulations reveal that the proposed scheme can bring performance improvements,
at high spectral efficiencies, as compared to a state-of-the-art technique that
investigates the use of large-scale antenna arrays in the context of massive

check for the presence, or absence of an element, the Bloom tree achieves
efficient verification by using a compact Merkle multiproof.

However, clustering methods remove peaks and other extreme events, which are

introduce a method to find extreme periods based on the slack variables of the

life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often
health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with
others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health.
For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of
healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people
with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in
social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.
We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,
motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.
In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:
a) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of
the person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure
for interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically
organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human
interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the
findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions
identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in
designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities

and (iii) the lack of semantic rule-based analysis. To address these challenges
we introduce a toolset, binnacle, that enabled us to ingest 900,000 GitHub
repositories.
  Focusing on Docker, we extracted approximately 178,000 unique Dockerfiles,
and also identified a Gold Set of Dockerfiles written by Docker experts. We
addressed challenge (i) by reducing the number of effectively uninterpretable
nodes in our ASTs by over 80% via a technique we call phased parsing. To
address challenge (ii), we introduced a novel rule-mining technique capable of
recovering two-thirds of the rules in a benchmark we curated. Through this
automated mining, we were able to recover 16 new rules that were not found
during manual rule collection. To address challenge (iii), we manually
collected a set of rules for Dockerfiles from commits to the files in the Gold
Set. These rules encapsulate best practices, avoid docker build failures, and
improve image size and build latency. We created an analyzer that used these
rules, and found that, on average, Dockerfiles on GitHub violated the rules
five times more frequently than the Dockerfiles in our Gold Set. We also found
that industrial Dockerfiles fared no better than those sourced from GitHub.
  The learned rules and analyzer in binnacle can be used to aid developers in

Model-based RL leverages learned surrogate models that describe dynamics and
rewards of individual tasks, such that planning in a good surrogate can lead to
good control of the true system. Rather than solving each task individually
from scratch, hierarchical models can exploit the fact that tasks are often
related by (unobserved) causal factors of variation in order to achieve
efficient generalization, as in learning how the mass of an item affects the
force required to lift it can generalize to previously unobserved masses. We
propose Generalized Hidden Parameter MDPs (GHP-MDPs) that describe a family of
MDPs where both dynamics and reward can change as a function of hidden
parameters that vary across tasks. The GHP-MDP augments model-based RL with
latent variables that capture these hidden parameters, facilitating transfer
across tasks. We also explore a variant of the model that incorporates explicit
latent structure mirroring the causal factors of variation across tasks (for
instance: agent properties, environmental factors, and goals). We

this as a reinforcement learning problem, where the generation agent learns a
policy to generate a musical note (action) based on previously generated

model. Instead of defining it using music composition rules, we learn this
model from monophonic and polyphonic training data. This model considers the
compatibility of the machine-generated note with both the machine-generated

forward pass and is highly efficient at inference stage compared with
autoregressive translation (AT) methods. However, NAT models often suffer from
the multimodality problem, i.e., generating duplicated tokens or missing

Look-Around (LA) strategy and the Vocabulary Attention (VA) mechanism. The
Look-Around strategy predicts the neighbor tokens in order to predict the
current token, and the Vocabulary Attention models long-term token dependencies
inside the decoder by attending the whole vocabulary for each position to
acquire knowledge of which token is about to generate. %We also propose a
dynamic bidirectional decoding approach to accelerate the inference process of
the LAVA model while preserving the high-quality of the generated output. Our
proposed model uses significantly less time during inference compared with
autoregressive models and most other NAT models. Our experiments on four
benchmarks (WMT14 En$\rightarrow$De, WMT14 De$\rightarrow$En, WMT16
Ro$\rightarrow$En and IWSLT14 De$\rightarrow$En) show that the proposed model
achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art

observe both second- and third-order magnonic EPs by tuning the interlayer
coupling strength, the external magnetic field, and the gain-loss parameter. We
show that the magnetic sensitivity can be enhanced by $3$ orders of magnitude

simulate the evolution of several molecular species including H2O, CH3OH, and

trustless systems to guarantee system's functioning when up to 1/3 Byzantine
processes exist. Despite a plethora of previous work in BFT systems, they are
mainly concerned about common knowledge deducible from the states of all
participant processes. In BFT systems, it is crucial to know about which
knowledge a process knows about the states of other processes and the global
state of the system. However, there is a lack of studies about common knowledge
of Byzantine faults, such as, whether existence of a Byzantine node is known by
all honest nodes. In a dynamic setting, processes may fail or get compromised
unexpectedly and unpredictably. It is critical to reason about which processes
know about the faulty processes of the network.
  In this paper, we are interested in studying BFT systems in which Byzantine
processes may misbehave randomly, possibly at some random periods of time. The
problem of \emph{probabilistic Byzantine} (PB) processes studied in this paper
is more general than the problems previously studied in existing work. We
propose an approach that allows us to formulate and reason about the concurrent
knowledge of the PB processes by all processes. We present our study of the

with respect to disorder in shape of the string. The results may be relevant
for localization phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensates, optical fibers and

crafted to mislead the output of the threat model. Different from vanilla
colorful images, images of printed text have clear backgrounds usually.
However, adversarial examples generated by most of the existing adversarial

the center of a transient source, an X-ray burster MAXI J1421-613, in the
Suzaku follow-up analysis. The spectrum of the annular emission shows no
significant emission-line structure, and is well explained by an absorbed power
law model with a photon index of $\sim$4.2. These features exclude the
possibility that the annular emission is a shell-like component of a supernova
remnant. The spectral shape, the time history, and the X-ray flux of the
annular emission agree with the scenario that the emission is due to a
dust-scattering echo. The annular emission is made under a rare condition of
the dust-scattering echo, where the central X-ray source, MAXI J1421-613,
exhibits a short time outburst with three X-ray bursts and immediately
re-enters a long quiescent period. The distribution of the hydrogen column
density along the annular emission follows that of the CO intensity, which
means that MAXI J1421-613 is located behind the CO cloud. We estimate the
distance to MAXI J1421-613 to be $\sim$3~kpc assuming that the dust layer
responsible for the annular emission is located at the same position as the CO

particles number of ground state and excited state are calculated analytically
to ideal Bose gases in the external potentials under GUP. Below the critical
temperature, taking rubidium and sodium atoms ideal Bose gases whose particle
densities are under standard and experimental conditions, respectively, as
examples, the relations of internal energy, heat capacity and entropy with

show that: GUP leads to an increase in the critical temperature. When the
temperature is lower than the critical temperature and slightly higher than
zero Kelvin, GUP's amendments to internal energy, heat capacity and entropy are
positive; As the temperature increases to a certain value, these amendments
become negative. The external potentials can increase or decrease the influence
of GUP on thermodynamic properties. Under the initial experimental conditions
when Bose-Einstein condensation was first verified by sodium atomic gas, the
influence of GUP can be completely ignored. Under certain conditions, GUP may
become the dominant factor governing the thermodynamic properties of the

planning and optimization problems by satisfying a set of constraints. These
constraint problems (CPs) are typically NP-complete and can be formalized as
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) or constraint optimization problems
(COPs). Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are good solvers for optimization
problems ubiquitous in various problem domains, however traditional operators
for EAs are 'blind' to constraints or generally use problem dependent objective
functions; as they do not exploit information from the constraints in search
for solutions. A variation of EA, Intelligent constraint handling evolutionary
algorithm (ICHEA), has been demonstrated to be a versatile constraints-guided
EA for continuous constrained problems in our earlier works in (Sharma and
Sharma, 2012) where it extracts information from constraints and exploits it in
the evolutionary search to make the search more efficient. In this paper ICHEA
has been demonstrated to solve benchmark exam timetabling problems, a classic
COP. The presented approach demonstrates competitive results with other
state-of-the-art approaches in EAs in terms of quality of solutions. ICHEA
first uses its inter-marriage crossover operator to satisfy all the given
constraints incrementally and then uses combination of traditional and enhanced
operators to optimize the solution. Generally CPs solved by EAs are problem
dependent penalty based fitness functions. We also proposed a generic
preference based solution model that does not require a problem dependent
fitness function, however currently it only works for mutually exclusive
constraints.

a legitimate receiver against an eavesdropper over slow fading channels, taking
into account the impact of finite blocklength secrecy coding. A comprehensive
analysis and optimization framework is established to investigate secrecy
throughput for both single- and multi-antenna transmitter scenarios. Both
adaptive and non-adaptive design schemes are devised, in which the secrecy
throughput is maximized by exploiting the instantaneous and statistical channel
state information of the legitimate receiver, respectively. Specifically,
optimal transmission policy, blocklength, and code rates are jointly designed
to maximize the secrecy throughput. Additionally, null-space artificial noise
is employed to improve the secrecy throughput for the multi-antenna setup with
the optimal power allocation derived.Various important insights are developed.
In particular, 1) increasing blocklength benefits both reliability and secrecy
under the proposed transmission policy; 2) secrecy throughput monotonically
increases with blocklength; 3) secrecy throughput initially increases but then
decreases as secrecy rate increases, and the optimal secrecy rate maximizing
the secrecy throughput should be carefully chosen in order to strike a good
balance between rate and decoding correctness. Numerical results are eventually
presented to verify theoretical findings.

resurgence due to several recent developments which improve either the overall
computational efficiency or the compactness of the resulting SCI vector. These
recent advances have made it possible to get full CI (FCI) quality results for
much larger orbital active spaces, compared to conventional approaches.
However, due to the starting assumption that the FCI vector has only a small
number of significant Slater determinants, SCI becomes intractable for systems
with strong correlation. This paper introduces a method for developing SCI
algorithms in a way which exploits local molecular structure to significantly
reduce the number of SCI variables. The proposed method is defined by first
grouping the orbitals into clusters over which we can define many particle
cluster states. We then directly perform the SCI algorithm in a basis of tensor
products of cluster states instead of Slater determinants. While the approach
is general for arbitrarily defined cluster states, we find significantly
improved performance by defining cluster states through a Tucker decomposition
of the global (and sparse) SCI vector. To demonstrate the potential of this
method, called tensor product selected configuration interaction (TPSCI), we
present numerical results for a diverse set of examples: 1) modified Hubbard
model with different inter- and intra-cluster hopping terms, 2) less obviously
clusterable cases of bond breaking in N2 and F2, and 3) ground state energies
of large planar {\pi}-conjugated systems with active spaces of up to 42
electrons in 42 orbitals. These numerical results show that TPSCI can be used
to significantly reduce the number of SCI variables in the variational space,
and thus paving a path for extending these deterministic and variational SCI
approaches to a wider range of physical systems.

a rotational velocity that is a function of radial position only, implying that
individual components have lost any information about their prior states.
Thermodynamically, such an equilibrium state is a microcanonical ensemble with
maximum entropy, characterised by a lognormal probability distribution.
Assuming this for the surface density distribution yields rotation curves that
closely match observational data across a wide range of disc masses and galaxy
types, and provides a useful tool for modelling the theoretical density
distribution in the disc. A universal disc spin parameter emerges from the
model, giving a tight virial mass estimator with strong correlation between
angular momentum and disc mass, suggesting a mechanism by which the proto-disc
developed by dumping excess mass to the core, or excess angular momentum to a
satellite galaxy. The baryonic-to-dynamic mass ratio for the model approaches
unity for high mass galaxies, but is generally $<1$ for low mass discs, and
this discrepancy appears to follow a similar relationship to that shown in
recent work on the radial acceleration relation (RAR). Although this may
support Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in preference to a dark matter (DM)

with important consequences for our understanding of processes like
circumstellar disk evolution and planet formation.A number of post-asymptotic
giant branch stars are found to host optically thick, dust- and gas-rich
circumstellar discs in Keplerian orbits. These discs exhibit evidence of dust
evolution, similar to protoplanetary discs; however since post-AGB discs have
substantially shorter lifetimes than protoplanetary discs they may provide new
insights on the grain-growth process. We examine a sample of post-AGB stars
with discs to determine the FIR and sub-mm spectral index by homogeneously
fitting a sample of data from \textit{Herschel}, the SMA and the literature. We
find that grain growth to at least hundreds of micrometres is ubiquitous in
these systems, and that the distribution of spectral indices is more similar to
that of protoplanetary discs than debris discs. No correlation is found with
the mid-infrared colours of the discs, implying that grain growth occurs
independently of the disc structure in post-AGB discs. We infer that grain
growth to $\sim$mm sizes must occur on timescales $<<10^{5}$ yr, perhaps by
orders of magnitude, as the lifetimes of these discs are expected to be
$\lesssim10^{5}$~yr and all objects have converged to the same state. This
growth timescale is short compared to the results of models for protoplanetary

linearly and circularly polarized light irradiation have been theoretically
studied. Since TMMs have the double-layered Kagome lattice structures for their
$\pi$-electrons, i.e., tiling of trigonal and hexagonal-symmetric rings, the
electronic band structures of TMMs have non-equivalent Dirac cones and perfect
flat bands. By constructing the tight-binding model to describe the
pi-electronic states of TMMs, we have evaluated the optical absorption
intensities and valley selective excitation of TMMs based on the Kubo formula.
It is found that absorption intensities crucially depend on both light
polarization angle and the excitation position in momentum space, i.e., the
momentum and valley selective optical excitation. The polarization dependence
and optical selection rules are also clarified by using group theoretical
analyses.

drones, have found numerous applications including package and parcel delivery
for shippers. Drone delivery offers benefits over conventional ground-based
vehicle delivery in terms of faster speed, lower cost, more
environment-friendly, and less manpower needed. However, most of existing
studies on drone delivery planning and scheduling focus on a single shipper and
ignore uncertainty factors. As such, in this paper, we consider a scenario that
multiple shippers can cooperate to minimize their drone delivery cost. We
propose the Bayesian Shipper Cooperation in Stochastic Drone Delivery (BCoSDD)
framework. The framework is composed of three functions, i.e., package
assignment, shipper cooperation formation and cost management. The
uncertainties of drone breakdown and misbehavior of cooperative shippers are
taken into account by using multistage stochastic programming optimization and
dynamic Bayesian coalition formation game. We conduct extensive performance
evaluation of the BCoSDD framework by using customer locations from Solomon
benchmark suite and a real Singapore logistics industry. As a result, the
framework can help the shippers plan and schedule their drone delivery
effectively.

bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously seeks to reduce vehicular
throughput in the network over time (maximize impact) while introducing minimal
changes to network signal timings (minimize noticeability). We represent the
Spatio-temporal traffic dynamics as a static network flow problem on a
time-expanded graph. This allows us to reduce the (non-convex) attack problem
to a tractable form, which can be solved using traditional techniques used to
solve linear network programming problems. We show that minor but objective
adjustments in the signal timings over time can severely impact traffic
conditions at the network level. We investigate network vulnerability by
examining the concavity of the Pareto-optimal frontier obtained by solving the
bi-objective attack problem. Numerical experiments are carried to illustrate
the types of insights that can be extracted from the Pareto-optimal frontier.
For instance, our experiments suggest that the vulnerability of a traffic
network to signal tampering is independent of the demand levels.

Different filtering techniques can be adapted for noise diminution to develop
the visual quality as well as understandability of images. In this paper, four
types of noises have been undertaken and applied on some images. The filtering
of these noises uses different types of filters like Mean, Median, Weiner,

carry out this work, we analyse when a composition of $2$-adjunctions is a lax

  Recognition","AAAI-2020(Oral)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Egocentric video recognition is a natural testbed for diverse interaction
reasoning. Due to the large action vocabulary in egocentric video datasets,
recent studies usually utilize a two-branch structure for action recognition,
ie, one branch for verb classification and the other branch for noun
classification. However, correlation studies between the verb and the noun
branches have been largely ignored. Besides, the two branches fail to exploit
local features due to the absence of a position-aware attention mechanism. In
this paper, we propose a novel Symbiotic Attention framework leveraging
Privileged information (SAP) for egocentric video recognition. Finer
position-aware object detection features can facilitate the understanding of
actor's interaction with the object. We introduce these features in action
recognition and regard them as privileged information. Our framework enables
mutual communication among the verb branch, the noun branch, and the privileged
information. This communication process not only injects local details into
global features but also exploits implicit guidance about the spatio-temporal
position of an on-going action. We introduce novel symbiotic attention (SA) to
enable effective communication. It first normalizes the detection guided
features on one branch to underline the action-relevant information from the
other branch. SA adaptively enhances the interactions among the three sources.
To further catalyze this communication, spatial relations are uncovered for the
selection of most action-relevant information. It identifies the most valuable
and discriminative feature for classification. We validate the effectiveness of
our SAP quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, it achieves the
state-of-the-art on two large-scale egocentric video datasets.

this work, we leverage emerging data-driven modeling techniques to develop
highly accurate and tractable reduced-order aeroelastic models that are valid
over a wide range of operating conditions and are suitable for control. In
particular, we develop two extensions to the recent dynamic mode decomposition
with control (DMDc) algorithm to make it suitable for flexible aeroelastic
systems: 1) we introduce a formulation to handle algebraic equations, and 2) we
develop an interpolation scheme to smoothly connect several linear DMDc models
developed in different operating regimes. Thus, the innovation lies in
accurately modeling the nonlinearities of the coupled aerostructural dynamics
over multiple operating regimes, not restricting the validity of the model to a
narrow region around a linearization point. We demonstrate this approach on a
high-fidelity, three-dimensional numerical model of an airborne wind energy
(AWE) system, although the methods are generally applicable to any highly
coupled aeroelastic system or dynamical system operating over multiple
operating regimes. Our proposed modeling framework results in real-time

i.e., transfer learning and classification, each of which has at least one
parameter to be tuned to achieve their optimal performance. This practice fits
well with the purpose of automated parameter optimization. However, there is a
lack of thorough understanding about what are the impacts of automated
parameter optimization on various CPDP techniques. In this paper, we present
the first empirical study that looks into such impacts on 62 CPDP techniques,
13 of which are chosen from the existing CPDP literature while the other 49

facial expression recognition (FER). Given 4D data, we first propose a novel
augmentation method to combat the data limitation problem for deep learning.
This is achieved by projecting the input data into RGB and depth map images and
then iteratively performing randomized channel concatenation. Encoded in the
given 3D landmarks, we also introduce an effective way to capture the facial
muscle movements from three orthogonal plans (TOP), the TOP-landmarks over
multi-views. Importantly, we then present a sparsity-aware deep network to
compute the sparse representations of convolutional features over multi-views.
This is not only effective for a higher recognition accuracy but is also
computationally convenient. For training, the TOP-landmarks and sparse
representations are used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The
refined predictions are achieved when the learned features collaborate over
multi-views. Extensive experimental results achieved on the BU-4DFE dataset
show the significance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods by
reaching a promising accuracy of 99.69% for 4D FER.

temperature stability can be maintained to within better than 8 {\mu}K of its

further improving the stability were also demonstrated, which can be a
reference for temperature metrology field worldwide and other fields where

gauge to control the pressure, and a home-made gas compensation system to

mining. For a given dataset $S$ of $n$ elements, the problem requires to
determine a subset of $S$ containing $k\ll n$ ""representatives"" which minimize
some diversity function expressed in terms of pairwise distances, where
distance models dissimilarity. An important variant of the problem prescribes
that the solution satisfy an additional orthogonal requirement, which can be
specified as a matroid constraint (i.e., a feasible solution must be an
independent set of size $k$ of a given matroid). While unconstrained diversity
maximization admits efficient coreset-based strategies for several diversity
functions, known approaches dealing with the additional matroid constraint
apply only to one diversity function (sum of distances), and are based on an
expensive, inherently sequential, local search over the entire input dataset.
We devise the first coreset-based algorithms for diversity maximization under
matroid constraints for various diversity functions, together with efficient
sequential, MapReduce and Streaming implementations. Technically, our
algorithms rely on the construction of a small coreset, that is, a subset of
$S$ containing a feasible solution which is no more than a factor $1-\epsilon$
away from the optimal solution for $S$. While our algorithms are fully general,
for the partition and transversal matroids, if $\epsilon$ is a constant in
$(0,1)$ and $S$ has bounded doubling dimension, the coreset size is independent
of $n$ and it is small enough to afford the execution of a slow sequential
algorithm to extract a final, accurate, solution in reasonable time. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms are accurate, fast and scalable, and
therefore they are capable of dealing with the large input instances typical of
the big data scenario.

cryocooler (PTC) displays temperature oscillations caused by the intrinsic
working principle of the regenerative cryocooler. To dampen such oscillations
usually requires either a large heat capacity or a large thermal resistance. To
understand this phenomenon better and suppress it more effectively, both the
step response characteristic and the intrinsic oscillation characteristic of
cryostat have been used to obtain the complete transfer functions of a
simulation model. The latter is used to test and optimize traditional PID
feedback control. The results showed this approach has almost no effect on the
temperature oscillation amplitude. Based on this simulation model, a novel
active method was proposed and tested numerically. Simulation results predict
the method should suppress the amplitude of the original temperature
oscillation by a factor of two.

oscillation, however, limits its application in experiments requiring high
thermal stability at low temperature (below 77 K). Passive suppression methods
are effective but all suffer from drawbacks. We describe a novel, active
suppression scheme more efficient than traditional proportional-integral (PI)
control. The experimental results show that it can reduce the standard
deviation of the temperature oscillation by a further 30% compared with PI
feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such active

estimate the optimal transport plan/map solely using samples from the given
source and target marginal distributions. This work takes the novel approach of
posing statistical OT as that of learning the transport plan's kernel mean
embedding from sample based estimates of marginal embeddings. The proposed
estimator controls overfitting by employing maximum mean discrepancy based
regularization, which is complementary to $\phi$-divergence (entropy) based
regularization popularly employed in existing estimators. A key result is that,
under very mild conditions, $\epsilon$-optimal recovery of the transport plan
as well as the Barycentric-projection based transport map is possible with a
sample complexity that is completely dimension-free. Moreover, the implicit
smoothing in the kernel mean embeddings enables out-of-sample estimation. An
appropriate representer theorem is proved leading to a kernelized convex
formulation for the estimator, which can then be potentially used to perform OT
even in non-standard domains. Empirical results illustrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Besides, the original DPC algorithm requires visiting a large number of

(i) a simple List Index, and (ii) an advanced Cumulative Histogram Index.
Efficient query algorithms are proposed for these indices which significantly
avoids irrelevant comparisons at the cost of space. For memory-constrained

differentiating naked singularities from black holes is through the comparative
study of thin accretion disks properties around these different types of
compact objects. In the present paper we continue the comparative investigation
of accretion disk properties around axially-symmetric rotating geometries in
Brans-Dicke theory in the presence of a massless scalar field. The solution of
the field equations contains the Kerr metric as a particular case, and,
depending on the numerical values of the model parameter $\gamma$, has also
solutions corresponding to non-trivial black holes and naked singularities,
respectively. Due to the differences in the exterior geometries between black

electromagnetic properties of the disks (energy flux, temperature distribution
and equilibrium radiation spectrum) are different for these two classes of
compact objects, consequently giving clear observational signatures that could
discriminate between black holes and naked singularities.

characteristic heavily constrains their capability to learn implicit visual
grammars behind the collaboration of different visual cues (i,e., hand shape,
facial expression and body posture). By injecting multi-cue learning into
neural network design, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-cue (STMC) network
to solve the vision-based sequence learning problem. Our STMC network consists
of a spatial multi-cue (SMC) module and a temporal multi-cue (TMC) module. The
SMC module is dedicated to spatial representation and explicitly decomposes
visual features of different cues with the aid of a self-contained pose
estimation branch. The TMC module models temporal correlations along two
parallel paths, i.e., intra-cue and inter-cue, which aims to preserve the
uniqueness and explore the collaboration of multiple cues. Finally, we design a
joint optimization strategy to achieve the end-to-end sequence learning of the
STMC network. To validate the effectiveness, we perform experiments on three
large-scale CSLR benchmarks: PHOENIX-2014, CSL and PHOENIX-2014-T. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art

the operational and mathematical definition(s) of the notion of pure state.
Continuing this analysis, in this work we attempt to address the role of
'purity' and 'mixtures' within two different categorical approaches to QM,
namely, the topos approach originally presented by Chris Isham and Jeremy
Butterfield [27, 28, 29] and the more recent logos categorical approach
presented by the authors of this article [10, 11, 13]. While the first approach
exposes the difficulties to produce a consistent understanding of pure states
and mixtures, the latter approach presents a new scheme in which their
reference is erased right from the start in favor of an intensive understanding
of projection operators and quantum superpositions. This new account of the
theory, grounded on an intensive interpretation of the Born rule, allows us not
only to avoid the orthodox interpretation of projection operators --either as
referring to definite valued properties or measurement outcomes-- but also to
consider all matrices (of any rank) on equal footing. It is from this latter
standpoint that we conclude that instead of distinguishing between pure and
mixed states it would be recommendable --for a proper understanding of the

Transitive-Aligned kernel, by transitively aligning the vertices between graphs
through a family of hierarchical prototype graphs. Comparing to most existing
state-of-the-art graph kernels, the proposed kernel has three theoretical
advantages. First, it incorporates the locational correspondence information
between graphs into the kernel computation, and thus overcomes the shortcoming
of ignoring structural correspondences arising in most R-convolution kernels.
Second, it guarantees the transitivity between the correspondence information
that is not available for most existing matching kernels. Third, it
incorporates the information of all graphs under comparisons into the kernel
computation process, and thus encapsulates richer characteristics. By
transductively training the C-SVM classifier, experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of the new transitive-aligned kernel. The
proposed kernel can outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on standard
graph-based datasets in terms of the classification accuracy.

the context of social networks, it allows to estimate the relationship strength

Neighbourhood Overlap. It computes the ratio of common neighbours to all
neighbours of an edge terminal nodes. This method has been initially proposed
for unweighted networks and later extended for weighted ones. These two
versions of the method are not mathematically equivalent: In fact, an
unweighted network is commonly considered as weighted with all edge weights
equal to one. Using both existent versions of Neighbourhood Overlap on such

problem and propose a new generalization for Neighbourhood Overlap that works
equally for unweighted and weighted networks. Experiment performed on networks

scale, can stabilize the Higgs sector led many authors to explore the role it
may play in particle physics. It was widely anticipated that superpartners
would reveal themselves once the TeV scale was probed in high energy
collisions. Experiments at the LHC have not yet revealed any sign for direct
production of superpartners, or for any other physics beyond the Standard
Model. This has led to some authors to question whether weak scale SUSY has a
role to play in stabilizing the Higgs sector. We show that SUSY models with
just the minimal particle content may well be consistent with data and
simultaneously serve to stabilize the Higgs sector, if model parameters
generally regarded as independent turn out to be appropriately correlated. In
our view, it would be premature to ignore this possibility, given that we do
not understand the underlying mechanism of SUSY breaking. We advocate using the
electroweak scale quantity, $\delew$, to determine whether a given SUSY
spectrum might arise from a theory with low fine-tuning, even when the
parameters correlations mentioned above are present. We find that all such
models contain light higgsinos and that this leads to the possibility of new
strategies for searching for SUSY. We discuss phenomenological implications of
these models for SUSY searches at the LHC and its luminosity and energy
upgrades, as well as at future electron-positron colliders. We conclude that
natural SUSY, defined as no worse than a part in 30 fine-tuning, will not
escape detection at a $pp$ collider operating at 27~TeV and an integrated
luminosity of 15~ab$^{-1}$, or at an electron-positron collider with a

images) comprehensively and efficiently is a widely needed but challenging
task. Numerous models were proposed to label various data and many approaches
were designed to enhance the ability of deep learning models or accelerate
them. Unfortunately, a single machine-learning model is not powerful enough to
extract various semantic information from data. Given certain applications,
such as image retrieval platforms and photo album management apps, it is often
required to execute a collection of models to obtain sufficient labels. With
limited computing resources and stringent delay, given a data stream and a
collection of applicable resource-hungry deep-learning models, we design a
novel approach to adaptively schedule a subset of these models to execute on
each data item, aiming to maximize the value of the model output (e.g., the
number of high-confidence labels). Achieving this lofty goal is nontrivial
since a model's output on any data item is content-dependent and unknown until
we execute it. To tackle this, we propose an Adaptive Model Scheduling
framework, consisting of 1) a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to
predict the value of unexecuted models by mining semantic relationship among
diverse models, and 2) two heuristic algorithms to adaptively schedule the
model execution order under a deadline or deadline-memory constraints
respectively. The proposed framework doesn't require any prior knowledge of the
data, which works as a powerful complement to existing model optimization
technologies. We conduct extensive evaluations on five diverse image datasets
and 30 popular image labeling models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
design: our design could save around 53\% execution time without loss of any
valuable labels.

compensating background charge can evolve maintaining spatial homogeneity and
isotropy that mimic the cosmological evolution of a universe with repulsive
gravity. Here we study dynamics of small perturbations on the background of the
corresponding Hubble flow by analyzing its normal modes of vibrations.
Arbitrary disturbance of the flow can be resolved into two electro-acoustic,
two vortical, and one entropic modes whose dynamics is investigated.
Specifically, in the zero pressure or long-wavelength limits perturbations of
density and velocity evolve in a manner that is independent of the form of the
initial disturbance. The same conclusion applies to vortical perturbations of
the velocity for arbitrary pressure while entropic perturbations are advected
by the Hubble flow. Without the background charge the underlying Hubble flow
describes a Coulomb explosion whose stability with respect to small
disturbances is also demonstrated.
