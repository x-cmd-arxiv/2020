full knowledge of the governing equations and the operators of a full model of

non-polynomial terms in analytic form and learns the rest of the dynamics from
snapshots computed with a potentially black-box full-model solver. The proposed
method learns operators for the linear and polynomially nonlinear dynamics via
a least-squares problem, where the given non-polynomial terms are incorporated
in the right-hand side. The least-squares problem is linear and thus can be
solved efficiently in practice. The proposed method is demonstrated on three
problems governed by partial differential equations, namely the
diffusion-reaction Chafee-Infante model, a tubular reactor model for reactive

process. The numerical results provide evidence that the proposed approach
learns reduced models that achieve comparable accuracy as models constructed

Moreover, the laws of thermodynamics provide a direction for the changes in the

involving an outward radial flux of impurity ions from the core of fusion
devices. Quasisymmetric magnetic fields are intrinsically ambipolar and give
rise to temperature screening for low enough $\eta^{-1}\equiv d\ln n/d\ln T$.
In contrast, neoclassical fluxes in generic stellarators will depend on the
radial electric field, which is predicted to be inward for ion-root plasmas,
potentially leading to impurity accumulation. Here we examine the impurity
particle flux in a number of approximately quasisymmetric stellarator
configurations and parameter regimes while varying the amount of
symmetry-breaking in the magnetic field. The amount of symmetry-breaking (from
perfect quasisymmetry) required to lose temperature screening is dependent on
the particular configuration and flux surface. Neoclassical fluxes have been
obtained using the SFINCS drift-kinetic equation solver with the electrostatic
potential $\Phi=\Phi(\psi)$, where $\psi$ is a flux surface label. Results
indicate that achieving temperature screening is possible, but unlikely, at
reactor-relevant conditions in the core. Thus, the small departures from
symmetry in nominally quasisymmetric stellarators are large enough to
significantly alter the neoclassical impurity transport. A further look at
these fluxes when compared to a gyro-Bohm turbulence estimate suggests that
neoclassical fluxes are small in optimized configurations compared to turbulent
fluxes. Therefore, although neoclassical impurity accumulation is expected in
most situations, the strength of the turbulence may render this irrelevant.

thrusters, including the thrust, specific impulse, and the thruster efficiency,
assume a steady state plasma flow with a constant flow velocity. However, it is
very common for these thrusters that the plasma exhibits unstable behavior
resulting in time-variations of the thrust and the exhaust velocity. For
example, in Hall thrusters, the ionization instability leads to strong
oscillations of the discharge current (so-called breathing oscillations),
plasma density, ion energy, and as a result the ion flow. In this paper, we
revisit the formulation of the thrust and the thrust efficiency to account for
time variations of the ion parameters including the phase shift between the ion
energy and the ion flow. For sinusoidal oscillations it was found thrust can
potentially change more than 20%. It is shown that by modulating ion energy at
specific amplitudes, thrust can be maximized in such regimes. Finally, an
expression for the thruster efficiency of the modulating thruster is derived to
show a mechanism for inefficiencies in such thrusters.

event space, and can be quantified using the R\'enyi family of indices (also
known as Hill numbers in ecology or Hannah-Kay indices in economics), which are
indexed by an elasticity parameter $q \geq 0$. Under these indices, the
heterogeneity of a composite system (the $\gamma$-heterogeneity) is
decomposable into heterogeneity arising from variation \textit{within} and
\textit{between} component subsystems (the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-heterogeneity,
respectively). Since the average heterogeneity of a component subsystem should
not be greater than that of the pooled system, we require that $\gamma \geq
\alpha$. There exists a multiplicative decomposition for R\'enyi heterogeneity
of composite systems with discrete event spaces, but less attention has been
paid to decomposition in the continuous setting. We therefore describe
multiplicative decomposition of the R\'enyi heterogeneity for continuous
mixture distributions under parametric and non-parametric pooling assumptions.
Under non-parametric pooling, the $\gamma$-heterogeneity must often be
estimated numerically, but the multiplicative decomposition holds such that
$\gamma \geq \alpha$ for $q > 0$. Conversely, under parametric pooling,
$\gamma$-heterogeneity can be computed efficiently in closed-form, but the
$\gamma \geq \alpha$ condition holds reliably only at $q=1$. Our findings will
further contribute to heterogeneity measurement in continuous systems.

$(\alpha,\beta)$-superprocess in $R^d$ with $\alpha\in (0,2)$ and $\beta<\frac

fixed $x$, $X_t(x)>0$ a.s. on $\{X_t\neq 0\}$ if and only if $\beta \leq
\beta^*(\alpha) = \frac{\alpha}{d+\alpha}$. We strengthen this and show that in
the continuous density regime, $\beta < \beta^*(\alpha)$ implies that the
density function is strictly positive a.s. on $\{X_t\neq 0\}$.
  We then give close to sharp conditions on a measure $\mu$ such that
$\mu(X_t):=\int X_t(x)\mu(dx)>0$ a.s. on $\{X_t\neq 0 \}$. Our characterization
is based on the size of $supp(\mu)$, in the sense of Hausdorff measure and
dimension. For $s \in [0,d]$, if $\beta \leq
\beta^*(\alpha,s)=\frac{\alpha}{d-s+\alpha}$ and $supp(\mu)$ has positive
$x^s$-Hausdorff measure, then $\mu(X_t)>0$ a.s. on $\{X_t\neq 0\}$; and when
$\beta > \beta^*(\alpha,s)$, if $\mu$ satisfies a uniform lower density
condition which implies $dim(supp(\mu)) < s$, then $P(\mu(X_t)=0|X_t\neq 0)>0$.
  We also give new result for the fractional PDE $\partial_t u(t,x) =
-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u(t,x)-u(t,x)^{1+\beta}$ with domain $(t,x)\in

$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.
  Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy
which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a
differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using
Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies
satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new

address the open questions concerning the nature and strength of electronic
interactions between exciton-polaritons and localized excited states in
chemical system as well as the proper way to measure such interactions. Here,
we use transient optical spectroscopy to investigate dynamical interactions
between exciton-polaritons, singlet excitons, and triplet excitons in a
molecular singlet fission system that is strongly coupled to an optical
microcavity. We identify some of the major limitations to modify molecular
dynamics in the strong coupling regime. Simultaneous excitation of cavity
polaritons and 'reservoir' states, defined as dark polaritons and dark excitons
(e.g. triplets) from coupled molecules and excitons from uncoupled molecules,
always occurs. In addition, slow conversion from reservoir states to cavity
polaritons results in minimal changes to the overall population dynamics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how in addition to the usual population dynamics,
transient optical measurements on microcavities reveal information pertaining
to modification of the exciton-polariton transition energies due to changes in
the population of molecular excited states and the exciton-photon coupling
conditions. As a consequence of weak interactions between reservoir states and
cavity polaritons, judicious design considerations are required to achieve
modified chemical dynamics, necessitating the use of molecular systems with
long excited-state lifetimes or strong coupling approaches that require a small

annual benchmarking evaluation MIREX for over 10 years, ACE is not yet a solved
problem, since performance has stagnated and modern systems have started to
tune themselves to subjective training data. We propose DECIBEL, a new ACE
system that exploits widely available MIDI and tab representations to improve
ACE from audio only. From an audio file and a set of MIDI and tab files
corresponding to the same popular music song, DECIBEL first estimates chord
sequences. For audio, state-of-the-art audio ACE methods are used. MIDI files
are aligned to the audio, followed by a MIDI chord estimation step. Tab files
are transformed into untimed chord sequences and then aligned to the audio.
Next, DECIBEL uses data fusion to integrate all estimated chord sequences into
one final output sequence. DECIBEL improves all tested state-of-the-art ACE

musical knowledge from heterogeneous symbolic music representations is a
suitable strategy for addressing challenging MIR tasks such as ACE.

arise, for example, in the spatial discretization of the gas flow in pipeline
networks. In practice, mathematical models of real-life processes pose
challenges when used in numerical simulations, due to complexity and system
size. Model-order reduction aims to eliminate this problem by generating
reduced-order models that have lower computational cost to simulate, yet
accurately represent the original large-scale system behavior. However, direct
reduction and simulation of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations is
difficult due to hidden constraints which affect the choice of numerical
integration methods and model-order reduction techniques. We propose an
extension of index-aware model-order reduction methods to nonlinear
differential-algebraic equations without any kind of linearization. The
proposed model-order reduction approach involves automatic decoupling of
nonlinear differential-algebraic equations into nonlinear ordinary differential
equations and algebraic equations. This allows applying standard model-order
reduction techniques to both parts without worrying about the index. The same
procedure can also be used to simulate nonlinear differential-algebraic

We calculate the total and the differential cross sections, and the quark

  Spectroscopy on Label-Free Proteins",,,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The poor photostability and low brightness of protein autofluorescence have
been major limitations preventing the detection of label-free proteins at the
single molecule level. Overcoming these issues, we report here a strategy to
promote the photostability of proteins and use their natural tryptophan
autofluorescence in the ultraviolet (UV) for fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS). Combining enzymatic oxygen scavengers with antioxidants and
triplet state quenchers greatly promotes the protein photostability, reduces
the photobleaching probability and improves the net autofluorescence detection
rate. Our results show that the underlying photochemical concepts initially
derived for organic visible fluorescent dyes are quite general. Using this
approach, we achieved UV fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on label-free
streptavidin proteins containing only 24 tryptophan residues, 6.5x less than
the current state-of-the-art. This strategy greatly extends the possibility to
detect single label-free proteins with the versatility of single molecule
fluorescence without requiring the presence of a potentially disturbing
external fluorescent marker. It also opens new perspectives to improve the UV
durability of organic devices.

Such a construction is not possible using only canonical slow-roll inflation,

exponential potential. The resulting cosmology is non-singular. We discuss the
spectrum of cosmological perturbations resulting in our scenario. On large
scales (scales which remain larger than the Hubble radius after the initial
string gas phase) the spectrum is determined by the thermal string gas
fluctuations set up in the primordial phase, and it is almost scale-invariant
with a slight red tilt. On small scales, the perturbations produced during the
inflationary phase dominate. On these scales, the spectrum is once again nearly
scale-invariant. There is an intermediate range (scales which enter the Hubble
radius during the period of inflation) where the string gas fluctuations are
damped but continue to dominate over those produced during the period of
inflation. On these scales the spectrum has a sharp red spectral index of $n_s

In this letter, we propose a novel method to detect adversarial inputs, by
augmenting the main classification network with multiple binary detectors

adversarial. During inference, the detectors are treated as a part of an
ensemble network and the input is deemed adversarial if at least half of the

between accuracy of classification on clean and adversarial samples, as the
original classification network is not modified during the detection process.
The use of multiple observer networks makes attacking the detection mechanism
non-trivial even when the attacker is aware of the victim classifier. We
achieve a 99.5% detection accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 97.5% on the

systems, such as air flows near the Earth's surface, water flows in rivers, and
flows around a car or a plane. The universal logarithmic velocity profile in
wall-bounded turbulent flows proposed by von K\'arm\'an in 1930 is one of the
few exact physical descriptions of turbulence. However, the mean velocity and
temperature profiles cannot be adequately described by this universal log law
when buoyancy effects are present. Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST),
proposed in 1954, has been the cornerstone theory to account for these buoyancy
effects and to describe the atmospheric boundary layer. MOST has been used in
almost all global weather, climate and hydrological models to describe the
dependence of the mean velocity, temperature and scalar profiles on buoyancy.
According to MOST, the logarithmic temperature profile breaks down as buoyancy
effects become important. In contrast, here we show that this long-standing
MOST theory does not apply for temperature. We propose a new theory for the
logarithmic profile of near-wall temperature, which corrects MOST pitfalls and
is supported by both high-resolution direct numerical simulations and field
observations of the convective atmospheric boundary layer. Buoyancy effects do
not modify the logarithmic nature but instead modulate the slope of the
temperature profile compared to the universal von K\'arm\'an slope. The new
formulation has widespread applications such as in climate models, where the
proposed new temperature log law should lead to more realistic continental
surface temperature, which are strongly impacted by buoyancy.

the recent uprising of quantum technologies, the debate on how to reconcile the
theory with the macroscopic classical world is still open. Spontaneous collapse
models are one of the few testable solutions so far proposed. In particular,
the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model has become subject of an
intense experimental research. Experiments looking for the universal force
noise predicted by CSL in ultrasensitive mechanical resonators have recently
set the strongest unambiguous bounds on CSL; further improving these
experiments by direct reduction of mechanical noise is technically challenging.
Here, we implement a recently proposed alternative strategy, that aims at
enhancing the CSL noise by exploiting a multilayer test mass attached on a high
quality factor microcantilever. The test mass is specifically designed to
enhance the effect of CSL noise at the characteristic length $r_c=10^{-7}$ m.
The measurements are in good agreement with pure thermal motion for
temperatures down to 100 mK. From the absence of excess noise we infer a new
bound on the collapse rate at the characteristic length $r_c=10^{-7}$ m, which
improves over previous mechanical experiments by more than one order of
magnitude. Our results are explicitly challenging a well-motivated region of
the CSL parameter space proposed by Adler.

work, PdSe2 is used in the form of multilayer as the channel of back-gate
field-effect transistors, which are studied under repeated electron
irradiations. Source-drain Pd leads enable contacts with resistance below 350
kOhm um. The transistors exhibit a prevailing n-type conduction in high vacuum,
which reversibly turns into ambipolar electric transport at atmospheric
pressure. Irradiation by 10 keV electrons suppresses the channel conductance
and promptly transforms the device from n-type to p-type. An electron fluence
as low as 160 e-/nm2 dramatically change the transistor behavior demonstrating
a high sensitivity of PdSe2 to electron irradiation. The sensitivity is lost
after few exposures, that is a saturation condition is reached for fluence
higher than 4000 e-/nm2. The damage induced by high electron fluence is
irreversible as the device persist in the radiation-modified state for several
hours, if kept in vacuum and at room temperature. With the support of numerical
simulation, we explain such a behavior by electron-induced Se atom vacancy
formation and charge trapping in slow trap states at the Si/SiO_2 interface.

that HarDNN can accurately estimate relative vulnerability of a feature map

However, the underlying mechanism has remained elusive and is generally
ascribed to their superior nonlinear optical properties such as nonlinear
absorption or nonlinear scattering. Using graphene as an example, we show that
photo-thermal microbubbles are responsible for the optical limiting as strong
light scattering centers: graphene sheets absorb incident light and become
heated up above the boiling point of water, resulting in vapor and microbubble
generation. This conclusion is based on direct observation of bubbles above the
laser beam as well as a strong correlation between laser-induced ultrasound and
optical limiting. In-situ Raman scattering of graphene further confirms that
the temperature of graphene under laser pulses rises above the boiling point of
water but still remains too low to vaporize graphene and create graphene plasma
bubbles. Photo-thermal bubble scattering is not a nonlinear optical process and
requires very low laser intensity. This understanding helps us to design more
efficient optical limiting materials and understand the intrinsic nonlinear

lifts has significant algorithmic implications, particularly for optimization
problems. We consider both the classical case of polyhedral lifts, described by
linear inequalities, as well as spectrahedral lifts, defined by linear matrix
inequalities, with a focus on recent developments related to spectrahedral
lifts.
  Given a convex set, ideally we would either like to find a (low-complexity)
polyhedral or spectrahedral lift, or find an obstruction proving that no such
lift is possible. To this end, we explain the connection between the existence
of lifts of a convex set and certain structured factorizations of its
associated slack operator. Based on this characterization, we describe a
uniform approach, via sums of squares, to the construction of spectrahedral
lifts of convex sets and illustrate the method on several families of examples.
Finally, we discuss two flavors of obstruction to the existence of lifts: one
related to facial structure, and the other related to algebraic properties of
the set in question.
  Rather than being exhaustive, our aim is to illustrate the richness of the
area. We touch on a range of different topics related to the existence of

the observation that adversarial images are sensitive to certain
label-invariant transformations. Specifically, to determine if an image has
been adversarially manipulated, the proposed detector checks if the output of
the target classifier on a given input image changes significantly after
feeding it a transformed version of the image under investigation. Moreover, we
show that the proposed detector is computationally-light both at runtime and
design-time which makes it suitable for real-time applications that may also
involve large-scale image domains. To highlight this, we demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed detector on ImageNet, a task that is computationally
challenging for the majority of relevant defenses, and on physically attacked
traffic signs that may be encountered in real-time autonomy applications.
Finally, we propose the first adversarial dataset, called AdvNet that includes
both clean and physical traffic sign images. Our extensive comparative
experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and AdvNet datasets show that
VisionGuard outperforms existing defenses in terms of scalability and detection
performance. We have also evaluated the proposed detector on field test data

rigidity arises from interlocking of pairs of particles, but the origins of
rigidity for non-interlocking particles remains unclear. We report on
experiments and numerical simulations of sheared columns of ""hexapods,""
particles consisting of three mutually orthogonal sphero-cylinders whose
centers coincide. We vary the length-to-diameter aspect ratio, $\alpha$, of the
sphero-cylinders and subject the packings to quasistatic direct shear. For
small $\alpha$, we observe a finite yield stress. For large $\alpha$, however,
the column becomes rigid when sheared, supporting stresses that increase
sharply with increasing strain. Analysis of X-ray micro-computed tomography
(Micro-CT) data collected during the shear reveals that the stiffening is
associated with a tilted, oblate cluster of hexapods near the nominal shear
plane in which particle deformation and average contact number both increase.
Simulation results show that the particles are collectively under tension along
one direction even though they do not interlock pairwise. These tensions comes
from contact forces carrying large torques, and they are perpendicular to the

Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) replace the incompressibility constraint by a
Poisson equation for the pressure and a suitable choice of boundary conditions.
This yields a time-evolution equation for the velocity field only, with the
pressure gradient acting as a nonlocal operator. Thus, numerical methods based
on PPE reformulations, in principle, have no limitations in achieving high
order. In this paper, it is studied to what extent high-order methods for the
NSE can be obtained from a specific PPE reformulation with electric boundary
conditions (EBC). To that end, implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-stepping is used
to decouple the pressure solve from the velocity update, while avoiding a
parabolic time-step restriction; and mixed finite elements are used in space,
to capture the structure imposed by the EBC. Via numerical examples, it is
demonstrated that the methodology can yield at least third order accuracy in
space and time.

  Microgrids",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of computing equilibria (steady-states) for
droop-controlled, islanded, AC microgrids that are both economic-optimal and
dynamically stable. This work is motivated by the observation that classical
optimal power flow (OPF) formulations used for economic optimization might
provide equilibria that are not reachable by low-level controllers (i.e.,
closed-loop unstable). This arises because OPF problems only enforce
steady-state conditions and do not capture the dynamics. We explain this
behavior by using a port-Hamiltonian microgrid representation. To overcome the
limitations of OPF, the port-Hamiltonian representation can be exploited to
derive a bilevel OPF formulation that seeks to optimize economics while
enforcing stability. Unfortunately, bilevel optimization with a nonconvex inner
problem is difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose an alternative
approach (that we call probing OPF), which identifies an economic-optimal and
stable equilibrium by probing a neighborhood of equilibria using random
perturbations. The probing OPF is advantageous in that it is formulated as a
standard nonlinear program, in that it is compatible with existing OPF
frameworks, and in that it is applicable to diverse microgrid models.
Experiments with the IEEE 118-bus system reveal that few probing points are
required to enforce stability.

focusing on content information to distinguish whether two papers are written
by the same author, the models focusing on relation information to represent
information as edges on the network and to quantify the similarity among
papers. However, the former requires adequate labeled samples and informative
negative samples, and are also ineffective in measuring the high-order
connections among papers, while the latter needs complicated feature
engineering or supervision to construct the network. We propose a novel
generative adversarial framework to grow the two categories of models together:
(i) the discriminative module distinguishes whether two papers are from the
same author, and (ii) the generative module selects possibly homogeneous papers
directly from the heterogeneous information network, which eliminates the
complicated feature engineering. In such a way, the discriminative module
guides the generative module to select homogeneous papers, and the generative
module generates high-quality negative samples to train the discriminative
module to make it aware of high-order connections among papers. Furthermore, a
self-training strategy for the discriminative module and a random walk based
generating algorithm are designed to make the training stable and efficient.
Extensive experiments on two real-world AND benchmarks demonstrate that our

risk-neutral approach, and it thus cannot capture rare, yet critical, events
with potentially large AoI. In order to capture the effect of these events, in
this paper, the notion of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is proposed as an
effective coherent risk measure that is suitable for minimization of AoI for
real-time IoT status updates. In the considered monitoring system, an IoT
device monitors a physical process and sends the status updates to a remote
receiver with an updating cost. The optimal status update process is designed
to jointly minimize the AoI at the receiver, the CVaR of the AoI at the
receiver, and the energy cost. This stochastic optimization problem is
formulated as an infinite horizon discounted risk-aware Markov decision process
(MDP), which is computationally intractable due to the time inconsistency of
the CVaR. By exploiting the special properties of coherent risk measures, the
risk-aware MDP is reduced to a standard MDP with an augmented state space, for
which we derive the optimal stationary policy using dynamic programming. In
particular, the optimal history-dependent policy of the risk-aware MDP is shown
to depend on the history only through the augmented system states and can be
readily constructed using the optimal stationary policy of the augmented MDP.
The proposed solution is shown to be computationally tractable and able to
minimize the AoI in real-time IoT monitoring systems in a risk-aware manner.

important and challenging task. Although many kinds of audio monitoring system
have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from several disadvantages
such as non-trivial feature selection, accuracy degradation because of
environmental noise or intensive local computation. In this paper, we propose a
deep learning based acoustic classification framework for Wireless Acoustic
Sensor Network (WASN). The proposed framework is based on cloud architecture
which relaxes the computational burden on the wireless sensor node. To improve
the recognition accuracy, we design a multi-view Convolution Neural Network
(CNN) to extract the short-, middle-, and long-term dependencies in parallel.
The evaluation on two real datasets shows that the proposed architecture can
achieve high accuracy and outperforms traditional classification systems
significantly when the environmental noise dominate the audio signal (low SNR).
Moreover, we implement and deploy the proposed system on a testbed and analyse
the system performance in real-world environments. Both simulation and
real-world evaluation demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed
acoustic classification system in distinguishing species of animals.

Hamiltonians with second order derivative terms. Examples of such Hamiltonians
arise from models of non-local electrostatics, membranes with non-zero bending
rigidities and field theories of the Brazovskii type that arise for polymer

boundary conditions can be imposed, leading to a richer phenomenology of
interaction phenomena. In addition zero modes can be generated that are not
present in standard first derivative models, and it is these zero modes which
give rise to long range Casimir forces. Two physically distinct cases are
considered: (i) unconfined fields, usually considered for finite size embedded
inclusions in an infinite fluctuating medium, here in a two plate geometry the
fluctuating field exists both inside and outside the plates, (ii) confined
fields, where the field is absent outside the slab confined between the two
plates. We show how these two physically distinct cases are mathematically
related and discuss a wide range of commonly applied boundary conditions. We
concentrate our analysis to the critical region where the underlying bulk
Hamiltonian has zero modes and show that very exotic Casimir forces can arise,
characterised by very long range effects and oscillatory behavior that can lead
to strong metastability in the system.

that of achieving predictable data transfers of multiple concurrent flows by

developing a control algorithm based on concepts from model predictive control

the proposed approach, we model the bottleneck link as a queue and derive a
model relating the pacing rate and the RTT. A MPC based control algorithm based

reduction that exists in current control algorithms when facing network

simulation and experimental analysis, we show that our algorithm achieves the
goals of a low standard deviation of RTT and pacing rate, even when the
bottleneck link is fully utilized. In the case of multiple flows, we can assign
different rates to each flow and as long as the sum of rates is less than
bottleneck rate, they can maintain their assigned pacing rate with low standard
deviation. This is achieved even when the flows have different RTTs.

``signature in counterparts'', a legal process that permits a contract between
two or more parties to be brought into force by having the parties
independently (possibly, remotely) sign different copies of the contract,
rather than placing their signatures on a common copy at a physical meeting. It
is argued that a satisfactory account of signature in counterparts benefits
from a logic with syntactic self-reference. The axioms used are supported by a
formal semantics, and a number of further properties of the logic are
investigated. In particular, it is shown that the logic implies that when a

nonzero nonunit element is the product of irreducibles, and it satisfies the
ACCP if every ascending chain of principal ideals eventually stabilizes. The
interplay between these two properties has been investigated since the 1970s.
An atomic domain (or monoid) satisfies the finite factorization property (FFP)
if every element has only finitely many factorizations, and it satisfies the
bounded factorization property (BFP) if for each element there is a common
bound for the number of atoms in each of its factorizations. These two
properties have been systematically studied since being introduced by Anderson,
Anderson, and Zafrullah in 1990. Noetherian domains satisfy the BFP, while
Dedekind domains satisfy the FFP. It is well known that for commutative
cancellative monoids (in particular, integral domains) FFP $\Rightarrow$ BFP
$\Rightarrow$ ACCP $\Rightarrow$ atomic. For $n \ge 2$, we show that each of
these four properties transfers back and forth between an information
semialgebras $S$ (i.e., a commutative cancellative semiring) and their
multiplicative monoids $T_n(S)^\bullet$ of $n \times n$ upper triangular
matrices over~$S$. We also show that a similar transfer behavior takes place if
one replaces $T_n(S)^\bullet$ by the submonoid $U_n(S)$ consisting of unit
triangular matrices. As a consequence, we find that the chain FFP $\Rightarrow$
BFP $\Rightarrow$ ACCP $\Rightarrow$ atomic also holds for the classes
comprising the noncommutative monoids $T_n(S)^\bullet$ and $U_n(S)$. Finally,
we construct various rational information semialgebras to verify that, in
general, none of the established implications is reversible.

dataset heterogeneity, where data quality varies across classes, on model
confidence. We demonstrate that this leads to heterogenous confidence/accuracy

technique and show that the proposed approach leads to improved calibration

obstacle is that access and use of such data is usually limited or not
permitted at all due to concerns about violating user privacy, and rightly so.
Anonymizing sequence data is not a simple task, since a user creates an almost
unique signature over time. Existing anonymization methods reduce the quality
of information in order to maintain the level of anonymity required. Damage to
quality may disrupt patterns that appear in the original data and impair the
preservation of various characteristics. Since in many cases the researcher

demonstrate that the data generation mechanism significantly limits the risk of

matrix factorization and neural networks. Meanwhile, we also present the
theoretical analysis of SetRank to show that the bound of excess risk can be
proportional to $\sqrt{M/N}$, where $M$ and $N$ are the numbers of items and

local gradients or parameters rather than raw data, the adversary still can
leverage local gradients and parameters to obtain local training data by
launching reconstruction and membership inference attacks. To defend such
privacy attacks, many noises perturbation methods (like differential privacy or
CountSketch matrix) have been widely designed. However, the strong defence
ability and high learning accuracy of these schemes cannot be ensured at the
same time, which will impede the wide application of FL in practice (especially
for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and
strong privacy guarantee). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose
\emph{an efficient model perturbation method for federated learning} to defend
reconstruction and membership inference attacks launched by curious clients. On
the one hand, similar to the differential privacy, our method also selects
random numbers as perturbed noises added to the global model parameters, and
thus it is very efficient and easy to be integrated in practice. Meanwhile, the
random selected noises are positive real numbers and the corresponding value
can be arbitrarily large, and thus the strong defence ability can be ensured.
On the other hand, unlike differential privacy or other perturbation methods
that cannot eliminate the added noises, our method allows the server to recover
the true gradients by eliminating the added noises. Therefore, our method does
not hinder learning accuracy at all.

is a graph kernel called the path-pattern graph kernel. The path-pattern graph
kernel first builds a truncated BFS tree rooted at each vertex and then uses
paths from the root to every vertex in the truncated BFS tree as features to
represent graphs. The path-pattern graph kernel can only capture graph
similarity at fine granularities. In order to capture graph similarity at
coarse granularities, we incorporate a new concept called super path into it.
The super path contains truncated BFS trees rooted at the vertices in a path.
Our evaluation on a variety of real-world graphs demonstrates that Tree++

to extend coverage and enhance throughput for traditional terrestrial wireless
communication systems. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled wireless sensor
network (WSN), where a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to collect data from a
group of sensor nodes (SNs). The objective is to maximize the minimum data
collection rate from all SNs via jointly optimizing their transmission
scheduling and power allocations as well as the trajectory of the UAV, subject
to the practical constraints on the maximum transmit power of the SNs and the
maximum speed of the UAV. The formulated optimization problem is challenging to
solve as it involves non-convex constraints and discrete-value variables. To
draw useful insight, we first consider the special case of the formulated
problem by ignoring the UAV speed constraint and optimally solve it based on
the Lagrange duality method. It is shown that for this relaxed problem, the UAV
should hover above a finite number of optimal locations with different
durations in general. Next, we address the general case of the formulated
problem where the UAV speed constraint is considered and propose a traveling
salesman problem (TSP)-based trajectory initialization, where the UAV
sequentially visits the locations obtained in the relaxed problem with minimum
flying time. Given this initial trajectory, we then find the corresponding
transmission scheduling and power allocations of the SNs and further optimize
the UAV trajectory by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) and
successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Finally, numerical results
are provided to illustrate the spectrum and energy efficiency gains of the
proposed scheme for multi-antenna UAV data harvesting, as compared to benchmark
schemes.

the first VAE. The minor variance creates a mismatch between the actual
distribution of latent variables and those generated by the second VAE, that
hinders the beneficial effects of the second stage. Renormalizing the output of
the second VAE towards the expected normal spherical distribution, we obtain a
sudden burst in the quality of generated samples, as also testified in terms of
FID.

pair a so-called Eckardt cubic threefold, admitting an involution, and the
period map sends the pair to the anti-invariant part of the intermediate
Jacobian of this cubic threefold, with respect to this involution. Our main
result is that the global Torelli theorem holds for this period map; i.e., the
period map is injective. To prove the result, we describe the anti-invariant
part of the intermediate Jacobian as a Prym variety of a branched cover. Our
proof uses results of Naranjo-Ortega, Bardelli-Ciliberto-Verra, and
Nagaraj-Ramanan, on related Prym maps. In fact, we are able to recover the
degree of one of these Prym maps by describing positive dimensional fibers, in
the same spirit as a result of Donagi-Smith on the degree of the Prym map for
connected \'etale double covers of genus 6 curves.

in the process of statistical inference based on Bayesian methods. However,
specifying suitable priors is often difficult even when detailed prior

addresses this question by extracting subjective information from an expert and
transforming it into a valid prior. Most existing methods, however, require
information to be provided on the unobservable parameters, whose effect on the

an alternative approach that only requires knowledge about the observable
outcomes - knowledge which is often much easier for experts to provide.
Building upon a principled statistical framework, our approach utilizes the
prior predictive distribution implied by the model to automatically transform
experts judgements about plausible outcome values to suitable priors on the

control, in which an agent has to reach a goal state in minimum total expected
cost. In the learning formulation of the problem, the agent is unaware of the
environment dynamics (i.e., the transition function) and has to repeatedly play
for a given number of episodes while reasoning about the problem's optimal
solution. Unlike other well-studied models in reinforcement learning (RL), the
length of an episode is not predetermined (or bounded) and is influenced by the
agent's actions. Recently, Tarbouriech et al. (2019) studied this problem in
the context of regret minimization and provided an algorithm whose regret bound
is inversely proportional to the square root of the minimum instantaneous cost.
In this work we remove this dependence on the minimum cost---we give an
algorithm that guarantees a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(B_\star |S|
\sqrt{|A| K})$, where $B_\star$ is an upper bound on the expected cost of the
optimal policy, $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set of actions and $K$ is
the number of episodes. We additionally show that any learning algorithm must
have at least $\Omega(B_\star \sqrt{|S| |A| K})$ regret in the worst case.

novel drag systems consisting of a two-dimensional graphene and a one
dimensional (1D) InAs nanowire (NW) heterostructure exhibiting distinct results
from 2D-2D heterostructures. For monolayer graphene (MLG)-NW heterostructures,
we observe an unconventional drag resistance peak near the Dirac point due to
the correlated inter-layer charge puddles. The drag signal decreases
monotonically with temperature ($\sim T^{-2}$) and with the carrier density of
NW ($\sim n_{N}^{-4}$), but increases rapidly with magnetic field ($\sim
B^{2}$). These anomalous responses, together with the mismatched thermal
conductivities of graphene and NWs, establish the energy drag as the
responsible mechanism of Coulomb drag in MLG-NW devices. In contrast, for
bilayer graphene (BLG)-NW devices the drag resistance reverses sign across the
Dirac point and the magnitude of the drag signal decreases with the carrier
density of the NW ($\sim n_{N}^{-1.5}$), consistent with the momentum drag but
remains almost constant with magnetic field and temperature. This deviation
from the expected $T^2$ arises due to the shift of the drag maximum on graphene
carrier density. We also show that the Onsager reciprocity relation is observed
for the BLG-NW devices but not for the MLG-NW devices. These Coulomb drag
measurements in dimensionally mismatched (2D-1D) systems, hitherto not

be a powerful formalism for expressing and reasoning about information-flow
security policies and important properties of cyber-physical systems such as
sensitivity and robustness, as well as consistency conditions in distributed
computing such as linearizability. Although there is an extensive body of work
on automata-based representation of trace properties, we currently lack such
characterization for hyperproperties. We introduce hyperautomata for em
hyperlanguages, which are languages over sets of words. Essentially,
hyperautomata allow running multiple quantified words over an automaton. We
propose a specific type of hyperautomata called nondeterministic finite
hyperautomata (NFH), which accept regular hyperlanguages. We demonstrate the
ability of regular hyperlanguages to express hyperproperties for finite traces.
We then explore the fundamental properties of NFH and show their closure under
the Boolean operations. We show that while nonemptiness is undecidable in
general, it is decidable for several fragments of NFH. We further show the
decidability of the membership problem for finite sets and regular languages
for NFH, as well as the containment problem for several fragments of NFH.
Finally, we introduce learning algorithms based on Angluin's L-star algorithm

highly speculative cryptocurrencies more robustly compared to other heavy
tailed distributions that are used in financial econometrics. We find that the
Maximum Likelihood Method proposed by DuMouchel (1971) produces estimates that
fit the cryptocurrency return data much better than the quantile based approach
of McCulloch (1986) and sample characteristic method by Koutrouvelis (1980).
The empirical results show that the leptokurtic feature presented in
cryptocurrencies' return data can be captured by an ${\alpha}$-stable
distribution. This papers covers predominant literature in cryptocurrencies and
stable distributions.

sophisticated games, such as Atari, Go, etc. However, real-world decision
making often requires reasoning with partial information extracted from complex
visual observations. This paper presents Discriminative Particle Filter
Reinforcement Learning (DPFRL), a new reinforcement learning framework for
complex partial observations. DPFRL encodes a differentiable particle filter in
the neural network policy for explicit reasoning with partial observations over
time. The particle filter maintains a belief using learned discriminative
update, which is trained end-to-end for decision making. We show that using the
discriminative update instead of standard generative models results in
significantly improved performance, especially for tasks with complex visual
observations, because they circumvent the difficulty of modeling complex
observations that are irrelevant to decision making. In addition, to extract
features from the particle belief, we propose a new type of belief feature
based on the moment generating function. DPFRL outperforms state-of-the-art
POMDP RL models in Flickering Atari Games, an existing POMDP RL benchmark, and
in Natural Flickering Atari Games, a new, more challenging POMDP RL benchmark

some bounded delay in the decoding process. Known algorithms for constructing

  This paper describes how to reduce the time for filling in the DP tables by
two orders of magnitude, down to $O(n^3)$. It does this by introducing a
grouping technique that permits separating the $\Theta(n^3)$-space tables into
$\Theta(n)$ groups, each of size $O(n^2)$, and then using Two-Dimensional

determined by localizing Stochastic Non-Negative Associated Gradient Projection
Points (SNN-GPPs) along descent directions. These are identified by a sign
change in the directional derivative from negative to positive along a descent
direction. Activation functions are a significant component of neural network
architectures as they introduce non-linearities essential for complex function
approximations. The smoothness and continuity characteristics of the activation
functions directly affect the gradient characteristics of the loss function to
be optimized. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the relationship
between activation functions and different neural network architectures in the
context of GOLS. We find that GOLS are robust for a range of activation
functions, but sensitive to the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation
function in standard feedforward architectures. The zero-derivative in ReLU's
negative input domain can lead to the gradient-vector becoming sparse, which
severely affects training. We show that implementing architectural features

designing numerical schemes with energy dissipation and mass conservation

requirement of small effective step sizes. In this paper, we discretize the
energy functional and propose efficient numerical algorithms for solving the
constrained non-convex minimization problem. A class of gradient based
approaches, which is the so-called adaptive accelerated Bregman proximal
gradient (AA-BPG) methods, is proposed and the convergence property is
established without the global Lipschitz constant requirements. A practical
Newton method is also designed to further accelerate the local convergence with
convergence guarantee. One key feature of our algorithms is that the energy
dissipation and mass conservation properties hold during the iteration process.
Moreover, we develop a hybrid acceleration framework to accelerate the AA-BPG
methods and most of existing approaches through coupling with the practical
Newton method. Extensive numerical experiments, including two three dimensional
periodic crystals in Landau-Brazovskii (LB) model and a two dimensional
quasicrystal in Lifshitz-Petrich (LP) model, demonstrate that our approaches
have adaptive step sizes which lead to a significant acceleration over many

a Z boson and a photon in association with two jets (Z$\gamma$jj) in
proton-proton collisions. The Z boson candidates are selected through their
decay into a pair of electrons or muons. The process of interest, electroweak
Z$\gamma$jj production, is isolated by selecting events with a large dijet mass
and a large pseudorapidity gap between the two jets. The measurement is based
on data collected at the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The observed significance of the
signal is 3.9 standard deviations, where a significance of 5.2 standard
deviations is expected in the standard model. These results are combined with
published results by CMS at $\sqrt{s} =$ 8 TeV, which leads to observed and
expected respective significances of 4.7 and 5.5 standard deviations. From the
13 TeV data, a value is obtained for the signal strength of electroweak
Z$\gamma$jj production and bounds are given on quartic vector boson

phenomenology of the superconducting cuprates in terms of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) shift and relaxation. Different from the old interpretation, it
was shown that the shifts demand two coupled spin components with different
temperature dependencies. One spin component couples isotropically to the
planar Cu nucleus and is likely to reside at planar O, while the other,
anisotropic component has its origin in the planar copper $3d(x^2-y^2)$
orbital. Nuclear relaxation, on the other hand, was found to be rather
ubiquitous and Fermi liquid-like for planar Cu, i.e., it is independent of
doping and material, apart from the sudden drop at the superconducting
transition temperature, $T_{\rm c}$. However, there is a doping and material
dependent anisotropy that is independent on temperature, above and below
$T_{\rm c}$. Here we present a slightly different analysis of the shifts that
fits all planar Cu shift data. In addition we are able to derive a simple model
that explains nuclear relaxation based on these two spin components. In
particular, the only outlier so far, \lsco, can be understood, as well. While
this concerns predominantly planar Cu, it is argued that the two component
model should fit all cuprate shift and relaxation data.

the measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through power

information, however, is more challenging than it is from the power spectrum
due to the complex models and the computational cost to measure the signal and
its covariance. To overcome these problems, we adopt a proxy statistic, skew
spectrum which is a cross-spectrum of the density field and its quadratic
field. By applying a large smoothing filter to the density field, we show the
theory fits the simulations very well. With the spectra and their full
covariance estimated from $N$-body simulations as our ""mock"" Universe, we
perform a global fits for the cosmological parameters. The results show that
adding skew spectrum to power spectrum the $1\sigma$ marginalized errors for

amorphous carbons as well as the nature and type of their amorphicity. The
latter was attributed to the amorphization of a new type named as enforced
fragmentation. The fragments are stable graphenous molecules, which are the
basic structural units (BSUs) of the solids, determining them as amorphics with
molecular structure. Due to weak intermolecular interaction, BSUs, once
aggregated, are the main defendants for IR absorption and Raman scattering of
the solids, just justifying the consideration of them at molecular level. The
standard G-D-2D pattern of Raman spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
$^2$ amorphous carbons, graphene and/or graphite crystal is attributed to
extended honeycomb composition of carbon atoms and are suggested as
manifestation of molecule-crystal dualism of graphenous materials. The
molecular approximation, applied to the analysis of one-phonon spectra of the
studied $^2$ ACs, makes it possible to trace a direct connection of the G-D
spectra image as well as their broadband structure with a considerable
dispersion of the C=C bond lengths within BSUs honeycomb structure, caused by
the influence of chemical action, deformation, etc. This approximation, applied
to the interpretation of two-phonon spectrum of graphenous molecules for the
first time, reveals a particular role of electrical anharmonicity in the
spectra formation and attributes this effect to a high degree of the electron
density delocalization. A size-stimulated transition from molecular to
quasi-particle phonon consideration of Raman spectra was experimentally traced,
which allowed evaluation of a free path of optical phonons in graphene crystal.

reduce the size of the formulation to be solved, allowing both an increase in

reduction on the average time to solve them. Moreover, the described

distortion, such as LaMnO$_3$ (LMO), the orbital order can also couple to the
defect chemistry and induce novel material properties. At low temperatures, LMO
exhibits a strong Jahn-Teller distortion that splits the $e_g$ orbitals of the
high-spin Mn$^{3+}$ ions and leads to alternating long, short, and intermediate
Mn--O bonds. Our DFT+$U$ calculations show that, as a result of this orbital
order, the charge localization in LMO upon oxygen vacancy formation differs
from other manganites, like SrMnO$_3$, where the two extra electrons reduce the
two Mn sites adjacent to the vacancy. In LMO, relaxations around the defect
depend on which type of Mn--O bond is broken, affecting the $d$-orbital
energies and leading to asymmetric and hence polar excess-electron localization
with respect to the vacancy. Moreover, we show that the Mn--O bond lengths,
orbital order and consequently the charge localization and polarity are tunable

Studying how to steer the dynamics of such systems towards a desired evolution

propose a pinning protocol for imposing specific dynamic evolutions compatible

any restrictions on the local dynamics, which may vary from node to node, nor
on the interactions between nodes, which may adopt in principle any nonlinear

oscillators, which allows us to unveil a correlation between the ordered
sequence of pinned nodes and their topological influence in the network. We
then consider a 12-species trophic web network, which is a model of a mammalian
food web. By pinning a relatively small number of species, one can make the
system abandon its spontaneous evolution from its (typically uncontrolled)
initial state towards a target dynamics, or periodically control it so as to
make the populations evolve within stipulated bounds. The relevance of these

simple group, and has first been constructed in 1982 by Griess. In 1985, Conway
has constructed a 196884-dimensional representation $\rho$ of $\mathbb{M}$ with
matrix coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$. So these matrices may be
reduced modulo any (not necessarily prime) odd number $p$, leading to
representations of $\mathbb{M}$ in odd characteristic. The representation
$\rho$ is based on representations of two maximal subgroups $G_{x0}$ and $N_0$
of $\mathbb{M}$. In ATLAS notation, $G_{x0}$ has structure
$2_+^{1+24}.\mbox{Co}_1$ and $N_0$ has structure $2^{2+11+22}.( M_{24} \times
S_3)$. Conway has constructed an explicit set of generators of $N_0$, but not
of $G_{x0}$.
  This paper is essentially a rewrite of Conway's construction augmented by an
explicit construction of an element of $G_{x0} \setminus N_0$. This gives us a
complete set of generators of $\mathbb{M}$. It turns out that the matrices of
all generators of $\mathbb{M}$ consist of monomial blocks, and of blocks which
are essentially Hadamard matrices scaled by a negative power of two.
Multiplication with such a generator can be programmed very efficiently if the
modulus $p$ is of shape $2^k-1$.
  So this paper may be considered a as programmer's reference for Conway's
construction of the monster group $\mathbb{M}$. We have implemented
representations of $\mathbb{M}$ modulo 3, 7, 15, 31, 127, and 255.

trainable parameters significantly enhance the performance of these deep

end, dropout based methods disable some elements in the output feature maps

the generalization ability of the resulting models can be enhanced by these

Therefore, we investigate the empirical Rademacher complexity related to

effective detection depression is a great public-health challenge. This
Electroencephalography (EEG)-based research is to explore the effective
biomarkers for depression recognition. Methods: Resting state EEG data was
collected from 24 major depressive patients (MDD) and 29 normal controls using
128 channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN). To better identify
depression, we extracted different types of EEG features including linear
features, nonlinear features and functional connectivity features phase lagging
index (PLI) to comprehensively analyze the EEG signals in patients with MDD.
And using different feature selection methods and classifiers to evaluate the
optimal feature sets. Results: Functional connectivity feature PLI is superior
to the linear features and nonlinear features. And when combining all the types
of features to classify MDD patients, we can obtain the highest classification
accuracy 82.31% using ReliefF feature selection method and logistic regression
(LR) classifier. Analyzing the distribution of optimal feature set, it was
found that intrahemispheric connection edges of PLI were much more than the
interhemispheric connection edges, and the intrahemispheric connection edges
had a significant differences between two groups. Conclusion: Functional
connectivity feature PLI plays an important role in depression recognition.
Especially, intrahemispheric connection edges of PLI might be an effective
biomarker to identify depression. And statistic results suggested that MDD

x, and is used to guide the change by imposing spatial constraints on objects
of the ""followed"" spatial scene, eventually at different time points of the
input trees. In order to capture the expressiveness of most modal temporal
logics encountered in the literature, we introduce weakly cyclic Terminological
Boxes (TBoxes) of MTALC(Dx), whose axioms capture the decreasing property of
modal temporal operators. We show the important result that satisfiability of
an MTALC(Dx) concept with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox can be reduced to the
emptiness problem of a Buchi weak alternating automaton augmented with spatial
constraints. In another work, complementary to this one, also submitted to this
conference, we thoroughly investigate Buchi automata augmented with spatial
constraints, and provide, in particular, a translation of an alternating into a
nondeterministic, and an effective decision procedure for the emptiness problem
of the latter.

multiple modules, namely voice activity detection (VAD), segmentation, speaker
embedding extraction, similarity scoring, clustering, resegmentation and
overlap detection. For each module, we explore different techniques to enhance
performance. Our final submission employs the ResNet-LSTM based VAD, the Deep
ResNet based speaker embedding, the LSTM based similarity scoring and spectral
clustering. Variational Bayes (VB) diarization is applied in the resegmentation
stage and overlap detection also brings slight improvement. Our proposed system
achieves 18.84% DER in Track1 and 27.90% DER in Track2. Although our systems
have reduced the DERs by 27.5% and 31.7% relatively against the official
baselines, we believe that the diarization task is still very difficult.

Up and Go (TUG) test is a common tool for fall risk assessment. In this paper,
we propose a method for predicting TUG score from gait characteristics
extracted from video with computer vision and machine learning technologies.
First, 3D pose is estimated from video captured with 2D and 3D cameras during
human motion and then a group of gait characteristics are computed from 3D pose
series. After that, copula entropy is used to select those characteristics
which are mostly associated with TUG score. Finally, the selected
characteristics are fed into the predictive models to predict TUG score.
Experiments on real world data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
method. As a byproduct, the associations between TUG score and several gait
characteristics are discovered, which laid the scientific foundation of the
proposed method and make the predictive models such built interpretable to
clinical users.

using Machine Learning. Support Vector Regression and Kernel Ridge Regression
techniques were independently employed to estimate the kinetic energy
functional and its derivative. Even though the accuracy should have been a
decisive factor in modeling a realistic functional, we show that at a certain
level it affects the generalizability of the model. By choosing the right
regularization term and by considering a reasonable interplay between it and
the accuracy, we were able to deduce the functional derivative from a model
that was trained to estimate the kinetic energy. Although the derivative
calculations demand very high accuracy to account for small variations of the
kinetic energy, the developed estimator was capable of capturing these
extremely small changes of the electron density. This work pours into highly
effective implementation of the orbital-free density functional theory as it
employs only direct calculation scheme

footprint, very high versatility, large numbers of wavelengths, and wide
Nyquist bands. Here, we review recent progress on Kerr microcomb-based photonic
RF and microwave reconfigurable filters, based both on transversal filter
methods and on RF to optical bandwidth scaling. We compare and contrast results
achieved with wide comb spacing combs (200GHz) with more finely spaced (49GHz)
microcombs. The strong potential of optical micro-combs for RF photonics
applications in terms of functions and integrability is also discussed.

trained to parse information when the conversation is synchronous and short;
however, for email-based conversational agents, the communication is
asynchronous, and often contains information irrelevant to the assistant. This
makes it harder for the system to accurately detect intents, extract entities
relevant to those intents and thereby perform the desired action. We present a
neural model for scoping relevant information for the agent from a large query.
We show that when used as a preprocessing step, the model improves performance
of both intent detection and entity extraction tasks. We demonstrate the
model's impact on Scheduler (Cortana is the persona of the agent, while
Scheduler is the name of the service. We use them interchangeably in the
context of this paper.) - a virtual conversational meeting scheduling assistant
that interacts asynchronously with users through email. The model helps the
entity extraction and intent detection tasks requisite by Scheduler achieve an
average gain of 35% in precision without any drop in recall. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the same approach can be used for component level analysis in
large documents, such as signature block identification.

technique comparing it with other inter-pulse schemes for weather radar

cross-polarization isolation. Here, a new inter-pulse scheme is discussed
taking advantage of frequency diverse waveforms. The simulations and tests of
performance are evaluated keeping in mind NASA dual-frequency,
dual-polarization, Doppler radar (D3R). A new method is described to recover
velocity and spectral width due to incoherence in samples from change of
frequency pulse to pulse. This technique can recover the weather radar moments
over a much higher dynamic range of the other trip contamination as compared
with the popular systematic phase code, for second trip suppression and
retrieval.
