quantum systems representing the long-time evolution of a system $S$
interacting with another system $S'$ and susceptible of being absorbed by $S'$.
The effective dynamics of $S$ is generated by an operator of the form $H = H_0
+ V - \mathrm{i} C^* C$ on the Hilbert space of the pure states of $S$, where
$H_0$ is the self-adjoint generator of the free dynamics of $S$, $V$ is
symmetric and $C$ is bounded. The main example is a neutron interacting with a
nucleus in the nuclear optical model. We recall the basic objects of the
scattering theory for the pair $(H,H_0)$, as well as the results, proven in
arXiv:1703.09018 and arXiv:1808.09179, on the spectral singularities of $H$ and
the asymptotic completeness of the wave operators. Next, for the nuclear
optical model, we show that asymptotic completeness generically holds.

height variations, the stellar surface becomes distorted, with helium-rich
regions dented inwards. Effectively, on top of flux variations due to opacity
effects, the depressed helium-rich surface regions become less bright in the
optical regions and brighter in the ultraviolet. We study the observational
effects of the aspherical surface on the light curves of a Cen. We simulate the
light curves of this star adopting surface distributions of He, N, O, Si, and
Fe derived from Doppler mapping and introducing the effect of distortion
proportional to helium abundance. We show that while most of the optical and UV
variations of this star result from flux redistribution due to the non-uniform
surface distributions of helium and iron, the reduction of light variations due
to the helium-related surface distortion leads to a better agreement between
simulated optical light curves and the light curves observed with the BRITE

Incompressibility is imposed by solving a Poisson equation for the pressure.
Being Fourier-based, the method allows for fast computation of spectral
transforms. It is compatible with uniform grids (although refined or nested
meshes can also be implemented), which in turn allows for explicit time
integration at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. Using a new parallel code
named SPECTER we illustrate the method with two problems: channel flow, and

polymer-based VOC sensor based on the self-leveling of mechanically leveraged
structures. The device utilizes folded polymer-coated microcantilevers to
achieve passive temperature compensation without the need for additional
compensating sensors or electronics. We demonstrate that a self-leveling vapor
sensor provides the same gas response as a simple microcantilever geometry,
showing ~20% change in device capacitance when subjected to 35-85 %RH change
while showing nearly-zero baseline drift due to changes in ambient temperature
when the temperature is increased from 23-72{\deg}C which is ~52-fold better
than a simple microcantilever geometry. The response of the VOC sensor was
measured using three polymers (Polyimide, Polyurethane, and PDMS) against five
different analytes (Ethanol, Acetone, Benzene, Hexane, and Water) and an
SVM-based model was used to show target specificity. The sensor also showed an
absorption response time ({\tau}90) of ~138s. We propose that the self-leveling
vapor sensor geometry is a significant improvement to a simple microcantilever
vapor sensor as it offers the same performance but shows near-complete
elimination of temperature-induced baseline drift.

However, the power consumption of the developed hardware can greatly depend on

linear Koopman operator model as states and estimating their values online via
an observer within the control loop. Using this approach, real-time, fully
autonomous control of a pneumatically actuated soft continuum manipulator is
achieved. In several trajectory following experiments, this controller is shown
to be more accurate and precise than controllers based on models that are

formulation that conserves energy, momentum and angular momentum when the
divergence constraint is only weakly enforced. Since its introduction, the EMAC
formulation has been successfully used for a wide variety of fluid dynamics
problems. We prove that discretizations using the EMAC formulation are
potentially better than those built on the commonly used skew-symmetric
formulation, by deriving a better longer time error estimate for EMAC: while
the classical results for schemes using the skew-symmetric formulation have
Gronwall constants dependent on $\exp(C\cdot Re\cdot T)$ with $Re$ the Reynolds
number, it turns out that the EMAC error estimate is free from this explicit
exponential dependence on the Reynolds number. Additionally, it is demonstrated
how EMAC admits smaller lower bounds on its velocity error, since {incorrect
treatment of linear momentum, angular momentum and energy induces} lower bounds
for $L^2$ velocity error, and EMAC treats these quantities more accurately.
Results of numerical tests for channel flow past a cylinder and 2D
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are also given, both of which show that the
advantages of EMAC over the skew-symmetric formulation increase as the Reynolds
number gets larger and for longer simulation times.

classical linear oscillators, supporting subradiant and superradiant collective
excitation eigenmodes. We identify the limits of validity of this \emph{linear
classical oscillator model} at increasing intensities of the drive by solving
the quantum many-body master equation for coherent and incoherent scattering
from a chain of trapped atoms. We show that deviations from the linear
classical oscillator model depend sensitively on the resonance linewidths
$\upsilon_\alpha$ of the collective eigenmodes excited by light, with the
intensity at which substantial deviation occurs scaling as a powerlaw of
$\upsilon_\alpha$. The linear classical oscillator model then becomes
inaccurate at much lower intensities for subradiant collective excitations than
superradiant ones, with an example system of seven atoms resulting in critical
incident light intensities differing by a factor of 30 between the two cases.
By individually exciting eigenmodes we find that this critical intensity has a
$\upsilon_\alpha^{2.5}$ scaling for narrower resonances and more strongly
interacting systems, while it approaches a $\upsilon_\alpha^3$ scaling for
broader resonances and when the dipole-dipole interactions are reduced. The
$\upsilon_\alpha^3$ scaling also corresponds to the semiclassical result
whereby quantum fluctuations between the atoms have been neglected. We study
both the case of perfectly mode-matched drives and the case of standing wave
drives, with significant differences between the two cases appearing only at
very subradiant modes and positions of Fano resonances.

formation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), spanning a
range of Mach numbers found in observed GMCs. As in past works, the mean and
median stellar masses are sensitive to numerical resolution, because they are
sensitive to low-mass stars that contribute a vanishing fraction of the overall
stellar mass. The {\em mass-weighted} median stellar mass $M_\mathrm{50}$
becomes insensitive to resolution once turbulent fragmentation is
well-resolved. Without imposing Larson-like scaling laws, our simulations find
$M_\mathrm{50} \propto M_\mathrm{0} \mathcal{M}^{-3} \alpha_\mathrm{turb}

$\mathcal{M}$, virial parameter $\alpha_\mathrm{turb}$, and star formation

with previous IMF results from the RAMSES, ORION2, and SphNG codes. Although
$M_\mathrm{50}$ has no significant dependence on the magnetic field strength at
the cloud scale, MHD is necessary to prevent a fragmentation cascade that
results in non-convergent stellar masses. For initial conditions and SFE
similar to star-forming GMCs in our Galaxy, we predict $M_\mathrm{50}$ to be
$>20 M_{\odot}$, an order of magnitude larger than observed ($\sim 2 M_\odot$),
together with an excess of brown dwarfs. Moreover, $M_\mathrm{50}$ is sensitive
to initial cloud properties and evolves strongly in time within a given cloud,
predicting much larger IMF variations than are observationally allowed. We
conclude that physics beyond MHD turbulence and gravity are necessary
ingredients for the IMF.

task-driven control policies for robotic systems equipped with rich sensory
modalities (e.g., vision or depth). Standard reinforcement learning algorithms
typically produce policies that tightly couple control actions to the entirety
of the system's state and rich sensor observations. As a consequence, the
resulting policies can often be sensitive to changes in task-irrelevant
portions of the state or observations (e.g., changing background colors). In
contrast, the approach we present here learns to create a task-driven
representation that is used to compute control actions. Formally, this is
achieved by deriving a policy gradient-style algorithm that creates an
information bottleneck between the states and the task-driven representation;
this constrains actions to only depend on task-relevant information. We
demonstrate our approach in a thorough set of simulation results on multiple
examples including a grasping task that utilizes depth images and a
ball-catching task that utilizes RGB images. Comparisons with a standard policy
gradient approach demonstrate that the task-driven policies produced by our
algorithm are often significantly more robust to sensor noise and
task-irrelevant changes in the environment.

of the inverse of the contamination rate. Second, it is equivariant by
translations, uniform scaling and orthogonal transformations. Third, it has a

adversarially chosen outliers. Fifth, it is asymptotically efficient when the
rate of contamination tends to zero. The estimator is obtained by an iterative
reweighting approach. Each sample point is assigned a weight that is
iteratively updated by solving a convex optimization problem. We also establish
a dimension-free non-asymptotic risk bound for the expected error of the

through a sharp microscopic interface or through an intermediate macroscopic
layer of inhomogeneous mixed phases, which is globally neutral but locally
contains electrically charged domains. Here I employ a nucleon-meson model
under neutron star conditions that shows a first-order chiral phase transition
at large densities. In the vicinity of this chiral transition I calculate the
free energies of various mixed phases - different 'pasta structures' - in the
Wigner-Seitz approximation. Crucially, chirally broken nuclear matter and the
approximately chirally symmetric phase (loosely interpreted as quark matter)
are treated on the same footing. This allows me to compute the interface
profiles of bubbles, rods, and slabs fully consistently, taking into account
electromagnetic screening effects and without needing the surface tension as an

electronic confinement and flat bands can naturally arise from the destructive
interference of electronic hopping pathways. Such lattice-borne flat bands are
often endowed with nontrivial topology if combined with spin-orbit coupling,
while their experimental realization in condensed matter system has been
elusive so far. Here, we report the direct observation of topological flat
bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level in frustrated kagome system CoSn,
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and band structure
calculations. The flat band manifests itself as a dispersionless electronic
excitation along the G-M high symmetry direction, with an order of magnitude
lower bandwidth (below 150 meV) compared to the Dirac bands originating from
the same orbitals. The frustration-driven nature of the flat band is directly
confirmed by the real-space chiral d-orbital texture of the corresponding
effective Wannier wave functions. Spin-orbit coupling opens a large gap of 80
meV at the quadratic band touching point between the Dirac and flat bands,
endowing a nonzero Z2 topological invariant to the flat band in the
two-dimensional Brillouin zone. Our observation of lattice-driven topological
flat band opens a promising route to engineer novel emergent phases of matter
at the crossroad between strong correlation physics and electronic topology.

'measurement'--i.e., the inability to account for the observation of
determinate measurement outcomes from within the theory itself. This paper
discusses a basic inconsistency arising in the FR scenario at a much earlier
point than the derived contradiction: namely, the inconsistency inherent in
treating an improper mixture (reduced density operator) as a proper, epistemic
mixture. This is an illegitimate procedure that is nevertheless endemic if
quantum theory is assumed to be always unitary. In contrast, under a
non-unitary account of quantum state reduction yielding determinate outcomes,
the use of a proper mixture for measurement results becomes legitimate, and
this entire class of paradoxes cannot be mounted. The conclusion is that the
real lesson of the FR paradox is that it is the unitary-only assumption that
needs to be critically reassessed.

non-bonding effect, and large interest has centered on understanding the
derived effect of lone pair expression on physical properties such as the
thermal conductivity. To manipulate such properties, it is essential to
understand the conditions that lead to lone pair expression and to provide a
quantitative chemical description. Here we first use density functional theory
calculations to establish the presence of stereo-chemically active lone pairs
on antimony in $\text{MnSb}_{2}\text{O}_{4}$. The lone pairs are formed through
a similar mechanism to those in binary post-transition metal compounds in an
oxidation state of two less than their main group number, where the degree of
orbital interaction determines the expression of the lone pair. In
$\text{MnSb}_{2}\text{O}_{4}$ the Sb lone pairs interact through a void space
in the crystal structure, and they minimize their mutual repulsion by
introducing a deflection angle. This angle increases significantly with
decreasing Sb-Sb distance, thus showing the highly destabilizing nature of the
lone pair interactions. Analysis of the chemical bonding in the structure shows
that it is dominated by polar covalent interactions. A database search of
related ternary chalcogenide structures shows that for structures with a lone
pair the degree of lone pair expression is largely determined by whether the
antimony-chalcogen units are connected or not, suggesting a cooperative effect.
Isolated $\text{SbX}_3$ units have larger X-Sb-X bond angles, and therefore
weaker lone pair expression than connected units. Since increased lone pair
expression is equivalent to an increased orbital interaction (covalent
bonding), which typically leads to increased heat conduction, this can explain
the previously established correlation between larger bond angles and lower
thermal conductivity.

change in magnitude and direction as we invert the baths at the boundaries: its

velocity spherical projectiles into a fine granular medium, sand. We delineate
velocity and impact angles giving ricochets, those giving projectiles that
roll-out from the impact crater and those that stop within their impact crater.
With high speed camera images and fluorescent markers on the projectiles we
track spin and projectile trajectories during impact. We find that the
projectile only reaches a rolling without slipping condition well after the
marble has reached peak penetration depth. The required friction coefficient
during the penetration phase of impact is 4-5 times lower than that of the sand
suggesting that the sand is fluidized near the projectile surface during
penetration. We find that the critical grazing impact critical angle dividing
ricochets from roll-outs, increases with increasing impact velocity. The
critical angles for ricochet and for roll-out as a function of velocity can be
matched by an empirical model during the rebound phase that balances a lift
force against gravity. We estimate constraints on projectile radius, velocity

valuable, if they have been highly magnified by strong gravitational lensing.
We use EAGLE and BAHAMAS, two recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations,
to predict the probability distribution for both the lens mass and lens
redshift when point sources are highly magnified by gravitational lensing. For
sources at a redshift of two, we find the distribution of lens redshifts to be
broad, peaking at z=0.6. The contribution of different lens masses is also
fairly broad, with most high-magnification lensing due to lenses with halo
masses between 10^12 and 10^14 solar masses. Lower mass haloes are inefficient
lenses, while more massive haloes are rare. We find that a simple model in
which all haloes have singular isothermal sphere density profiles can
approximately reproduce the simulation predictions, although such a model
over-predicts the importance of haloes with mass <10^12 solar masses for
lensing. We also calculate the probability that point sources at different
redshifts are strongly lensed. At low redshift, high magnifications are
extremely unlikely. Each z=0.5 source produces, on average, 5x10^-7 images with
magnification greater than ten; for z =2 this increases to about 2x10^-5. Our
results imply that searches for strongly lensed optical transients, including
the optical counterparts to strongly lensed gravitational waves, can be
optimized by monitoring massive galaxies, groups and clusters rather than
concentrating on an individual population of lenses.

key question is whether this reflects a causal connection - can star formation
be quenched dynamically by bulges or the spheroids of early-type galaxies? We
systematically investigate the impact of these morphological components on star
formation, by performing a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of isolated
galaxies containing a spheroid. We vary the bulge mass and scale radius, while
the total initial stellar, halo and gas mass are kept constant, with a gas
fraction of 5 per cent. In addition, we consider two different sub-grid star
formation prescriptions. The first follows most simulations in the literature
by assuming a constant star formation efficiency per free-fall time, whereas in
the second model it depends on the gas virial parameter, following
high-resolution simulations of turbulent fragmentation. Across all simulations,
central spheroids increase the gas velocity dispersion towards the galactic
centre. This increases the gravitational stability of the gas disc, suppresses
fragmentation and star formation, and results in galaxies hosting extremely
smooth and quiescent gas discs that fall below the galaxy main sequence. These
effects amplify when using the more sophisticated, dynamics-dependent star
formation model. Finally, we discover a pronounced relation between the central
stellar surface density and star formation rate (SFR), such that the most
bulge-dominated galaxies show the strongest deviation from the main sequence.
We conclude that the SFR of galaxies is not only set by the balance between
accretion and feedback, but carries a (sometimes dominant) dependence on the
gravitational potential.

subdwarf star (sdOB) fills its Roche lobe and started mass transfer to its
companion. The object was discovered as part of a dedicated high-cadence survey
of the Galactic Plane named the Zwicky Transient Facility and exhibits a period
of $P_{\rm orb}=39.3401(1)$ min, making it the most compact hot subdwarf binary

He-sdOB star with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=42,400\pm300$ K and
a surface gravity of $\log(g)=5.77\pm0.05$. A high-signal-to noise GTC+HiPERCAM
light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the sdOB star and an
eclipse of the sdOB by an accretion disk. We infer a low-mass hot subdwarf
donor with a mass $M_{\rm sdOB}=0.337\pm0.015$ M$_\odot$ and a white dwarf
accretor with a mass $M_{\rm WD}=0.545\pm0.020$ M$_\odot$. Theoretical binary
modeling indicates the hot subdwarf formed during a common envelope phase when
a $2.5-2.8$ M$_\odot$ star lost its envelope when crossing the Hertzsprung Gap.
To match its current $P_{\rm orb}$, $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log(g)$, and masses, we
estimate a post-common envelope period of $P_{\rm orb}\approx150$ min, and find
the sdOB star is currently undergoing hydrogen shell burning. We estimate that
the hot subdwarf will become a white dwarf with a thick helium layer of

distribution and characterising its components is of fundamental importance in
astrophysics but is also a difficult task to achieve. Wide-area spectroscopic
redshift surveys are required to accurately measure galaxy positions in space
that also need to cover large areas of the sky. It is also difficult to create
algorithms that can extract cosmic web structures (e.g. filaments). Moreover,
these detections will be affected by systematic uncertainties that stem from
the characteristics of the survey used (e.g. its completeness and coverage) and
from the unique properties of the specific method adopted to detect the cosmic
web (i.e. the assumptions it relies on and the free parameters it may employ).
For these reasons, the creation of new catalogues of cosmic web features on
wide sky areas is important, as this allows users to have at their disposal a
well-understood sample of structures whose systematic uncertainties have been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper we present the filament catalogues
created using the discrete persistent structure extractor (DisPerSE) tool in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we fully characterise them in terms of
their dependence on the choice of parameters pertaining to the algorithm, and
with respect to several systematic issues that may arise in the skeleton as a
result of the properties of the galaxy distribution (such as Finger-of-God
redshift distortions and defects of the density field that are due to the
boundaries of the survey).

theory of two interacting spin-2 objects, so-called bigravity, and the other
conformal gravity, a theory of gravity that has no knowledge of fundamental
length scales. The former of the two constitutes a veritable extension of
General Relativity, given that it adds to the metric tensor of gravity a second
dynamical tensor field. The resulting dynamics have been proposed as a
self-accelerating cosmology. Conformal gravity on the other hand is a much more
drastic change of the underlying gravitational theory. Its ignorance towards
fundamental length scales offers a completely different approach to the origin
of late time acceleration. In this sense, both models offer - in one way or
another - an explanation for the dark energy problem. We perform a combined

stream, using Gaia DR2 astrometry, Pan-STARRS photometry, together with high
precision radial velocities measured with the CFHT/ESPaDOnS and VLT/UVES
instruments and complemented with public radial velocity catalogs. We show that
after correcting for projection effects, the density profile exhibits high
contrast periodic peaks, separated by $2.64\pm0.18$ kpc. An N-body simulation
is presented that reproduces this striking morphology with simple epicyclic
motion in a smooth Galactic potential. We also discuss the reliability of
measuring density variations using ground-based photometric surveys, and for
the particular case of GD-1 we highlight some of the artifacts present in the
Gaia DR2 catalog along its track. Massive dark subhalos do not appear to be
required to explain the density clumping along GD-1.

properties in dark matter haloes, along with data-driven predictions for the

empirical relationships between the build-up of galactic components and their
evolution over cosmic time. At high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), the frameworks
imply that galaxies acquire their cold gas (both atomic and molecular) mostly
by accretion, with the fraction of cold gas reaching about 20% of the cosmic
baryon fraction. We infer a strong dependence of the star formation rate on the
H$_2$ mass, suggesting a near-universal depletion timescale of 0.1-1 Gyr in
Milky Way sized haloes (of masses $10^{12} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$). There is
also evidence for a near-universality of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation across
redshifts, with very little dependence on stellar mass, if a constant
conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) of CO luminosity to molecular gas mass is
assumed. Combining the atomic and molecular gas observations with the stellar
build-up illustrates that galactic mass assembly in Milky-Way sized haloes
proceeds from smooth accretion at high redshifts, towards becoming
merger-dominated at late times ($z \lesssim 0.6$). Our results can be used to
constrain numerical simulations of the dominant growth and accretion processes

scenarios for linear systems and eigenvalue problems, restarting is a well
explored technique for mitigating memory constraints. In this work, such
restarting techniques are applied to polynomial KSMs for matrix equations with
a compression step to control the growing rank of the residual. An error
analysis is also performed, leading to heuristics for dynamically adjusting the
basis size in each restart cycle. A panel of numerical experiments demonstrates
the effectiveness of the new method with respect to extended block KSMs.

which are abstract games between two competing players that send quantum states
to a referee, who performs an efficiently implementable joint measurement on
the two states to determine which of the player wins. The complexity class
$\mathrm{QRG}(1)$ contains those decision problems for which one of the players
can always win with high probability on yes-instances and the other player can
always win with high probability on no-instances, regardless of the opposing
player's strategy. This class trivially contains $\mathrm{QMA} \cup

prove stronger containments on two restricted variants of this class.
Specifically, if one of the players is limited to sending a classical
(probabilistic) state rather than a quantum state, the resulting complexity
class $\mathrm{CQRG}(1)$ is contained in $\exists\cdot\mathrm{PP}$ (the
nondeterministic polynomial-time operator applied to $\mathrm{PP}$); while if
both players send quantum states but the referee is forced to measure one of
the states first, and incorporates the classical outcome of this measurement
into a measurement of the second state, the resulting class $\mathrm{MQRG}(1)$

propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to explain how speakers and listeners
solve this inductive problem. To evaluate our model's predictions, we conducted
an experiment where participants played an extended natural-language

several measures of generalization and find key signatures of both

bicycle attacks. We aim to quantify both the prevalence of password length
leakage bugs as well as the potential harm to users. In an observational study,
we find that {\em most} of the Alexa top 100 rates sites are vulnerable to
bicycle attacks meaning that an eavesdropping attacker can infer the exact
length of a password based on the length the encrypted packet containing the
password. We discuss several ways in which an eavesdropping attacker could link
this password length with a particular user account e.g., a targeted campaign
against a smaller group of users or via DNS hijacking for larger scale
campaigns. We next use a decision-theoretic model to quantify the extent to
which password length leakage might help an attacker to crack user passwords.
In our analysis, we consider three different levels of password attackers:
hacker, criminal and nation-state. In all cases, we find that such an attacker
who knows the length of each user password gains a significant advantage over
one without knowing the password length. As part of this analysis, we also
release a new differentially private password frequency dataset from the 2016
LinkedIn breach using a differentially private algorithm of Blocki et al. (NDSS
2016) to protect user accounts. The LinkedIn frequency corpus is based on over
170 million passwords making it the largest frequency corpus publicly available
to password researchers. While the defense against bicycle attacks is
straightforward (i.e., ensure that passwords are always padded before
encryption), we discuss several practical challenges organizations may face
when attempting to patch this vulnerability. We advocate for a new W3C standard
on how password fields are handled which would effectively eliminate most
instances of password length leakage.

Process Regression (GPR) machine learning approaches are used to develop a
high-fidelity prediction approach of the Nikuradse equivalent sand-grain height
$k_s$ for turbulent flows over a wide variety of different rough surfaces. To
this end, 45 surface geometries were generated and the flow over them simulated
at $\hbox{Re}_\tau=1000$ using direct numerical simulations. These surface
geometries differed significantly in moments of surface height fluctuations,
effective slope, average inclination, porosity and degree of randomness. Thirty
of these surfaces were considered fully-rough and they were supplemented with
experimental data for fully-rough flows over 15 more surfaces available from
previous studies. The DNN and GPR methods predicted $k_s$ with an average error
of less than 10% and a maximum error of less than 30%, which appears to be
significantly more accurate than existing prediction formulas. They also
identified the surface porosity and the effective slope of roughness in the
spanwise direction as important factors in drag prediction.

the uncertainties of photon radiation pressure imposed on the object and of the
photon number in the photoelectric detection. The only possibility surpassing
the SQL is via correlations within the position/momentum uncertainty of the

we experimentally prove the theoretical prediction that this type of quantum
correlation is naturally produced in the Laser Interferometer

which associates have been assumed in existing thermodynamic modeling. It is
found that in the Ba rich melt, the Bi atoms are almost completely surrounded

to crystalline structures of Ba5Bi3 and Ba4Bi3 with a longer lifetime than
other polyhedrons during the AIMD simulations. In addition, these Bi-centered

structurally and compositionally diverse with a shorter lifetime. These
findings from AIMD study provide evidences that there exist a strongly ordering
Ba4Bi3 associate and a weakly ordering BaBi3 associate in the Ba-Bi liquid. The

of number of samples in lookahead horizon, that computes the optimal energy
ramping rates in a time horizon. The proposed algorithm exploits the problem's
piecewise linear structure and convexity properties for the
\textit{discretization} of optimal Lagrange multipliers. The solution has a
\textit{threshold-based structure} in which optimal control decisions are
independent of past or future price as well as of net load values beyond a
certain time horizon, defined as a \textit{sub-horizon}. Numerical results show
the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Furthermore, we
investigate the impact of forecasting errors on the proposed technique. We
consider an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) based forecasting of net load
together with the Model Predictive Control (MPC). We numerically show that
adaptive forecasting and MPC significantly mitigate the effects of forecast
error on energy arbitrage gains.

The unified framework is particularly well-suited for FSI, as the fluid and
solid sub-problems are addressed in essentially the same manner and can thus be
uniformly integrated in time with the generalized-$\alpha$ method. In addition,
the VMS formulation provides a mechanism for large-eddy simulation in the fluid
sub-problem and pressure stabilization in the solid sub-problem. The FSI
problem is solved in a quasi-direct approach, in which the pressure and
velocity in the unified continuum body are first solved, and the solid
displacement is then obtained via a segregated algorithm and prescribed as a
boundary condition for the mesh motion. Results of the pulmonary arterial FSI
simulation are presented and compared against those of a rigid wall simulation.

component can shift from its ideal (or designed) position on the wet solder
paste. The solder paste with some fluid properties could slump and the
unbalance between different sides of solder paste can lead to other forces on
the components as well. Though the shifts are usually considered to be
negligible and can be made up to some extent by the following self-alignment
during the process of soldering reflow, it should be attracted attention as its
importance for addressing the quality of the printed circuit board (PCB) in
SMT. To minimize or control the component shifts, whose relationship with the
characteristics of the solder paste (e.g., offset, volume) should be studied
initially. In this paper, we design a comprehensive experiment and collect the
data from a state-of-the-art SMT assembly line. Then we use support vector
regression (SVR) model to predict the component shifts based on different
situations of solder paste and placement settings. Also, two kernel functions,
linear (SVR-Linear) and radial basis function (SVR-RBF), are employed. The
achieved results indicate that the component shift in P&P process is
significant, and the SVR model is highly qualified for the forecast of the
component shifts. Particularly, the SVR-RBF model outperforms the SVR-Linear
model considering the prediction error.

sample composed of 846 ETGs to investigate environmental effects on galaxy
evolution. We find that the dependences of mean stellar ages, [Z/H] and
[$\alpha$/Fe] on central stellar velocity dispersion are similar, regardless
where the ETG resides, CGs or field. When compared to the sample of centrals
and satellites from the literature, we find that ETGs in GCs behave similarly
to centrals, especially those embedded in low-mass haloes ($M_{h} < 10^
{12.5}M_{\odot}$). Except for the low-mass limit, where field galaxies present
a Starforming signature, not seen in CGs, the ionization agent of the gas in CG
and field galaxies seem to be similar and due to hot, evolved low-mass stars.
However, field ETGs present an excess of H$\alpha$ emission relative to ETGs in
CGs. Additionally, we performed a dynamical analysis, which shows that CGs
present a bimodality in the group velocity dispersion distribution - a high and
low-$\sigma$ mode. Our results indicate that high-$\sigma$ groups have a
smaller fraction of spirals, shorter crossing times, and a more luminous
population of galaxies than the low $\sigma$ groups. It is important to
emphasize that our findings point to a small environmental impact on galaxies
located in CGs. The only evidence we find is the change in gas content,

challenging to image soft interfaces, such as biological membranes, due to the
deformations induced by the tip. Photonic Force Microscopy (PhFM), based on
optical tweezers (OT), represents an interesting alternative for soft
scanning-probe microscopy. Using light instead of a physical cantilever to hold
the scanning probe results in a stiffness ($k_{OT}\sim0.1-0.001$ pN/nm) which
can be 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that of standard cantilevers
($k_{AFM}\sim 10$ pN/nm). Combined with nm resolution of displacement
measurements of the trapped probe, this allows for imaging soft materials
without force-induced artefacts. However, the size of the optically trapped
probe, often chosen as a $\sim \mu$m-size sphere, has so far limited the
resolution of PhFM. Here we show a novel and simple nanofabrication protocol to
massively produce optically trappable quartz particles which mimic the sharp
tips of AFM. We demonstrate and quantify the stable trapping of particles with
tips as sharp as 35 nm, the smallest used in PhFM to date. Raster scan images
of rigid nanostructures with features smaller than 80 nm obtained with our tips
compare well with AFM images of the same samples. Imaging the membrane of

reveals the sub-micron structural features termed knobs, related to the

The agent nodes form a multi-hop network among themselves. Each agent node
computes an estimate of the process by using its sensor observation and
messages obtained from neighboring nodes,via Kalman-consensus filtering. An
external attacker, capable of arbitrarily manipulating the sensor observations
of some or all agent nodes, injects errors into those sensor observations. The
goal of the attacker is to steer the estimates at the agent nodes as close as
possible to a pre-specified value, while respecting a constraint on the attack
detection probability. To this end,a constrained optimization problem is
formulated to find the optimal parameter values of a certain class of linear
attacks. The parameters of linear attack are learnt on-line via a combination
of stochastic approximation and online stochastic gradient descent.Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of the attack.

  Approach","Accepted in ICC Workshop 2020, Dublin, Ireland. Fixed some errors",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The pervasiveness of the wireless cellular network can be a key enabler for
the deployment of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in beyond visual
line of sight scenarios without human control. However, traditional cellular
networks are optimized for ground user equipment (GUE) such as smartphones
which makes providing connectivity to flying UAVs very challenging. Moreover,
ensuring better connectivity to a moving cellular-connected UAV is notoriously
difficult due to the complex air-to-ground path loss model. In this paper, a
novel mechanism is proposed to ensure robust wireless connectivity and mobility
support for cellular-connected UAVs by tuning the downtilt (DT) angles of all
the GBSs. By leveraging tools from reinforcement learning (RL), DT angles are
dynamically adjusted by using a model-free RL algorithm. The goal is to provide
efficient mobility support in the sky by maximizing the received signal quality
at the UAV while also maintaining good throughput performance of the ground
users. Simulation results show that the proposed RL-based mobility management
(MM) technique can reduce the number of handovers while maintaining the
performance goals, compared to the baseline MM scheme in which the network
always keeps the DT angle fixed.

presented in Freedman et al. (2019) for measuring corrections for the total

differential comparison of the red giant population in the LMC, first with red

of the TRGB sequence using the SMC alone, invoking its geometric distance also
calibrated by DEBs. An additional consistency check comes from near-infrared
observations of Galactic globular clusters covering a wide range of
metallicities. In all cases we find excellent agreement in the zero-point

demonstrating that, in the case of the SMC, they corrected for extinction alone

  Caching",,,,,"cs.NI cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While edge video caching has great potential to decrease the core network
traffic as well as the users' experienced latency, it is often challenging to
exploit the caches in current client-driven video streaming solutions due to
two key reasons. First, even those clients interested in the same content might
request different quality levels as a video content is encoded into multiple
qualities to match a wide range of network conditions and device capabilities.
Second, the clients, who select the quality of the next chunk to request, are
unaware of the cached content at the network edge. Hence, it becomes imperative
to develop network-side solutions to exploit caching. This can also mitigate
some performance issues, in particular for the scenarios in which multiple
video clients compete for some bottleneck capacity. In this paper, we propose a
network-side control logic running at a WiFi AP to facilitate the use of cached
video content. In particular, an AP can assign a client station a different
video quality than its request, in case the alternative quality provides a
better utility. We formulate the quality assignment problem as an optimization
problem and develop several heuristics with polynomial complexity. Compared to
the baseline where the clients determine the quality adaptation, our proposals,
referred to as EdgeDASH, offer higher video quality, higher cache hits, and
lower stalling ratio which are essential for user's satisfaction. Our
simulations show that EdgeDASH facilitates significant cache hits and decreases
the buffer stalls only by changing the client's request by one quality level.
Moreover, from our analysis, we conclude that the network assistance provides
significant performance improvement, especially when the clients with identical
interests compete for a bottleneck link's capacity.

that ethics codes from corporations and professional associations conflated
consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. Interviews with
community organizers about social change in the digital era supplement the
analysis, surfacing the limits of technical solutions to concerns of
marginalized communities. Given evidence that highlights the gulf between the

study sufficient conditions for a convex hull result that immediately implies
that the standard semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation of a QCQP is tight. We
begin by outlining a general framework for proving such sufficient conditions.
Then using this framework, we show that the convex hull result holds whenever
the quadratic eigenvalue multiplicity, a parameter capturing the amount of

new sufficient conditions for the tightness (as well as convex hull exactness)

coherent point-like sources, such as pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), wave
effects will become important in their gravitational lensing. In this paper, we
describe the wave optics formalism, its various limits, and the conditions for
which these limits hold. Using the simple point lens as an example, we will
show that the frequency dependence of wave effects breaks degeneracies that are
present in the usual geometric optics limit, and constructive interference
results in larger magnifications further from the lens. This latter fact leads
to a generic increase in cross section for microlensing events in the
wave-optics regime compared to the geometric optics regime. For realistic
percent-level spectral sensitivities, this leads to a relative boost in lensing
cross section of more than an order of magnitude. We apply the point-lens model
to the lensing of FRBs and pulsars and find that these radio sources will be
lensed in the full wave-optics regime by isolated masses in the range of
$0.1-100\,M_\oplus$, which includes free-floating planets (FFPs), whose
Einstein radius is smaller than the Fresnel scale. More generally, the
interference pattern allows an instantaneous determination of lens masses,

benefits from external perturbations. By means of the differences of
antifragility between the original and mutated biological networks, we train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and test it to classify the properties of

sublattices. It is supposed that the first sublattice of a bipartite honeycomb
lattice is formed by the spin-1/2 magnetic ions, while the sites of the second
sublattice are randomly occupied either by the spin-1 magnetic ions with a
probability $\rho$ or the spin-3/2 magnetic ions with a probability $1-\rho$,
both being subject to a uniaxial single-ion anisotropy. The model under

triangular lattice through the generalized star-triangle transformation. For a
specific concentration of the spin-1 (spin-3/2) magnetic ions, it is shown that
the ferro-ferrimagnetic version of the studied model may display a compensation
temperature at which the total magnetization vanishes below a critical
temperature. The critical temperature strikingly may also become independent of
the concentration of the randomly mixed spin-1 and spin-3/2 magnetic ions for a

boosting on separable data, taking statistical and computational perspectives.
We consider a high-dimensional setting where the number of features (weak
learners) $p$ scales with the sample size $n$, in an overparametrized regime.
Under a class of statistical models, we provide an exact analysis of the
generalization error of boosting when the algorithm interpolates the training
data and maximizes the empirical $\ell_1$-margin. Further, we explicitly pin
down the relation between the boosting test error and the optimal Bayes error,
as well as the proportion of active features at interpolation (with zero
initialization). In turn, these precise characterizations answer certain
questions raised in \cite{breiman1999prediction, schapire1998boosting}
surrounding boosting, under assumed data generating processes. At the heart of
our theory lies an in-depth study of the maximum-$\ell_1$-margin, which can be
accurately described by a new system of non-linear equations; to analyze this
margin, we rely on Gaussian comparison techniques and develop a novel uniform
deviation argument. Our statistical and computational arguments can handle (1)
any finite-rank spiked covariance model for the feature distribution and (2)
variants of boosting corresponding to general $\ell_q$-geometry, $q \in [1,
2]$. As a final component, via the Lindeberg principle, we establish a
universality result showcasing that the scaled $\ell_1$-margin (asymptotically)
remains the same, whether the covariates used for boosting arise from a
non-linear random feature model or an appropriately linearized model with
matching moments.

must be accurately quantified. This uncertainty may come from errors in
learning (due to a lack of data, for example), or may be inherent to the
system. Propagating uncertainty forward in learned dynamics models is a
difficult problem. In this work we use deep learning to obtain expressive and
flexible models of how distributions of trajectories behave, which we then use
for nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). We introduce a deep quantile
regression framework for control that enforces probabilistic quantile bounds
and quantifies epistemic uncertainty. Using our method we explore three
different approaches for learning tubes that contain the possible trajectories
of the system, and demonstrate how to use each of them in a Tube MPC scheme. We
prove these schemes are recursively feasible and satisfy constraints with a
desired margin of probability. We present experiments in simulation on a
nonlinear quadrotor system, demonstrating the practical efficacy of these
ideas.

(offline) a reachable set of parameterized trajectories for each joint of an

parameterized reachable set of the full arm in workspace and intersects it with
obstacles to generate sub-differentiable, provably-conservative

two MCs at different evolutionary stages, the Pipe and the G14.225 clouds, to
test the ability of the GHC scenario to follow the early evolution of the
energy budget and star formation activity of these structures. In the
simulation, we select a region that contains cores of sizes and densities
similar to the Pipe cores, and find that it evolves through accretion,
developing substructure similar to that of G14.225 cloud after $\sim 1.6$ Myr.
Within this region, we follow the evolution of the Larson ratio $\mathcal{L}
\equiv \sigma_{\rm v}/R^{1/2}$, where $\sigma_{\rm v}$ is the velocity
dispersion and $R$ is the size, the virial parameter $\alpha$, and the star
formation activity of the cores/clumps. In the simulation, we find that as the
region evolves: $i)$ its clumps have $\mathcal{L}$ and $\alpha$ values first
consistent with those of the Pipe substructures and later with those of
G14.225; $ii)$ the individual cores first exhibit a decrease in $\alpha$
followed by an increase when star formation begins; $iii)$ collectively, the
ensemble of cores/clumps reproduces the observed trend of lower $\alpha$ for
higher-mass objects, and $iv)$ the star formation rate and star formation
efficiency increase monotonically. We suggest that this evolution is due to the
simultaneous loss of externally-driven compressive kinetic energy and increase
of the self-gravity-driven motions. We conclude that the GHC scenario provides
a realistic description of the evolution of the energy budget of the clouds'
substructure at early times, which occurs simultaneously with an evolution of
the star formation activity.

as other labels, and thus their existence appears unknown from the given
supervision. We attribute the unknown unknowns to the fact that the training
dataset is badly advised by the incompletely perceived label space due to the
insufficient feature information. To this end, we propose the exploratory
machine learning, which examines and investigates the training dataset by
actively augmenting the feature space to discover potentially unknown labels.
Our approach consists of three ingredients including rejection model, feature
acquisition, and model cascade. The effectiveness is validated on both
synthetic and real datasets.

that asymmetric spike patterns are all unstable in the absence of the precursor

analytical-numerical approach we analyze the spectrum of the linearization of
the GM model around the two-spike steady-state to establish that portions of

incorporate a light-weight objectness mask generation (OMG) network in front of

(GW) distance is often presented as the gold standard. GW is intuitive, as it
quantifies whether one measure can be isomorphically mapped to the other.
However, its exact computation is intractable, and most algorithms that claim
to approximate it remain expensive. Building on \cite{memoli-2011}, who
proposed to represent each point in each distribution as the 1D distribution of
its distances to all other points, we introduce in this paper the Anchor Energy
(AE) and Anchor Wasserstein (AW) distances, which are respectively the energy

contribution is to propose a sweep line algorithm to compute AE \emph{exactly}
in log-quadratic time, where a naive implementation would be cubic. This is
quasi-linear w.r.t. the description of the problem itself. Our second
contribution is the proposal of robust variants of AE and AW that uses rank

speech separation. However, MDC only applies the spatial features as the
additional information. So it is difficult to learn mutual relationship between
spatial and spectral features. Besides, the training objective of MDC is
defined at embedding vectors, rather than real separated sources, which may
damage the separation performance. In this work, we propose a deep attention
fusion method to dynamically control the weights of the spectral and spatial
features and combine them deeply. In addition, to solve the training objective
problem of MDC, the real separated sources are used as the training objectives.
Specifically, we apply the deep clustering network to extract deep embedding
features. Instead of using the unsupervised K-means clustering to estimate
binary masks, another supervised network is utilized to learn soft masks from
these deep embedding features. Our experiments are conducted on a spatialized
reverberant version of WSJ0-2mix dataset. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms MDC baseline and even better than the oracle ideal
binary mask (IBM).

method that can efficiently project a $d$-dimensional data into $r$-dimensional
space ($r \ll d$) in $O(dlog(d))$ time, has been widely used to address the
challenge of high-dimensionality in machine learning. SRHT works by rotating
the input data matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ by Randomized
Walsh-Hadamard Transform followed with a subsequent uniform column sampling on
the rotated matrix. Despite the advantages of SRHT, one limitation of SRHT is
that it generates the new low-dimensional embedding without considering any
specific properties of a given dataset. Therefore, this data-independent random
projection method may result in inferior and unstable performance when used for
a particular machine learning task, e.g., classification. To overcome this
limitation, we analyze the effect of using SRHT for random projection in the
context of linear SVM classification. Based on our analysis, we propose
importance sampling and deterministic top-$r$ sampling to produce effective
low-dimensional embedding instead of uniform sampling SRHT. In addition, we
also proposed a new supervised non-uniform sampling method. Our experimental
results have demonstrated that our proposed methods can achieve higher

The CE for such systems is a challenging task due to the large dimension of

address this problem, this paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE
solution for IRS-aided mmWave massive MIMO systems, whereby the angular channel
sparsity of large-scale array at mmWave is exploited for improved CE with
reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, we first propose a downlink pilot
transmission framework. By designing the pilot signals based on the prior
knowledge that the line-of-sight dominated BS-to-IRS channel is known, the
high-dimensional channels for BS-to-user and IRS-to-user can be jointly
estimated based on CS theory. Moreover, to efficiently estimate broadband
channels, a distributed orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is exploited,
where the common sparsity shared by the channels at different subcarriers is
utilized. Additionally, the redundant dictionary to combat the power leakage is
also designed for the enhanced CE performance. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

printing slice the input model into successive 2D layers in order to construct
the toolpath. Unfortunately slicing-based methods can incur a substantial
amount of wasted motion (i.e., the extruder is moving while not printing),
particularly when features of the model are spatially separated. In recent
years we have introduced a new paradigm that characterizes the space of
feasible toolpaths using a dependency graph on the input model, along with
several algorithms to search this space for toolpaths that optimize objective
functions such as wasted motion or print time. A natural question that arises
is, under what circumstances can we efficiently compute an optimal toolpath? In
this paper, we give an algorithm for computing fused deposition modeling (FDM)
toolpaths that utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a powerful
general-purpose method for navigating large search spaces that is guaranteed to
converge to the optimal solution. Under reasonable assumptions on printer
geometry that allow us to compress the dependency graph, our MCTS-based
algorithm converges to find the optimal toolpath. We validate our algorithm on
a dataset of 75 models and show it performs on par with our previous best local
search-based algorithm in terms of toolpath quality. In prior work we
speculated that the performance of local search was near optimal, and we
examine in detail the properties of the models and MCTS executions that lead to
better or worse results than local search.

difficult to avoid. Although how agents can resolve such problems autonomously
has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on
underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA),
a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's
intention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active
inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we
hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an
agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a
critical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of
imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive
sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the
model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body
movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity
can be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We
first searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate
coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's
complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception
module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the
tightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the
SoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an
agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In
contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by
adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity
regulation crucially affects the strength of the SoA and the dynamics of
interactions between agents.

Recently, deep clustering,

deep clustering methods usually boost the clustering results by means of the
powerful representation ability of deep learning, e.g., autoencoder, suggesting
that learning an effective representation for clustering is a crucial
requirement. The strength of deep clustering methods is to extract the useful
representations from the data itself, rather than the structure of data, which
receives scarce attention in representation learning. Motivated by the great
success of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in encoding the graph structure,
we propose a Structural Deep Clustering Network (SDCN) to integrate the
structural information into deep clustering. Specifically, we design a delivery
operator to transfer the representations learned by autoencoder to the
corresponding GCN layer, and a dual self-supervised mechanism to unify these
two different deep neural architectures and guide the update of the whole
model. In this way, the multiple structures of data, from low-order to
high-order, are naturally combined with the multiple representations learned by
autoencoder. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the delivery operator, i.e.,
with the delivery operator, GCN improves the autoencoder-specific
representation as a high-order graph regularization constraint and autoencoder
helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem in GCN. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our propose model can consistently perform
better over the state-of-the-art techniques.

faithfully transmitting large-amplitude control microwave pulses due to the
saturation of the quantum filter, enabling fast qubit control. We observe an
improvement of the qubit relaxation time without a reduction of the Rabi

large-scale superconducting quantum information processor in terms of the
heating of the qubit environments and the crosstalk between qubits.

phase and amplitude response of the induced fields will be influenced by the
increasing electrical conductivity along oceans' convective adiabatic
temperature profiles. Here, we examine the amplitudes and phase lags for
magnetic diffusion in modeled oceans of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. We
restrict our analysis to spherically symmetric configurations, treating
interior structures based on self-consistent thermodynamics, which account for
variations in electrical conductivity with depth in convective oceans (Vance et
al., 2018). The numerical approach considers tens of radial layers. The
induction response of the adiabatic conductivity profile differs from oceans
with uniform conductivity based on the ice-ocean interface or the mean value of
the adiabatic profile by more than 10% in many cases. In addition, we consider
the generation of induced magnetic fields by oceanic fluid motions that might
be used to probe the ocean flows directly (e.g., Chave, 1983; Tyler, 2011;
Minami, 2017). Assuming turbulent convection (Soderlund et al., 2014), we find
that these signals can dominate induction signal at low latitudes, which
underscores the need for spatial coverage in magnetic induction investigations.
Based on end-member ocean compositions (Zolotov, 2008; Zolotov & Kargel, 2009),
we quantify the residual magnetic induction signals that might be used to infer
the oxidation state of Europa's ocean and to investigate stable liquids within

parameter space for the sake of planned missions requires electrical
conductivity measurements in fluids at low temperature and to high salinity and

unsupervised community detection has received a lot of attention in the
literature. Increasingly the focus of network analysis is shifting towards
using network information in some other prediction or inference task rather
than just analyzing the network itself. In particular, in neuroimaging
applications brain networks are available for multiple subjects and the goal is
often to predict a phenotype of interest. Community structure is well known to
be a feature of brain networks, typically corresponding to different regions of
the brain responsible for different functions. There are standard parcellations
of the brain into such regions, usually obtained by applying clustering methods
to brain connectomes of healthy subjects. However, when the goal is predicting
a phenotype or distinguishing between different conditions, these static
communities from an unrelated set of healthy subjects may not be the most
useful for prediction. Here we present a method for supervised community
detection, aiming to find a partition of the network into communities that is
most useful for predicting a particular response. We use a block-structured
regularization penalty combined with a prediction loss function, and compute
the solution with a combination of a spectral method and an ADMM optimization
algorithm. We show that the spectral clustering method recovers the correct
communities under a weighted stochastic block model. The method performs well
on both simulated and real brain networks, providing support for the idea of
task-dependent brain regions.

conventional machine learning based on centralized datasets is confronted with
significant challenges, making artificial intelligence (AI) impractical in many
mission-critical and data-sensitive scenarios, such as finance, government, and
health. In the meantime, tremendous datasets are scattered in isolated silos in
various industries, organizations, different units of an organization, or
different branches of an international organization. These valuable data
resources are well underused. To advance AI theories and applications, we
propose a comprehensive framework (called Knowledge Federation - KF) to address
these challenges by enabling AI while preserving data privacy and ownership.
Beyond the concepts of federated learning and secure multi-party computation,
KF consists of four levels of federation: (1) information level, low-level
statistics and computation of data, meeting the requirements of simple queries,
searching and simplistic operators; (2) model level, supporting training,
learning, and inference; (3) cognition level, enabling abstract feature
representation at various levels of abstractions and contexts; (4) knowledge
level, fusing knowledge discovery, representation, and reasoning. We further
clarify the relationship and differentiation between knowledge federation and
other related research areas. We have developed a reference implementation of
KF, called iBond Platform, to offer a production-quality KF platform to enable
industrial applications in finance, insurance et al. The iBond platform will
also help establish the KF community and a comprehensive ecosystem and usher in
a novel paradigm shift towards secure, privacy-preserving and responsible AI.
As far as we know, knowledge federation is the first hierarchical and unified
framework for secure multi-party computing and learning.

In this paper, we address the common setting in which one of the graphs to
match is a bipartite network and one is unipartite. Commonly, the bipartite
networks are collapsed or projected into a unipartite graph, and graph matching
proceeds as in the classical setting. This potentially leads to noisy edge
estimates and loss of information. We formulate the graph matching problem
between a bipartite and a unipartite graph using an undirected graphical model,
and introduce methods to find the alignment with this model without collapsing.
We theoretically demonstrate that our methodology is consistent, and provide
non-asymptotic conditions that ensure exact recovery of the matching solution.
In simulations and real data examples, we show how our methods can result in a
more accurate matching than the naive approach of transforming the bipartite

a concept whitening module is added to a CNN, the axes of the latent space are

that it normalizes, and also decorrelates (whitens) the latent space. CW can be
used in any layer of the network without hurting predictive performance.

result of their orbital motion around their equilibrium positions, has garnered
attention as a quantity analogous to the magnon spin. However, can we
manipulate PAM like magnon spin? Here, we show that temperature gradient
generally induces a transverse flow of PAM, which we term the phonon angular
momentum Hall effect (PAMHE). The PAMHE relies only on the presence of
transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons, and it is therefore ubiquitous in
condensed matter systems. As a consequence of the PAMHE, PAM accumulates at the
edges of a crystal. When the atoms in the crystal carry nonzero Born effective
charge, the edge PAM induces edge magnetization, which may be observed through
optical measurement. We believe that PAMHE provides a new principle for the
manipulation of angular momenta in insulators and opens up an avenue for
developing functional materials based on phonon engineering.

HierArchical INference (CHAIN) is proposed to interpret the net decision-making
process. For net-decisions being interpreted, the proposed method presents the
CHAIN interpretation in which the net decision can be hierarchically deduced
into visual concepts from high to low semantic levels. To achieve it, we
propose three models sequentially, i.e., the concept harmonizing model, the
hierarchical inference model, and the concept-harmonized hierarchical inference
model. Firstly, in the concept harmonizing model, visual concepts from high to
low semantic-levels are aligned with net-units from deep to shallow layers.
Secondly, in the hierarchical inference model, the concept in a deep layer is
disassembled into units in shallow layers. Finally, in the concept-harmonized
hierarchical inference model, a deep-layer concept is inferred from its
shallow-layer concepts. After several rounds, the concept-harmonized
hierarchical inference is conducted backward from the highest semantic level to
the lowest semantic level. Finally, net decision-making is explained as a form
of concept-harmonized hierarchical inference, which is comparable to human
decision-making. Meanwhile, the net layer structure for feature learning can be
explained based on the hierarchical visual concepts. In quantitative and
qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CHAIN at the
instance and class levels.

short channel back-gated GFETs (L=300, 100 nm) were measured at lower and
higher drain voltages, for a wide range of gate voltages covering the region
away from charge neutrality point (CNP) up to CNP at p-type operation region.
Current-voltage (IV) and LFN data were also available from a long channel SL
top solution-gated (SG) GFET (L=5 um), for both p- and n-type regions near and
away CNP. At each of these regimes, the appropriate IV and LFN parameters can
be accurately extracted. Regarding LFN, mobility fluctuation effect is dominant
at CNP and from there the Hooge parameter aH can be extracted while the carrier
number fluctuation contribution which is responsible for the well-known M-shape
bias dependence of output noise divided by squared drain current, also observed
in our data, makes possible the extraction of the NT parameter related to the
number of traps. In the less possible case of a Lambda-shape trend, NT and aH
can be extracted simultaneously from the region near CNP. Away from CNP,
contact resistance can have a significant contribution to LFN and from there
the relevant parameter SDR^2 is defined. The LFN parameters described above can
be estimated from the low drain voltage region of operation where the effect of
Velocity Saturation (VS) mechanism is negligible. VS effect results in the
reduction of LFN at higher drain voltages and from there the IV parameter
hOmega which represents the phonon energy and is related to VS effect can be
derived both from drain current and LFN data.

IA can be combined with interference cancellation (IC), involving a new
receiver architecture associated with signaling over backhaul links among the
different users, as another interference mitigation scheme which is referred to
as interference alignment and cancellation (IAC). In our earlier work, by
proposing an IAC graph, we have derived the necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of closed-form solutions for IAC subject to the given DoF
requirement for individual user. Furthermore, we have also shown that it can
achieve the theoretically maximum possible DoF, which is 2M for MIMO system
with M Tx/Rx antennas. Following our previous works on IAC, we aim to
investigate the design criteria to obtain such closed-form transceivers when
they exist. We first develop a general closed-form IAC transceiver design for
any given DoF requirement of individual user and then, we specify how the
optimal IAC transceiver can be designed to achieve the theoretically maximum
DoF of 2M, beating the performance of conventional IA with much less

simply a projection or ""shadow"" of the object rather than a point-to-point
image possible with a lens. This technique fails to take advantage of the
resolving capabilities of short-wavelength X rays. Various X-ray microscopes,
typically operating with soft X rays (< 10 keV), use focusing X-ray optics to
obtain higher resolution images of the internal structure of an object. Due to
the short focal length of focusing X-ray optics, it becomes difficult to focus
on the internal structure of larger objects in such a way to provide
significant magnification to be resolvable. Here we present an imaging
mechanism that utilizes two-photon X-ray ghost imaging to produce a true
point-to-point image of the internal structure of an object, with the potential
to introduce focusing X-ray optics or a scintillator-lens pairing to produce a
magnified secondary ghost image. The focusing X-ray optics would image the
primary ghost image (which has no physical structure to it) allowing the
imaging of internal structures deeper than a standard X-ray microscope would
allow. In principle, once some experimental barriers are overcome, this X-ray

stars were generated and reconstructed assuming different relative precision in
$\delta \nu$ (5% and 2%). The quantification of the systematic errors arising
from a mismatch between synthetic stars and the recovery grid was also
performed. The biases were negligible. The statistical error in age estimates
was strongly dependent on the stellar evolutionary phase. It is at its maximum
at ZAMS and decreases to about 11% and 6% ($\delta \nu$ at 5% and 2% level)
when stars reach the 30% of their evolutionary MS lifetime, then vanishes in
the last 20% of the MS. For mass and radius estimates we detected nearly
identical behavior for an observational uncertainty of 5%. No benefit was
detected for mass and radius determinations from a reduction $\delta \nu$
precision to 2%. The impact on the age of the initial helium abundance resulted
in negligible results. On the other hand greater bias (2% and 1%) in mass and
radius estimates were detected whenever $\delta \nu$ is in the observational
pool. This result, together with the presence of further unexplored uncertainty
sources, suggest that precision in the derived stellar quantities below these
thresholds may possibly be overoptimistic. [...] Finally, we compared the
estimates by the SCEPtER pipeline for 13 Kepler asteroseismic LEGACY sample

was observed depending on the cooling or heating history of the sample. Below
about 20 K the magnetic structure became of a chiral type. From spherical
neutron polarimetry measurements, the resulting low-temperature magnetic
structure kz3 was approximated by the general elliptic helix. The parameters of
the magnetic helix-like ellipticity and helical plane orientation in regard to
the crystal structure were determined. A reorientation of the helix occurs at
an intermediate temperature between 4 K and 18 K. A difference between the
population of right- and left-handed chiral domains of about 0.2 was observed
in the as-grown crystal when cooling without an external electric field. The
magnetic chiral ratio can be changed by the application of an external electric
field of a few kV/cm, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. A linear
dependence of the magnetic chirality on the applied electric field in NdMn2O5
was found. The results are discussed within the frame of the antisymmetric
super-exchange model for Dzyaloshinsky-Moria interaction.

catalogue data from the same simulation. The results show that the recovered
signal could be attenuated by low angular resolution of the map or large
aperture photometry filter radius size, but the mean radial velocity profile
can be fully recovered with our estimator. By applying the estimator to the
Planck 2D-ILC CMB map, with galaxy and void catalogues from BOSS DR12, we find
that the estimated void velocity profile is $3.31\sigma$ apart from null
detection for for voids with continuously rising density profiles asymptoting
to the mean density; and $1.75\sigma$ for voids with positive density contrast
shell surrounded. By fitting the reconstructed data to the theoretical profile,
we find the reduced $\chi^{2}$ to be $1.19$ and $0.62$ for the two types of
void, respectively, indicating a good fit of the model to the data. We then
forecast the detectability of the radial velocity profile of cosmic voids with
future CMB surveys, including SPT-3G, AdvACT, and Simons Observatory. We find
that the contamination effect from CMB residuals is negligible with survey area
over $2,000~{\rm deg}^2$, especially with aperture photometry size less than
$1\,{\rm arcmin}$. But the effect from instrumental noise is non-negligible.
For future SPT-3G, AdvACT and Simons Observatory, the detection is potentially

upper bound allows providing a tight approximation of the average AoI with a
very low complexity. We then provide a game framework that allows each source

novel ways to probe particle structure and interactions. In the recent paper

collisions or twisted $e^+e^-$ annihilation gives access to parity- and
spin-sensitive observables in inclusive cross sections, even when the initial
particles are unpolarized. Here, we explore these features in detail, providing
a qualitative picture and illustrating it with numerical examples. We show how
one can detect parity-violating effects in collisions of unpolarized twisted

unpolarized twisted $e^+e^-$ annihilation. These examples highlight the
unprecedented level of control over polarization offered by twisted particles,

  welcome!",,"10.1093/mnras/staa360",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spherical plasma lens models are known to suffer from a severe over-pressure
problem, with some observations requiring lenses with central pressures up to
millions of times in excess of the ambient ISM. There are two ways that lens
models can solve the over-pressure problem: a confinement mechanism exists to
counter the internal pressure of the lens, or the lens has a unique geometry,
such that the projected column-density appears large to an observer. This
occurs with highly asymmetric models, such as edge-on sheets or filaments, with
potentially low volume-density. In the first part of this work we investigate
the ability of non-magnetized plasma filaments to mimic the magnification of
sources seen behind spherical lenses and we extend a theorem from gravitational
lens studies regarding this model degeneracy. We find that for plasma lenses,
the theorem produces unphysical charge density distributions. In the second
part of the work, we consider the plasma lens over-pressure problem. Using
magnetohydrodynamics, we develop a non self-gravitating model filament confined
by a helical magnetic field. We use toy models in the force-free limit to
illustrate novel lensing properties. Generally, magnetized filaments may act as
lenses in any orientation with respect to the observer, with the most high
density events produced from filaments with axes near the line of sight. We
focus on filaments that are perpendicular to the line of sight that show the
toroidal magnetic field component may be observed via the lens rotation
measure.

Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. In the ETAS framework, the
occurrence of the mainshock earthquakes in a geographical region is assumed to
follow an inhomogeneous spatial point process, and aftershock events are then
modelled via a separate triggering kernel. Most previous studies of the ETAS
model have relied on point estimates of the model parameters due to the
complexity of the likelihood function, and the difficulty in estimating an
appropriate mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty
into account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model
which uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the
spatial mainshock process. Direct inference for the resulting model is
problematic due to the strong correlation of the parameters for the mainshock

growth of demand, the market is about to saturate soon, and the future trend is
to seek efficient utilization of resources. Specifically speaking, food company
must have a reliable algorithm to help them produce efficient delivery
strategies; individual customers need planning for their decision making in
this field. For example, when customers add tip to their order with the sake of
controlling or reducing latency. However, few customers know how much tip is
enough to reach their desired latency. Therefore, in our paper, we establish a
dynamic model to generate delivery strategy for companies and tip advice for
customers. We believe that the system we design is more efficient than the
currently primitive system. We simulate the delivery process and generate
delivery strategies using genetic annealing because it can approach a near
optimal solution. High-quality delivery queue ensures that those orders can be
delivered within an acceptable amount of time. Next, we construct regressions
to find out relationships between multiple factors and latency and then
generate the advisory amount of tip. Finally, we plug in those values and
desired waiting time, getting the advisory tip price. Multiple indexes suggest
that our regression results are accurate and reliable.

analyzed analytically and numerically. A modified sine-Gordon type equation in
the presence of time-dependent local field is derived and solved numerically in
static and dynamic cases. Two specific examples of local fields are considered:
induced either by an Abrikosov vortex, or by a tip of a magnetic force
microscope (MFM). It is demonstrated that time-dependent local field can induce
a dynamic flux-flow state in the junction with shuttling, or unidirectional
ratchet-like Josephson vortex motion. This provides a mechanism of detection
and manipulation of Josephson vortices by an oscillating MFM tip. In a static
case local field leads to a distortion of the critical current versus magnetic
field, $I_c(H)$, modulation pattern. The distortion is sensitive to both the
shape and the amplitude of the local field. Therefore, the $I_c(H)$ pattern
carries information about the local field distribution within the junction.
This opens a possibility for employing a single Josephson junction as a
scanning probe sensor with spatial resolution not limited by its geometrical
size, thus obviating a known problem of a trade-off between field sensitivity
and spatial resolution of a sensor.

laser pulses. This signal depends not only on the population of optically
active excitons, which affects the absorption of the probe, but also on the
population of optically inactive states, by interaction-induced energy shift,
influencing the refractive index experienced by the probe. As such, it offers
insight into density dynamics of excitons which do not directly couple to
photons. Reproducing the coherent signal detected in amplitude and phase, the
FWM delay dependence is modeled by a coherent superposition of several
exponential decay components, with characteristic time constants from 0.1
picosecond up to 1 nanosecond. With increasing excitation intensity and/or
temperature, we observe strong interference effects in the FWM field amplitude,
resulting in progressively more complex and nonintuitive signal dynamics. We
attribute this behaviour to increasingly populated exciton dark states, which
change the FWM field phase by the relative effect on absorption and refractive
index. We observe that exciton recombination occurs on a significantly longer

analysis of disturbances on the GNSS signal propagation. We show how the GNSS
signals are sensitive to a space variation of the fine structure constant
$\alpha$ in a generic framework of effective scalar field theories beyond the
Standard Model. This effective variation may originate from the crossing of the
RF signals with dark matter clumps and/or solitonic structures. At the
macroscopic scale, the subsequent disturbances are equivalent to those which
occur during the propagation in an inhomogeneous medium. We thus propose an
interpretation of the ""measure"" of the vacuum permeability as a test of
fundamental physics. We show the relevance of our approach by a first
quantification of the expected signature in a simple model of a variation of
$\alpha$ according to a planar geometry. We use a test-bed model of domain
walls for that purpose and focus on the measurable time delay in the GNSS

barotropic beta-plane turbulence was analyzed through a geometric decomposition
of the eddy stress tensor. The stress tensor is visualized by an eddy variance
ellipse whose characteristics are related to eddy properties. The tilt of the
ellipse principal axis is the tilt of the eddies with respect to the shear, the
eccentricity of the ellipse is related to the eddy anisotropy, while its size
is related to the eddy kinetic energy. Changes of these characteristics are
directly related to the vorticity fluxes forcing the mean flow. The statistical
state dynamics of the turbulent flow closed at second order was employed as it
provides an analytic expression for both the zonostrophic instability and the
stress tensor. For the linear phase of the instability, the stress tensor was
analytically calculated at the stability boundary. For the non--linear
equilibration of the instability the tensor was calculated in the limit of
small supercriticality in which the amplitude of the jet velocity follows
Ginzburg--Landau dynamics. It is found that dependent on the characteristics of
the forcing, the jet is accelerated either because it primarily anisotropizes
the eddies so as to produce upgradient fluxes or because it changes the eddy
tilt. The instability equilibrates as these changes are partially reversed by
the non--linear terms. Parameterizations of the ellipse characteristics are
also discussed.

wavevector, Q_AF, that is associated with the square lattice of iron atoms that
makes up the system. It has been suggested that such a ""hollowed-out""
spin-excitation spectrum is due to hidden Neel order. We study such a hidden
spin-density wave (hSDW) state that results from nested Fermi surfaces at the
center and at the corner of the unfolded Brillouin zone. It emerges within mean
field theory from an extended Hubbard model over a square lattice of iron atoms
that contain the minimal d_xz and d_yz orbitals. Opposing Neel order exists
over the isotropic d+ = d_xz + i d_yz and d- = d_xz - i d_yz orbitals. The
dynamical spin susceptibility of the hSDW is computed within the random phase
approximation, at perfect nesting. Unobservable Goldstone modes that disperse
acoustically are found at Q_AF. A threshold is found in the spectrum of
observable spin excitations that forms a ""floating ring"" at Q_AF also. The ring
threshold moves down in energy toward zero with increasing Hund's Rule
coupling, while it moves up in energy with increasing magnetic frustration.
Comparison with the normal-state features of the spin-excitation spectrum shown
by electron-doped iron selenide is made. Also, recent predictions of a Lifshitz
transition from the nested Fermi surfaces to Fermi surface pockets at the

enabled the upconversion of visible femtosecond lasers to the vacuum and
extreme ultraviolet regions. However, the complexity of their experimental

optimal for maximize the VUV generation efficiency and prevents self-phase

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may host a polar dust region with the size of
several pc, and such dust may be carried by radiation from the central engine.
The polar dust emission often exhibits very weak or absence of the silicate
10-$\mu$m emission feature. A possible explanation is that the polar dust is
dominated by micron-sized large grains because these grains do not show the
silicate feature, while it remains unclear how large grains are preferentially
supplied to the polar region. We here propose a new scenario describing the
prevalence of large grains at the polar region. We show that grains are
accelerated to the hypersonic drift velocity by the radiation pressure from
AGN, and the hypersonic drift results in dust destruction via kinetic
sputtering. Sputtering destroys small grains faster than the large ones, and
thus larger grains will be preferentially blown over longer distance. Although
the hypersonic drift, or kinetic sputtering, tends to be suppressed for very
small grains due to the Coulomb drag, they might also be disrupted by Coulomb
explosion. Removal of small grains and/or survival of large grains may explain
the lack of a silicate 10-$\mu$m emission feature in polar dust emission.

prove two new Marstrand-type projection theorems, concerning subsets of
Euclidean space which are not assumed to be Borel, or even analytic. One of the
theorems states that if $K \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is any set with equal
Hausdorff and packing dimensions, then $$ \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \pi_{e}(K) =
\min\{\dim_{\mathrm{H}} K,1\} $$ for almost every $e \in S^{n - 1}$. Here
$\pi_{e}$ stands for orthogonal projection to $\mathrm{span}(e)$.
  The primary purpose of this paper is to present proofs for Lutz and Stull's
projection theorems which do not refer to information theoretic concepts.
Instead, they will rely on combinatorial-geometric arguments, such as
discretised versions of Kaufman's ""potential theoretic"" method, the pigeonhole
principle, and a lemma of Katz and Tao. A secondary purpose is to slightly
generalise Lutz and Stull's theorems: the versions in this paper apply to
orthogonal projections to $m$-planes in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, for all $0 < m < n$.

same launcher as ESA's ARIEL mission. Comet Interceptor's science payload
consists of three spacecraft, a primary spacecraft that will carry two smaller
probes to be released at the target. The three spacecraft will fly-by the
target along different chords, providing multiple simultaneous perspectives of
the comet nucleus and its environment. Each of the spacecraft will be equipped
with different but complementary instrument suites designed to study the far
and near coma environment and surface of a comet or interstellar object (ISO).
The primary spacecraft will perform a fly-by at ~1000 km from the target. The
two smaller probes will travel deeper into the coma, closer to the nucleus. The
mission is being designed and launched without a specific comet designated as
its main target. Comet Interceptor will travel to the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian
point with ARIEL and wait in hibernation until a suitable long-period comet
(LPC) is found that will come close enough to the Sun for the spacecraft to
maneuver to an encounter trajectory. To prepare for all eventualities, the
science team has assembled a preliminary set of backup targets from the known
Jupiter family comets, where a suitable fly-by trajectory can be achieved
during the nominal mission timeline (including the possibility of some launch
delay). To better prioritize this list, we are releasing our potential backup
targets in order to solicit the planetary community's help with observations of
these objects over future apparitions and to encourage publication of archival
data on these objects.

with $n\ge rk$ and $2\le s\le r$, the $r$-uniform general Kneser hypergraph
$\mbox{KG}^r_s(n,k)$, has all $k$-subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ as the vertex set
and all multi-sets $\{A_1,\dots, A_r\}$ of $k$-subsets with $s$-wise empty
intersections as the edge set. The case $r=s=2$, was considers by Kneser
\cite{K} in 1955, where he conjectured that its chromatic number is $n-2(k-1)$.
This was finally proved by Lov\'asz \cite{L} in 1978. The case $r>2$ and $s=2$,
was considered by Erd\""os in 1973, and he conjectured that its chromatic number
is $\left\lceil\frac{n-r(k-1)}{r-1}\right\rceil$. This conjecture was proved by
Alon, Frankl and Lov\'asz \cite{AFL} in 1986. The case where $s>2$, was
considered by Sarkaria \cite{S} in 1990, where he claimed to prove a lower
bound for its chromatic number which generalized all previous results.
Unfortunately, an error was found by Lange and Ziegler \cite{Z'} in 2006 in the
induction method of Sarkaria on the number of prime factors of $r$, and
Sarkaria's proof only worked when $s$ is less than the smallest prime factor of
$r$ or $s=2$. In this paper, by applying the $\mathbb Z_p$-Tucker lemma of
Ziegler \cite{Z} and Meunier \cite{M}, we finally prove the general Erd\""{o}s

also provide another proof of a special case of this result, using methods

The radius of planet b lies in the transition region between rocky and gaseous
planets, but its density is consistent with a rocky composition. Its semimajor
axis and the corresponding photoevaporation levels to which the planet has been
exposed might explain its measured density today. In contrast, the densities

singularity of this system, which orbits a slightly evolved star that is just

decided to make a new Chinese wordnet called Multi-Fusion Chinese Wordnet (MCW)
to make up those shortcomings. The key idea is to extend the SEW with the help
of Oxford bilingual dictionary and Xinhua bilingual dictionary, and then
correct it. More specifically, we used machine learning and manual adjustment
in our corrections. Two standards were formulated to help our work. We
conducted experiments on three tasks including relatedness calculation, word
similarity and word sense disambiguation for the comparison of lemma's
accuracy, at the same time, coverage also was compared. The results indicate
that MCW can benefit from coverage and accuracy via our method. However, it
still has room for improvement, especially with lemmas. In the future, we will
continue to enhance the accuracy of MCW and expand the concepts in it.

stellar activity of this M dwarf also hampers significantly the derivation of
the planetary parameters. With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements
obtained since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and
resolve the alias issues. We use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian

derive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity
with a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters
further we apply a stability analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits. We
resolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star with periods of $2.02$ d,
$3.06$ d, and $4.66$ d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational
signal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the
eccentricity of the innermost planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar
rotational period to be close to $68$ d. From the absence of a transit event
with TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of $i_\mathrm{max} =
87.43$ deg. YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing
hindered the determination of the orbital periods of exoplanets. Additionally,
stellar activity influences the derivation of planetary parameters and modeling
them correctly is important for the reliable estimation of the orbital
parameters in this specific compact system. Stability considerations then allow
additional constraints to be placed on the planetary parameters.

limitations motivated our approach: on the one hand, the inability to determine

initially motivates one to approximating it) and, on the other hand, the
existence of uncertainties associated with the numerical approximation
$u^{(k)}_{h}$. We thus fill this knowledge gap by considering the exact

random variables. By way of consequence, any function where $u$ and

method, topology identification is done jointly based on both fundamental

done by formulating and then solving a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)

communication to improve the transmission capacity of a single optical fibre.
However, the number of channels that can be multiplexed is limited by the
crosstalks between channels, and the multiplexing is only applied to few-mode
or multi-core fibres. Here, we propose a high-spatial-density channel
multiplexing framework employing deep learning for standard multimode fibres
(MMF). We present a proof-of-concept experimental system, consisting of a
single light source, a single digital-micromirror-device modulator, a single
detection camera, and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to demonstrate
up to 400-channel simultaneous data transmission with accuracy close to 100%
over MMFs of different types, diameters and lengths. A novel scalable
semi-supervised learning model is proposed to adapt the CNN to the time-varying
MMF information channels in real-time, to overcome the environmental changes
such as temperature variations and vibrations, and to reconstruct the input
data from complex crosstalks among hundreds of channels. This deep-learning
based approach is promising to maximize the use of the spatial dimension of
MMFs, and to break the present number-of-channel limit in space-division
multiplexing for future high-capacity MMF transmission data links.

systems is evaluated in a wide parameter range, from the very weakly coupled
gaseous state to the strongly coupled fluid at the crystallization point (Yukwa
melt). This allows us to quantify how shear rigidity develops with increasing
coupling and inter-particle correlations. The radial distribution functions
(RDFs) needed to calculate the excess shear modulus have been obtained from
extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD results demonstrate that
fluid RDFs appear quasi-universal on the curves parallel to the melting line of
a Yukawa solid, in accordance with the isomorph theory of Roskilde-simple
systems. This quasi-universality, allows to simplify considerably calculations
of quantities involving integrals of the RDF (elastic moduli represent just one
relevant example). The calculated reduced shear modulus grows linearly with the
coupling parameter at weak coupling and approaches a quasi-constant asymptote
at strong coupling. The asymptotic value at strong coupling is in reasonably
good agreement with the existing theoretical approximation.

stochastic rewards, where edges are associated with success probabilities and a
match succeeds with the probability of the corresponding edge. It is one of the
few online matching problems that have defied the randomized online primal dual
framework by Devanur, Jain, and Kleinberg (SODA 2013) thus far. This paper
unlocks the power of randomized online primal dual in online matching with
stochastic rewards by employing the configuration linear program rather than
the standard matching linear program used in previous works. Our main result is
a 0.572 competitive algorithm for the case of vanishing and unequal
probabilities, improving the best previous bound of 0.534 by Mehta, Waggoner,
and Zadimoghaddam (SODA 2015) and, in fact, is even better than the best
previous bound of 0.567 by Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012) for the more
restricted case of vanishing and equal probabilities. For vanishing and equal
probabilities, we get a better competitive ratio of 0.576. Our results further
generalize to the vertex-weighted case due to the intrinsic robustness of the
randomized online primal dual analysis.

uncertain since it is not only governed by the protoplanetary disc structure

processes after planet formation as well as possible capture of planets not

100mas. This paper introduces our NACO Imaging Survey for Planets around Young

development of versatile knowledge-infused model. Taking RoBERTa as the
backbone model, K-Adapter has a neural adapter for each kind of infused
knowledge, like a plug-in connected to RoBERTa. There is no information flow
between different adapters, thus multiple adapters can be efficiently trained
in a distributed way. As a case study, we inject two kinds of knowledge in this
work, including (1) factual knowledge obtained from automatically aligned
text-triplets on Wikipedia and Wikidata and (2) linguistic knowledge obtained
via dependency parsing. Results on three knowledge-driven tasks, including
relation classification, entity typing, and question answering, demonstrate
that each adapter improves the performance and the combination of both adapters
brings further improvements. Further analysis indicates that K-Adapter captures
versatile knowledge than RoBERTa.

the lack of understanding of the decision boundary and decision regions of deep

decision boundary and how this margin evolves over the training of a deep
neural network. By conducting experiments on MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, and
CIFAR-10, we observe that the decision boundary moves closer to natural images
over training. This phenomenon even remains intact in the late epochs of

rates. On the other hand, adversarial training appears to have the potential to
prevent this undesired convergence of the decision boundary.

perturbative reheating. We find that the decay of the inflaton does not alter
the instability structure until the fluid dominates the universe content. As an
application, we discuss the impact of the inflaton decay on the production of
primordial black holes from the instability. We stress the difference between

allowed the theory of general relativity to be tested in a previously unstudied

measurable effect associated with this aspect of the theory is the nonlinear GW
memory effect. The GW memory effect is characterized by its effect on freely
falling observers: the proper distance between their locations differs before
and after a burst of GWs passes by their locations. Gravitational-wave
interferometers, like the LIGO and Virgo detectors, can measure features of
this effect from a single BBH merger, but previous work has shown that it will
require an event that is significantly more massive and closer than any
previously detected GW event. Finding evidence for the GW memory effect within
the entire population of BBH mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo is more likely
to occur sooner. A prior study has shown that the GW memory effect could be
detected in a population of BBHs consisting of binaries like the first GW150914
event after roughly one-hundred events. In this paper, we compute forecasts of
the time it will take the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors (when the detectors
are operating at their design sensitivities) to find evidence for the GW memory
effect in a population of BBHs that is consistent with the measured population
of events in the first two observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We find that
after five years of data collected by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors the
signal-to-noise ratio for the nonlinear GW memory effect in the population will
be about three (near a previously used threshold for detection). We point out

Synchronous Machines, combining a torque/current controller and an observer for

motivated by the need of an appropriate signal injection technique, in order to
guarantee full state observability. Neither the typical constant or
slowly-varying speed assumptions, nor a priori mechanical model information are
used in the observer design. Instead, the rotor speed is modeled as an unknown
input disturbance with constant (unknown) sign and uniformly non-zero

Because of these features, we refer to this strategy as a sensorless
controller-observer with no mechanical model. Employing a gradient descent
resistance/back-EMF estimation, combined with the unit circle formalism to
describe the rotor position, we rigorously prove regional practical asymptotic
stability of the overall structure, with a domain of attraction that can be

paper argues that also divergence-free virtual element methods (VEM) on
polygonal meshes are not really pressure-robust as long as the right-hand side
is not discretised in a careful manner. To be able to evaluate the right-hand
side for the test functions, some explicit interpolation of the virtual test
functions is needed that can be evaluated pointwise everywhere. The standard
discretisation via an $L^2$-best approximation does not preserve the divergence
and so destroys the orthogonality between divergence-free test functions and
possibly eminent gradient forces in the right-hand side. To repair this
orthogonality and restore pressure-robustness another divergence-preserving
reconstruction is suggested based on Raviart-Thomas approximations on local
subtriangulations of the polygons. All findings are proven theoretically and
are demonstrated numerically in two dimensions. The construction is also
interesting for hybrid high-order methods on polygonal or polyhedral meshes.

requires non-gradient optimizers to solve highly complicated problems. However,
with hundreds of design variables or more involved, solving such problems would
require millions of Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations whose
computational cost is huge and impractical. Here we report Self-directed Online
Learning Optimization (SOLO) which integrates Deep Neural Network (DNN) with
FEM calculations. A DNN learns and substitutes the objective as a function of
design variables. A small number of training data is generated dynamically
based on the DNN's prediction of the optimum. The DNN adapts to the new
training data and gives better prediction in the region of interest until
convergence. The optimum predicted by the DNN is proved to converge to the true
global optimum through iterations. Our algorithm was tested by four types of
problems including compliance minimization, fluid-structure optimization, heat
transfer enhancement and truss optimization. It reduced the computational time
by 2 ~ 5 orders of magnitude compared with directly using heuristic methods,
and outperformed all state-of-the-art algorithms tested in our experiments.
This approach enables solving large multi-dimensional optimization problems.

market and regulatory uncertainty, namely a sliding premium with cap and floor
and a minimum price guarantee. Regulatory uncertainty is modeled with a Poisson
process, whereby a jump event may reduce the tariff before the signature of the
contract. Using a semi-analytical real options framework, we derive the project
value, the optimal investment threshold, and the value of the investment
opportunity for these schemes. Taking into consideration the optimal investment
threshold, we also compare the two aforementioned FITs with the fixed-price FIT
and the fixed-premium FIT, which are policy schemes that have been extensively
studied in the literature. Our results show that increasing the likelihood of a
jump event lowers the investment threshold for all the schemes; moreover, the
investment threshold also decreases when the tariff reduction increases. We
also compare the four schemes in terms of the corresponding optimal investment
thresholds. For example, we find that the investment threshold of the sliding
premium is lower than the minimum price guarantee. This result suggests that
the first regime is a better policy than the latter because it accelerates the
investment while avoiding excessive earnings to producers.

systems induces a significant cost for maintenance and operation. A technique
is required to reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the
degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we present an
approach for inferring the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a
city based on coarse-grained observations. This task exhibits two challenges:
the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the
complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a model
entitled UrbanFM which consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to
generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs that uses a
feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a
general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the
influence of different external factors. This structure provides outstanding
effectiveness and efficiency for small scale upsampling. However, the
single-pass upsampling used by UrbanFM is insufficient at higher upscaling
rates. Therefore, we further present UrbanPy, a cascading model for progressive
inference of fine-grained urban flows by decomposing the original tasks into
multiple subtasks. Compared to UrbanFM, such an enhanced structure demonstrates
favorable performance for larger-scale inference tasks.

the sheared system, and compute correlation functions of the velocity, the
particle density, the nematic order parameter, and the particle angular

shown to be short ranged both below and above jamming. We compare a system of
size-bidisperse particles with a system of size-monodisperse particles, and
argue how differences in spatial order as the packing increases leads to
differences in the global nematic order parameter. We consider the effect of

the shearing acts to destroy the order, leading to the same steady-state

specified symbolic scenario combined with a previous music context. We add
manual labeled vectors denoting external music quality in terms of chord
function that provides a low dimensional representation of the harmonic tension
and resolution. Our model is capable of generating long melodies by regarding
8-beat note sequences as basic units, and shares consistent rhythm pattern
structure with another specific song. The model contains two stages and
requires separate training where the first stage adopts a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE) to build a bijection between note sequences and
their latent representations, and the second stage adopts long short-term
memory networks (LSTM) with structural conditions to continue writing future
melodies. We further exploit the disentanglement technique via C-VAE to allow
melody generation based on pitch contour information separately from
conditioning on rhythm patterns. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model using
quantitative analysis of rhythm and the subjective listening study. Results
show that the music generated by our model tends to have salient repetition
structures, rich motives, and stable rhythm patterns. The ability to generate
longer and more structural phrases from disentangled representations combined

an isotropic dielectric material that is periodically nonhomogeneous in the
direction normal to the interface. The special case was considered in which the
propagation matrix for material $A$ is non-diagonalizable because the
corresponding surface wave-named the Dyakonov-Tamm-Voigt (DTV) surface wave-has
unusual localization characteristics. The decay of the DTV surface wave is
given by the product of a linear function and an exponential function of
distance from the interface in material $A$; in contrast, the fields of
conventional DT surface waves decay only exponentially with distance from the
interface. Numerical studies revealed that multiple DT surface waves can exist
for a fixed propagation direction in the interface plane, depending upon the
constitutive parameters of materials $A$ and $B$. When regarded as functions of
the angle of propagation in the interface plane, the multiple DT surface-wave
solutions can be organized as continuous branches. A larger number of DT
solution branches exist when the degree of anisotropy of material $A$ is
greater. If $\chi = 0^\circ$ then a solitary DTV solution exists for a unique
propagation direction on each DT branch solution. If $\chi > 0^\circ$, then no
DTV solutions exist. As the degree of nonhomogeneity of material $B$ decreases,
the number of DT solution branches decreases.

sensory information; which in turn likely affect learning rates and
performance. This paper evaluates the role of tactile information on autonomous
learning of manipulation with a simulated 3-finger tendon-driven hand. We
compare the ability of the same learning algorithm (Proximal Policy
Optimization, PPO) to learn two manipulation tasks (rolling a ball about the
horizontal axis with and without rotational stiffness) with three levels of
tactile sensing: no sensing, 1D normal force, and 3D force vector.
Surprisingly, and contrary to recent work on manipulation, adding 1D
force-sensing did not always improve learning rates compared to no
sensing---likely due to whether or not normal force is relevant to the task.
Nonetheless, even though 3D force-sensing increases the dimensionality of the
sensory input---which would in general hamper algorithm convergence---it
resulted in faster learning rates and better performance. We conclude that, in
general, sensory input is useful to learning only when it is relevant to the
task---as is the case of 3D force-sensing for in-hand manipulation against
gravity. Moreover, the utility of 3D force-sensing can even offset the added
computational cost of learning with higher-dimensional sensory input.

possible gauge symmetries namely ${L_e-L_\mu}$, ${L_e-L_\tau}$, and
${L_\mu-L_\tau}$. Of these, ${L_e-L_\mu}$ and ${L_e-L_\tau}$ forces can mediate
between the Sun and the planets and change the perihelion precession of
planetary orbits. It is well known that a deviation from the $1/r^2$ Newtonian
force can give rise to a perihelion advancement in the planetary orbit, for
instance, as in the well known case of Einstein's gravity which was tested from
the observation of the perihelion advancement of the Mercury. We consider the
long range Yukawa potential which arises between the Sun and the planets if the
mass of the gauge boson is $M_{Z^{\prime}}\leq \mathcal{O}(10^{-19})\rm {eV}$.
We derive the formula of perihelion advancement for Yukawa type fifth force due
to the mediation of such $U(1)_{L_e-L_{\mu,\tau}}$ gauge bosons. The perihelion
advancement for Yukawa potential is proportional to the square of the semi
major axis of the orbit for small $M_{Z^{\prime}}$, unlike GR, where it is
largest for the nearest planet. However for higher values of $M_{Z^{\prime}}$,
an exponential suppression of the perihelion advancement occurs. We take the
observational limits for all planets for which the perihelion advancement is
measured and we obtain the upper bound on the gauge boson coupling $g$ for all
the planets. The Mars gives the stronger bound on $g$ for the mass range $\leq
10^{-19}\rm{eV}$ and we obtain the exclusion plot. This mass range of gauge
boson can be a possible candidate of fuzzy dark matter whose effect can
therefore be observed in the precession measurement of the planetary orbits.

depends on the local Peclet number Pe and follows a universal scaling law
<Vol>_area~Pe^(3/4). Moreover, the probability distribution function of the
droplet volume strongly depends on the local Pe as well, regardless of the flow

a symmetric Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) map, each generic orbit of the
Lyness map lies on a curve of genus one, and corresponds to a sequence of
points on an elliptic curve which is one of the fibres in a pencil of
biquadratic curves in the plane. Here we present a version of the elliptic
curve method (ECM) for integer factorization, which is based on iteration of
the Lyness map with a particular choice of initial data. More precisely, we
give an algorithm for scalar multiplication of a point on an elliptic curve,
which is represented by one of the curves in the Lyness pencil. In order to
avoid field inversion, and require only field multiplication (${\bf M}$),
squaring (${\bf S}$) and addition, projective coordinates in $\mathbb{P}^1
\times \mathbb{P}^1$ are used. Neglecting multiplication by curve constants
(assumed small), each addition of the chosen point uses $2{\bf M}$, while each
doubling step requires $15{\bf M}$. We further show that the doubling step can
be implemented efficiently in parallel with four processors, dropping the
effective cost to $4{\bf M}$. Our scalar multiplication algorithm should
require, on average, roughly twice as many multiplications per bit as the
fastest state of the art methods using twisted Edwards curves with small
constants, but it can be applied to any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$,

framework to fully analyze the collected probe requests to extract three types
of patterns related to crowd behaviors in a large social event, with the help
of statistics, visualization, and unsupervised machine learning. First,
trajectories of the mobile devices are extracted from probe requests and
analyzed to reveal the spatial patterns of the crowds' movement. Hierarchical
agglomerative clustering is adopted to find the interconnections between
different locations. Next, k-means and k-shape clustering algorithms are
applied to extract temporal visiting patterns of the crowds by days and
locations, respectively. Finally, by combining with time, trajectories are
transformed into spatiotemporal patterns, which reveal how trajectory duration
changes over the length and how the overall trends of crowd movement change
over time. The proposed data analysis framework is fully demonstrated using
real-world data collected in a large social event. Results show that one can

topologically nontrivial/trivial semimetals have been theoretically proposed,
but experimentally it is unclear which mechanism is responsible in a particular
sample. In this article, by the combination of band structure calculations,
numerical simulations of magnetoresistance (MR), Hall resistivity and de
Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements, we studied the MR anisotropy
of SiP$_{2}$ which is verified to be a topologically trivial, incomplete
compensation semimetal. It was found that as magnetic field, $H$, is applied
along the $a$ axis, the MR exhibits an unsaturated nearly linear $H$
dependence, which was argued to arise from incomplete carriers compensation.
For the $H$ $\parallel$ [101] orientation, an unsaturated nearly quadratic $H$
dependence of MR up to 5.88 $\times$ 10$^{4}$$\%$ (at 1.8 K, 31.2 T) and
field-induced up-turn behavior in resistivity were observed, which was
suggested due to the existence of hole open orbits extending along the $k_{x}$
direction. Good agreement of the experimental results with the simulations
based on the calculated Fermi surface (FS) indicates that the topology of FS
plays an important role in its MR.

place (P&P) process of surface mount technology (SMT). It does not usually
attract much attention, because the shift is considered to be negligibly small
and the following self-alignment effect in the solder paste reflow soldering
process could also make it up. However, with the decreasing size of the
electronic components and the increasing demand for the low defective rate of
PCB, the component shift in P&P process is becoming more and more important in
quality control of SMT industries. Though a few papers are related to the
component shift in P&P process, there is no earlier research using the data
from the real production line. In this paper, we study two basic and important
issues: the behavior of the component shift in P&P process and the contributing
factors to it. Several statistical methods are used to explore the behavior
component shift based on the data from a complete state-of-the-art SMT assembly
line. Main effects and regression analysis are implemented to pinpoint the
contributing factors. In order to investigate the issues comprehensively, six
types of electronic components and multiple potential factors are considered in
this work, e.g., solder paste properties (position, volume, area, height),
designed position of the component, placement pressure. The results indicate
that component shift cannot be ignored. Also, the position of solder paste,
designed position of component and component type are the top three most
important factors to study the component shifts in P&P process.

Existing research on large-scale ideation systems has investigated this
phenomenon through aspects of timing, inspiration similarity and inspiration
integration. However, these approaches do not address people's individual
preferences. In the research presented, we aim to address this lack with
regards to inspirations. In a first step, we conducted a co-located
brainstorming study with 15 participants, which allowed us to differentiate two
types of ideators: Inspiration seekers and inspiration avoiders. These insights
informed the study design of the second step, where we propose a user model for
classifying people depending on their ideator types, which was translated into
a rule-based and a random forest-based classifier. We evaluated the validity of
our user model by conducting an online experiment with 380 participants. The
results confirmed our proposed ideator types, showing that, while seekers
benefit from the availability of inspiration, avoiders were influenced
negatively. The random forest classifier enabled us to differentiate people
with a 73 \% accuracy after only three minutes of ideation. These insights show
that the proposed ideator types are a promising user model for large-scale
ideation. In future work, this distinction may help to design more personalized
large-scale ideation systems that recommend inspirations adaptively.

density with tangential pressure while the second postulate is to assume a
specific form of one of the two unknown functions that appear in the
non-diagonal tetrad field. Among many things presented in this study, we
investigate the static stability specification. We also study the

conditions of energy. The causality constraints with the adiabatic index in

of central potentials. These are of Kepler-Coulomb and harmonic oscillator
type. Volker Perlick recently designed new static spherically symmetric
(Bertrand) spacetimes obeying Einstein's equations and supporting closed
orbits. In this work we demonstrate that the topology and geometry of these
spacetimes permits us to solve quantum many-body problem for any atom of
periodic system exactly. The computations of spectrum for any atom are
analogous to that for hydrogen atom. Initially, the exact solution of the
Schr\""odinger equation for any multielectron atom (without reference to
Bertrand theorem) was obtained by Tietz in 1956. We recalculated Tietz results
by applying the methodology consistent with new (different from that developed
by Fock in 1936) way of solving Schr\""odinger's equation for hydrogen atom. By
using this new methodology it had become possible to demonstrate that the
Tietz-type Schr\""odinger's equation is in fact describing the quantum motion in
Bertrand spacetimes. As a bonus, we solved analytically the L\""owdin's
challenge problem. Obtained solution is not universal though since there are
exceptions of the Madelung rule in transition metals and among lanthanides and
actinides. Quantum mechanically these exceptions as well as the rule itself are
treated thus far with help of relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations. The
obtained results do not describe the exceptions in detail yet. However, studies
outlined in this paper indicate that developed methods are capable of
describing exceptions as well. The paper ends with some remarks about
usefulness of problems of atomic physics for development of quantum mechanics,
