  Data",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The continuous expansion of the urban traffic sensing infrastructure has led
to a surge in the volume of widely available road related data. Consequently,
increasing effort is being dedicated to the creation of intelligent
transportation systems, where decisions on issues ranging from city-wide road
maintenance planning to improving the commuting experience are informed by
computational models of urban traffic instead of being left entirely to humans.
The automation of traffic management has received substantial attention from
the research community, however, most approaches target highways, produce
predictions valid for a limited time window or require expensive retraining of
available models in order to accurately forecast traffic at a new location. In
this article, we propose a novel and accurate traffic flow prediction method
based on symbolic regression enhanced with a lag operator. Our approach
produces robust models suitable for the intricacies of urban roads, much more
difficult to predict than highways. Additionally, there is no need to retrain
the model for a period of up to 9 weeks. Furthermore, the proposed method
generates models that are transferable to other segments of the road network,
similar to, yet geographically distinct from the ones they were initially
trained on. We demonstrate the achievement of these claims by conducting
extensive experiments on data collected from the Darmstadt urban
infrastructure.

symbolic and neural approaches, as it is often argued that the strengths and
weaknesses of these approaches are complementary. One recent trend in the
literature are weakly supervised learning techniques that employ operators from
fuzzy logics. In particular, these use prior background knowledge described in
such logics to help the training of a neural network from unlabeled and noisy
data. By interpreting logical symbols using neural networks, this background
knowledge can be added to regular loss functions, hence making reasoning a part
of learning. We study, both formally and empirically, how a large collection of
logical operators from the fuzzy logic literature behave in a differentiable
learning setting. We find that many of these operators, including some of the
most well-known, are highly unsuitable in this setting. A further finding
concerns the treatment of implication in these fuzzy logics, and shows a strong
imbalance between gradients driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the
implication. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of fuzzy implications
(called sigmoidal implications) to tackle this phenomenon. Finally, we
empirically show that it is possible to use Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for
semi-supervised learning, and compare how different operators behave in
practice. We find that, to achieve the largest performance improvement over a
supervised baseline, we have to resort to non-standard combinations of logical
operators which perform well in learning, but no longer satisfy the usual

the dominant channel. However, the adopted description of the electronic
structure of the biradical (i.e., CH$_3$/HCO) system was inadequate (without
the broken-symmetry (BS) approach). In this work, we revisit the original
results by means of BS-DFT both in gas phase and with one water molecule
simulating the role of the ice. Results indicate that adoption of BS-DFT is
mandatory to describe properly biradical systems. In the presence of the single

In contrast, CH$_3$CHO formation is found to be barrierless. However, direct H
transfer from HCO to CH$_3$ to give CO and CH$_4$ presents a very low energy

accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are
well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple
parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we
model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive
deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a
conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of
autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the
future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional

short-range when associated with cell-to-cell contact sites. Mathematical
studies of long-range interactions in-volve models based on differential
equations while short-range interactions are modelled using discrete type

formation of patterns due to short-range interactions. Namely, we use von
Neumann cellular automata represented by a finite set of lattices whose states
evolve according to transition rules. Lattices can be considered as
representing biological cells (which, in the simplest case, can only be in one

essentially from helioseismic analyses of frequency splittings of resonant

internal solar rotation rate using the perturbation of the shape of the
acoustic waves. For this purpose, we extend a global helioseismic approach
developed previously for the investigation of the meridional flow
\cite{schad11, schad12, schad13} to work on the components of the differential
rotation. We discuss the effect of rotation on mode eigenfunctions and thereon
based observables. Based on a numerical study using a simulated rotation rate
profile we tailor an inversion approach and also consider the case of the
presence of an additional meridional flow. This inversion approach is then
applied to data from the MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar
Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)) instrument and the HMI (Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)) instrument. In the
end, rotation rate profiles estimated from eigenfunction perturbation and
frequency splittings are compared.
  The rotation rate profiles from the two different approaches are
qualitatively in good agreement, especially for the MDI data. Significant
differences are obtained at high latitudes $> 50^{\circ}$ and near the
subsurface. The result from HMI data shows larger discrepancies between the
different methods. We find that the two global helioseismic approaches provide
complementary methods for measuring solar rotation. Comparing the results from

solution for improving the spectrum efficiency of next-generation wireless
networks. In this paper, the performance of a p-persistent slotted ALOHA system
in support of NOMA transmissions is investigated. Specifically, wireless users
can choose to use high or low power for data transmissions with certain
probabilities. To achieve the maximum network throughput, an analytical
framework is developed to analyze the successful transmission probability of
NOMA and long term average throughput of users involved in the non-orthogonal
transmissions. The feasible region of the maximum number of concurrent users
using high and low power to ensure successful NOMA transmissions are
quantified. Based on the analysis, an algorithm is proposed to find the optimal
transmission probabilities for users to choose high and low power to achieve
the maximum system throughput. In addition, the impact of power settings on the
network performance is further investigated. Simulations are conducted to
validate the analysis.

properties which are not seen in small dimensions and in asymptotical
considerations, for very large $n$. One of these properties can be termed `do
not try to cover the vertices' as the vertices of the cube and their close
neighbourhoods are very hard to cover and for large $d$ there are far too many
of them. We clearly demonstrate that, contrary to a common belief, placing
balls at points which form a low-discrepancy sequence in the cube, makes for a
very inefficient covering scheme. For a family of random coverings, we are able
to provide very accurate approximations to the coverage probability. We then
extend our results to the problems of coverage of a cube by smaller cubes and
quantization, the latter being also referred to as facility location. Along

multiple access (C-NOMA) in a cellular downlink system. The system model
consists of a base station (BS) serving multiple users, where users with good
channel quality can assist the transmissions between the BS and users with poor
channel quality through either half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD)
device-to-device (D2D) communications. We formulate and solve a novel
optimization problem that jointly determines the optimal D2D user pairing and
the optimal power control scheme, where the objective is maximizing the
achievable sum rate of the whole system while guaranteeing a certain quality of
service (QoS) for all users. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer
non-linear program (MINLP) which is generally NPhard. To overcome this issue,
we reconstruct the original problem into a bi-level optimization problem that
can be decomposed into two sub-problems to be solved independently. The outer
problem is a linear assignment problem which can be efficiently handled by the
well-known Hungarian method. The inner problem is still a non-convex
optimization problem for which finding the optimal solution is challenging.
However, we derive the optimal power control policies for both the HD and the
FD schemes in closedform expressions, which makes the computational complexity
of the inner problems polynomial for every possible pairing configurations.
These findings solve ultimately the original MILNP in a timely manner that
makes it suitable for real-time and low latency applications. Our simulation
results show that the proposed framework outperforms a variety of proposed
schemes in the literature and that it can obtain the optimal pairing and power
control policies for a network with 100 users in a negligible computational

scheme for measuring the axion-induced ellipticity signal during the

Consequently, the resonant enhancement of vacuum birefringence gives rise to a
large ellipticity signal. This signal enhancement can be applied in order to
discriminate between the axion contribution to LBL scattering and the standard
model contribution due to electron-positron pairs. The sensitivity of the
scheme is studied for experimentally feasible probe light sources and ultrahigh

to probe the QCD axion in the mass range $10^{-2} \textrm{eV} \lesssim m_{a}

metadata performance. We demonstrate how a combination of two technologies,
Singularity and SquashFS, can help developers, integrators, architects, and

minimal performance limitations. The proposed integration enables more

the approach does not require administrative privileges on the target system.

sites for the Fermi acceleration of relativistic particles at standing shock
waves in the accretion disc. Previous work has demonstrated that the
shock-acceleration process can be efficient enough to power the observed,
strong outflows in radio-loud active galaxies such as M87. However, the
dynamical effect (back-reaction) on the flow, exerted by the pressure of the
relativistic particles, has not been previously considered, and this effect can
have a significant influence on the disc structure. We reexamine the problem by
developing a new, two-fluid model for the structure of the accretion disc that
includes the dynamical effect of the relativistic particle pressure, combined
with the pressure of the background (thermal) gas. The new model is analogous
to the two-fluid model of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova-driven shock
waves. As part of the model, we also develop a new set of shock jump
conditions, which are solved along with the hydrodynamic conservation equations
to determine the structure of the accretion disc. The solutions include the
formation of a mildly relativistic outflow (jet) at the shock radius, driven by
the relativistic particles accelerated in the disc. One of our main conclusions
is that in the context of the new two-fluid accretion model, global smooth
(shock-free) solutions do not exist, and the disc must always contain a
standing shock wave, at least in the inviscid case considered here.

(TQD) is one form of STA. We develop and study the effects of TQD on a
single-qubit system subjected to a changing magnetic field and a general
two-qubit Heisenberg model with a time-dependent interaction strength. We
establish a quantitative relation between the work produced across the dynamics

the role played by the initial states of the work medium. We identify the
states that extremize performance under the TQD protocol. The thermodynamic
implications of STA are discussed in the end.

notion of a saddle operator. Under investigation is a highly structured
multivariate monotone inclusion problem involving a mix of set-valued,
cocoercive, and Lipschitzian monotone operators, as well as various
monotonicity-preserving operations among them. This model encompasses most
formulations found in the literature. A limitation of existing primal-dual
algorithms is that they operate in a product space that is too small to achieve
full splitting of our problem in the sense that each operator is used
individually. To circumvent this difficulty, we recast the problem as that of
finding a zero of a saddle operator that acts on a bigger space. This leads to
an algorithm of unprecedented flexibility, which achieves full splitting,
exploits the specific attributes of each operator, is asynchronous, and
requires to activate only blocks of operators at each iteration, as opposed to
activating all of them. The latter feature is of critical importance in
large-scale problems. Weak convergence of the main algorithm is established, as
well as the strong convergence of a variant. Various applications are
discussed, and instantiations of the proposed framework in the context of
variational inequalities and minimization problems are presented.

flares are produced when a relativistic proton jet originating in the core of
M87 collides with a molecular cloud (or stellar atmosphere) located less than
one parsec from the central black hole. We explore this scenario in detail here
using a self-consistent model for the acceleration of relativistic protons in a
shocked, two-fluid ADAF accretion disc. The relativistic protons accelerated in
the disc escape to power the observed jet outflows. The distribution function
for the jet protons is used to compute the TeV emission produced when the jet
collides with a cloud or stellar atmosphere. The simulated broadband radiation
spectrum includes radio, X-ray, and GeV components generated via synchrotron,
as well as TeV emission generated via the production and decay of muons,
positrons, and electrons. The self-consistency of the model is verified by
computing the relativistic particle pressure using the distribution function,
and comparing it with the relativistic particle pressure obtained from the
hydrodynamical model. We demonstrate that the model is able to reproduce the

particle in a single-wall-bounded linear shear flow are examined via numerical
computation. The effects of shear rate are isolated from those of slip by
setting the particle velocity equal to the local fluid velocity (zero slip),
and examining the resulting hydrodynamic forces as a function of separation
distance. In contrast to much of the previous numerical literature, low shear
Reynolds numbers are considered ($10^{-3} \lesssim Re_{\gamma} \lesssim
10^{-1}$). This shear rate range is relevant when dealing with particulate
flows within small channels, for example particle migration in microfluidic
devices being used or developed for the biotech industry. We demonstrate a
strong dependence of both the lift and drag forces on shear rate. Building on
previous theoretical $Re_{\gamma} \ll 1$ studies, a wall-shear based lift
correlation is proposed that is applicable when the wall lies both within the
inner and outer regions of the disturbed flow. Similarly, we validate an
improved drag correlation that includes higher order terms in wall separation
distance that more accurately captures the drag force when the particle is
close to, but not touching, the wall. Application of the new correlations shows
that the examined shear based lift force is as important as the previously
examined slip based lift force, highlighting the need to account for shear when
predicting the near-wall movement of neutrally-buoyant particles.

mean of a possibly non-stationary time series and at (2) identifying regions
where the mean exhibits a piecewise constant behavior. In many applications
however, it is more reasonable to assume that the mean changes gradually in a
smooth way. Those gradual changes may either be non-relevant (i.e., small), or
relevant for a specific problem at hand, and the present paper presents
statistical methodology to detect the latter. More precisely, we consider the
common nonparametric regression model $X_{i} = \mu (i/n) + \varepsilon_{i}$
with possibly non-stationary errors and propose a test for the null hypothesis
that the maximum absolute deviation of the regression function $\mu$ from a
functional $g (\mu )$ (such as the value $\mu (0)$ or the integral
$\int_{0}^{1} \mu (t) dt$) is smaller than a given threshold on a given
interval $[x_{0},x_{1}] \subseteq [0,1]$. A test for this type of hypotheses is
developed using an appropriate estimator, say $\hat d_{\infty, n}$, for the
maximum deviation $ d_{\infty}= \sup_{t \in [x_{0},x_{1}]} |\mu (t) - g( \mu)
|$. We derive the limiting distribution of an appropriately standardized
version of $\hat d_{\infty,n}$, where the standardization depends on the
Lebesgue measure of the set of extremal points of the function

of its edges must satisfy two linear constraints in order for it to close up.
If we also require unit perimeter, our vectors of $n$ edge lengths form a
convex polytope of dimension $n-3$, each facet of which consists of those
$n$-gons in which the length of a particular edge has fallen to zero. Bavard
and Ghys require unit area instead, which gives them a hyperbolic polytope.
Those two polytopes are combinatorially equivalent, so either is fine for our
purposes.
  Such a fixed-angles polytope is combinatorially richer when the angles are
well balanced. We say that fixed external angles are ""majority dominant"" when
every consecutive string of more than half of them sums to more than $\pi$.
When $n$ is odd, we show that the fixed-angles polytope for any
majority-dominant angles is dual to the cyclic polytope $C_{n-3}(n)$. To extend
that result to even $n$, we require that the angles also have ""dipole
tie-breaking"": None of the $n$ strings of length $n/2$ sums to precisely $\pi$,
and the $n/2$ that sum to more than $\pi$ overlap as much as possible, all
containing a particular angle.
  Fixing the vertex angles is uncommon, however; people more often fix the edge
lengths. That is harder, in part because fixed-lengths $n$-gons may not be
convex, but mostly because fixing the lengths constrains the angles nonlinearly
-- so the resulting moduli spaces, called ""polygon spaces"", are curved. Using
Schwarz-Christoffel maps, Kapovich and Millson show that the subset of that
polygon space in which the $n$-gons are convex and traversed counterclockwise
is homeomorphic to the fixed-angles polytope above, for those same fixed
values. Each such subset is thus a topological polytope; and it is dual cyclic
whenever the fixed lengths are majority dominant and, for even $n$, have dipole
tie-breaking.

inversion parities (21600 coupled ro-vibrational states total). Splittings
between the states of different parities, so called K-doublings, are calculated

Coriolis coupling effect in the large mass-independent isotopic enrichment of
ozone, observed in both laboratory experiments and the atmosphere of Earth. It
is found that the Coriolis effect in ozone is relatively small, as evidenced by
deviations of its rotational constants from the symmetric-top-rotor behavior,
by the magnitudes of parity splittings ({\Lambda}-doubling), and by the ratios
of ro-vibrational partition functions for asymmetric vs. symmetric ozone
molecules. It is concluded that all of these characteristics are influenced by
the isotopic masses as much as they are influenced by the overall symmetry of

photometry and selected member stars through a decontamination algorithm which

assign membership likelihoods. Previous studies of most of these objects were
based mostly on photometric information. All investigated OCs were proved to be
real stellar concentrations and relations among their parameters indicate a
general disruption scenario in which OCs tend to be more concentrated as they

relaxed structures and make them less subject to mass loss due to tidal
effects. Tidal radius tends to increase with $R_G$ in accordance with the

contributions. It is widely accepted that badges ""steer"" people's behavior
toward increasing their rate of contributions before obtaining the badge. This
paper provides a new probabilistic model of user behavior in the presence of
badges. By applying the model to data from thousands of users on the Q&A site
Stack Overflow, we find that steering is not as widely applicable as was
previously understood. Rather, the majority of users remain apathetic toward
badges, while still providing a substantial number of contributions to the
site. An interesting statistical phenomenon, termed ""Phantom Steering,""
accounts for the interaction data of these users and this may have contributed
to some previous conclusions about steering. Our results suggest that a small
population, approximately 20%, of users respond to the badge incentives.
Moreover, we conduct a qualitative survey of the users on Stack Overflow which
provides further evidence that the insights from the model reflect the true
behavior of the community. We argue that while badges might contribute toward a
suite of effective rewards in an online system, research into other aspects of
reward systems such as Stack Overflow reputation points should become a focus
of the community.

Zone is the region of the sky from which an observer would see the Earth
transit the Sun with an impact parameter of less than 0.5. This region of the
sky is geometrically unique, providing a potential way for an extraterrestrial
intelligence to discover the Solar System. The targets were nearby (7-143 pc)
and the search covered an electromagnetic frequency range of 3.95-8.00 GHz. We
used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to perform these observations with
the standard BL data recorder. We searched these data for artificial narrowband
($\sim$Hz) signals with Doppler drift rates of $\pm 20$ Hz s$^{-1}$. We found
one set of potential candidate signals on the target HIP 109656 which was then
found to be consistent with known properties of anthropogenic radio frequency
interference. We find no evidence for radio technosignatures from
extraterrestrial intelligence in our observations. The observing campaign
achieved a minimum detectable flux which would have allowed detections of
emissions that were $10^{-3}$ to $0.88$ times as powerful as the signaling
capability of the Arecibo radar transmitter, for the nearest and furthest stars
respectively. We conclude that at least $8\%$ of the systems in the restricted
Earth Transit Zone within 150 pc do not possess the type of transmitters
searched in this survey. To our knowledge, this is the first targeted search
for extraterrestrial intelligence of the restricted Earth Transit Zone. All

that users perform. Existing solutions treat data cleaning as a separate
offline process that takes place before analysis begins. Applying data cleaning
before analysis assumes a priori knowledge of the inconsistencies and the query
workload, thereby requiring effort on understanding and cleaning the data that
is unnecessary for the analysis. We propose an approach that performs
probabilistic repair of denial constraint violations on-demand, driven by the
exploratory analysis that users perform. We introduce Daisy, a system that
seamlessly integrates data cleaning into the analysis by relaxing query
results. Daisy executes analytical query-workloads over dirty data by weaving
cleaning operators into the query plan. Our evaluation shows that Daisy adapts
to the workload and outperforms traditional offline cleaning on both synthetic

  changes in notation",,,,"math.CO hep-th math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of the moment map from the Grassmannian to the hypersimplex, and
the relation between torus orbits and matroid polytopes, dates back to the
foundational 1987 work of Gelfand-Goresky-MacPherson-Serganova. On the other
hand, the amplituhedron is a very new object, defined by Arkani-Hamed-Trnka in
connection with scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
theory. In this paper we discover a striking duality between the moment map
$\mu:Gr^{\geq0}_{k+1,n}\to\Delta_{k+1,n}$ from the positive Grassmannian
$Gr^{\geq0}_{k+1,n}$ to the hypersimplex, and the amplituhedron map
$\tilde{Z}:Gr^{\geq0}_{k,n}\to\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$ from $Gr^{\geq0}_{k,n}$
to the $m=2$ amplituhedron. We consider the positroid dissections of both
objects, which informally, are subdivisions of $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ (respectively,
$\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$) into a disjoint union of images of positroid cells of
the positive Grassmannian. At first glance, $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ and
$\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$ seem very different - the former is an
$(n-1)$-dimensional polytope, while the latter is a $2k$-dimensional
non-polytopal subset of $Gr_{k,k+2}$. Nevertheless, we conjecture that
positroid dissections of $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ are in bijection with positroid
dissections of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$ via a map we call T-duality. We prove
this conjecture for the (infinite) class of BCFW dissections and give
additional experimental evidence. Moreover, we prove that the positive tropical
Grassmannian is the secondary fan for the regular positroid subdivisions of the
hypersimplex, and propose that it also controls the T-dual positroid
subdivisions of the amplituhedron. Along the way, we prove that a matroid
polytope is a positroid polytope if and only if all two-dimensional faces are
positroid polytopes. Towards the goal of generalizing T-duality for higher $m$,
we also define the momentum amplituhedron for any even $m$.

the acoustic features or to the hidden layer activations of an E2E neural
network model. The E2E ASR system is based on the joint connectionist temporal
classification and attention-based encoder-decoder architecture. M-vector and
i-vector results are compared for inserting them at different layers of the
encoder neural network using the WSJ and TED-LIUM2 ASR benchmarks. We show that
M-vectors, which do not require an auxiliary speaker embedding extraction
system at test time, achieve similar word error rates (WERs) compared to
i-vectors for single speaker utterances and significantly lower WERs for
utterances in which there are speaker changes.

accompanied by a charge transfer across the interface that provides another
avenue to modify the electronic structure and magnetotransport properties in
the ultra-thin limit. Our work lays out a general strategy of utilizing

a microresonator can be coherently extended by using bichromatic pumping: one
pump with a frequency in the anomalous dispersion regime of the microresonator
is used to generate a bright soliton microcomb while a second pump in the
normal dispersion regime both compensates the thermal effect of the
microresonator and generates a second frequency comb via cross-phase modulation
with the bright soliton, thus extending the spectrum of the microcomb.
Experimental results for different microresonators show that the mode spacings
of the two combs are synchronised, even when the combs are generated in
different mode families. Numerical simulations agree well with experimental
results and reveal that a bright optical pulse from the second pump is
passively formed in the normal dispersion regime and trapped by the bright
soliton. We believe the demonstrated technique provides an alternative way to
generate broadband microcombs and multi-coloured frequency combs that can be
useful for frequency metrology and spectroscopy. In addition, this method
enables the selective enhancement of available optical power in specific parts
of the comb spectrum.

relationship between two individuals for two reasons: 1) Proximity to the graph
(structure) 2) Similar properties of the two individuals (Homophile law).
However, studying the impact of the two approaches working together to create
new edges remains an open problem. Similarity metrics can also be divided into
two categories; Neighborhood-based and path-based. So far, the above two
theoretical approaches (proximity and homophile) have not been found together
in the neighborhood-based metrics. In this paper, we first attempt to provide a
solution to determine importance of the proximity to the graph and similar
features in the connectivity of the graphs. Then obtained weights are assigned
to both proximity and homophile. Then the best similarity metric in each
approach are obtained. Finally, the selected metric of homophily similarity and
structural similarity are combined with the obtained weights. The results of
this study were evaluated on two datasets; Zanjan University Graduate School of
Social Sciences and Pokec online Social Network. The first data set was
collected for this study and then the questionnaires and data collection
methods were filled out. Since this dataset is one of the few Iranian datasets

value. In this paper, we have been able to increase the accuracy of
Neighborhood-based similarity metric by using two proximity in graph and
homophily approaches.

ascension, using data collected by the surface detector array of the Pierre
Auger Observatory over more than 14 years. We determine the equatorial dipole
component, $\vec{d}_\perp$, through a Fourier analysis in right ascension that
includes weights for each event so as to account for the main detector-induced
systematic effects. For the energies at which the trigger efficiency of the
array is small, the ``East-West'' method is employed. Besides using the data
from the array with detectors separated by 1500 m, we also include data from
the smaller but denser sub-array of detectors with 750 m separation, which
allows us to extend the analysis down to $\sim 0.03$ EeV. The most significant
equatorial dipole amplitude obtained is that in the cumulative bin above 8~EeV,
$d_\perp=6.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$%, which is inconsistent with isotropy at the
6$\sigma$ level. In the bins below 8 EeV, we obtain 99% CL upper-bounds on
$d_\perp$ at the level of 1 to 3 percent. At energies below 1 EeV, even though
the amplitudes are not significant, the phases determined in most of the bins
are not far from the right ascension of the Galactic center, at $\alpha_{\rm
GC}=-94^\circ$, suggesting a predominantly Galactic origin for anisotropies at
these energies. The reconstructed dipole phases in the energy bins above 4 EeV
point instead to right ascensions that are almost opposite to the Galactic
center one, indicative of an extragalactic cosmic ray origin.

performance of the well-known fifth-order WENO methods. The approximation space
consists of exponential polynomials with a tension parameter that may be
optimized to fit the the specific feature of the data, yielding better results
compared to the polynomial approximation space. However, finding an optimal
tension parameter is a very important and difficult problem, indeed a topic of
active research. In this regard, this study introduces a practical approach to
determine an optimal tension parameter by taking into account the relationship
between the tension parameter and the accuracy of the exponential polynomial
interpolation under the setting of the fifth-order WENO scheme. As a result,
the proposed WENO scheme attains an improved order of accuracy (that is,
sixth-order) better than other fifth-order WENO methods without loss of
accuracy at critical points. A detailed analysis is provided to verify the
improved convergence rate. Further, we present modified nonlinear weights based
on $L^1$-norm approach along with a new global smoothness indicator. The
proposed nonlinear weights reduce numerical dissipation significantly, while
attaining better resolution in smooth regions. Some experimental results for
various benchmark test problems are presented to demonstrate the ability of the
new scheme.

natural method for describing loops in programs. However, there does often
exist a substantial cognitive distance between the recursive definition and the
simplest explanation of an algorithm even for the basic list processing
functions such as map, concat, or unique; when we explain these functions, we
seldom use recursion explicitly as we do in functional programming. For
example, map is often explained as follows: the map function takes a function
and a list and returns a list of the results of applying the function to all
the elements of the list.
  This paper advocates a new programming paradigm called pattern-match-oriented
programming for filling this gap. An essential ingredient of our method is
utilizing pattern matching for non-free data types. Pattern matching for
non-free data types features non-linear pattern matching with backtracking and
extensibility of pattern-matching algorithms. Several non-standard pattern
constructs, such as not-patterns, loop patterns, and sequential patterns, are
derived from this pattern-matching facility. Based on that result, this paper
introduces many programming techniques that replace explicit recursions with an
intuitive pattern by confining recursions inside patterns. We classify these
techniques as pattern-match-oriented programming design patterns.
  These programming techniques allow us to redefine not only the most basic
functions for list processing such as map, concat, or unique more elegantly
than the traditional functional programming style, but also more practical
mathematical algorithms and software such as a SAT solver, computer algebra
system, and database query language that we had not been able to implement

  Issue 3, Article 9","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/9",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied
these years. A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect
chaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users. Although such a
safe property improves the productivity of its users, the construction of a
safe fluent API is too complicated for the developers. The generation
algorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The
study on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent
API is a popular design in the real world.
  Inquiry: The generation of a generic fluent API has been left untackled. A
generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods
(methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in
Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe
fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm
can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use
nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of
the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to
internally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The
library developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in
their API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically
checked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream.
  Approach: We propose an algorithm to generate a generic fluent API. Our
translation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite
automaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds
information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This
information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly
binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The
identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a
particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the
following method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the
binding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA
that is naively constructed from the given grammar.
  Knowledge and Importance: Our algorithm helps library developers to develop a
generic fluent API. The ability to generate a generic fluent API is essential
to bring the safe fluent API generation to the real world since the use of type
parameters is a common technique in the library API design. By our algorithm,
the generation of a safe fluent API will be ready for practical use.
  Grounding: We implemented a generator named Protocool to demonstrate our
algorithm. We also generated several libraries using Protocool to show the
ability and the limitations of our algorithm.

programming, in which users can communicate and transfer knowledge by
interleaving executable code, output, and prose in a single rich document. A
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for
a particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may
not have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be
familiar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development
of tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is
relevant.
  Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would
like to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the
context of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then,
our main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing
and implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we
might be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the
interaction between end-users and DSLs.
  Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\'a, a mechanism for generating
notebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this
mechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language
components (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as
possible.
  Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\'a
can be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few
considerations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that
rely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with
Bacat\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language
components in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform.
  Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\'a by generating functional computational
notebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small
subset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended
version of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is
relevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them
manually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs)
that we reused from existing implementations of those languages.
  Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has
made them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data
science, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data)
science, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as
understandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper
opens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when
interacting with code and to increase DSLs adoption.

algorithms for simulating such universal quantum circuits, and characterize
them by establishing precise connections with a family of magic monotones. Our
first simulator introduces a new class of quasiprobability distributions and
connects its runtime to a generalized notion of negativity. We prove that this
algorithm has significantly improved exponential scaling compared to all prior
quasiprobability simulators for qubits. Our second simulator is a new variant
of the stabilizer-rank simulation algorithm, extended to work with mixed states
and with significantly improved runtime bounds. Our third simulator trades
precision for speed by discarding negative quasiprobabilities. We connect each
algorithm's performance to a corresponding magic monotone and, by
comprehensively characterizing the monotones, we obtain a precise understanding
of the simulation runtime and error bounds. Our analysis reveals a deep
connection between all three seemingly unrelated simulation techniques and
their associated monotones. For tensor products of single-qubit states, we
prove that our monotones are all equal to each other, multiplicative and
efficiently computable, allowing us to make clear-cut comparisons of the
simulators' performance scaling. Furthermore, our monotones establish several
asymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds on state interconversion and distillation
rates. Beyond the theory of magic states, our classical simulators can be
adapted to other resource theories under certain axioms, which we demonstrate
through an explicit application to the theory of quantum coherence.

  back on 10 years of use",,"The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 5","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/5",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every
developer, but that cannot be always anticipated, and software sometimes cannot
be stopped. In such cases, unanticipated adaptation of running systems is of
interest for many scenarios, ranging from functional upgrades to on-the-fly
debugging or monitoring of critical applications.
  Inquiry. A way of altering software at run time is using behavioral
reflection, which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated adaptation of
real-world systems. Partial behavioral reflection is not a new idea, and for
years many efforts have been made to propose a practical way of expressing it.
All these efforts resulted in practical solutions, but which introduced a
semantic gap between the code that requires adaptation and the expression of
the partial behavior. For example, in Aspect-Oriented Programming, a pointcut
description is expressed in another language, which introduces a new distance
between the behavior expression (the Advice) and the source code in itself.
  Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the
expression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the
Reflectivity framework. Using Reflectivity, developers annotate Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) nodes with meta-behavior which is taken into account by the compiler
to produce behavioral variations. In this paper, we present Reflectivity, its
API, its implementation and its usage in Pharo. We reflect on ten years of use
of Reflectivity, and show how it has been used as a basic building block of
many innovative ideas.
  Knowledge. Reflectivity brings a practical way of working at the AST level,
which is a high-level representation of the source code manipulated by software
developers. It enables a powerful way of dynamically add and modify behavior.
Reflectivity is also a flexible mean to bridge the gap between the expression
of the meta-behavior and the source code. This ability to apply unanticipated
adaptation and to provide behavioral reflection led to many experiments and
projects during this last decade by external users. Existing work use
Reflectivity to implement reflective libraries or languages extensions,
featherweight code instrumentation, dynamic software update, debugging tools
and visualization and software analysis tools.
  Grounding. Reflectivity is actively used in research projects. During the
past ten years, it served as a support, either for implementation or as a
fundamental base, for many research work including PhD theses, conference,
journal and workshop papers. Reflectivity is now an important library of the
Pharo language, and is integrated at the heart of the platform.
  Importance. Reflectivity exposes powerful abstractions to deal with partial
behavioral adaptation, while providing a mature framework for unanticipated,
non-intrusive and partial behavioral reflection based on AST annotation.
Furthermore, even if Reflectivity found its home inside Pharo, it is not a pure
Smalltalk-oriented solution. As validation over the practical use of
Reflectivity in dynamic object-oriented languages, the API has been ported to
Python. Finally, the AST annotation feature of Reflectivity opens new
experimentation opportunities about the control that developers could gain on
the behavior of their own software.

  Issue 3, Article 16","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/16",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a
software project. Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes
to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental
compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast
recompilation.
  Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are
usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires
cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency
tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in
compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration,
correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a
challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We
address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts
of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an
incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling
difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.
  Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to
develop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This
language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with
incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to
demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original
compiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on
which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental
build system to wire together the components we extract from the original
compiler.
  Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the
original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system
inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a
compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that
into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation
\`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is
responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound
and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking
into the compiler.
  Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact
along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its
performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version
control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual
machine image for easy reproducibility.
  Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego
programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many
currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than
necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an
existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.

ScalaLoci language allows developers to declare the different components and
their architectural relation at the type level, allowing static reasoning about
about distribution and remote communication and guaranteeing static type safety
across components. The compiler splits the multitier program into the
component-specific code and automatically generates the communication
boilerplate. Communication between components can be modeled by declaratively
specifying data flows between components using reactive programming.
  In this paper, we report on the implementation of our design and our
experience with embedding our language features into Scala as a host language.
We show how a combination of Scala's advanced type level programming and its

service interfaces and supports the seamless evolution of compatible
interfaces. We define a compatibility relation that captures real evolution
patterns and embodies known good practices on the evolution of interfaces.
Namely, we allow for the addition, removal, and renaming of data fields of a
producer module without breaking or needing to upgrade consumer services. The
evolution of interfaces is supported by runtime generated proxy components that
dynamically adapt data exchanged between services to match with the statically
checked service code.The model was instantiated in a core language whose
semantics is defined by a labeled transition system and a type system that
prevents breaking changes from being deployed. Standard soundness results for
the core language entail the existence of adapters, hence the absence of
adaptation errors and the correctness of the management model. This adaptive
approach allows for gradual deployment of modules, without halting the whole
system and avoiding losing or misinterpreting data exchanged between system
nodes. Experimental data shows that an average of 69% of deployments that would
require adaptation and recompilation are safe under our approach.

$z_{tt}-z_{xx}=0$ on $[0,1]$ with a Dirichlet condition at $x=0$ and a damping
acting at $x=1$ which takes the form $(z_t(t,1),-z_x(t,1))\in\Sigma$ for every
$t\geq 0$, where $\Sigma$ is a given subset of $\mathbb R^2$. The study is
performed within an $L^p$ functional framework, $p\in [1, +\infty]$. We aim at
determining conditions on $\Sigma$ ensuring existence and uniqueness of
solutions of that wave equation as well as strong stability and uniform global
asymptotic stability of its solutions. In the latter case, we also study the
decay rates of the solutions and their optimality. We first establish a
one-to-one correspondence between the solutions of that wave equation and the
iterated sequences of a discrete-time dynamical system in terms of which we
investigate the above mentioned issues. This enables us to provide a simple
necessary and sufficient condition on $\Sigma$ ensuring existence and
uniqueness of solutions of the wave equation as well as an efficient strategy
for determining optimal decay rates when $\Sigma$ verifies a generalized sector
condition. As an application, we solve two conjectures stated in the
literature, the first one seeking a specific optimal decay rate and the second
one associated with a saturation type of damping. In case the boundary damping
is subject to perturbations, we derive sharp results regarding asymptotic
perturbation rejection and input-to-state issues.

  Issue 3, Article 15","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/15",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify
tasks and problems themselves, while enabling static analysis to elucidate
issues in the modelled domain early. Although language workbenches have
simplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages,
static analyses must still be implemented manually.
  Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency
analysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot
be easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another
DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always
intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which
a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm
employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused
in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either
implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the
implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.
Thus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis
relies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the
analysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional
implementation effort.
  Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary
domain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures,
yet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to
make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute
Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay
structure using higher-order attributes.
  Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on
analysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the
specification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be
performed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be
externalized and reused in another general purpose language.
  Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To
illustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed
languages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL
and for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an
analysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling
language. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three
completely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis
to evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal
reference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and
thereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal
overhead.
  Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality
and efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general
purpose languages using relational RAGs.

unrestricted way in a text editor. Supporting interactive editing is tricky as
any edit can change the structure of code and fully recomputing the output

  Issue 3, Article 14","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/14",,"cs.SE cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their
code if they want to stay productive. Tools that highlight code locations that
could benefit from refactoring are thus highly desirable. The most common name
for such locations is ""bad code smell"". A number of tools offer such quality
feedback and there is a substantial body of related research. However, all
these tools, including those based on Machine Learning, still produce false
positives. Every single false positive shown to the developer places a
cognitive burden on her and should thus be avoided. The literature discusses
the choice of metric thresholds, the general subjectivity of such a judgment
and the relation to conscious design choices, ""design ideas"". To examine false
positives and the relation between bad smells and design ideas, we designed and
conducted an exploratory case study. While previous research presented a broad
overview, we have chosen a narrow setting to reach for even deeper insights:
The framework JHotDraw had been designed so thoughtfully that most smell
warnings are expected to be false positives. Nevertheless, the ""Law of Good
Style"", better known as the ""Law of Demeter"", is a rather restrictive design
rule so that we still expected to find some potential bad smells, i.e.
violations of this ""Law"". This combination led to 1215 potential smells of
which at most 42 are true positives. We found generic as well as specific
design ideas that were traded for the smell. Our confidence in that decision
ranged from high enough to very high. We were surprised to realize that the
smell definition itself required the formulation of constructive design ideas.
Finally we found some smells to be the result of the limitation of the language
and one could introduce auxiliary constructive design ideas to compensate for
them. The decision whether a potential smell occurrence is actually a true
positive was made very meticulously. For that purpose we took three qualities
that the smell could affect negatively into account and we discussed the result
of the recommended refactorings. If we were convinced that we had found a false
positive, we described the relationships with design ideas. The realization
that not only general design ideas but also specific design ideas have an
influence on whether a potential smell is a true positive turns the problem of
false positives from a scientific problem (""What is the true definition of the
smell?"") to a engineering problem (""How can we incorporate design ideas into
smell definitions?""). We recommend to add adaptation points to the smell
definitions. Higher layers may then adapt the smell for specific contexts.
After adaptation the tool may continuously provide distinct and precise quality
feedback, reducing the cognitive load for the developer and preventing
habituation. Furthermore, the schema for the discussion of potential smells may
be used to elaborate more sets of true and false smell occurrences. Finally, it
follows that smell detection based on machine learning should also take signs
of design ideas into account.

normal-metal leads via tunnel junctions. We calculate the average charge on the

pairing gap $\Delta_P$, charging energy $E_C$ and dimensionless junction
conductances $g_i$. We find that the presence of a topological ground-state
degeneracy in the island dramatically enhances charge fluctuations and leads to
the suppression of Coulomb blockade effects. In contrast with conventional
(s-wave) mesoscopic superconducting islands, we find that Coulomb blockade
oscillations of conductance are suppressed in Majorana islands regardless of

avoid exposing patients to unacceptably high risk of toxicities. Traditionally,
these trials are based on one type of schedule. In more recent practice,
however, there is often a need to consider more than one schedule, which means
that in addition to the dose itself, the schedule needs to be varied in the
trial. Hence, the aim is finding an acceptable dose-schedule combination.
However, most established methods for dose-escalation trials are designed to
escalate the dose only and ad-hoc choices must be made to adapt these to the
more complicated setting of finding an acceptable dose-schedule combination. In
this paper, we introduce a Bayesian time-to-event model which takes explicitly
the dose amount and schedule into account through the use of pharmacokinetic
principles. The model uses a time-varying exposure measure to account for the
risk of a dose-limiting toxicity over time. The dose-schedule decisions are
informed by an escalation with overdose control criterion. The model is
formulated using interpretable parameters which facilitates the specification
of priors. In a simulation study, we compared the proposed method with an
existing method. The simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method
yields similar or better results compared to an existing method in terms of
recommending acceptable dose-schedule combinations, yet reduces the number of
patients enrolled in most of scenarios. The \texttt{R} and \texttt{Stan} code

geometries, the topology-free method combined with the immersed boundary method
is presented for viscous and incompressible flows at a high Reynolds number.
The method simultaneously employs a ghost-cell technique and distributed
forcing technique to impose the boundary conditions. An axis-projected
interpolation scheme is used to avoid searching failures during fluid and solid
identification. This method yields a topology-free immersed boundary, which
particularly suits flow simulations of highly complex geometries. Difficulties
generally arise when generating the calculation grid for these scenarios. This
method allows dirty data to be handled without any preparatory treatment work
to simplify or clean-up the geometry. This method is also applicable to the
coherent structural turbulence model employed in this study. The verification
cases, used in conjunction with the second-order central-difference scheme,
resulted in first-order accuracy at finer resolution, although the coarser
resolution retained second-order accuracy. This method is fully parallelized
for distributed memory platforms. In this study, the accuracy and fidelity of
this method were examined by simulating the flow around the bluff body, past a
flat plate, and past dirty spheres. These simulations were compared with
experimental data and other established results. Finally, results from the
simulation of practical applications demonstrate the ability of the method to
model highly complex, non-canonical three-dimensional flows. The countermeasure
based on the accurate classification of geometric features has provided a
robust and reasonable solution.

an overdensity of narrowband selected H$\alpha$ emitting candidates. With only
two masks of Keck/MOSFIRE near-IR spectroscopy in both $H$ ($\sim$ 1.47-1.81
$\mu$m) and $K$ ($\sim$ 1.92-2.40 $\mu$m) bands ($\sim$ 1.5 hour each), we
confirm 35 unique protocluster members with at least two emission lines
detected with S/N $>$ 3. Combined with 12 extra members from the zCOSMOS-deep
spectroscopic survey (47 in total), we estimate a mean redshift and a
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $z_{mean}$=2.23224 $\pm$ 0.00101 and
$\sigma_{los}$=645 $\pm$ 69 km s$^{-1}$ for this protocluster, respectively.
Assuming virialization and spherical symmetry for the system, we estimate a
total mass of $M_{vir}$ $\sim$ $(1-2) \times$10$^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ for the
structure. We evaluate a number density enhancement of $\delta_{g}$ $\sim$ 7
for this system and we argue that the structure is likely not fully virialized
at $z$ $\sim$ 2.2. However, in a spherical collapse model, $\delta_{g}$ is
expected to grow to a linear matter enhancement of $\sim$ 1.9 by $z$=0,
exceeding the collapse threshold of 1.69, and leading to a fully collapsed and
virialized Coma-type structure with a total mass of $M_{dyn}$($z$=0) $\sim$
9.2$\times$10$^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ by now. This observationally efficient
confirmation suggests that large narrowband emission-line galaxy surveys, when
combined with ancillary photometric data, can be used to effectively trace the
large-scale structure and protoclusters at a time when they are mostly

deeply uncertain, with almost all studies adopting simple prescriptions (e.g.
constant-diffusivity). We explore different physically-motivated, anisotropic,
dynamical CR transport scalings in high-resolution cosmological FIRE
simulations of dwarf and ~$L_{\ast}$ galaxies where scattering rates vary with
local plasma properties motivated by extrinsic turbulence (ET) or
self-confinement (SC) scenarios, with varying assumptions about e.g. turbulent
power spectra on un-resolved scales, Alfven-wave damping, etc. We
self-consistently predict observables including $\gamma$-rays ($L_{\gamma}$),
grammage, residence times, and CR energy densities to constrain the models. We
demonstrate many non-linear dynamical effects (not captured in simpler models)
tend to enhance confinement. For example, in multi-phase media, even allowing
arbitrary fast transport in neutral gas does not substantially reduce CR
residence times (or $L_{\gamma}$), as transport is rate-limited by the ionized
WIM and 'inner CGM' gaseous halo ($10^{4}-10^{6}$ K gas within 10-30 kpc), and
$L_{\gamma}$ can be dominated by trapping in small 'patches.' Most physical ET
models contribute negligible scattering of ~1-10 GeV CRs, but it is crucial to
account for anisotropy and damping (especially of fast modes) or else
scattering rates would violate observations. We show that the most
widely-assumed scalings for SC models produce excessive confinement by factors
>100 in the WIM and inner CGM, where turbulent and Landau damping dominate.
This suggests either a breakdown of quasi-linear theory used to derive the CR
transport parameters in SC, or that other novel damping mechanisms dominate in
intermediate-density ionized gas.

that adapts to the characteristics of the target distribution with minimal
hand-tuning. However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the
user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter and the method generally
struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions. This paper
introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling (ESS), a new class of algorithms that
bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the initial length scale and
utilising an ensemble of parallel walkers in order to efficiently handle strong
correlations between parameters. These affine-invariant algorithms are trivial
to construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel
computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can
improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional
MCMC methods on a broad range of highly correlated target distributions. In
cases of strongly multimodal target distributions, Ensemble Slice Sampling can
sample efficiently even in high dimensions. We argue that the parallel,
black-box and gradient-free nature of the method renders it ideal for use in
scientific fields such as physics, astrophysics and cosmology which are
dominated by a wide variety of computationally expensive and non-differentiable
models.

  Issue 3, Article 12","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/12",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The practice of unit testing enables programmers to obtain automated feedback
on whether a currently edited program is consistent with the expectations
specified in test cases. Feedback is most valuable when it happens immediately,
as defects can be corrected instantly before they become harder to fix. With
growing and longer running test suites, however, feedback is obtained less
frequently and lags behind program changes.
  The objective of test prioritization is to rank tests so that defects, if
present, are found as early as possible or with the least costs. While there
are numerous static approaches that output a ranking of tests solely based on
the current version of a program, we focus on change-based test prioritization,
which recommends tests that likely fail in response to the most recent program
change. The canonical approach relies on coverage data and prioritizes tests
that cover the changed region, but obtaining and updating coverage data is
costly. More recently, information retrieval techniques that exploit
overlapping vocabulary between change and tests have proven to be powerful, yet
lightweight.
  In this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of information retrieval for
prioritizing tests in dynamic programming languages using Python as example. We
discuss and measure previously understudied variation points, including how
contextual information around a program change can be used, and design
alternatives to the widespread \emph{TF-IDF} retrieval model tailored to
retrieving failing tests.
  To obtain program changes with associated test failures, we designed a tool
that generates a large set of faulty changes from version history along with
their test results. Using this data set, we compared existing and new lexical
prioritization strategies using four open-source Python projects, showing large
improvements over untreated and random test orders and results consistent with
related work in statically typed languages.
  We conclude that lightweight IR-based prioritization strategies are effective
tools to predict failing tests in the absence of coverage data or when static
analysis is intractable like in dynamic languages. This knowledge can benefit
both individual programmers that rely on fast feedback, as well as operators of
continuous integration infrastructure, where resources can be freed sooner by
detecting defects earlier in the build cycle.

molecular tracers such as NH3 and HCN, and simulate a time window of 50 Myr,
long enough to capture phases during which the CMZ experiences both quiescent
and intense star formation. We then post-process the simulated CMZ to calculate
its spatially-dependent chemical and thermal state, producing synthetic
emission data cubes and maps of both HI and the molecular gas tracers CO, NH3
and HCN. We show that, as viewed from Earth, gas in the CMZ is distributed
mainly in two parallel and elongated features extending from positive
longitudes and velocities to negative longitudes and velocities. The molecular
gas emission within these two streams is not uniform, and it is mostly
associated to the region where gas flowing towards the Galactic Center through
the dust lanes collides with gas orbiting within the ring. Our simulated data
cubes reproduce a number of features found in the observed CMZ. However, some
discrepancies emerge when we use our results to interpret the position of
individual molecular clouds. Finally, we show that, when the CMZ is near a
period of intense star formation, the ring is mostly fragmented as a
consequence of supernova feedback, and the bulk of the emission comes from
star-forming molecular clouds. This correlation between morphology and star
formation rate should be detectable in observations of extragalactic CMZs.

pedagogically to provide immediate feedback to students learning either to
employ POSIX threads system calls or to implement multithreaded algorithms.
  This work represents the first example of in-vivo model checking operating
directly on the standard multithreaded executable and its libraries, without
the aid of a compiler-generated intermediate representation. Sthread leverages
the open-source SimGrid libraries, and will eventually be integrated into
SimGrid. Sthread employs a non-preemptive model in which thread context
switches occur only at multithreaded system calls (e.g., mutex, semaphore) or
before accesses to shared memory regions. The emphasis is on finding
""algorithmic bugs"" (bugs in an original algorithm, implemented as POSIX threads
and shared memory regions. This work is in contrast to Context-Bounded Analysis
(CBA), which assumes a preemptive model for threads, and emphasizes
implementation bugs such as buffer overruns and write-after-free for memory

potential for pedagogy, by providing immediate feedback to students who are

Optimization Algorithm (WOA) used to build new method (MLP-WOA) with a limited
set of data (2004-2014). Then, the MLP-WOA model was utilized at each of the
ten target stations, with the nine stations for training and tenth station for

Methane is considered a spherical molecule, and carbon dioxide is represented

NRs are approached atomistically. We observe that when the NRs are placed 6
\r{A} above the graphite surface, methane is blocked out, while CO$_2$

discuss their stability and their extent, as well as their size and

high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded
scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the

reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future
trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative
neural system (called Social-WaGDAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction,
which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating
relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages
both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient
kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not
only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. The
proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory
prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles.
The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance

prone to higher mortality rates than those who were admitted directly to the
ICU. Recent advances in machine learning to predict patient deterioration have
introduced the possibility of \emph{proactive transfer} from the ward to the
ICU. In this work, we study the problem of finding \emph{robust} patient
transfer policies which account for uncertainty in statistical estimates due to
data limitations when optimizing to improve overall patient care. We propose a
Markov Decision Process model to capture the evolution of patient health, where
the states represent a measure of patient severity. Under fairly general
assumptions, we show that an optimal transfer policy has a threshold structure,
i.e., that it transfers all patients above a certain severity level to the ICU
(subject to available capacity). As model parameters are typically determined
based on statistical estimations from real-world data, they are inherently
subject to misspecification and estimation errors. We account for this
parameter uncertainty by deriving a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case
reward across all plausible values of the model parameters. We show that the
robust policy also has a threshold structure under fairly general assumptions.
Moreover, it is more aggressive in transferring patients than the optimal
nominal policy, which does not take into account parameter uncertainty. We
present computational experiments using a dataset of hospitalizations at 21
KNPC hospitals, and present empirical evidence of the sensitivity of various
hospital metrics (mortality, length-of-stay, average ICU occupancy) to small
changes in the parameters. Our work provides useful insights into the impact of
parameter uncertainty on deriving simple policies for proactive ICU transfer
that have strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees.

performance than deep feedforward networks (FFNets). However, the theory behind
such a phenomenon is still largely unknown. This paper studies this fundamental
problem in deep learning from a so-called ""neural tangent kernel"" perspective.
Specifically, we first show that under proper conditions, as the width goes to
infinity, training deep ResNets can be viewed as learning reproducing kernel
functions with some kernel function. We then compare the kernel of deep ResNets
with that of deep FFNets and discover that the class of functions induced by
the kernel of FFNets is asymptotically not learnable, as the depth goes to
infinity. In contrast, the class of functions induced by the kernel of ResNets
does not exhibit such degeneracy. Our discovery partially justifies the
advantages of deep ResNets over deep FFNets in generalization abilities.

be unambiguously separated into linear wave and geostrophic components at each
instant in time, without the need for temporal filtering. The fluid can then be
diagnosed for temporal changes in wave and geostrophic coefficients at each
unique wavenumber and mode, including those that inevitably occur due to

  We demonstrate that this methodology can be used to determine which physical

generally to determine which mechanisms are involved in energy transfers

levels of a face-identification network. At the unit level, identification,
gender classification, and viewpoint estimation were measured by deleting units
to create variably-sized, randomly-sampled subspaces at the top network layer.
Identification of 3,531 identities remained high (area under the ROC
approximately 1.0) as dimensionality decreased from 512 units to 16 (0.95), 4
(0.80), and 2 (0.72) units. Individual identities separated statistically on
every top-layer unit. Cross-unit responses were minimally correlated,
indicating that units code non-redundant identity cues. This ""distributed"" code
requires only a sparse, random sample of units to identify faces accurately.
Gender classification declined gradually and viewpoint estimation fell steeply
as dimensionality decreased. Individual units were weakly predictive of gender
and viewpoint, but ensembles proved effective predictors. Therefore,
distributed and sparse codes co-exist in the network units to represent
different face attributes. At the ensemble level, principal component analysis
of face representations showed that identity, gender, and viewpoint information
separated into high-dimensional subspaces, ordered by explained variance.
Identity, gender, and viewpoint information contributed to all individual unit

produces the embeddings for query and document independently, which allows
document embeddings to be pre-computed offline and cached in memory. Thereupon,
the computation left for run-time is from the query encoding and query-document

decision-making (e.g., pre-trial bail and loan approval), it becomes important
to explain how the system arrived at its decision, and also suggest actions to
achieve a favorable decision. Counterfactual explanations -- ""how the world
would have (had) to be different for a desirable outcome to occur"" -- aim to
satisfy these criteria. Existing works have primarily focused on designing
algorithms to obtain counterfactual explanations for a wide range of settings.
However, one of the main objectives of ""explanations as a means to help a
data-subject act rather than merely understand"" has been overlooked. In
layman's terms, counterfactual explanations inform an individual where they
need to get to, but not how to get there. In this work, we rely on causal
reasoning to caution against the use of counterfactual explanations as a
recommendable set of actions for recourse. Instead, we propose a shift of
paradigm from recourse via nearest counterfactual explanations to recourse
through minimal interventions, moving the focus from explanations to
recommendations. Finally, we provide the reader with an extensive discussion on
how to realistically achieve recourse beyond structural interventions.

nine different pooling methods on LSTM models using 1.7M generated mixture
clips of multiple events with different signal-to-noise ratios. This paper
focuses on understanding: 1) utterance-level classification accuracy; 2)
sensitivity to event position within an utterance. The analysis is done on the

Then, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress
existence probability. Experiment results showed that the trained fNIRS model
performs stress classification by achieving 88.52 -+ 0.77% accuracy. Employment
of the proposed deep learning system trained on the fNIRS measurements leads to
higher stress classification accuracy than the existing methods proposed in

performance of Multipath TCP (MPTCP). However, existing MPTCP protocols are
still far from satisfactory in lossy and ever-changing networks because of
their loss-based congestion control and the difficulty of managing multiple
subflows. Recently, a congestion-based congestion control, BBR, is proposed to
promote TCP transmission performance through better use of bandwidth. Due to
the superior performance of BBR, we try to boost MPTCP with it. For this
propose, coupled congestion control should be redesigned for MPTCP, and a
functional scheduler able to effectively make use of the characteristics of BBR
must also be developed for better performance. In this paper, we first propose
Coupled BBR as a coupled congestion control algorithm for MPTCP to achieve high
throughput and stable sending rate in lossy network scenarios with guaranteed
fairness with TCP BBR flows and balanced congestion. Then, to further improve
the performance, we propose an Adaptively Redundant and Packet-by-Packet

adaptability in highly dynamic network scenarios and keep in-order packet
delivery in asymmetric networks. Based on Linux kernel implementation and
experiments in both testbed and real network scenarios, we show that the
proposed scheme not only provides higher throughput, but also improves
robustness and reduces out-of-order packets in some harsh circumstances.

drives the system from type-I WSMs into type-II WSMs. Here, based on the
lattice model, we perform a systematic numerical study of the effect of on-site
disorder on the diagonal magnetoconductivity in tilted WSMs.We use the
self-consistent Born approximation to calculate the disorder-induced
self-energy and then apply the Kubo-Streda formula to calculate the diagonal
magnetoconductivity. For the transverse magnetoconductivity \sigma_xx, the
disorder is found to exhibit distinct effects in the quantum limit regime and
in the quantum oscillation regime of type-I WSMs, which could be understood
from Einstein's relationship.With strong disorder, \sigma_xx shows a linear
relation with the inverse magnetic field 1/B , which exhibits certain
robustness to both the Fermi energy and the Weyl cone tilting. For the
longitudinal magnetoconductivity \sigma_zz , the strong disorder can break the
positive magnetoconductivity as well as the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.By
analyzing the spectral function, we find that the chiral anomaly is still

this structure is employed to prove that there exists a unique regular solution

Kalman filtering, which builds physical trajectories incrementally while

faster computational throughput, we have adapted Kalman-filter-based methods
for highly parallel, many-core SIMD and SIMT architectures that are now
prevalent in high-performance hardware. Previously we observed significant
parallel speedups, with physics performance comparable to CMS standard
tracking, on Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi, and (to a limited extent) NVIDIA GPUs.
While early tests were based on artificial events occurring inside an idealized
barrel detector, we showed subsequently that our mkFit software builds tracks
successfully from complex simulated events (including detector pileup)
occurring inside a geometrically accurate representation of the CMS-2017
tracker. Here, we report on advances in both the computational and physics
performance of mkFit, as well as progress toward integration with CMS
production software. Recently we have improved the overall efficiency of the
algorithm by preserving short track candidates at a relatively early stage
rather than attempting to extend them over many layers. Moreover, mkFit
formerly produced an excess of duplicate tracks; these are now explicitly
removed in an additional processing step. We demonstrate that with these
enhancements, mkFit becomes a suitable choice for the first iteration of CMS
tracking, and eventually for later iterations as well. We plan to test this
capability in the CMS High Level Trigger during Run 3 of the LHC, with an
ultimate goal of using it in both the CMS HLT and offline reconstruction for
the HL-LHC CMS tracker.

while storing only $O(d \log^2 d / \epsilon^2)$ rows. Known lower bounds of
$\Omega(d / \epsilon^2)$ rows show that this is nearly optimal. Moreover, each
row of our coreset is a weighted subset of the input rows. This is highly
desirable since it: (1) preserves sparsity; (2) is easily interpretable; (3)
avoids precision errors; (4) applies to problems with constraints on the input.
Previous streaming results for SVD that return a subset of the input required
storing $\Omega(d \log^3 n / \epsilon^2)$ rows where $n$ is the number of rows
seen so far. Our algorithm, with storage independent of $n$, is the first
result that uses finite memory on infinite streams. We support our findings
with experiments on the Wikipedia dataset benchmarked against state-of-the-art
algorithms.

the pulsar similar to those seen around other pulsars in young PWNe, which
further argues for association between PSR J1418$-$6058 and the Rabbit PWN. The

classification', has become a topic of major interest with applications in
technology, science, and e-commerce. Traditional softmax regression induces a
gradient cost proportional to the number of classes $C$, which often is
prohibitively expensive. A popular scalable softmax approximation relies on
uniform negative sampling, which suffers from slow convergence due a poor
signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a simple training method for
drastically enhancing the gradient signal by drawing negative samples from an
adversarial model that mimics the data distribution. Our contributions are
three-fold: (i) an adversarial sampling mechanism that produces negative
samples at a cost only logarithmic in $C$, thus still resulting in cheap
gradient updates; (ii) a mathematical proof that this adversarial sampling
minimizes the gradient variance while any bias due to non-uniform sampling can
be removed; (iii) experimental results on large scale data sets that show a
reduction of the training time by an order of magnitude relative to several
competitive baselines.

us to show, without relying on the generative model approach, that the
estimator has an instance-dependent convergence rate of
$\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\tau_s/T}\right)$ over steps $T$ on a single sample
path, where $\tau_s$ is the maximal expected hitting time to state $s$. In

distinct random seeds can lead to substantially different results. To better
understand this phenomenon, we experiment with four datasets from the GLUE

random seeds. We find substantial performance increases compared to previously
reported results, and we quantify how the performance of the best-found model
varies as a function of the number of fine-tuning trials. Further, we examine
two factors influenced by the choice of random seed: weight initialization and
training data order. We find that both contribute comparably to the variance of
out-of-sample performance, and that some weight initializations perform well
across all tasks explored. On small datasets, we observe that many fine-tuning
trials diverge part of the way through training, and we offer best practices
for practitioners to stop training less promising runs early. We publicly
release all of our experimental data, including training and validation scores

fault location, and further numerically validates its effectiveness when the

the fault impedance is derived, and the correctness of the model derivation is
verified by various calculation methods. Based on this, we found that when the
fault impedance is large, the existing EMTR methods might fail to accurately
locate the fault. We propose an EMTR method that improves the location effect
of high-impedance faults by injecting double-ended signals simultaneously.
Theoretical calculations show that this method can achieve accurate location
for high-impedance faults. To further illustrate the effectiveness, the
proposed method is compared with the existing EMTR methods and the most
commonly used traveling wave-based method using wavelet transform. The
simulation results show that the proposed double-ended EMTR method can
effectively locate high-impedance faults, and it is more robust against
synchronization errors compared to the traveling wave method. In addition, the
proposed method does not require the knowledge or the a priori guess of the
unknown fault impedance.

generally dependent on the employed robot in training or dimension-specific,
which cannot be directly reused by robots with different dimensional
configurations. To address this issue, a DRL-based dimension-variable robot
navigation method is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach trains a
meta-agent with DRL and then transfers the meta-skill to a robot with a
different dimensional configuration (named dimension-scaled robot) using a
method named dimension-variable skill transfer (DVST). During the training
phase, the meta-agent learns to perform self-navigation with the meta-robot in
a simulation environment. In the skill-transfer phase, the observations of the
dimension-scaled robot are transferred to the meta-agent in a scaled manner,
and the control policy generated by the meta-agent is scaled back to the
dimension-scaled robot. Simulation and real-world experimental results indicate
that robots with different sizes and angular velocity bounds can accomplish
navigation tasks in unknown and dynamic environments without any retraining.
This work greatly extends the application range of DRL-based navigation methods

in the 10-100 km range, directly from freely floating particles. The IMFs have
a modal nature, with a well-defined peak rather than a powerlaw size
dependence. Predictions for the inner and outer nebula behave similarly in
these regards, and observations of inner and outer nebula primitive bodies
support such modal IMFs. Also, we present predictions of local particle
concentrations on several lengthscales in which particles ""commonly"" find

important difference between these results, and those of Cuzzi et al. (2010),
is that particle growth-by-sticking must proceed to at least the 1-few cm
radius range for the IMF and meteoritical properties to be most plausibly
satisfied. That is, as far as the inner nebula goes, the predominant
""particles"" must be aggregates of chondrules (or chondrule-size precursors)

autocorrelation in the observations, and a linear trend over time. Also,
segmented regression is very sensitive to outliers. In a small sample study, if
the outcome variable does not follow a Gaussian distribution, then using
segmented regression to estimate the intervention effect leads to incorrect
inferences. To address the small sample problem and non-normality in the
outcome variable, including outliers, we describe and develop a robust
statistical method to estimate the policy intervention effect in a series of
longitudinal data. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the effect of
outliers and non-normality in the outcomes by calculating the power of the test
statistics with the segmented regression and the proposed robust statistical
methods. Moreover, since finding the sampling distribution of the proposed
robust statistic is analytically difficult, we use a nonparametric bootstrap
technique to study the properties of the sampling distribution and make
statistical inferences. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has
more power than the standard t-test used in segmented regression analysis under
the non-normality error distribution. Finally, we use the developed technique
to estimate the intervention effect of the Istanbul Declaration on illegal

Existing works only treat the passive and active eavesdroppers separately.
Different from the existing works, we investigate the achievable secrecy rate

model, we assume that the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the
active eavesdroppers is available at the jammer, while only partial CSI of the
passive eavesdroppers is available at the jammer. A new zero-forcing

which FGKK [2016] characterize the optimal mechanism for a single agent. We
ask: how far can such characterizations go? In particular, we consider
single-minded agents. A seller has heterogenous items. A buyer has a value v
for a specific subset of items S, and obtains value v iff he gets (at least)
all the items in S. We show:
  1. Deterministic mechanisms are optimal for distributions that satisfy the
""declining marginal revenue"" (DMR) property; we give an explicit construction
of the optimal mechanism.
  2. Without DMR, the result depends on the structure of the directed acyclic
graph (DAG) representing the partial order among types. When the DAG has
out-degree at most 1, we characterize the optimal mechanism a la FedEx.
  3. Without DMR, when the DAG has some node with out-degree at least 2, we
show that in this case the menu complexity is unbounded: for any M, there exist
distributions over (v,S) pairs such that the menu complexity of the optimal
mechanism is at least M.
  4. For the case of 3 types, we show that for all distributions there exists
an optimal mechanism of finite menu complexity. This is in contrast to 2
additive heterogenous items or which the menu complexity could be uncountable

  In addition, we prove that optimal mechanisms for Multi-Unit Pricing (without

  Methods: We introduced a new methodology that combines SegNet and CRFI to
improve the accuracy and robustness of the segmentation. CRFI has feedback
connections that encourage the data consistency at multiple levels of the
feature pyramid. On the encoder side of the SegNet, the CRFI combines the input
feature maps and convolution block output based on their spatial local

  Results: The SegNet with CRFI achieved the relatively high Dice coefficients
(0.76, 0.84, and 0.89) for the peripheral zone, central zone, and whole gland,
respectively. Compared with UNet, the SegNet+CRFIs segmentation has generally
higher Dice score and showed the robustness in determining the boundaries of
anatomical structures compared with the SegNet or UNet segmentation. The SegNet
with a CRFI at the end showed the CRFI can correct the segmentation errors from
SegNet output, generating smooth and consistent segmentation for the prostate.
  Conclusion: UNet based deep neural networks demonstrated in this study can
perform zonal prostate segmentation, achieving high Dice coefficients compared
with those in the literature. The proposed CRFI method can reduce the fuzzy
boundaries that affected the segmentation performance of baseline UNet and
SegNet models.

radar (GPR) applications such as ultra-wide bandwidth, polarization diversity,
and a low-profile form factor. However, sinuous antennas are dispersive since
the active region moves with frequency along the structure. This is an
undesirable quality for pulsed-radar applications since the radiated pulse will
be distorted. Such distortion may be detrimental to close-in sensing
applications such as GPR. This distortion may be compensated in processing with
accurately simulated or measured phase data. However, antenna performance may
deviate from that simulated or measured due to the dielectric loading of the
ground. In such cases, it may be desirable to employ a dispersion model based
on antenna design parameters which may be optimized in-situ. Dispersion
compensation models previously investigated for other antennas may be similarly
applied to sinuous antennas. This paper explores the dispersive properties of
the sinuous antenna and presents a simple model that may be used to compress

stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of
normalizing flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible
posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing
flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped
to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this
fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to
hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces
using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent
Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling
($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation
that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing
for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean
normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density
estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a
hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power
a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.

must be tested with sufficient realistic data to assure their correctness. To
effectively test an image classification neural network, one must obtain
realistic test data adequate enough to inspire confidence that differences
between the implicit requirements and the learned model would be exposed. This
raises two challenges: first, an adequate subset of the data points must be
carefully chosen to inspire confidence, and second, the implicit requirements
must be meaningfully extrapolated to data points beyond those in the explicit
training set. This paper proposes a novel framework to address these
challenges. Our approach is based on the premise that patterns in a large input
data space can be effectively captured in a smaller manifold space, from which
similar yet novel test cases---both the input and the label---can be sampled
and generated. A variant of Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is used
for capturing this manifold with a generative function, and a search technique
is applied on this manifold space to efficiently find fault-revealing inputs.
Experiments show that this approach enables generation of thousands of
realistic yet fault-revealing test cases efficiently even for well-trained

first push the object towards a support surface and establishes a pivot to lift
up one side of the object, thus creating a clearance between the object and the
table for possible grasping solutions. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness
of our proposed learning framework in training robust pregrasp policies that
can directly transfer from simulation to real hardware through suitable design
of training procedures, state, and action space. Lastly, we evaluate the
effectiveness and the generalisation ability of the learned policies in
real-world experiments, and demonstrate pregrasp manipulation of objects with

based methods have been widely employed to solve these problems and can be
categorized into proposal-free and proposal-based methods. However, both
proposal-free and proposal-based methods suffer from information loss, as they
focus on either global-level semantic or local-level instance features. To
tackle this issue, we present a Panoptic Feature Fusion Net (PFFNet) that
unifies the semantic and instance features in this work. Specifically, our
proposed PFFNet contains a residual attention feature fusion mechanism to
incorporate the instance prediction with the semantic features, in order to
facilitate the semantic contextual information learning in the instance branch.
Then, a mask quality sub-branch is designed to align the confidence score of
each object with the quality of the mask prediction. Furthermore, a consistency
regularization mechanism is designed between the semantic segmentation tasks in
the semantic and instance branches, for the robust learning of both tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PFFNet,
which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on various biomedical and
biological datasets.

the number of RF chains. Based on the ideal codewords, practical codewords are
then obtained taking the hardware constraints into consideration. For the ideal
codeword design in the first step, additional phase is introduced to the beam
gain to provide extra degree of freedom. We develop a phase-shifted ideal

with each iteration having a closed-form solution and can be extended to design
more general beamforming vectors with different beam patterns. Once the ideal

systems. We use databases of supernovae type-Ia (Pantheon) and Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs) for calculating the luminosity distance. To study the model of the lens
galaxy, we consider a general lens model namely, the Extended Power-Law model.
Further, we take into account two different parametrisations of the mass
density power-law index $(\gamma)$ to study the dependence of $\gamma$ on
redshift. The best value of $\Omega_{k0}$ suggests a closed universe, though a
flat universe is accommodated at $68\%$ confidence level. We find that
parametrisations of $\gamma$ have a negligible impact on the best fit value of
the cosmic curvature parameter.
  Furthermore, measurement of time delay can be a promising cosmographic probe
via ""time delay distance"" that includes the ratio of distances between the
observer, the lens and the source. We again use the distance sum rule method
with time-delay distance dataset of H0LiCOW to put constraints on the Cosmic
Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) and the cosmic curvature parameter
$(\Omega_{k0})$. For this we consider two different redshift-dependent
parametrisations of the distance duality parameter $(\eta)$. The best fit value
of $\Omega_{k0}$ clearly indicates an open universe. However, a flat universe
can be accommodated at $95\%$ confidence level. Further, at $95\%$ confidence
level, no violation of CDDR is observed. We believe that a larger sample of
strong gravitational lensing systems is needed in order to improve the
constraints on the cosmic curvature and distance duality parameter.

assumptions in the statistical and mathematical modeling processes. As a joint
effect of high-dimensionality, nonlinear dependence, and non-concave structures
in the joint posterior posterior distribution over model parameters and
hyperparameters, solving inverse problems in the hierarchical Bayesian setting
poses a significant computational challenge. In this work, we aim to develop
scalable optimization-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for solving
hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems with nonlinear parameter-to-observable

based on the recently developed scalable randomize-then-optimize (RTO) method

using RTO either as a proposal distribution in a Metropolis-within-Gibbs update

design efficient sampling tools for hierarchical Bayesian inversion. In
particular, the integration of RTO and the pseudo-marginal MCMC has sampling
performance robust to model parameter dimensions. We also extend our methods to
nonlinear inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements. Numerical
examples in PDE-constrained inverse problems and positron emission tomography

advance network measurement and management. Machine Learning is one of the
effective approaches for network traffic classification. Specifically, Deep
Learning (DL) has attracted much attention from the researchers due to its
effectiveness even in encrypted network traffic without compromising neither
user privacy nor network security. However, most of the existing models are
created from closed-world datasets, thus they can only classify those existing
classes previously sampled and labeled. In this case, unknown classes cannot be
correctly classified. To tackle this issue, an autonomous learning framework is
proposed to effectively update DL-based traffic classification models during
active operations. The core of the proposed framework consists of a DL-based
classifier, a self-learned discriminator, and an autonomous self-labeling
model. The discriminator and self-labeling process can generate new dataset
during active operations to support classifier update. Evaluation of the
proposed framework is performed on an open dataset, i.e., ISCX VPN-nonVPN, and
independently collected data packets. The results demonstrate that the proposed
autonomous learning framework can filter packets from unknown classes and
provide accurate labels. Thus, corresponding DL-based classification models can
be updated successfully with the autonomously generated dataset.

local systems to construct the volume solution. This technicality requires a

must be controllable by a magnetic field at room temperature, which remains a
significant challenge. Magnetic doping in TMDs can enhance the Zeeman
splitting, however, to achieve this experimentally is not easy. Here, we report
unambiguous magnetic manipulation of valley Zeeman splitting at 300 K (g =
-6.4) and 10 K (g = -11) in a CVD-grown Fe-doped MoS2 monolayer; the effective
g factor can be tuned to -20.7 by increasing the Fe dopant concentration, which
represents an approximately fivefold enhancement as compared to undoped MoS2.
Our measurements and calculations reveal that the enhanced splitting and geff
factors are due to the Heisenberg exchange interaction of the localized
magnetic moments (Fe 3d electrons) with MoS2 through the d-orbital
hybridization.

estimates the angles of arrival (AoA) and angles of departure (AoD) and then
pairs the AoA and AoD. The other scheme reduces the pilot transmission from

based on one-dimensional ESPRIT and minimum searching (EMS). It first estimates
the AoD of each channel path and then searches the minimum from the identified

develop a hybrid precoding and combining matrices design method so that the

success due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN).
Current state-of-the-art CNN methods usually treat the VSR problem as a large
number of separate multi-frame super-resolution tasks, at which a batch of low
resolution (LR) frames is utilized to generate a single high resolution (HR)
frame, and running a slide window to select LR frames over the entire video
would obtain a series of HR frames. However, duo to the complex temporal
dependency between frames, with the number of LR input frames increase, the
performance of the reconstructed HR frames become worse. The reason is in that
these methods lack the ability to model complex temporal dependencies and hard
to give an accurate motion estimation and compensation for VSR process. Which
makes the performance degrade drastically when the motion in frames is complex.
In this paper, we propose a Motion-Adaptive Feedback Cell (MAFC), a simple but
effective block, which can efficiently capture the motion compensation and feed
it back to the network in an adaptive way. Our approach efficiently utilizes
the information of the inter-frame motion, the dependence of the network on
motion estimation and compensation method can be avoid. In addition, benefiting
from the excellent nature of MAFC, the network can achieve better performance
in the case of extremely complex motion scenarios. Extensive evaluations and
comparisons validate the strengths of our approach, and the experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed framework is outperform the

quenching is a requirement for extracting the microscopic properties of the QGP
via jet-tomography. STAR has recently introduced a technique called Jet
Geometry Engineering (JGE) wherein we enforce particular selection criteria
imposed on the jet collection, such as recoiling off a high $p_{\rm{T}}$ hadron
trigger along with an additional transverse momentum threshold for jet
constituents in events with back-to-back di-jets. With JGE, we are able to
control the extent of energy loss ranging from quenched/imbalanced to
recovered/balanced di-jets. Since jet quenching is also expected to be
dependent on the resolution/transverse-length scales with which the jet probes
the medium, it is necessary to perform differential measurements with a handle
on both momentum and angular scales. To quantify the angular scale within jets,
we present the first measurement of the jet's inherent angular structure in
Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = $ 200 GeV via the opening angle
between the two leading sub-jets ($\theta_{\rm{SJ}}$). We also measure the

of age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for
real-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote
controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming
data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be
displayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources
and they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a
promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this
paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and
consider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC
server, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed
locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is
adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message
is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While
in remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the
previous one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and
exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for
exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing
schemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed
numerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the
computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared
to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically
the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared
with local computing.

the processes of methylation and demethylation work together to shape the
pattern of genome-scale DNA methylation and guid the process of cell

whole genome bisulfite sequencing (scBS-seq) provides an opportunity to study
DNA methylation dynamics in the whole genome in individual cells, which reveal
the heterogeneous methylation distributions of enhancers in embryo stem cells

methylation inheritance to study the dynamics of genome-scale DNA methylation
reprogramming during exit from pluripotency. The model enables us to track
genome-scale DNA methylation reprogramming at single-cell level during the
embryo development process, and reproduce the DNA methylation heterogeneity
reported by scBS-seq. Model simulations show that DNA methylation heterogeneity
is an intrinsic property driven by cell division along the development process,
and the collaboration between neighboring enhancers is required for
heterogeneous methylation. Our study suggest that the mechanism of genome-scale

temperature (Tc) of ca. 350 K among more than hundreds of compounds with its
structural type, which makes it more attractive in potential applications. To
reveal the origin of such high ordering temperature, critical behaviors,
electronic structure and crystal-field effects of Gd6FeBi2 are investigated in
this work. The short-range Gd-Fe ferrimagnetic interaction is supported by the
non-Curie-Weiss paramagnetic behavior, crystal and electronic structure
analyses, in agreement with previous DFT calculations. Unlike the strong TM-TM
exchange interactions, the Gd-Fe exchange interaction shows limited influence
on the critical exponents determined by long-range exchange interactions, which
seems a common feature in RE-TM based alloys without TM-TM exchange
interactions. However, the strong Gd-Fe hybridization reduces the influence of
vibronic couplings on the short-range exchange interaction and thus allows a
high Tc. The broadening or splitting mechanism of Gd 4f-electron bands is
addressed based on crystal-field analysis and likely another factor for
elevated Tc in Gd6FeBi2 and Gd-based compounds with non-magnetic elements.
Different magnetic behaviors among isostructural compounds, and the
relationship between the band splitting and crystal-field effects is also
discussed.

wide range of tasks by learning from both original features and graph
structures. Here we present a graph attention model for predicting disease
state from single-cell data on a large dataset of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
patients. MS is a disease of the central nervous system that can be difficult
to diagnose. We train our model on single-cell data obtained from blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for a cohort of seven MS patients and six healthy
adults (HA), resulting in 66,667 individual cells. We achieve 92 % accuracy in
predicting MS, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as a graph
convolutional network and a random forest classifier. Further, we use the
learned graph attention model to get insight into the features (cell types and
genes) that are important for this prediction. The graph attention model also
allow us to infer a new feature space for the cells that emphasizes the
differences between the two conditions. Finally we use the attention weights to
learn a new low-dimensional embedding that can be visualized. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first effort to use graph attention, and deep
learning in general, to predict disease state from single-cell data. We
envision applying this method to single-cell data for other diseases.

stimulate intense research on neuromimetic devices. This feature article is
devoted to various in materio implementation of neuromimetic processes,

neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI)
connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply
this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically
developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterise with
inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings, we additionally
perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing
to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble
model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774,
0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and task vs rest, respectively.
Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two
visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional
connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification.
Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also
able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre dataset,
finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing
different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed),
and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep
learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal
and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate
nucleus and paracentral sulcus.

Most molecular visualizers typically provide only a static view of a folded

vistas towards deploying multimodal biometric recognition systems in various
real-world applications. These systems have the ability to deal with the
limitations of unimodal biometric systems which are vulnerable to spoofing,
noise, non-universality and intra-class variations. In addition, the ocular
traits among various biometric traits are preferably used in these recognition
systems. Such systems possess high distinctiveness, permanence, and performance
while, technologies based on other biometric traits (fingerprints, voice etc.)
can be easily compromised. This work presents a novel deep learning framework
called SIP-SegNet, which performs the joint semantic segmentation of ocular
traits (sclera, iris and pupil) in unconstrained scenarios with greater
accuracy. The acquired images under these scenarios exhibit purkinje reflexes,
specular reflections, eye gaze, off-angle shots, low resolution, and various
occlusions particularly by eyelids and eyelashes. To address these issues,
SIP-SegNet begins with denoising the pristine image using denoising
convolutional neural network (DnCNN), followed by reflection removal and image
enhancement based on contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE).
Our proposed framework then extracts the periocular information using adaptive
thresholding and employs the fuzzy filtering technique to suppress this
information. Finally, the semantic segmentation of sclera, iris and pupil is
achieved using the densely connected fully convolutional encoder-decoder
network. We used five CASIA datasets to evaluate the performance of SIP-SegNet
based on various evaluation metrics. The simulation results validate the
optimal segmentation of the proposed SIP-SegNet, with the mean f1 scores of
93.35, 95.11 and 96.69 for the sclera, iris and pupil classes respectively.

are contracted it becomes a spherical mobile robot able to move in a fast pace
on land, embedding all spherical mobile robots properties. On the other hand,
when the spines or legs are extended in a controlled pattern, it can walk on
flat surfaces as well as move on snow and over rocks as a bionic sea urchin.
The spines of the robot are telescopic linear actuators, which combines soft
and hard 3D print materials to make the actuation unit flexible for compressing
it in minimal space and rigid for lifting the robot.

  Phosphorous",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How fast processes can we measure? Attosecond physics address the limit of
measurable time in science. Atomic X-ray excited states offers a way to study
extremely fast dynamics with chemical specificity. In black phosphorous an
X-ray excited electron can relocate in 22.7 attoseconds. Using the lifetime of
the P 1s core-hole as time-base, the radiationless decay spectrum can be used
to study charge transfer processes on the time-scale of the atomic unit of time
(24 attoseconds). We demonstrate that the technique can be extended to within a
few percent of the core hole's lifetime, an order of magnitude smaller than
previously thought.
