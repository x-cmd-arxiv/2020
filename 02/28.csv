  for Indoor Scenes from a Single Image","Accepted by CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic reconstruction of indoor scenes refers to both scene understanding
and object reconstruction. Existing works either address one part of this
problem or focus on independent objects. In this paper, we bridge the gap
between understanding and reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end solution to
jointly reconstruct room layout, object bounding boxes and meshes from a single
image. Instead of separately resolving scene understanding and object
reconstruction, our method builds upon a holistic scene context and proposes a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy with three components: 1. room layout with camera
pose; 2. 3D object bounding boxes; 3. object meshes. We argue that
understanding the context of each component can assist the task of parsing the
others, which enables joint understanding and reconstruction. The experiments
on the SUN RGB-D and Pix3D datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing methods in indoor layout estimation, 3D object detection
and mesh reconstruction.

single image super-resolution (SISR) by using large-scale external samples.
Despite their remarkable performance based on the external dataset, they cannot
exploit internal information within a specific image. Another problem is that
they are applicable only to the specific condition of data that they are
supervised. For instance, the low-resolution (LR) image should be a ""bicubic""
downsampled noise-free image from a high-resolution (HR) one. To address both
issues, zero-shot super-resolution (ZSSR) has been proposed for flexible
internal learning. However, they require thousands of gradient updates, i.e.,
long inference time. In this paper, we present Meta-Transfer Learning for
Zero-Shot Super-Resolution (MZSR), which leverages ZSSR. Precisely, it is based
on finding a generic initial parameter that is suitable for internal learning.
Thus, we can exploit both external and internal information, where one single
gradient update can yield quite considerable results. (See Figure 1). With our
method, the network can quickly adapt to a given image condition. In this
respect, our method can be applied to a large spectrum of image conditions
within a fast adaptation process.

process and is the initial step for important applications such as
fragmentation of molecules or laser ablation in solids. It is well understood
that an intense fs laser pulse can remove several electrons from an atom within
its pulse duration. [1] However, the speed of electron localization out of an
electron gas, the capture of an electron by ion, is unknown. Here, we
demonstrate that electronic localization out of the conduction band can occur
within only a few hundred femtoseconds. This ultrafast electron localization
into 4f states has been directly quantified by transient x-ray absorption
spectroscopy following photo-excitation of a Eu based correlated metal with a
fs laser pulse. Our x-ray experiments show that the driving force for this
process is either an ultrafast reduction of the energy of the 4f states, a
change of their bandwidth or an increase of the hybridization between the 4f
and the 3d states. The observed ultrafast electron localization process raises
further basic questions for our understanding of electron correlations and
their coupling to the lattice.

  central operator and decentralized producers in an electricity market","17 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Condition-based and predictive maintenance enable early detection of critical
system conditions and thereby enable decision makers to forestall faults and
mitigate them. However, decision makers also need to take the operational and
production needs into consideration for optimal decision-making when scheduling
maintenance activities. Particularly in network systems, such as power grids,
decisions on the maintenance of single assets can affect the entire network and
are, therefore, more complex. This paper proposes a two-level multi-agent
decision support systems for the generation maintenance decision (GMS) of power
grids in an electricity markets. The aim of the GMS is to minimize the
generation cost while maximizing the system reliability. The proposed framework
integrates a central coordination system, i.e. the transmission system operator
(TSO), and distributed agents representing power generation units that act to
maximize their profit and decide about the optimal maintenance time slots while
ensuring the fulfilment of the energy demand. The objective function of agents
(power generation companies) is based on the reward and the penalty that they
obtain from the interplay between power production and loss of production due
to failure, respectively. The optimal strategy of agents is then derived using
a distributed algorithm, where agents choose their optimal maintenance decision
and send their decisions to the central coordinating system. The TSO decides
whether to accept the agents' decisions by considering the market reliability
aspects and power supply constraints. To solve this coordination problem, we
propose a negotiation algorithm using an incentive signal to coordinate the
agents' and central system's decisions such that all the agents' decisions can
be accepted by the central system. We demonstrate the efficiency of our
proposed algorithm using a IEEE 39 bus system.

properties of the network model, including degree distribution, diameter,
clustering coefficient, as well as distribution of clique sizes, obtaining
explicit expressions for these relevant quantities, which agree with the
behaviors found in diverse real networks. Moreover, we obtain exact expressions
for all the eigenvalues and their associated multiplicities of the normalized
Laplacian matrix, based on which we derive explicit formulas for mixing time,
mean hitting time and the number of spanning trees. Thus, as previous models
generated by other graph products, our model is also an exactly solvable one,
whose structural properties can be analytically treated. More interestingly,
the expressions for the spectra of our model are also exactly determined, which
is sharp contrast to previous models whose spectra can only be given
recursively at most. This advantage makes our model a good test-bed and an
ideal substrate network for studying dynamical processes, especially those
closely related to the spectra of normalized Laplacian matrix, in order to
uncover the influences of simplicial structure on these processes.

Researchers have introduced various such flow operations, but few of these
allow rich interactions among variables without incurring significant
computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Woodbury transformations,
which achieve efficient invertibility via the Woodbury matrix identity and
efficient determinant calculation via Sylvester's determinant identity. In
contrast with other operations used in state-of-the-art normalizing flows,
Woodbury transformations enable (1) high-dimensional interactions, (2)
efficient sampling, and (3) efficient likelihood evaluation. Other similar
operations, such as 1x1 convolutions, emerging convolutions, or periodic

multiple image datasets, we find that Woodbury transformations allow learning
of higher-likelihood models than other flow architectures while still enjoying
their efficiency advantages.

the doped holes go into the oxygen orbitals. This requires a more elaborate
multi-band model such as the three-orbital Emery model. The recently discovered
nickelate superconductors appear, at first glance, to be even more complicated
multi-orbital systems. Here, we analyse this multi-orbital system and find that
it is instead the nickelates which can be described by a one-band Hubbard
model, albeit with an additional electron reservoir and only around the

social networks across multi-disciplines. The majority of the corresponding
research has focused on information diffusion independently, ignoring the
network evolution in the diffusion process. Therefore, it is more reasonable to
describe the real diffusion systems by the co-evolution between network
topologies and information states. In this work, we propose a mechanism
considering the coevolution between information states and network topology
simultaneously, in which the information diffusion was executed as an SIS
process and network topology evolved based on the adaptive assumption. The
theoretical analyses based on the Markov approach were very consistent with
simulation. Both simulation results and theoretical analyses indicated that the
adaptive process, in which informed individuals would rewire the links between
the informed neighbors to a random non-neighbor node, can enhance information
diffusion (leading to much broader spreading). In addition, we obtained that
two threshold values exist for the information diffusion on adaptive networks,
i.e., if the information propagation probability is less than the first
threshold, information cannot diffuse and dies out immediately; if the
propagation probability is between the first and second threshold, information
will spread to a finite range and die out gradually; and if the propagation
probability is larger than the second threshold, information will diffuse to a
certain size of population in the network. These results may shed some light on
understanding the co-evolution between information diffusion and network

insulator (EI) in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity. In an EI, two bands of a
semiconductor or semimetal spontaneously hybridize due to the Coulomb
interaction between electrons and holes, leading to the opening of a gap. The
coupling to the electromagnetic field reduces the symmetry of the system with
respect to phase rotations of the excitonic order parameter from $U(1)$ to
$Z_2$. While the reduction to a discrete symmetry would in general lead to a
gapped phase mode and enhance the stability of the ordered phase, the coupling
to the cavity leaves the mean-field ground state unaffected. Its energy remains
invariant under $U(1)$ phase rotations, in spite of the lower $Z_2$ symmetry
imposed by the cavity. In dipolar gauge, this can be traced back to the
balancing of the linear light-matter coupling and the dipolar self-interaction
at zero frequency. At nonzero frequency, however, the collective excitations do
reflect the lower $Z_2$ symmetry, which shows that fluctuations beyond
mean-field could play a crucial role in finding the true phase at finite
temperature.

based vocabulary. Then, as a self-supervised task, we train another convnet to
predict the histogram of visual words of an image (i.e., its Bag-of-Words

task forces the convnet to learn perturbation-invariant and context-aware image
features, useful for downstream image understanding tasks. We extensively
evaluate our method and demonstrate very strong empirical results, e.g., our
pre-trained self-supervised representations transfer better on detection task
and similarly on classification over classes ""unseen"" during pre-training, when
compared to the supervised case.
  This also shows that the process of image discretization into visual words

environment, e.g., in shared workspaces, continues to represent a major
challenge. Mismatches in the dynamic model of the robots, numerical
singularities, and the intrinsic environmental unpredictability are all
contributing factors. Online optimization of impedance controllers has recently
shown great promise in addressing this challenge, however, their performance is
not sufficiently robust to be deployed in challenging environments. This work
proposes a compliant control method for redundant manipulators based on a
superimposition of multiple passive task-space controllers in a hierarchy. Our
control framework of passive controllers is inherently stable, numerically
well-conditioned (as no matrix inversions are required), and computationally
inexpensive (as no optimization is used). We leverage and introduce a novel
stiffness profile for a recently proposed passive controller with smooth
transitions between the divergence and convergence phases making it
particularly suitable when multiple passive controllers are combined through
superimposition. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves sub-centimeter tracking performance during demanding dynamic tasks
with fast-changing references, while remaining safe to interact with and robust
to singularities. he proposed framework achieves such results without knowledge
of the robot dynamics and thanks to its passivity is intrinsically stable. The
data further show that the robot can fully take advantage of the redundancy to
maintain the primary task accuracy while compensating for unknown environmental
interactions, which is not possible from current frameworks that require
accurate contact information.

pairs of wires) and an initial order of the wires, a tangle realizes $L$ if
each pair of wires changes its order exactly as many times as specified by $L$.
Deciding whether a given multiset of swaps admits a realizing tangle is known
to be NP-hard [Yamanaka et al., CCCG 2018]. We prove that this problem remains
NP-hard if every pair of wires swaps only a constant number of times. On the
positive side, we improve the runtime of a previous exponential-time algorithm.
We also show that the problem is in NP and fixed-parameter tractable with
respect to the number of wires.

complete stress tensor sector of four-point functions in CFTs with a large

bootstrapping a certain ansatz for the stress tensor sector of the correlator,
iteratively computing the OPE coefficients of multi-stress tensor operators
with increasing twist. Some parameters are not fixed by the bootstrap - they
correspond to the OPE coefficients of multi-stress tensors with spin zero and
two. We further show that in holographic CFTs one can use the phase shift
computed in the dual gravitational theory to reduce the set of undetermined

that it is similar to that in elemental 3d ferromagnets. In contrast, the

density scenarios in static images. Current approaches cannot handle huge crowd
diversity well and thus perform poorly in extreme cases, where the crowd
density in different regions of an image is either too low or too high, leading
to crowd underestimation or overestimation. The proposed solution is based on
the observation that detecting and handling such extreme cases in a specialized
way leads to better crowd estimation. Additionally, existing methods find it
hard to differentiate between the actual crowd and the cluttered background
regions, resulting in further count overestimation. To address these issues, we
propose a simple yet effective modular approach, where an input image is first
subdivided into fixed-size patches and then fed to a four-way classification
module labeling each image patch as low, medium, high-dense or no-crowd. This
module also provides a count for each label, which is then analyzed via a
specifically devised novel decision module to decide whether the image belongs
to any of the two extreme cases (very low or very high density) or a normal
case. Images, specified as high- or low-density extreme or a normal case, pass
through dedicated zooming or normal patch-making blocks respectively before
routing to the regressor in the form of fixed-size patches for crowd estimate.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks under most of the
evaluation criteria.

generated in a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, offer a null model to study typical
properties of datasets and of machine learning algorithms. Up to now, most of
the literature focused on the characterization of low-dimensional random
geometric graphs whereas typical datasets of interest in machine learning live
in high-dimensional spaces ($d \gg 10^{2}$). In this work, we consider the
infinite dimensions limit of hard and soft random geometric graphs and we show
how to compute the average number of subgraphs of given finite size $k$, e.g.
the average number of $k$-cliques. This analysis highlights that local
observables display different behaviors depending on the chosen ensemble: soft
random geometric graphs with continuous activation functions converge to the
naive infinite dimensional limit provided by Erd\""os-R\'enyi graphs, whereas
hard random geometric graphs can show systematic deviations from it. We present
numerical evidence that our analytical insights, exact in infinite dimensions,
provide a good approximation also for dimension $d\gtrsim10$.

multiple hybrid models were proposed recently to optimize MF performance by

general-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is
built. The Chinese public transportation system between over 340
prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with
layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail
routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities,
peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local
spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the
overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different
transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the
transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation
vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the
infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the
recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be
used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other
countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction
number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from
any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective
government interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to
trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from
empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The
model is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that
the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public
city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.

precision? We prove that this statistical reconstruction problem undergoes the
following Kosterlitz-Thouless type phase transition:
  -) If $T<T_{rec}^-$ , one can fully recover $\phi$ from the knowledge of
$\phi \pmod{\frac {2\pi} T}$. In this regime our proof relies on a new type of
Peierls argument which we call annealed Peierls argument and which allows us to
deal with an unknown quenched groundstate.
  -) If $T>T_{rec}^+$, it is impossible to fully recover the field $\phi$ from
the knowledge of $\phi \pmod{\frac {2\pi} T}$. To prove this result, we
generalise the delocalisation theorem by Fr\""ohlich-Spencer to the case of
integer-valued GFF in an inhomogeneous medium. This delocalisation result is of
independent interest and we give an application of our techniques to the {\em
random-phase Sine-Gordon model} in Appendix B. Also, an interesting connection
with Riemann-theta functions is drawn along the proof.
  This statistical reconstruction problem is motivated by the two-dimensional
XY and Villain models. Indeed, at low-temperature $T$, the large scale
fluctuations of these continuous spin systems are conjectured to be governed by
a Gaussian free field. It is then natural to ask if one can recover the
underlying macroscopic GFF from the observation of the spins of the XY or
Villain model.
  Another motivation for this work is that it provides us with an ``integrable

significant fraction exhibit photometric variability. However, no systematic
investigation has been conducted on the variability of extragalactic YSOs. Here
we present the first variability study of massive YSOs in a $\sim
1.5\,\mathrm{deg^2}$ region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The aim is to
investigate whether the different environmental conditions in the metal-poor
LMC ($\sim$ 0.4-0.5 Z_sun) have an impact on the variability characteristics.
Multi-epoch near-infrared (NIR) photometry was obtained from the VISTA Survey
of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) and our own monitoring campaign using the VISTA
telescope. By applying a reduced $\chi^2$-analysis, stellar variability was
identified. We found 3062 candidate variable stars from a population of 362 425
stars detected. Based on several Spitzer studies, we compiled a sample of
high-reliability massive YSOs: a total of 173 massive YSOs have NIR
counterparts ($K_{\mathrm{s}}\sim 18.5\,$mag) in the VMC catalogue, of which 39
display significant ($>3\sigma$) variability. They have been classified as
eruptive, fader, dipper, short-term variable and long-period variable YSOs
based mostly on the appearance of their $K_{\mathrm{s}}$ band light curves. The
majority of YSOs are aperiodic, only five YSOs exhibit periodic lightcurves.
The observed amplitudes are comparable or smaller than those for Galactic YSOs
(only two Magellanic YSOs exhibit $\Delta K_{\mathrm{s}}>1\,$mag), not what
would have been expected from the typically larger mass accretion rates
observed in the Magellanic Clouds.

high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach is more sample efficient than existing exploration methods,
particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we
analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our

diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially
more for interacting with objects that it can control.

measuring cosmological distances and has therefore emerged as a leading probe
of cosmic expansion history. However, any physical effect that alters the
length of the ruler can lead to a bias in our determination of distance and
expansion rate. One of these physical effects is the streaming velocity, the
relative velocity between baryons and dark matter in the early Universe, which
couples to the BAO scale due to their common origin in acoustic waves at
recombination. In this work, we investigate the impact of streaming velocity on
the BAO feature of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest auto-power spectrum, one of the
main tracers being used by the recently commissioned DESI spectrograph. To do
this, we develop a new perturbative model for Lyman-$\alpha$ flux density
contrast which is complete to second order for a certain set of fields, and
applicable to any redshift-space tracer of structure since it is based only on
symmetry considerations. We find that there are 8 biasing coefficients through
second order. We find streaming velocity-induced shifts in the BAO scale of
0.081--0.149% (transverse direction) and 0.053--0.058% (radial direction),
depending on the model for the biasing coefficients used. These are smaller
than, but not negligible compared to, the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ BAO error budget,
which is 0.46% on the overall scale. The sensitivity of these results to our
choice of bias parameters underscores the need for future work to measure the
higher-order biasing coefficients from simulations, especially for future

most important assumptions made when investigating electromagnetic phenomena.
Breaking this assumption is expected to open up novel possibilities and result
in exceeding conventional limitations. However, to explore the field of
time-varying electromagnetic structures, we primarily need to contemplate the
fundamental principles and concepts from a nonstationarity perspective. Here,
we revisit one of those key concepts: The polarizability of a small particle,
assuming that its properties vary in time. We describe the creation of induced
dipole moment by external fields in a nonstationary, causal way, and introduce
a complex-valued function, called temporal complex polarizability, for
elucidating a nonstationary Hertzian dipole under time-harmonic illumination.
This approach can be extended to any subwavelength particle exhibiting electric
response. In addition, we also study the classical model of the polarizability
of an oscillating electron using the equation of motion whose damping
coefficient and natural frequency are changing in time. Next, we theoretically
derive the effective permittivity corresponding to time-varying media
(comprising free or bound electrons, or dipolar meta-atoms) and explicitly show
the differences with the conventional macroscopic Drude-Lorentz model. This
paper will hopefully pave the road towards better understanding of
nonstationary scattering from small particles and homogenization of
time-varying materials, metamaterials, and metasurfaces.

momentum space and includes short-range-correlated random potential which
allows for scattering between the nodes and near each node. In contrast with
the previously studied models in dimensions $d<3$, the model considered here
exhibits a critical scaling of the Thouless conductance which allows for {an
accurate} determination of the critical properties of the non-Anderson
transition, with a precision significantly exceeding the results obtained from
the critical scaling of the density of states, usually simulated at such
transitions. We find that in the limit of the vanishing parameter
$\varepsilon=2\alpha-1$ the correlation-length exponent
$\nu=2/(3|\varepsilon|)$ at the transition is inconsistent with the prediction
$\nu_{RG}=1/|\varepsilon|$ of the perturbative renormalisation-group analysis.

while the training is done at server machines. However, retraining or
customizing a model is required at edge devices as the model is becoming
outdated due to environmental changes over time. To follow such a concept
drift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is recently proposed,
so that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to update their model. In
this case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices, the issue is
that only a limited amount of training data can be used for each edge device.
To address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or federated
learning, where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their
model by using those collected from the other devices. In this paper, as an
on-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme
Learning Machine) to sequentially train a model based on recent samples and
combine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection. We extend it for an
on-device federated learning so that edge devices can exchange their trained
results and update their model by using those collected from the other edge
devices. This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be repeatedly
applied to synchronize their model. Our approach is evaluated with anomaly
detection tasks generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity
dataset, and MNIST dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed on-device
federated learning can produce a merged model by integrating trained results
from multiple edge devices as accurately as traditional backpropagation based

clinical assessments at specialized LVAD centers. Remote analysis of digitally

cardiac support in LVAD recipients, facilitating real-time, remote monitoring
for early detection of complications. To our knowledge, prior studies of

than intrinsic heart sounds, due to a focus on detecting pump complications,
and perhaps the obscuring of heart sounds by LVAD noise. In this letter, we
describe an adaptive filtering method to remove sounds generated by the LVAD,

same size. Since Ferrers shapes are a subclass of D-free shapes, this result
can be seen as a generalization of previous analogous results for Ferrers
shapes.
  As our second main result, we construct a bijection between 01-fillings of an
arbitrary skew shape that avoid a south-east chain of size 2, and the
01-fillings of the same shape that simultaneously avoid a north-east chain of
size 2 and a particular non-square subfilling. This generalizes a previous
result for transversal fillings.

epidemic threshold of certain network dynamics. In this work, we develop
techniques that identify which nodes have the largest impact on the leading

this analysis we derive two new centrality measures: X-degree and

the phase difference. We show that under experimentally viable conditions the

that the density modulations in the two gases interplay with the relative phase

Nevertheless, existing algorithms for distributed optimization generally do not

rigorous notion of ""locality"" that quantifies the degree to which agents can

simple algorithm in which agents individually solve a truncated sub-problem of

to find a procedure for testing multiple hypotheses that accounts for this

The assignment of the Raman-active modes to definite atomic vibrations is
supported by two types of lattice-dynamical calculations: empirical shell-model
and $\textit{ab initio}$ DFT. The temperature dependencies of the lineshape
parameters of some Raman-active vibrations near to the
antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition infers for a significant
spin-lattice coupling in this compound. The most informative in this aspect is
the $B_{3g}$ phonon at 387 cm$^{-1}$, which overlays a broad scattering
background and displays a pronounced asymmetric Fano-lineshape. The asymmetry
increases in the paramagnetic state above the Neel temperature ($T_{\text{N}}$
= 393 K) indicating a strong interaction of this mode with the underlying
excitation continuum. The origin of the excitation background is discussed in
light of our experimental results and the existing data for the magnetic
structure and transport properties of $\alpha-$FeOOH. We rationalize that, most
probably, the background stems from magnetic excitations, and the asymmetric
shape of the $B_{3g}$ phonon is a result of a linear spin-phonon coupling of
this mode with the Fe-O1-Fe spin dimers. Another mechanism, a phonon
interaction with thermally activated charge carriers above above
$T_{\text{N}}$, is also considered.

Therefore, as the dimension of the code or the size of the underlying finite
field increase, so it does exponentially the run time. In this work, we prove
that, given a generating matrix, there exists a column permutation which leads
to a reduced row echelon form containing a row whose weight is the code
distance. This result enables the use of permutations as representation scheme,
in contrast to the usual discrete representation, which makes the search of the
optimum polynomial time dependent from the base field. In particular, we have
implemented genetic and CHC algorithms using this representation as a proof of
concept. Experimental results have been carried out employing codes over fields
with two and eight elements, which suggests that evolutionary algorithms with
our proposed permutation encoding are competitive with regard to existing
methods in the literature. As a by-product, we have found and amended some
inaccuracies in the MAGMA Computational Algebra System concerning the stored
distances of some linear codes.

quantify the contributions of individuals within groups, and more recently

not account for statistical aspects of the data and does not give a way to
reason about points outside the data set. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel framework -- distributional Shapley -- where the value of a

that distributional Shapley has several desirable statistical properties; for
example, the values are stable under perturbations to the data points
themselves and to the underlying data distribution. We leverage these
properties to develop a new algorithm for estimating values from data, which
comes with formal guarantees and runs two orders of magnitude faster than

We determine the transition scale between these regimes and show that UV brane
correlation functions are independent of IR brane-localized operators for
four-momenta beyond this transition scale. The same bulk interactions that
induce the transition also give rise to cascade decays. We study these cascade
decays for the case of a cubic self-interaction in the continuum regime. We
find that the cascade decay progresses slowly towards the IR region and gives
rise to soft spherical final states, in accordance with former results from
both gravity and CFT. We identify a recursion relation between integrated
squared amplitudes of different leg numbers and thus evaluate the total rate.
We find that cascade decays in the continuum regime are exponentially
suppressed. This feature completes the picture of the IR brane as an emergent
sector as seen from the UV brane. We briefly discuss consistency with the

observations of a dynamical system obtained offline, e.g., images obtained from
self-supervised robot interaction. Most previous works on VP approached the
problem by planning in a learned latent space, resulting in low-quality visual
plans, and difficult training algorithms. Here, instead, we propose a simple VP
method that plans directly in image space and displays competitive performance.
We build on the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method: image samples
are treated as nodes in a graph, the graph connectivity is learned from image
sequence data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search
methods. We propose two modifications on SPTM. First, we train an energy-based
graph connectivity function using contrastive predictive coding that admits
stable training. Second, to allow zero-shot planning in new domains, we learn a
conditional VAE model that generates images given a context of the domain, and
use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph and
planning. We show that this simple approach significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art VP methods, in terms of both plan interpretability and success
rate when using the plan to guide a trajectory-following controller.
Interestingly, our method can pick up non-trivial visual properties of objects,
such as their geometry, and account for it in the plans.

against disorder in topological lasers. However, the lifetime strongly depends
on the edge-mode dispersion around the lasing frequency. As a result, the

the emitted light. On the other hand, amplitude fluctuations and the

interest for quantum information science and for our understanding of quantum

coupled Kondo impurities, a Kondo triangle, which can be used to further extend
the application of these concepts to electronic systems. We show that, by
tuning the magnetic frustration, the Kondo triangle undergoes a quantum phase
transition between two phases of unbroken symmetry, signaling a phase
transition beyond the Landau paradigm. We demonstrate that the frustrated spin
liquid phase is described by a three-channel Kondo (3CK) fixed point and thus
displays an irrational ground state degeneracy. Using an Abrikosov
pseudofermion representation, this quantum state is categorized by an emergent
U(1) gauge field and its projective symmetry group. The gauge theory is
deconfining in the sense that a miniature Wilson loop orders and topological
defects (instantons in the gauge field) are expelled. This phase persists in
the presence of moderate Kondo screening until proliferation of topological
defects leads to a quantum phase transition to an unfrustrated Fermi liquid
phase. Based on this evidence, we propose that the 3CK phase displays
topological order in a similar sense as gapless spin liquids.

factorise into a product of ascending Slater determinants in Baxter
Q-functions. Finally, we construct raising and lowering operators -- the

space-temporal prior, treating time as the third dimension. The rationale
behind this model is that a continuous evolution of a cartoon-like object is
well suited for the use of 3D shearlets. We provide a basic mathematical
analysis of the variational model for the image reconstruction. The numerical
minimization is carried out with primal-dual scheme coupled with an automated

focused on using classification performance, e.g., Inception Score (IS) and
statistical metrics, e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). Here, we
consider a fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images
they generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers. We
characterize the performance of a GAN as an image generator according to three
aspects: 1) Creativity: non-duplication of the real images. 2) Inheritance:
generated images should have the same style, which retains key features of the
real images. 3) Diversity: generated images are different from each other. A
GAN should not generate a few different images repeatedly. Based on the three
aspects of ideal GANs, we have designed the Likeness Score (LS) to evaluate GAN
performance, and have applied it to evaluate several typical GANs. We compared
our proposed measure with two commonly used GAN evaluation methods: IS and FID,
and four additional measures. Furthermore, we discuss how these evaluations
could help us deepen our understanding of GANs and improve their performance.

bright, nearby Seyfert galaxy, Ark 120 using a ~50-day observing programme with
Swift and a ~4-month co-ordinated ground-based observing campaign,
predominantly using the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network. We find Ark 120 to be
variable at all optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths, with the variability
observed to be well-correlated between wavelength bands on short timescales. We
perform cross-correlation analysis across all available wavelength bands,
detecting time delays between emission in the X-ray band and the Swift V, B and
UVW1 bands. In each case, we find that the longer-wavelength emission is
delayed with respect to the shorter-wavelength emission. Within our measurement
uncertainties, the time delays are consistent with the \tau ~ \lambda^{4/3}
relation, as predicted by a disc reprocessing scenario. The measured lag
centroids are \tau_{cent} = 11.90 +/- 7.33, 10.80 +/- 4.08, and 10.60 +/- 2.87
days between the X-ray and V, B, and UVW1 bands, respectively. These time
delays are longer than those expected from standard accretion theory and, as
such, Ark 120 may be another example of an active galaxy whose accretion disc
appears to exist on a larger scale than predicted by the standard thin-disc
model. Additionally, we detect further inter-band time delays: most notably
between the ground-based I and B bands (\tau_{cent} = 3.46 +/- 0.86 days), and
between both the Swift XRT and UVW1 bands and the I band (\tau_{cent} = 12.34
+/- 4.83 and 2.69 +/- 2.05 days, respectively), highlighting the importance of
co-ordinated ground-based optical observations.

observations offer exceptional views of wave behavior and its impact on the
surrounding atmosphere. The stratified plasma gradients present in the lower
solar atmosphere allow for the potential formation of many theorized shock
phenomena. In this study, using chromospheric Ca II 854.2nm spectropolarimetric
data of a large sunspot, we examine fluctuations in the plasma parameters in
the aftermath of powerful shock events that demonstrate polarimetric reversals
during their evolution. Modern inversion techniques are employed to uncover
perturbations in the temperatures, line-of-sight velocities, and vector
magnetic fields occurring across a range of optical depths synonymous with the
shock formation. Classification of these non-linear signatures is carried out
by comparing the observationally-derived slow, fast, and Alfv\'en shock
solutions to the theoretical Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Employing over 200,000
independent measurements, we reveal that the Alfv\'en (intermediate) shock
solution provides the closest match between theory and observations at optical

the unusually persistent broad emission lines in the blue compact dwarf galaxy
PHL 293B. The galaxy's unusual spectral features (P Cygni-like profiles with
$\sim$800 km s$^{-1}$ blueshifted absorption lines) have resulted in
conflicting interpretations of the nature of this source in the literature.
However, analysis of new Gemini spectroscopy reveals the broad emission has
begun to fade after being persistent for over a decade prior. Precise
difference imaging light curves constructed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

$\sim$0.1 mag in the g band offset by $100\pm21$ pc from the brightest pixel of
the host. The light curve is well-described by an active galactic nuclei

the optical variability and spectral features of PHL 293B is due to a
long-lived stellar transient, likely a Type IIn supernova or non-terminal
outburst, mimicking long-term AGN-like variability. This work highlights the
challenges of discriminating between scenarios in such extreme environments,
relevant to searches for AGNs in dwarf galaxies. This is the second long-lived
transient discovered in a blue compact dwarf, after SDSS1133. Our result
implies such long-lived stellar transients may be more common in

companion paper, we showed that in a $10^\circ$ radius region of interest (ROI)
surrounding the Galactic Center, apparent evidence for GCE point sources (PSs)
from non-Poissonian template fitting (NPTF) is actually an artifact of
unmodeled north-south asymmetry of the GCE. In this work, we develop a
simplified analytic description of how signal mismodeling can drive an apparent
preference for a PS population, and demonstrate how the behavior pointed out in
the companion paper also appears in simpler simulated datasets that contain no
PS signals at all. We explore the generality of this behavior in the real
gamma-ray data, and discuss the implications for past and future studies using
NPTF techniques. While the drop in PS preference once north-south asymmetry is
included is not ubiquitous in larger ROIs, we show that any overly-rigid signal
model is expected to yield a spurious PS signal that can appear very
convincing: as well as apparent significance comparable to what one would
expect from a true PS population, the signal can exhibit stability against a
range of variations in the analysis, and a source count function that is very
consistent with previous apparent NPTF-based detections of a GCE PS population.
This contrasts with previously-studied forms of systematic mismodeling which
are unlikely to mimic a PS population in the same way. In the light of this
observation, and its explicit realization in the region where the GCE is
brightest, we argue that a dominantly smooth origin for the GCE is not in
tension with existing NPTF analyses.

matter annihilation. Firmly establishing the dark matter origin for this excess
is however complicated by challenges in modeling diffuse cosmic-ray foregrounds
as well as unresolved astrophysical sources, such as millisecond pulsars.
Non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF) is one statistical technique that has
previously been used to show that at least some fraction of the GeV excess is
likely due to a population of dim point sources. These results were recently
called into question by Leane and Slatyer (2019), who showed that a synthetic
dark matter annihilation signal injected on top of the real Fermi data is not
recovered by the NPTF procedure. In this work, we perform a dedicated study of
the Fermi data and explicitly show that the central result of Leane and Slatyer
(2019) is likely driven by the fact that their choice of model for the Galactic
foreground emission does not provide a sufficiently good description of the
data. We repeat the NPTF analyses using a state-of-the-art model for diffuse
gamma-ray emission in the Milky Way and introduce a novel statistical
procedure, based on spherical-harmonic marginalization, to provide an improved
description of the Galactic diffuse emission in a data-driven fashion. With
these improvements, we find that the NPTF results continue to robustly favor
the interpretation that the Galactic Center excess is due, in part, to
unresolved astrophysical point sources across the analysis variations that we

diagrams, while the spaxel spectra can lead to misinterpretation of the
observations. We find that the emission-line ratios of Abell 14 are consistent
with UV photo-ionized emission, however there are some pieces of evidence of an
additional thermal mechanism. The chemical abundances confirm its previous
classification as a Type I planetary nebula, without spatial variation. We
find, though, variation in the ionization correction factors (ICFs) as a
function of the slit position angle. The star at the geometric centre of Abell
14 has an A5 spectral type with an effective temperature of Teff = 7909$\pm$135
K and surface gravity log(g) = 1.4$\pm$0.1 cm s$^{-2}$. Hence, this star cannot
be responsible for the ionization state of the nebula. Gaia parallaxes of this
star yield distances between 3.6 and 4.5 kpc in good agreement with the
distance derived from a 3-dimensional photoionization modelling of Abell 14,
indicating the presence of a binary system at the centre of the planetary
nebula.

parameters have been investigated to improve SN Ia standardization though none
have been shown to significantly alter the determination of cosmological

host galaxies, of a 0.05 mag/Gyr dependence of standardized SN Ia luminosity on
host age which if extrapolated to higher redshifts, would be a bias up to 0.25
mag, challenging the inference of dark energy. We reanalyze this sample of
hosts using both the original method and a Bayesian hierarchical model and find
after a fuller accounting of the uncertainties the significance of a dependence
on age to be $\leq2\sigma$ and $\sim1\sigma$ after the removal of a single
poorly-sampled SN Ia. To test the claim that a trend seen in old stellar
populations can be applied to younger ages, we extend our analysis to a larger
sample which includes young hosts. We find the residual dependence of host age

be consistent with zero for 254 SNe Ia from the Pantheon sample, ruling out the
large but low significance trend seen in passive hosts.

investigate the relationship of luminous matter with their host dark matter
haloes by measuring the angular and spatial clustering of sources (two-point
statistics), using deep radio observation of ELAIS N1 (EN1) field with upgraded
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 300-500 MHz. We also analyze the 612

star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on their
radio luminosity. We find that the spatial clustering length and bias to the
dark matter density field of SFGs are smaller than AGNs at both frequencies.
This proves that AGNs are mainly hosted by massive haloes and hence strongly
clustered. However, a small decrease in the bias for both kind of sources at
higher frequency indicates that we are most likely tracing the faint objects
residing in less massive haloes at higher frequencies. Our results are in
excellent agreement with previous findings at radio and multi-frequency

gamma-ray bursts (GRB). This observed variability is widely attributed to an
intermittency of the central engine, through formation of strong internal
shocks in the GRB-emitting jet expelled by the engine. In this paper we study
numerically the propagation of hydrodynamic jets, injected periodically by a
variable engine, through the envelope of a collapsed star. By post-processing
the output of 3D numerical simulations, we compute the net radiative efficiency
of the outflow. We find that all intermittent jets are subject to heavy baryon
contamination that inhibits the emission at and above the photosphere well
below detection limits. This is in contrast to continuous jets that, as shown
recently, produce a highly variable gamma-ray photospheric emission with high
efficiency, owing to the interaction of the jet with the stellar envelope. Our
results challenge the variable engine model for hydrodynamic jets, and may
impose constraints on the duty cycle of GRB engines. If such systems exist in
nature, they are not expected to produce bright gamma-ray emission, but should
appear as X-ray, optical and radio transients that resemble a delayed GRB
afterglow signal.

steady state with a sub-thermal volume law entanglement emerges, which is
resistant to the disentangling action of measurements, suggesting a connection
to quantum error-correcting codes. Here we quantify these notions by
identifying a universal, subleading logarithmic contribution to the volume law
entanglement entropy: $S^{(2)}(A)=\kappa L_A+\frac{3}{2}\log L_A$ which bounds
the mutual information between a qudit inside region $A$ and the rest of the
system. Specifically, we find the power law decay of the mutual information
$I(\{x\}:\bar{A})\propto x^{-3/2}$ with distance $x$ from the region's
boundary, which implies that measuring a qudit deep inside $A$ will have
negligible effect on the entanglement of $A$. We obtain these results by
mapping the entanglement dynamics to the imaginary time evolution of an Ising
model, to which we can apply field-theoretic and matrix-product-state
techniques. Finally, exploiting the error-correction viewpoint, we assume that
the volume-law state is an encoding of a Page state in a quantum

$p_{c}\log[(d^{2}-1)({p_{c}^{-1}-1})]\le \log[(1-p_{c})d]$. The bound is

small fraction of FRBs. Through a Bayesian estimation method, we show how a
statistical analysis of the coincident associations of FRBs with CBC
gravitational wave (GW) events may test the hypothesis of these associations.
We show that during the operation period of advanced LIGO, the detection of
$\sim100$ ($\sim1000$) GW-less FRBs with dispersion measure (DM) values smaller
than 500 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ could reach the constraint that less than $10\%$

of FRBs with DM values smaller than 100 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ is required to reach
the same constraint for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. With the upgrade of
GW detectors, the same constraints for BBH and BNS mergers can be reached with
less FRBs or looser requirements for the DM values. It is also possible to pose
constraints on the fraction of each type of CBCs that are able to produce
observable FRBs based on the event density of FRBs and CBCs. This would further
constrain the dimensionless charge of black holes in binary BH systems.

we compare several hadron lists including both experimentally discovered and

security is critical. However, recently it has been demonstrated that motivated
adversaries are able to mislead ML systems by perturbing test data using
semantic transformations. While there exists a rich body of research providing
provable robustness guarantees for ML models against $\ell_p$ norm bounded
adversarial perturbations, guarantees against semantic perturbations remain
largely underexplored. In this paper, we provide TSS -- a unified framework for
certifying ML robustness against general adversarial semantic transformations.
First, depending on the properties of each transformation, we divide common
transformations into two categories, namely resolvable (e.g., Gaussian blur)
and differentially resolvable (e.g., rotation) transformations. For the former,
we propose transformation-specific randomized smoothing strategies and obtain
strong robustness certification. The latter category covers transformations
that involve interpolation errors, and we propose a novel approach based on
stratified sampling to certify the robustness. Our framework TSS leverages

to provide rigorous certification of robustness. We conduct extensive
experiments on over ten types of challenging semantic transformations and show
that TSS significantly outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, to the best
of our knowledge, TSS is the first approach that achieves nontrivial certified
robustness on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. For instance, our framework
achieves 30.4% certified robust accuracy against rotation attack (within $\pm
30^\circ$) on ImageNet. Moreover, to consider a broader range of

unforeseen image corruptions such as CIFAR-10-C and ImageNet-C.

To date, the only techniques that explicitly address delusion require
comprehensive search using tabular value estimates. In this paper, we develop
efficient methods to mitigate delusional bias by training Q-approximators with
labels that are ""consistent"" with the underlying greedy policy class. We
introduce a simple penalization scheme that encourages Q-labels used across
training batches to remain (jointly) consistent with the expressible policy

to be generated and tracked, thus mitigating the effect of premature (implicit)

of an entangled state from a finite number of trials. The statistical
confidence of such an experiment is typically expressed as the number of
observed standard deviations of witness violations. This method implicitly
assumes that the noise is well-behaved so that the central limit theorem
applies. In this work, we propose two methods to analyze witness experiments
where the states can be subject to arbitrarily correlated noise. Our first
method is a rejection experiment, in which we certify the creation of
entanglement by rejecting the hypothesis that the experiment can only produce
separable states. We quantify the statistical confidence by a p-value, which
can be interpreted as the likelihood that the observed data is consistent with
the hypothesis that only separable states can be produced. Hence a small
p-value implies large confidence in the witnessed entanglement. The method
applies to general witness experiments and can also be used to witness genuine
multipartite entanglement. Our second method is an estimation experiment, in
which we estimate and construct confidence intervals for the average witness
value. This confidence interval is statistically rigorous in the presence of
correlated noise. The method applies to general estimation problems, including
fidelity estimation. To account for systematic measurement and random setting
generation errors, our model takes into account device imperfections and we
show how this affects both methods of statistical analysis. Finally, we
illustrate the use of our methods with detailed examples based on a simulation

known about them. In this work we study three classes of biased compression

show for the first time that biased compressors can lead to linear convergence

the downsampling operations reduce computation and the required communication
bandwidth, it removes both redundant and salient information obliviously, which
results in accuracy degradation. Inspired by digital signal processing
theories, we analyze the spectral bias from the frequency perspective and
propose a learning-based frequency selection method to identify the trivial
frequency components which can be removed without accuracy loss. The proposed
method of learning in the frequency domain leverages identical structures of
the well-known neural networks, such as ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and Mask R-CNN,
while accepting the frequency-domain information as the input. Experiment
results show that learning in the frequency domain with static channel

downsampling approach and meanwhile further reduce the input data size.
Specifically for ImageNet classification with the same input size, the proposed

MobileNetV2, respectively. Even with half input size, the proposed method still
improves the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50 by 1%. In addition, we observe a 0.8%

from $e^+e^-\to {\rm (hadrons)}$ below the charm threshold rely on finite
energy sum rules (FESRs) where the experimental side is given by integrated
spectral function moments. Here we study the renormalons that appear in the
Borel transform of polynomial moments in the large-$\beta_0$ limit and in full
QCD. In large-$\beta_0$, we establish a direct connection between the
renormalons and the perturbative behaviour of moments often employed in the
literature. The leading IR singularity is particularly prominent and is behind
the fate of moments whose perturbative series are unstable, while those with
good perturbative behaviour benefit from partial cancellations of renormalon
singularities. The conclusions can be extended to QCD through a convenient
scheme transformation to the $C$-scheme together with the use of a modified
Borel transform which make the results particularly simple; the leading IR
singularity becomes a simple pole, as in large-$\beta_0$. Finally, for the
moments that display good perturbative behaviour, we discuss an optimized
truncation based on renormalisation scheme (or scale) variation. Our results
allow for a deeper understanding of the perturbative behaviour of integrated
spectral function moments and provide theoretical support for low-$Q^2$
$\alpha_s$ determinations.

coordinate interactions (i.e. constraints) in cooperative multi-agent systems.
The traditional DCOP model assumes that variables owned by the agents can take
only discrete values and constraints' cost functions are defined for every
possible value assignment of a set of variables. While this formulation is
often reasonable, there are many applications where the variables are
continuous decision variables and constraints are in functional form. To
overcome this limitation, Functional DCOP (F-DCOP) model is proposed that is
able to model problems with continuous variables. The existing F-DCOPs
algorithms experience huge computation and communication overhead. This paper
applies continuous non-linear optimization methods on Cooperative Constraint

robust topological graph guided approach for line segment detection in low

segments with a line segment connectivity graph, which means the topological
relationships (e.g., intersection, an isolated line segment) of the detected
line segments are captured and stored; whereas other line detectors only retain
a collection of loose line segments. Our empirical results show that the
TGGLines detector visually and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art line
segment detection methods. In addition, our TGGLines approach has the following
two competitive advantages: (1) our method only requires one parameter and it
is adaptive, whereas almost all other line segment detection methods require
multiple (non-adaptive) parameters, and (2) the line segments detected by
TGGLines are organized by a line segment connectivity graph.

  signals and cues",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Honest signals and cues have been observed as part of interspecific and
intraspecific communication among animals. Recent theories suggest that
existing signaling systems have evolved through natural selection imposed by
predators. Honest signaling in the interspecific communication can provide
insight into the evolution of anti-predation techniques. In this work, we
introduce a deterministic three-stage, two-species predator-prey model, which
modulates the impact of honest signals and cues on the interacting populations.
The model is built from a set of first principles originated from signaling and
social learning theory in which the response of predators to transmitted honest
signals or cues is determined. The predators then use the signals to decide
whether to pursue the attack or save their energy for an easier catch. Other
members from the prey population that are not familiar with signaling their
fitness observe and learn the technique. Our numerical bifurcation analysis
indicates that increasing the predator's search rate and the corresponding
assimilation efficiency gives a journey from predator-prey abundance and
scarcity, a stable transient cycle between persistence and near-extinction, a
homoclinic orbit pointing towards extinction, and ultimately, a quasi-periodic
orbit. A similar discovery is met under the increment of the prey's intrinsic
birth rate and carrying capacity. When both parameters are of sufficiently
large magnitudes, the separator between honest signal and cue takes the similar
journey from a stable equilibrium to a quasi-periodic orbit as it increases. In
the context of modeling, we conclude that under prey abundance, transmitting
error-free honest signals leads to not only a stable but also more predictable
predator-prey dynamics.

simulation a novel nanostructured material design that can lead to
unprecedentedly high thermoelectric power factors, with improvements of more
than an order of magnitude compared to optimal bulk material power factors. The
design is based on a specific grain/grain-boundary (potential well/barrier)
engineering such that: i) carrier energy filtering is achieved using potential
barriers, combined with ii) higher than usual doping operating conditions such
that high carrier velocities and mean-free-paths are utilized, iii) minimal
carrier energy relaxation after passing over the barriers to propagate the high
Seebeck coefficient of the barriers into the potential wells, and importantly,
iv) the formation of an intermediate dopant-free (depleted) region. The design
consists thus of a three-region geometry, in which the high doping resides in
the center/core of the potential well, with a dopant-depleted region separating
the doped region from the potential barriers. It is shown that the filtering
barriers are optimal when they mitigate the reduction in conductivity they
introduce, and this can be done primarily when they are clean from dopants
during the process of filtering. The potential wells, on the other hand, are
optimal when they mitigate the reduced Seebeck they introduce by: i) not
allowing carrier energy relaxation, and importantly ii) by mitigating the
reduction in mobility that the high concentration of dopant impurities cause.
Dopant segregation, with clean dopant-depletion regions around the potential
barriers, serves this key purpose of improved mobility towards the
phonon-limited mobility levels in the wells. Using quantum transport
simulations as well as semi-classical Monte Carlo simulations we also verify
the important ingredients and validate this clean-filtering design.

these attacks remain blurry. In contrast, the results obtained so far for a
quantum adversary making classical queries only are less impressive. In this
paper, we introduce a new quantum algorithm which uses Simon's subroutines in a
novel way. We manage to leverage the algebraic structure of cryptosystems in
the context of a quantum attacker limited to classical queries and offline
quantum computations. We obtain improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs
with respect to the current literature, while using only as much hardware
requirements (quantum and classical) as a standard exhaustive search with
Grover's algorithm. In particular, we are able to break the Even-Mansour
construction in quantum time $\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical
queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits only. In addition, we improve some previous
superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to
polynomial, with the same time complexity. Our approach can be seen in two
complementary ways: \emph{reusing} superposition queries during the iteration
of a search using Grover's algorithm, or alternatively, removing the memory
requirement in some quantum attacks based on a collision search, thanks to
their algebraic structure. We provide a list of cryptographic applications,
including the Even-Mansour construction, the FX construction, some Sponge
authenticated modes of encryption, and many more.

  problems",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces the 2019 version of \us{}, a novel Constraint
Programming framework for floating point verification problems expressed with
the SMT language of SMTLIB. SMT solvers decompose their task by delegating to
specific theories (e.g., floating point, bit vectors, arrays, ...) the task to
reason about combinatorial or otherwise complex constraints for which the SAT
encoding would be cumbersome or ineffective. This decomposition and encoding
processes lead to the obfuscation of the high-level constraints and a loss of
information on the structure of the combinatorial model. In \us{}, constraints
over the floats are first class objects, and the purpose is to expose and
exploit structures of floating point domains to enhance the search process. A
symbolic phase rewrites each SMTLIB instance to elementary constraints, and
eliminates auxiliary variables whose presence is counterproductive. A
diversification technique within the search steers it away from costly
enumerations in unproductive areas of the search space. The empirical
evaluation demonstrates that the 2019 version of \us{} is competitive on
computationally challenging floating point benchmarks that induce significant
search efforts even for other CP solvers. It highlights that the ability to
harness both inference and search is critical. Indeed, it yields a factor 3
improvement over Colibri and is up to 10 times faster than SMT solvers. The
evaluation was conducted over 214 benchmarks (The Griggio suite) which is a
standard within SMTLIB.

the optimization of the phenomenon of self-induced stochastic resonance in a
delayed multiplex neural network by using analytical and numerical methods. We
consider a two-layer multiplex network, in which at the intra-layer level
neurons are coupled either by electrical synapses or by inhibitory chemical
synapses. For each isolated layer, computations indicate that weaker electrical
and chemical synaptic couplings are better optimizers of self-induced
stochastic resonance. In addition, regardless of the synaptic strengths,
shorter electrical synaptic delays are found to be better optimizers of the
phenomenon than shorter chemical synaptic delays, while longer chemical
synaptic delays are better optimizers than longer electrical synaptic delays --
in both cases, the poorer optimizers are in fact worst. It is found that
electrical, inhibitory, or excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers
having only electrical synapses at the intra-layer levels can each optimize the
phenomenon. And only excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having
only inhibitory chemical synapses at the intra-layer levels can optimize the

artificial neural circuits, as well as in real biological neural networks.

argue that there may be a systematic approximation scheme for processes where N
particles near threshold scatter to produce N particles, and discuss the
leading contributions to the scattering amplitude and cross sections in this
limit. Scattering amplitudes do not grow as rapidly as in perturbation theory.
Additionally, partial and total cross sections do not show factorial growth. In
the case of cross sections for $2 \to N$ particles, there is no systematic
large N approximation available. That said, we provide evidence that
non-perturbatively, there is no factorial growth in partial or total cross

question that arises is whether the meta-learning idea can be used for
improving the generalization of DNNs on the standard supervised learning. In
this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning based training procedure (MLTP)
for DNNs and demonstrate that the meta-learning idea can indeed improve the
generalization abilities of DNNs. MLTP simulates the meta-training process by
considering a batch of training samples as a task. The key idea is that the
gradient descent step for improving the current task performance should also
improve a new task performance, which is ignored by the current standard
procedure for training neural networks. MLTP also benefits from all the
existing training techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and batch
normalization. We evaluate MLTP by training a variety of small and large neural
networks on three benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny
ImageNet. The experimental results show a consistently improved generalization
performance on all the DNNs with different sizes, which verifies the promise of
MLTP and demonstrates that the meta-learning idea is indeed able to improve the

pi-conjugated materials that can play a critical role in optoelectronic
processes such as, energy harvesting, photoprotection and singlet fission.
Despite this widespread importance, direct experimental characterisations of
the electronic structure of the S1 (21Ag-) wavefunction have remained scarce
and uncertain, although advanced theory predicts it to have a rich
multi-excitonic character. Here, studying an archetypal polymer,
polydiacetylene, and carotenoids, we experimentally demonstrate that S1 (21Ag-)
is a superposition state with strong contributions from spin-entangled pairs of
triplet excitons (1(TT)). We further show that optical manipulation of the S1
(21Ag-) wavefunction using triplet absorption transitions allows selective
projection of the 1(TT) component into a manifold of spatially separated
triplet-pairs with lifetimes enhanced by up to one order of magnitude and whose
yield is strongly dependent on the level of inter-chromophore coupling. Our
results provide a unified picture of 21Ag-states in pi-conjugated materials and
open new routes to exploit their dynamics in singlet fission, photobiology and
for the generation of entangled (spin-1) particles for molecular quantum
technologies.

However, when an ER schema is transformed to a Relational Database Schema

meaningfully on the RDS. This causes a loss of information during the
transformation process. Although, several previous researches have proposed
solutions to remedy the situation, the problem still exists. Thus, in this
on-going research, we wish to improve the proposed solutions and maximize
information preservation in the ER to relational transformation process.
Cardinality ratio constraints, role names, composite attributes, and certain
relationship types are among the information frequently lost in the
transformation process. Deficiencies in the ER model and the transformation
method seems to cause this situation. We take the view that if the information
lost is resolved; a one-to-one mapping should exist from the ER schema to its
RDS. We modified the ER model and the transformation algorithm following a
heuristic research method with a view to eliminating the deficiencies and
thereby achieving a one-to-one mapping. We should show that the mapping exists
for any real-world application. We create a generic ER schema - an ER schema
that represents any phenomena in symbolic form - and use it to show that a
one-to-one mapping exists for any real-world application. In this paper, we
explore our generic ER schema and its advantages over its predecessors in view

spectral lines offer additional opportunities for measuring surface wind speed.
As examples, we fit optical data for a black widow pulsar J1959+2048 and a
redback pulsar J2215+5135; the wind heating models (WH) are statistically
strongly preferred over direct heating (DH) for both objects, although the
latter is even better fit with a heated spot. In general, WH effects tend to
increase the inferred orbital inclination $i$ and decrease the inferred
companion center-of-mass radial velocity amplitude $K_\mathrm{c}$; both effects
decrease the inferred neutron star mass. Even with such a decrease, we find
large masses for the two neutron stars: $2.18\pm0.09M_\odot$ and
$2.28^{+0.10}_{-0.09}M_\odot$, respectively (for the modest surface speeds fit
from the bulk heat flow; supersonic photospheric winds can slightly change

utilization of all of the gathered samples, (2) the best performance can be
accomplished by means of a combination of specialized sampling behaviors
(Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, and locally fitted square
functions). From a software engineering point of view, GAPSO considers a
standard Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm as an ideal starting point for
creating a generalpurpose global optimization framework. Within this framework
hybrid optimization algorithms are developed, and various additional techniques
(like algorithm restart management or adaptation schemes) are tested. The paper
introduces a new version of the algorithm, abbreviated as M-GAPSO. In
comparison with the original GAPSO formulation it includes the following four
features: a global restart management scheme, samples gathering within an
R-Tree based index (archive/memory of samples), adaptation of a sampling
behavior based on a global particle performance, and a specific approach to
local search. The above-mentioned enhancements resulted in improved performance
of M-GAPSO over GAPSO, observed on both COCO BBOB testbed and in the black-box
optimization competition BBComp. Also, for lower dimensionality functions (up
to 5D) results of M-GAPSO are better or comparable to the state-of-the art
version of CMA-ES (namely the KL-BIPOP-CMA-ES algorithm presented at the GECCO
2017 conference).

GAN is applied to fully extract distributional information from historical data
in a nonparametric and unsupervised way without a priori approximation or
assumption. Since GAN utilizes deep neural networks, complicated data
distributions and modes can be learned, and it can model uncertainty
efficiently and accurately. Distributionally robust chance constrained
programming takes into consideration ambiguous probability distributions of
uncertain parameters. To tackle the computational challenges, sample average
approximation method is adopted, and the required data samples are generated by
GAN in an end-to-end way through the differentiable networks. The proposed
framework is then applied to supply chain optimization under demand
uncertainty. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated through
a county-level case study of a spatially explicit biofuel supply chain in

appear to decrease from 0.12 +/- 0.029 at 300 K to 0.075 +/- 0.006 at 125 K.
The current-voltage characteristics of the amorphized cells measured in the 85
K - 300 K using high-voltage sweeps (0 to ~25 V) show a combination of a
linear, low-field exponential and high-field exponential conduction mechanisms,
all of which are strong functions of temperature. The very first high-voltage
sweep after amorphization (with electric fields up to ~70% of the breakdown
field) shows clear hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics due to
accelerated drift, while the consecutive sweeps show stable characteristics.
Stabilization was achieved with 50 nA compliance current (current densities
~104 A/cm^2), preventing appreciable self-heating in the cells. The observed
acceleration and stoppage of the resistance drift with the application of high
electric fields is attributed to changes in the electrostatic potential profile
within amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 due to trapped charges, reducing tunneling current.
Stable current-voltage characteristics are used to extract carrier activation
energies for the conduction mechanisms in 85 K - 300 K temperature range. The
carrier activation energy associated with linear current-voltage response is
extracted to be 331 +/- 5 meV in 200 - 300 K range, while carrier activation
energies of 233 +/- 2 meV and 109 +/- 5 meV are extracted in 85 K to 300 K

technology for intelligent video analysis. Existing works mainly focus on
learning common representation by embedding different modalities into a same
feature space. However, only learning the common characteristics means great
information loss, lowering the upper bound of feature distinctiveness. In this
paper, we tackle the above limitation by proposing a novel cross-modality
shared-specific feature transfer algorithm (termed cm-SSFT) to explore the
potential of both the modality-shared information and the modality-specific
characteristics to boost the re-identification performance. We model the
affinities of different modality samples according to the shared features and
then transfer both shared and specific features among and across modalities. We
also propose a complementary feature learning strategy including modality
adaption, project adversarial learning and reconstruction enhancement to learn
discriminative and complementary shared and specific features of each modality,
respectively. The entire cm-SSFT algorithm can be trained in an end-to-end
manner. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the superiority of
the overall algorithm and the effectiveness of each component. The proposed

sophisticated curb edges extraction and parametrized 3D curb template fitting.
Using a few assumptions regarding the real world geometry, we can thus retrieve
the curb's height and its relative position w.r.t. the moving vehicle on which
the camera is mounted. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier fed with
Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used for appearance-based filtering
out outliers. In the second part, the detected curb regions are tracked in the

show that CGL can help alleviate a well-known causal confusion problem in

yielding instead a Turing pattern composed of a few interfering waves. These
resonators also support the localized soliton pulse as a separate nonlinear
stationary state. Kerr solitons are remarkably versatile for applications, but
they cannot emerge from constant excitation. Here, we explore an edge-less

denoised version of it, and a discriminator is trained to distinguish between
clean and adversarial samples. More precisely, we use a wavelet domain
algorithm for denoising images and demonstrate that the obtained residuals act
as a digital fingerprint for adversarial attacks. To emulate the limitations of
a physical adversary, we evaluate the performance of our approach against
localized (patch-based) adversarial attacks, including in settings where the
adversary has complete knowledge about the detection scheme. Our results show
that the proposed detection method generalizes to previously unseen, stronger
attacks and that it is able to reduce the success rate (conversely, increase
the computational effort) of an adaptive attacker.

all pure positional scoring rules: the PW problem is in P for the plurality and

problem was studied on classes of restricted partial orders that arise in
natural settings, such as partitioned partial orders and truncated partial

investigate the PW problem on partial chains, i.e., partial orders that are a
total order on a subset of their domains. Such orders arise naturally in a
variety of settings, including rankings of movies or restaurants. We classify
the complexity of the PW problem on partial chains by establishing that,
perhaps surprisingly, this restriction does not change the complexity of the

magnetic field strength of BHR 71 was found to be $B_{\rm pos} = 8.8 - 15.0$
$\mu$G, indicating that the BHR 71 core is magnetically supercritical with
$\lambda = 1.44 - 2.43$. Taking into account the effect of thermal/turbulent
pressure and the plane-of-sky magnetic field component, the critical mass of
BHR 71 was $M_{\rm cr} = 14.5-18.7$ M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent with the
observed core mass of $M_{\rm core} \approx 14.7$ M$_{\odot}$ (Yang et al.
2017). We conclude that BHR 71 is in a condition close to a kinematically
critical state, and the magnetic field direction lies close to the plane of
sky. Since BHR 71 is a star-forming core, a significantly subcritical condition
(i.e., the magnetic field direction deviating from the plane of sky) is
unlikely, and collapsed from a condition close to a kinematically critical
state. There are two possible scenarios to explain the curved magnetic fields
of BHR 71, one is an hourglass-like field structure due to mass accumulation

sensitive observations made with the Very Large Array revealed the presence of
a mJy double radio source apparently coincident in position with the infrared
source n. The radio source was assumed to be the counterpart of the infrared
source. However, over the years it has been concluded that the radio source
shows large proper motions to the south while the infrared source n is
stationary. Here we reanalyze the proper motions of the radio source adding
both older and newer VLA observations than previously used. We confirm the
proper motions of the radio source that at present no longer coincides
positionally with the infrared source. The solution to this problem is, most
probably, that the infrared source n and the radio source are not the same
object: the infrared source is a stationary object in the region while the
radio counterpart is moving as a result of the explosion that took place in
this region some 500 years ago and that expelled large amounts of molecular gas
as well as several compact sources. Considering the paper where it was first
reported, we refer to this double radio source as Orion MR.
  In addition, we use these new observations to fully confirm the large proper
motions of the sources IRc23 and Zapata 11. Together with sources BN, I, Orion
MR, and x, there are at least six compact sources that recede from a point in
common in Orion BN/KL. However, IRc23 is peculiar in that its ejection age
appears to be only $\sim$300 years. The relatively large number of sources
rules out as a possible mechanism the classic three-body scenario since then
only two escaping bodies are expected: a tight binary plus the third star

TATs for non-flagged (132+/-193 min) cases (p<0.05, one-sided t-test), where

graphs (DAGs) exploits the inherent parallelism presented by the model. For DAG
tasks, a node represents a request to execute an object on one of the available
processors. In one DAG task, there may be multiple execution requests for one
object, each represented by a distinct node. These distinct execution requests
offer an opportunity to reduce their combined cache overhead through
coordinated scheduling of objects as threads within a parallel task. The goal
of this work is to realize this opportunity by incorporating the cache-aware
BUNDLE-scheduling algorithm into federated scheduling of sporadic DAG task
sets.
  This is the first work to incorporate instruction cache sharing into
federated scheduling. The result is a modification of the DAG model named the
DAG with objects and threads (DAG-OT). Under the DAG-OT model, descriptions of
nodes explicitly include their underlying executable object and number of
threads. When possible, nodes assigned the same executable object are collapsed
into a single node; joining their threads when BUNDLE-scheduled. Compared to
the DAG model, the DAG-OT model with cache-aware scheduling reduces the number
of cores allocated to individual tasks by approximately 20 percent in the
synthetic evaluation and up to 50 percent on a novel parallel computing
platform implementation. By reducing the number of allocated cores, the DAG-OT
model is able to schedule a subset of previously infeasible task sets.

theories, regulators which preserve supersymmetry yield the correct quantum
corrections, as these are dictated by supersymmetry. However, in a general
theory it is not known which matching condition yields the correct mass. We use
the leading term in the operator that creates the soliton to construct the
regulated one-soliton sector Hamiltonian from that of the vacuum sector,

formula for the one-loop mass of a kink in a large class of 1+1 dimensional
scalar field theories and also, at one loop, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian
which describes the kink excitations.

and can serve as a precursor to more complex organic chemistry. We present an
ALMA survey of H$_2$CO towards 15 disks covering a range of stellar spectral
types, stellar ages, and dust continuum morphologies. H$_2$CO is detected
towards 13 disks and tentatively detected towards a 14th. We find both
centrally-peaked and centrally-depressed emission morphologies, and half of the
disks show ring-like structures at or beyond expected CO snowline locations.
Together these morphologies suggest that H$_2$CO in disks is commonly produced
through both gas-phase and CO-ice-regulated grain-surface chemistry. We extract
disk-averaged and azimuthally-averaged H$_2$CO excitation temperatures and
column densities for four disks with multiple H$_2$CO line detections. The
temperatures are between 20-50K, with the exception of colder temperatures in
the DM Tau disk. These temperatures suggest that H$_2$CO emission in disks is
generally emerging from the warm molecular layer, with some contributions from
the colder midplane. Applying the same H$_2$CO excitation temperatures to all
disks in the survey, we find that H$_2$CO column densities span almost three
orders of magnitude ($\sim 5 \times 10^{11} - 5 \times 10^{14}
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). The column densities appear uncorrelated with disk size and
stellar age, but Herbig Ae disks may have less H$_2$CO compared to T Tauri
disks, possibly because of less CO freeze-out. More H$_2$CO observations
towards Herbig Ae disks are needed to confirm this tentative trend, and to
better constrain under which disk conditions H$_2$CO and other oxygen-bearing
organics efficiently form during planet formation.

including many security concerning scenarios. However, a considerable amount of
work has proved its vulnerability to adversaries. We unravel the properties
that can intrinsically differentiate adversarial examples and normal inputs
through theoretical analysis. That is, adversarial examples generated by $L_2$
attacks usually have larger input sensitivity which can be used to identify
them efficiently. We also found that those generated by $L_\infty$ attacks will
be different enough in the pixel domain to be detected empirically. To verify
our analysis, we proposed a \textbf{G}uided \textbf{C}omplementary
\textbf{D}efense module (\textbf{GCD}) integrating detection and recovery
processes. When compared with adversarial detection methods, our detector
achieves a detection AUC of over 0.98 against most of the attacks. When
comparing our guided rectifier with commonly used adversarial training methods
and other rectification methods, our rectifier outperforms them by a large
margin. We achieve a recovered classification accuracy of up to 99\% on MNIST,
89\% on CIFAR-10, and 87\% on ImageNet subsets against $L_2$ attacks.
Furthermore, under the white-box setting, our holistic defensive module shows a
promising degree of robustness. Thus, we confirm that at least $L_2$
adversarial examples are intrinsically different enough from normal inputs both
theoretically and empirically. And we shed light upon designing simple yet
effective defensive methods with these properties.

train machine learning models such as Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models to rank
results for a given query, and implicit user feedbacks (e.g. click data) have
become the dominant source of data collection due to its abundance and low
cost, especially for major Internet companies. However, a drawback of this data
collection approach is the data could be highly biased, and one of the most
significant biases is the position bias, where users are biased towards
clicking on higher ranked results. In this work, we will investigate the
marginal importance of properly handling the position bias in an online test
environment in Tripadvisor Hotels search. We propose an empirically effective
method of handling the position bias that fully leverages the user action data.
We take advantage of the fact that when user clicks a result, he has almost
certainly observed all the results above, and the propensities of the results
below the clicked result will be estimated by a simple but effective position
bias model. The online A/B test results show that this method leads to an
improved search ranking model.

dark matter is comprised of compact objects, such as the black holes in the
10-100\,M$_\odot$ range whose existence has been confirmed by LIGO. The strong
gravitational lensing of transients such as FRBs and GRBs has been suggested as
a more sensitive probe for compact dark matter than intensity fluctuations
observed in microlensing experiments. Recently ASKAP has reported burst
substructure down to $15\mu$s timescales in FRBs in the redshift range
$0.3-0.5$. We investigate here the implications of this for the detectability
of compact dark matter by FRBs. We find that a sample size of $\sim130$ FRBs
would be required to constrain compact dark matter to less than the existing
35$\%$ limit with 95$\%$ confidence, if it were distributed along $\gtrsim
1\,$Gpc-long FRB sightlines through the cosmic web. Conversely, existing
constraints on the fraction of compact dark matter permit as many as 1 in
$\approx 40$ of all $z \lesssim 0.4$ FRBs to exhibit micro-lensed burst
structure. Approximately $170$ FRBs intercepting halos within $\sim 50\,$kpc
would be required to exclude the fraction of compact dark matter in each
intercepted halo to a similar level. Furthermore, we consider the cumulative
effects of lensing of the FRB signal by a macroscopic dark matter distribution.
We conclude that lensing from a uniform distribution of compact objects is
likely not observable, but suggest that FRBs may set meaningful limits on
power-law distributions of dark matter.

decision tree to partition a data set into clusters, so that clusters can be
characterized in a straightforward manner. We study this problem from a
theoretical viewpoint, measuring cluster quality by the $k$-means and
$k$-medians objectives: Must there exist a tree-induced clustering whose cost
is comparable to that of the best unconstrained clustering, and if so, how can
it be found? In terms of negative results, we show, first, that popular

an $\Omega(\log k)$ approximation factor compared to the optimal clustering. On
the positive side, we design an efficient algorithm that produces explainable
clusters using a tree with $k$ leaves. For two means/medians, we show that a

we give nearly-matching lower bounds. For general $k \geq 2$, our algorithm is
an $O(k)$ approximation to the optimal $k$-medians and an $O(k^2)$

by the new capability, here we present a spectropolarimetric analysis of FRB
181112 detected by ASKAP, localized to a galaxy at redshift 0.47. At
microsecond time resolution the burst is resolved into four narrow pulses with
a rise time of just $15 \mu$s for the brightest. The pulses have a diversity of
morphology, but do not show evidence for temporal broadening by turbulent
plasma along the line of sight, nor is there any evidence for periodicity in
their arrival times. The pulses are highly polarized (up to 95%), with the
polarization position angle varying both between and within pulses. The pulses
have apparent rotation measures that vary by $15\pm 2\, {\rm rad \,m^{-2}}$ and
apparent dispersion measures that vary by $0.041\pm 0.004\,{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$.
Conversion between linear and circular polarization is observed across the
brightest pulse. We conclude that the FRB 181112 pulses are most consistent
with being a direct manifestation of the emission process or the result of
propagation through a relativistic plasma close to the source. This

failure and a frequent reason for withdrawal of candidate drugs during
preclinical and clinical testing. An important type of DILI is cholestatic
liver injury, caused by buildup of bile salts within hepatocytes; it is
frequently associated with inhibition of bile salt transporters, such as the
bile salt export pump (BSEP). Reliable in silico models to predict BSEP
inhibition directly from chemical structures would significantly reduce costs
during drug discovery and could help avoid injury to patients. Unfortunately,
models published to date have been insufficiently accurate to encourage wide
adoption. We report our development of classification and regression models for
BSEP inhibition with substantially improved performance over previously
published models. Our model development leveraged the ATOM Modeling PipeLine
(AMPL) developed by the ATOM Consortium, which enabled us to train and evaluate
thousands of candidate models. In the course of model development, we assessed
a variety of schemes for chemical featurization, dataset partitioning and class
labeling, and identified those producing models that generalized best to novel
chemical entities. Our best performing classification model was a neural
network with ROC AUC = 0.88 on our internal test dataset and 0.89 on an
independent external compound set. Our best regression model, the first ever
reported for predicting BSEP IC50s, yielded a test set $R^2 = 0.56$ and mean
absolute error 0.37, corresponding to a mean 2.3-fold error in predicted IC50s,
comparable to experimental variation. These models will thus be useful as
inputs to mechanistic predictions of DILI and as part of computational
pipelines for drug discovery.

non-classical and in extreme cases such as AuSi, the surface crystallizes above
the melting point. In this study, we employ atomic-scale computational
frameworks to study the surface crystallization of AuSi films and droplets as a
function of composition, temperature and size. For temperatures in the range
$T_s^\ast=765-780$K above the melting point $(T_s^\ast\approx1.3\,T_m)$, both
thin film and droplet surfaces undergo a first order transition, from a 2D
Au$_2$Si crystalline phase to a laterally disordered yet stratified layer. The
thin film surfaces exhibit an effective surface tension that increases with
temperature and decreases with Si concentration. On the other hand, for
droplets in the size range $10-30$ nm, the bulk Laplace pressure alters the
surface segregation as it occurs with respect to a strained bulk. Above
$T_s^\ast$ the size effect on the surface tension is small, while for
$T<T_s^\ast$ the surface layer is strained and composed of 2D crystallites
separated by extended grain boundary scars that lead to large fluctuations in
its energetics. As a specific application, all-atom simulations of AuSi
droplets on Si(111) substrate subject to Si surface flux show that the
supersaturation dependent surface tension destabilizes the contact line via
formation of a precursor wetting film on the solid-vapor interface, and has
ramifications for size selection during VLS-based routes for nanowire growth.
Our study sheds light on the interplay between stability and energetics of
surfaces in these unique class of binary alloys and offers pathways for
exploiting their surface structure for varied applications such as catalytic
nanocrystal growth, dealloying, and polymer crystallization.

cases. Three interesting observations have been made on the current artifacts
of software testing. Firstly, an error-revealing test case is considered useful
while a successful test case which does not reveal software errors is usually
not further investigated. Whether these successful test cases still contain
useful information for revealing software errors has not been properly studied.
Secondly, no matter how extensive the testing has been conducted in the
development phase, errors may still exist in the software [5]. These errors, if
left undetected, may eventually cause damage to the production system. The
study of techniques for uncovering software errors in the production phase is
seldom addressed in the literature. Thirdly, as indicated by Weyuker in [6],
the availability of test oracles is pragmatically unattainable in most
situations. However, the availability of test oracles is generally assumed in
conventional software testing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel
test case selection technique that derives new test cases from the successful
ones. The selection aims at revealing software errors that are possibly left
undetected in successful test cases which may be generated using some existing
strategies. As such, the proposed technique augments the effectiveness of
existing test selection strategies. The technique also helps uncover software
errors in the production phase and can be used in the absence of test oracles.

is to infer the underlying tree topology. In this work we develop Spectral
Neighbor Joining (SNJ), a novel method to recover the structure of latent tree

derive a sufficient condition for correct tree recovery from an estimated
similarity matrix. Combining this condition with a concentration of measure

that in comparison to several other reconstruction methods, SNJ requires fewer

We propose localization models that leverage the presence of the hand as the

In our approach, hand segmentation is fed to either the entire localization

sequence-to-sequence neural networks to generate target translation word by
word, and then make the generated word at each time-step and the counterpart in
the references as consistent as possible. However, the trained translation
model tends to focus on ensuring the accuracy of the generated target word at
the current time-step and does not consider its future cost which means the
expected cost of generating the subsequent target translation (i.e., the next
target word). To respond to this issue, we propose a simple and effective
method to model the future cost of each target word for NMT systems. In detail,
a time-dependent future cost is estimated based on the current generated target
word and its contextual information to boost the training of the NMT model.
Furthermore, the learned future context representation at the current time-step
is used to help the generation of the next target word in the decoding.
Experimental results on three widely-used translation datasets, including the
WMT14 German-to-English, WMT14 English-to-French, and WMT17 Chinese-to-English,
show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over strong
Transformer-based NMT baseline.

quarks and a scalar LQ of electromagnetic charge $1/3$. The relative change is
moderately larger in the case of the first two generations of quarks, as they
have vanishingly small Yukawa couplings in the SM. The enhancement in the
couplings would also lead to a non-negligible contribution from the quark
fusion process to the production of the 125 GeV Higgs scalar in the SM, though
the gluon fusion always dominates. However, this may not be true for a general
scalar. As an example, we consider a scenario with a SM-gauge-singlet scalar
$\phi$ where an $\mathcal O(1)$ coupling between $\phi$ and the LQ is allowed.
The $\phi q \bar{q}$ Yukawa couplings can be generated radiatively only through
a loop of LQ and sterile neutrinos. Here, the quark fusion process can have a
significant cross section, especially for a light $\phi$. It can even supersede
the normally dominant gluon fusion process for a moderate to large value of the
LQ mass. This model can be tested/constrained at the high luminosity run of the
LHC through a potentially large branching fraction of the scalar to two jets.

proposes a fusion network based on multimodal attention mechanism for 3D shape

soft attention scheme, which can use the global point-cloud features to filter

mining the contribution of each multi-view image to the overall shape

neural architecture search. In this paper, for the first time, we
systematically investigate the impact of different layer assignments to the
network performance by building an architecture dataset of layer assignment on
CIFAR-100. Through analyzing this dataset, we discover a neural inheritance
relation among the networks with different layer assignments, that is, the
optimal layer assignments for deeper networks always inherit from those for
shallow networks. Inspired by this neural inheritance relation, we propose an
efficient one-shot layer assignment search approach via inherited sampling.
Specifically, the optimal layer assignment searched in the shallow network can
be provided as a strong sampling priori to train and search the deeper ones in
supernet, which extremely reduces the network search space. Comprehensive
experiments carried out on CIFAR-100 illustrate the efficiency of our proposed
method. Our search results are strongly consistent with the optimal ones
directly selected from the architecture dataset. To further confirm the

Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimized power allocation at the legitimate

Effectively pooling information across samples while correctly accounting for
heterogeneity presents a significant challenge in large-scale estimation
problems. We address this issue by introducing the ``Nonparametric Empirical
Bayes Structural Tweedie"" (NEST) estimator, which efficiently estimates the
unknown effect sizes and properly adjusts for heterogeneity via a generalized

handles the two main selection biases introduced by heterogeneity: one, the

correcting for, two, selection bias in the variance. We develop theory to show
that NEST is asymptotically as good as the optimal Bayes rule that uniquely
minimizes a weighted squared error loss. In our simulation studies NEST
outperforms competing methods, with much efficiency gains in many settings. The
proposed method is demonstrated on estimating the batting averages of baseball

about the tissue structure. This information can be a lot richer if these 2D
images can be stacked into a 3D tissue volume. A 3D analysis, however, requires
accurate reconstruction of the tissue volume from the 2D image stack. This task
is not trivial due to the distortions that each individual tissue slice
experiences while cutting and mounting the tissue on the glass slide.
Performing registration for the whole tissue slices may be adversely affected
by the deformed tissue regions. Consequently, regional registration is found to
be more effective. In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust regional
registration algorithm for whole slide images which incrementally focuses
registration on the area around the region of interest. Results: Using mean
similarity index as the metric, the proposed algorithm (mean $\pm$ std: $0.84

outperformed the state-of-the-art linear whole tissue registration algorithm

that the integration of several learning models, known as ensemble learning,
generally gives better performance compared to a single model. The design of
wings, tail, and nose of a jet improves the aerodynamics resulting in a smooth

Inspired by the shape and working of a jet, a novel Deep Ensemble Learning
using Jet-like Architecture (DEL-Jet) technique is proposed to enhance the
diversity and robustness of a learning system against the variations in the

Finally, both the reduced and the original feature spaces are exploited to
train the meta-regressor (as jet nose) for forecasting the wind speed. The

  the solution of nonconvex QP problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we address game theory problems arising in the context of
network security. In traditional game theory problems, given a defender and an
attacker, one searches for mixed strategies which minimize a linear payoff
functional. In the problems addressed in this paper an additional quadratic
term is added to the minimization problem. Such term represents switching
costs, i.e., the costs for the defender of switching from a given strategy to
another one at successive rounds of a Nash game. The resulting problems are
nonconvex QP ones with linear constraints and turn out to be very challenging.
We will show that the most recent approaches for the minimization of nonconvex
QP functions over polytopes, including commercial solvers such as CPLEX and
GUROBI, are unable to solve to optimality even test instances with n = 50
variables. For this reason, we propose to extend with them the current
benchmark set of test instances for QP problems. We also present a spatial
branch-and-bound approach for the solution of these problems, where a
predominant role is played by an optimality-based domain reduction, with
multiple solutions of LP problems at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. Of
course, domain reductions are standard tools in spatial branch-and-bound
approaches. However, our contribution lies in the observation that, from the
computational point of view, a rather aggressive application of these tools
appears to be the best way to tackle the proposed instances. Indeed, according
to our experiments, while they make the computational cost per node high, this
is largely compensated by the rather slow growth of the number of nodes in the
branch-and-bound tree, so that the proposed approach strongly outperforms the
existing solvers for QP problems.

a detailed electric field model from finite element TCAD into a Monte Carlo

found for various quantities such as cluster size, spatial resolution and

  The validation of such simulations is fundamental for modeling the detector

is axisymmetric and $(\omega_0,\rho_0)$ belongs to the critical space
$L^1(\Omega)\times L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$, with $\omega_0$ is the initial vorticity

machine learning prediction, and, while feature selection is widely recognized
as important process in data-analysis, it could cause cofounding bias. A causal
Bayesian network is a standard tool for describing causal relationships, and if
relationships are known, then adjustment criteria can determine with which
features cofounding bias disappears. A standard modification would thus utilize
causal discovery algorithms for preventing cofounding bias in feature
selection. Causal discovery algorithms, however, essentially rely on the
faithfulness assumption, which turn out to be easily violated in practical
feature selection settings. In this paper, we propose a meta-algorithm that can
remedy existing feature selection algorithms in terms of cofounding bias. Our
algorithm is induced from a novel adjustment criterion that requires rather
than faithfulness, an assumption which can be induced from another well-known
assumption of the causal sufficiency. We further prove that the features added
through our modification convert cofounding bias into prediction variance. With
the aid of existing robust optimization technologies that regularize risky
strategies with high variance, then, we are able to successfully improve the
throughput performance of decision-making optimization, as is shown in our
experimental results.

especially when it comes to fine-grained recognition. In this work, we define a
new FSL setting termed few-shot fewshot learning (FSFSL), under which both the

class data scarcity problem, a natural option is to crawl images from the web
with class names as search keywords. However, the crawled images are inevitably
corrupted by large amount of noise (irrelevant images) and thus may harm the
performance. To address this problem, we propose a graph convolutional network

Further, with the cleaned web images as well as the original clean training

novel adaptive aggregation GCN (AdarGCN) model is proposed, which differs from
existing GCN models in that adaptive aggregation is performed based on a
multi-head multi-level aggregation module. With AdarGCN, how much and how far

be determined automatically, therefore alleviating the effects of both noisy

denied that relativity was philosophically significant, exemplify a global
pattern: while critics of relativity feared to become marginalized by the

facilities supported by Adaptive Optics (AO) relies on our ability to forecast
the optical turbulence (OT) and a set of relevant atmospheric parameters.
Indeed, in spite of the fact that the AO is able to achieve, at present,
excellent levels of wavefront corrections (a Strehl Ratio up to 90% in H band),
its performances strongly depend on the atmospheric conditions. Knowing in
advance the turbulence conditions allows an optimization of the AO use. It has
already been proven that it is possible to provide reliable forecasts of the
optical turbulence (CN2 profiles and integrated astroclimatic parameters such
as seeing, isoplanantic angle, wavefront coherence time, ...) for the next
night. In this paper we prove that it is possible to improve the forecast
performances on shorter time scales (order of one or two hours) with consistent
gains (order of 2 to 8) using filtering techniques. This has permitted us to
achieve forecasts accuracies never obtained before and reach a fundamental
milestone for the astronomical applications. The time scale of one or two hours
is the most critical one for an efficient management of the ground-based
telescopes supported by AO. Results shown here open, therefore, to an important
revolution in the field. We implemented this method in the operational forecast
system of the Large Binocular Telescope, named ALTA Center that is, at our
knowledge, the first operational system providing forecasts of turbulence and
atmospheric parameters at short time scales to support science operations.

formulation over the computationally intractable cone of completely positive

tractable cone of doubly nonnegative matrices, i.e., the cone of positive

doubly nonnegative relaxation, whose optimal value yields a lower bound on that
of the original problem. We present a full algebraic characterization of the
set of instances of standard quadratic programs that admit an exact doubly
nonnegative relaxation. This characterization yields an algorithmic recipe for
constructing such an instance. In addition, we explicitly identify three
families of instances for which the doubly nonnegative relaxation is exact. We
establish several relations between the so-called convexity graph of an

provide an algebraic characterization of the set of instances for which the
doubly nonnegative relaxation has a positive gap and show how to construct such

To demonstrate that `INDICATE' is a powerful spatial analysis tool
which when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2 can be used to robustly
probe star formation history.
  Methods. We compared the dynamic & spatial distributions of young stellar
objects (YSOs) at various evolutionary stages in NGC 2264 using Gaia DR2 proper
motion data and INDICATE.
  Results. The dynamic & spatial behaviours of YSOs at different evolutionary
stages are distinct. Dynamically, Class II YSOs predominately have non-random
trajectories that are consistent with known substructures, whereas Class III
YSOs have random trajectories with no clear expansion or contraction patterns.
Spatially, there is a correlation between the evolutionary stage and source
concentration: 69.4% of Class 0/I, 27.9% of Class II, and 7.7% of Class III
objects are found to be clustered. The proportion of YSOs clustered with
objects of the same class also follows this trend. Class 0/I objects are both
found to be more tightly clustered with the general populous/objects of the
same class than Class IIs and IIIs by a factor of 1.2/4.1 and 1.9/6.6,
respectively. An exception to these findings is within 0.05deg of S Mon where
Class III objects mimic the behaviours of Class II sources across the wider
cluster region. Our results suggest (i) current YSOs distributions are a result
of dynamical evolution, (ii) prolonged star formation has been occurring
sequentially, and (iii) stellar feedback from S Mon is causing YSOs to appear
as more evolved sources.
  Conclusions. Designed to provide a quantitative measure of clustering
behaviours, INDICATE is a powerful tool with which to perform rigorous spatial
analyses. Our findings are consistent with what is known about NGC 2264,
effectively demonstrating that when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2
INDICATE can be used to robustly study the star formation history of a cluster.

radiation doses and longer image scanning and reconstruction times. Existing
methods attempt to reduce the dynamic sequence by interpolating the volumes
between the acquired image volumes. However, these methods are limited to
either 2D images and/or are unable to support large variations in the motion
between the image volume sequences. In this paper, we present a spatiotemporal
volumetric interpolation network (SVIN) designed for 4D dynamic medical images.
SVIN introduces dual networks: first is the spatiotemporal motion network that
leverages the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for unsupervised parametric
volumetric registration to derive spatiotemporal motion field from two-image
volumes; the second is the sequential volumetric interpolation network, which
uses the derived motion field to interpolate image volumes, together with a new
regression-based module to characterize the periodic motion cycles in
functional organ structures. We also introduce an adaptive multi-scale
architecture to capture the volumetric large anatomy motions. Experimental
results demonstrated that our SVIN outperformed state-of-the-art temporal
medical interpolation methods and natural video interpolation methods that have
been extended to support volumetric images. Our ablation study further
exemplified that our motion network was able to better represent the large
functional motion compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised medical
registration methods.

The [CII] 158 {\mu}m far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure line is one
of the most important cooling lines of the star-forming interstellar medium
(ISM). High spectral resolution observations have shown complex structures in
the line profiles of the [CII] emission. Aims. Our aim is to determine whether
the complex profiles observed in [^{12}CII] are due to individual velocity
components along the line-of-sight or to self-absorption based on a comparison
of the [^{12}CII] and isotopic [^{13}CII] line profiles. Methods. Deep
integrations with the SOFIA/upGREAT 7-pixel array receiver in M43,
Horsehead~PDR, Monoceros~R2, and M17~SW allow for the detection of optically
thin [^{13}CII] emission lines, along with the [^{12}CII] emission lines, with
a high signal-to-noise ratio. We first derived the [^{12}CII] optical depth and
the [CII] column density from a single component model. However, the complex
line profiles observed require a double layer model with an emitting background
and an absorbing foreground. A multi-component velocity fit allows us to derive
the physical conditions of the [CII] gas: column density and excitation
temperature. Results. We find moderate to high [^{12}CII] optical depths in all
four sources and self-absorption of [^{12}CII] in Mon R2 and M17 SW. The high
column density of the warm background emission corresponds to an equivalent Av
of up to 41 mag. The foreground absorption requires substantial column
densities of cold and dense [CII] gas, with an equivalent Av ranging up to
about 13 mag. Conclusions. The column density of the warm background material
requires multiple photon-dominated region (PDR) surfaces stacked along the line
of sight and in velocity. The substantial column density of dense and cold
foreground [CII] gas detected in absorption cannot be explained with any known
scenario and we can only speculate on its origins

consider the temporal version of Edmonds' classical result about the problem of
finding $k$ edge-disjoint spanning branchings respectively rooted at given

spanning branchings, and of edge-disjointness in the context of temporal

each vertex $v$ of $G$ at some time where $v$ is active, while it is
temporal-spanning if $v$ can be reached from the root at every time where $v$

edge-disjoint if they do not use the same edge of $G$, and are
temporal-edge-disjoint if they can use the same edge of $G$ but at different

prove that, unlike the static case, only one of these can be computed in
polynomial time, namely the temporal-edge-disjoint temporal-spanning branchings

respect to different optimisation targets. Working under the assumption of a
Gaussian likelihood for the parameters of a $w_0 w_a$CDM-model and using
Euclid's conservative survey specifications, we compare an equipopulated,
equidistant and optimised bin setting and find that in general the
equipopulated setting is very close to the optimal one, while an equidistant
setting is far from optimal and also suffers from the ad hoc choice of a
maximum redshift. More importantly, we find that nearly saturated information
content can be gained using already few tomographic bins. This is crucial for
photometric redshift surveys with large redshift errors. We consider a large
range of targets for the optimisation process that can be computed from the

since their discovery. The so-called reactor-anti-neutrino-anomaly RAA, a ~6.5
$\%$ deficit of the mean observed neutrino flux compared to the prediction
appeared recently. This anomaly could be interpreted by the existence of a
fourth, sterile, neutrino and this hypothesis is currently being tested by the
very short baseline experiment STEREO. The latter is installed at very short
distance (9 -11m) from the compact core of the ILL research reactor in
Grenoble-France and collecting data since November 2016. The ILL core is highly
enriched in ${}^{235}\textrm{U}$ and releases a nominal thermal power of 58.3
MW. The geometry of the STEREO detector, segmented into six identical cells
filled with Gd-loaded liquid scintillator, is designed for a direct test of a
new oscillation pattern in the L/E range around 1 m/MeV, relevant for the RAA.
First published results of STEREO have demonstrated the mitigation of the
background induced by the reactor and the cosmic-rays and a good energy
response. The data taking is now in progress with very stable conditions
favorable for an improved accuracy. We will present an overview of the
experiment and an update of the sterile neutrino analysis. A refined prediction
of the neutrino spectrum emitted by the ILL reactor is also presented.

diffuse interface models for tumor growth describing evolutions driven by
long-range interactions. These integro-partial differential equations model
cell-to-cell adhesion by a non-local term and may be seen as non-local variants
of the corresponding local model proposed by H. Garcke et al. (2016). The model
in consideration couples a non-local Cahn-Hilliard equation for the tumor phase
variable with a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient concentration, and
takes into account also significant mechanisms such as chemotaxis and active
transport. The system depends on two relaxation parameters: a viscosity
coefficient and parabolic-regularization coefficient on the chemical potential.
The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the system with both
regularizations. Here, a rich spectrum of results is presented. Weak
well-posedness is first addressed, also including singular potentials. Then,
under suitable conditions, existence of strong solutions enjoying the
separation property is proved. This allows also to obtain a refined stability
estimate with respect to the data, including both chemotaxis and active
transport. The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of the
asymptotic behavior of the system as the relaxation parameters vanish. The
asymptotics are analyzed when the parameters approach zero both separately and
jointly, and exact error estimates are obtained. As a by-product,
well-posedness of the corresponding limit systems is established.

attracting high interest in many fields. The theoretical modeling of these
processes is challenging, and the only rigorous quantum-dynamics approach that
can treat correlated fermions in two and three dimensions is nonequilibrium
Green functions (NEGF). However, NEGF simulations are computationally expensive
due to their $T^3$-scaling with the simulation duration $T$. Recently,
$T^2$-scaling was achieved with the generalized Kadanoff--Baym ansatz (GKBA),
for the second-order Born (SOA) selfenergy, which has substantially extended
the scope of NEGF simulations. In a recent Letter [Schl\""unzen \textit{et al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{124}, 076601 (2020)] we demonstrated that GKBA-NEGF
simulations can be efficiently mapped onto coupled time-local equations for the
single-particle and two-particle Green functions on the time diagonal, hence
the method has been called G1--G2 scheme. This allows one to perform the same
simulations with order $T^1$-scaling, both for SOA and $GW$ selfenergies giving
rise to a dramatic speedup. Here we present more details on the G1--G2 scheme,
including derivations of the basic equations including results for a general
basis, for Hubbard systems and for jellium. Also, we demonstrate how to
incorporate initial correlations into the G1--G2 scheme. Further, the
derivations are extended to a broader class of selfenergies, including the $T$
matrix in the particle--particle and particle--hole channels, and the
dynamically screened-ladder approximation. Finally, we demonstrate that, for
all selfenergies, the CPU time scaling of the G1--G2 scheme with the basis
dimension, $N_b$, can be improved compared to our first report: the overhead
compared to the original GKBA, is not more than an additional factor $N_b$.

domain-specific set of transformations that are hard to obtain in general. The
second approach of minimizing a classical one-class loss on the learned final
layer representations, e.g., DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) suffers from the
fundamental drawback of representation collapse. In this work, we propose Deep
Robust One-Class Classification (DROCC) that is both applicable to most
standard domains without requiring any side-information and robust to
representation collapse. DROCC is based on the assumption that the points from
the class of interest lie on a well-sampled, locally linear low dimensional
manifold. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DROCC is highly effective in
two different one-class problem settings and on a range of real-world datasets
across different domains: tabular data, images (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio, and
time-series, offering up to 20% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art
in anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML.

described by just their mass and spin. These simple solutions are not exclusive
to general relativity, as they also appear in theories that allow for an extra
scalar degree of freedom. Recently, it was shown that some theories which
couple a scalar field with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant can have the same classic
general relativity black hole solutions as well as hairy black holes. These
scalarized solutions can be stable, having an additional ""charge"" term that has
an impact on the gravitational-wave emission by black hole binaries. In this
paper, we overview black hole solutions in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity,
considering self-interacting terms for the scalar field. We present the mode
analysis for the mono and dipolar perturbations around the Schwarzschild black
hole in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, showing the transition between stable and unstable
solutions. We also present the time-evolution of scalar Gaussian wave packets,
analyzing the impact of the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet term in their evolution. We
then present some scalarized solutions, showing that nonlinear coupling
functions and self-interacting terms can stabilize them. Finally, we compute
the light-ring frequency and the Lyapunov exponent, which possibly estimate the
black hole quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit.

  small noise diffusion","83 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The aim of this paper is to develop tractable large deviation approximations
for the empirical measure of a small noise diffusion. The starting point is the
Freidlin-Wentzell theory, which shows how to approximate via a large deviation
principle the invariant distribution of such a diffusion. The rate function of
the invariant measure is formulated in terms of quasipotentials, quantities
that measure the difficulty of a transition from the neighborhood of one
metastable set to another. The theory provides an intuitive and useful
approximation for the invariant measure, and along the way many useful related
results (e.g., transition rates between metastable states) are also developed.
With the specific goal of design of Monte Carlo schemes in mind, we prove large
deviation limits for integrals with respect to the empirical measure, where the
process is considered over a time interval whose length grows as the noise
decreases to zero. In particular, we show how the first and second moments of
these integrals can be expressed in terms of quasipotentials. When the dynamics
of the process depend on parameters, these approximations can be used for
algorithm design, and applications of this sort will appear elsewhere. The use
of a small noise limit is well motivated, since in this limit good sampling of
the state space becomes most challenging. The proof exploits a regenerative
structure, and a number of new techniques are needed to turn large deviation
estimates over a regenerative cycle into estimates for the empirical measure
and its moments.

on various forms of filtering or predict an additive residual depth map to
refine a first estimate. We instead learn to predict, given a depth map

re-sample pixels around the occlusion boundaries into sharper reconstructions.
Our method can be applied to the output of any depth estimation method, in an
end-to-end trainable fashion. For evaluation, we manually annotated the
occlusion boundaries in all the images in the test split of popular NYUv2-Depth

It is a
prerequisite for motion planning and execution. The well-established
localization approaches such as Kalman and particle filters require a
probabilistic observation model allowing to compute a likelihood of measurement

precision of the localization system may be achieved through the development of
a more sophisticated observation model considering various measurement error
sources. Meanwhile model needs to be simple to be computable in real-time. This
paper proposes an observation model for visually detected linear features.
Examples of such features include, but not limited to, road markings and road
boundaries. The proposed observation model depicts two core detection error
sources: shift error and angular error. It also considers the probability of
false-positive detection. The structure of the proposed model allows
precomputing and incorporating the measurement error directly into the map
represented by a multichannel digital image. Measurement error precomputation
and storing the map as an image speeds up observation likelihood computation
and in turn localization system. The experimental evaluation on real autonomous
vehicle demonstrates that the proposed model allows for precise and reliable
localization in a variety of scenarios.

(2019, arXiv:1910.04820 [math.AP]) using the theory of paracontrolled
distributions and a technique of coupled renormalizations. When an equation is
well-posed, and it is approximated by replacing the differentiation operator by
reasonable discretization schemes with a parameter, it is widely believed that
a solution of the approximating equation should converge to the solution of the
original equation as the parameter approaches zero. We prove otherwise in the
case of the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics system forced by space-time
white noise. Specifically, it is proven that the limit of the solution to the
approximating system with an additional 32 drift terms solves the original
system. These 32 drift terms depend on the choice of approximations, can be
calculated explicitly in the process of renormalizations, and essentially
represent a spatial version of It$\hat{\mathrm{o}}$-Stratonovich correction
terms. In particular, the proof relies on the technique of coupled
renormalizations again, as well as taking advantage of the special structure of

towards understanding whether mass transfer in low-mass binaries is one of the
potential origins of the aforementioned abundance anomalies in globular
clusters. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code to
calculate binary evolutionary models with different initial donor masses
between 0.9 and 1.9 $ \rm {M}_\odot$ for an initial metallicity of Z = 0.0034.
The results show that in some low-mass binary systems, the accretors exhibit
peculiar chemical patterns when they are still unevolved stars, e.g. C and O
depletion; Na and N enhancement; constant Mg, Al and C+N+O. The abundance
patterns of the accretors are significantly different from their initial
abundances (or that of normal single stars), and can match the observed
populations. These abundance patterns strongly depend not only on the initial
parameters of binaries (donor mass, mass ratio, and orbital period), but also
on the assumptions regarding mass-transfer efficiency and angular momentum
loss. These results support the hypothesis that mass transfer in low-mass
binaries is at least partly responsible for the unevolved anomalous stars in

efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed
this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and
transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture
human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with
obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space

on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train
decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of
waypoints in task space. These waypoints provided a high-level plan, which
could be transferred to an arbitrary robot model and used to initialise a local
trajectory optimiser. We evaluated this approach through testing on unseen

condition enforcement (MDG-ICE) is applied to the case of viscous flows. This
method uses a weak formulation that separately enforces the conservation law,
constitutive law, and the corresponding interface conditions in order to
provide the means to detect interfaces or under-resolved flow features. To
satisfy the resulting overdetermined weak formulation, the discrete domain
geometry is introduced as a variable, so that the method implicitly fits a
priori unknown interfaces and moves the grid to resolve sharp, but smooth,
gradients, achieving a form of anisotropic curvilinear $r$-adaptivity. This
approach avoids introducing low-order errors that arise using shock capturing,
artificial dissipation, or limiting. The utility of this approach is
demonstrated with its application to a series of test problems culminating with
the compressible Navier-Stokes solution to a Mach 5 viscous bow shock for a
Reynolds number of $10^{5}$ in two-dimensional space. Time accurate solutions
of unsteady problems are obtained via a space-time formulation, in which the
unsteady problem is formulated as a higher dimensional steady space-time
problem. The method is shown to accurately resolve and transport viscous

its powerful feature representation ability in revealing long-range
correlations and input-dependent characteristics. However, non-stationary
spectral kernels are still shallow models, thus they are deficient to learn
both hierarchical features and local interdependence. In this paper, to obtain
hierarchical and local knowledge, we build an interpretable convolutional
spectral kernel network (\texttt{CSKN}) based on the inverse Fourier transform,
where we introduce deep architectures and convolutional filters into
non-stationary spectral kernel representations. Moreover, based on Rademacher
complexity, we derive the generalization error bounds and introduce two
regularizers to improve the performance. Combining the regularizers and recent
advancements on random initialization, we finally complete the learning
framework of \texttt{CSKN}. Extensive experiments results on real-world
datasets validate the effectiveness of the learning framework and coincide with
our theoretical findings.

M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi by substituting the Pochhammer symbol with a nearly
arbitrary function. Moreover, this generalization is valid for the entire
Shiraishi series, not only for its Noumi-Shiraishi part. The theta function
needed in the recently suggested description of the double-elliptic systems, 6d
N=2* SYM instanton calculus and the doubly-compactified network models, is a
very particular member of this huge family. The series depends on two kinds of
variables, $\vec x$ and $\vec y$, and on a set of parameters, which becomes
infinitely large now. Still, one of the parameters, $p$ is distinguished by its
role in the series grading. When $\vec y$ are restricted to a discrete subset
labeled by Young diagrams, the series multiplied by a monomial factor reduces
to a polynomial at any given order in $p$. All this makes the map from
functions to the hypergeometric-like series very promising, and we call it
Shiraishi functor despite it remains to be seen, what are exactly the morphisms
that it preserves. Generalized Noumi-Shiraishi (GNS) symmetric polynomials
inspired by the Shiraishi functor in the leading order in $p$ can be obtained
by a triangular transform from the Schur polynomials and possess an interesting
grading. They provide a family of deformations of Macdonald polynomials, as
rich as the family of Kerov functions, still very different from them, and, in
fact, much closer to the Macdonald polynomials. In particular, unlike the Kerov
case, these polynomials do not depend on the ordering of Young diagrams in the
triangular expansion.

with the risk that it will be carrying some disease. When players follow a
simple memory-based strategy we observe a spontaneous separation into two
groups corresponding to players with relatively high, or low, levels of
infection. By modelling the dynamics of both the disease and the formation and
breaking of trade relationships, we derive the conditions for which this
separation occurs as a function of the transmission rate and the threshold
level of acceptable disease for each player. When interactions in the game are
restricted to players that neighbour each other in a small-world network,
players tend to have similar levels of infection as their neighbours. We
conclude that success in economic-epidemiological systems can originate from
misfortune and geographical circumstances as well as by innate differences in

lack of universality reduces DFT's predictive capacity, and functionals may
produce energy-density imbalances. The absolute electronegativity (\chi) and
hardness (\eta) directly reflect the energy-density relationship via the
chemical potential dE/dN and we thus hypothesized that they probe universality.
We studied \chi and \eta for atoms Z = 1-36 using 50 diverse functionals
covering all major classes. Very few functionals describe both \chi and \eta
well. \eta benefits from error cancelation whereas \chi is marred by error
propagation from IP and EA; thus almost all standard GGA and hybrid functionals
display a plateau in the MAE at 0.2-0.3 eV for \eta. In contrast, variable
performance for \chi indicates problems in describing the chemical potential by
DFT. The accuracy and precision of a functional is far from linearly related,
yet for a universal functional we expect linearity. Popular functionals such as
B3LYP, PBE, and revPBE, perform poorly for both properties. Density sensitivity
calculations indicate large density-derived errors as occupation of degenerate
p- and d-orbitals causes ""non-universality"" and large dependency on exact
exchange. Thus, we argue that performance for \chi for the same systems is a
hallmark of universality by probing dE/dN. With this metric, B98, B97-1,
PW6B95D3, APFD are the most ""universal"" tested functionals. B98 and B97-1 are
accurate for very diverse metal-ligand bonds, supporting that a balanced
description of dE/dN and dE2/dN2, via \chi and \eta, is probably a first simple
probe of universality.

multiferroics display simultaneous ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, leading
to new technologies in information storage. It remains an open question whether
metallicity, ferroelectricity, and ferromagnetism can coexist in a single
domain of a material. EuTiO$_3$ is actively studied for potential applications
in magnetic sensors, memories, magneto-optical devices, and energy conversion
devices. It stabilizes at a multi-critical equilibrium and exhibits a rich
range of intriguing properties. Here, using the results from hybrid density
functional theory calculations, we report metallic FE-FM multiferroics in
strain-engineered epitaxial EuTiO$_3$ with H doping. The emergence of the
magnetism in polar metals provides a new degree of freedom to control these
materials in applications. The underlying mechanism for the coexistence of
metallicity, ferroelectricity, and ferromagnetism is discussed. The
ferromagnetism in metallic EuTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ is explained by the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya- Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which agrees with
experiments. The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity is allowed
because the electrons at the Fermi level are weakly coupled to the
ferroelectric distortion. Our results suggest that the combined effect of
strain and doping is responsible for achieving EuTiO$_3$-based metallic FE-FM
multiferroics and may provide a new way for obtaining metallic FE-FM
multiferroics in other materials.

a sample of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data collected at a

approximately a factor of three smaller than that achievable with previous

devices in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Their performance can be
limited by dielectric losses in the substrate and in the material interfaces.
Reliable modeling is required to aid in the design of low-loss CPW structures
for cQED. We analyze the geometric dependence of the dielectric losses in CPW
structures using finite-element modeling of the participation ratios of the
lossy regions. In a practical scenario, uncertainties in the the dielectric
constants and loss tangents of these regions introduce uncertainties in the
theoretically predicted participation ratios. We present a method for combining
loss simulations with measurements of two-level-system-limited quality factors
and resonance frequencies of CPW resonators. Namely, we solve an inverse
problem to find model parameters producing the measured values. High quality
factors are obtainable by properly designing the cross-sectional geometries of
the CPW structures, but more accurate modeling and design methods for low-loss
CPW resonators are called for major future improvements. Our nonlinear
optimization methodology for solving the aforementioned inverse problem is a
step in this direction.

that all the position embeddings are accessible in partially autoregressive

recognition, building on the fact that the scene type is highly correlated with
the objects in the scene, and therefore with its semantic segmentation into
different object classes. In a series of ablation studies, we show that
successful scene recognition is not just the recognition of individual objects
unique to some scene type (such as a bathtub), but depends on several different
cues, including coarse 3D geometry, colour, and the (implicit) distribution of
object categories. Moreover, we demonstrate that surprisingly sparse 3D data is
sufficient to classify indoor scenes with good accuracy.

structure, kinematics, and morphological landscape. Our principal aim is to
estimate the virial mass of the cluster. For this purpose, we present a sample
of 1537 galaxies with radial velocities $V_{LG} < 2600$~km~s$^{-1}$ situated
within a region of $\Delta{}SGL = 30^\circ$ and $\Delta{}SGB = 20^\circ$ around
M87. About half of the galaxies have distance estimates.
  Methods. We selected 398 galaxies with distances in a $(17\pm5)$~Mpc range.
Based on their 1D and 2D number-density profiles and their radial velocity
dispersions, we made an estimate for the virial mass of the Virgo cluster.
  Results. We identify the infall of galaxies towards the Virgo cluster core
along the Virgo Southern Extension filament. From a 1D profile of the cluster,
we obtain the virial mass estimate of $(6.3\pm0.9) \times 10^{14} M_\odot, $
which is in tight agreement with its mass estimate via the external infall
pattern of galaxies.
  Conclusions. We conclude that the Virgo cluster outskirts between the virial
radius and the zero-velocity radius do not contain significant amounts of dark
matter beyond the virial radius.

nuclei (AGN) can be investigated by analyzing the temporal response of the
torus's infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in the AGN
ultraviolet/optical luminosity. This method, reverberation mapping, is
applicable over a wide redshift range, but the IR response is sensitive to
several poorly constrained variables relating to the dust distribution and its
illumination, complicating the interpretation of measured reverberation lags.
We have used an enhanced version of our torus reverberation mapping code
(TORMAC) to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the torus response functions
at selected wavelengths, for the standard interstellar medium grain
composition. The shapes of the response functions vary widely over the
parameter range covered by our models, with the largest variations occurring at
shorter wavelengths ($\leq 4.5\,\mu$m). The reverberation lag, quantified as
the response-weighted delay (RWD), is most affected by the radial depth of the
torus, the steepness of the radial cloud distribution, the degree of anisotropy
of the AGN radiation field, and the volume filling factor. Nevertheless, we
find that the RWD provides a reasonably robust estimate, to within a factor of
$\sim 3$, of the luminosity-weighted torus radius, confirming the basic
assumption underlying reverberation mapping. However, overall, the models
predict radii at $2.2\,\mu$m that are a typically factor of $\sim 2$ larger
than those derived from K-band reverberation mapping. This is likely an
indication that the innermost region of the torus is populated by clouds
dominated by large graphite grains.

Currently, deep generative approaches addressing the challenge belong to two
broad categories, differing in how molecules are represented. One approach
encodes molecular graphs as strings of text, and learns their corresponding
character-based language model. Another, more expressive, approach operates
directly on the molecular graph. In this work, we address two limitations of
the former: generation of invalid and duplicate molecules. To improve validity
rates, we develop a language model for small molecular substructures called
fragments, loosely inspired by the well-known paradigm of Fragment-Based Drug
Design. In other words, we generate molecules fragment by fragment, instead of
atom by atom. To improve uniqueness rates, we present a frequency-based masking
strategy that helps generate molecules with infrequent fragments. We show
experimentally that our model largely outperforms other language model-based
competitors, reaching state-of-the-art performances typical of graph-based
approaches. Moreover, generated molecules display molecular properties similar
to those in the training sample, even in absence of explicit task-specific

widely used single nucleus model of accreting neutron star crust. We calculate
beta disequilibrium within the crust, which is sizable, and implies that
neutron and baryon chemical potentials, $\mu_n$ and $\mu_{\rm b}$, are not
equal. We include also non-equilibrium reactions, driven by matter compression,
and proceeding in the reaction layers. The constancy of $e^{\Phi}\mu_n$, where
the spacetime metric component $g_{00}=e^{2\Phi}$, in the shells between the
reaction layers is not applicable, because single electron captures are
blocked, so that the neutron fraction is fixed, and therefore neutrons are not
an independent component of the crust matter. The absence of neutron diffusion
in the shells between the reaction layers, stems from the constancy of the
neutron fraction (concentration) in these shells. In the reaction layers, the
outward force resulting from neutron fraction gradient is balanced by the
inward gravitational force acting on unbound neutrons. Neglecting the thickness
of the reaction layers compared to the shell thickness, we obtain condition
$e^{\Phi(r)}f_Q(r)g(r)=$constant, where $g$ is Gibbs energy per nucleon,
undergoing discontinuous drops on the reaction surfaces, and
$f_Q(r)g(r)={\widetilde{g}}(r)$ is a continuous function, due to the factor
$f_Q(r)$ canceling the discontinuities (drops) in $g(r)$. The function $f_Q(r)$
is calculated using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations from $f_Q(P)$ and
$g(P)$ obtained from the equation of state (EOS) with discontinuites. The
constancy of of $e^{\Phi(r)}{\widetilde{g}}(r)$ is an extension of the standard
relation $e^{\Phi(r)}{{\mu}}_{\rm b}(r)=$constant, valid in hydrostatic
equilibrium for catalyzed crust.

This paper explores whether these mechanisms may be exploited to infer

passive adversary. The first is a probing attack: here the adversary aims to
detect the maximum amount which is transferable in a given direction over a
target channel by actively probing it and differentiating the response messages
it receives. The second is a timing attack: the adversary discovers how close
the destination of a routed payment actually is, by acting as a passive
man-in-the middle and analyzing the time deltas between sent messages and their
corresponding responses. We then analyze the limitations of these attacks and
propose remediations for scenarios in which they are able to produce accurate

contrast enhancement was demonstrated using time-domain full-field OCT
(FF-OCT), which makes cellular and subcellular structures visible. The putative
cause of the dynamic OCT signal is ATP-dependent motion of cellular structures

demonstrate dynamic contrast with a scanning frequency-domain OCT (FD-OCT).
Given the inherent sectional imaging geometry, scanning FD-OCT provides
depth-resolved images across tissue layers, a perspective known from
histopathology, much faster and more efficiently than FF-OCT. Both, shorter

search optimal policies, and suffer from poor sampling efficiency. This paper
presents a mixed reinforcement learning (mixed RL) algorithm by simultaneously
using dual representations of environmental dynamics to search the optimal
policy with the purpose of improving both learning accuracy and training speed.
The dual representations indicate the environmental model and the state-action
data: the former can accelerate the learning process of RL, while its inherent
model uncertainty generally leads to worse policy accuracy than the latter,
which comes from direct measurements of states and actions. In the framework
design of the mixed RL, the compensation of the additive stochastic model
uncertainty is embedded inside the policy iteration RL framework by using
explored state-action data via iterative Bayesian estimator (IBE). The optimal
policy is then computed in an iterative way by alternating between policy
evaluation (PEV) and policy improvement (PIM). The convergence of the mixed RL
is proved using the Bellman's principle of optimality, and the recursive
stability of the generated policy is proved via the Lyapunov's direct method.
The effectiveness of the mixed RL is demonstrated by a typical optimal control
problem of stochastic non-affine nonlinear systems (i.e., double lane change

  Analytics","to appear at ECML-PKDD 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Citywide crowd flow analytics is of great importance to smart city efforts.
It aims to model the crowd flow (e.g., inflow and outflow) of each region in a
city based on historical observations. Nowadays, Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have been widely adopted in raster-based crowd flow analytics by virtue
of their capability in capturing spatial dependencies. After revisiting
CNN-based methods for different analytics tasks, we expose two common critical
drawbacks in the existing uses: 1) inefficiency in learning global spatial
dependencies, and 2) overlooking latent region functions. To tackle these
challenges, in this paper we present a novel framework entitled DeepLGR that
can be easily generalized to address various citywide crowd flow analytics
problems. This framework consists of three parts: 1) a local feature extraction
module to learn representations for each region; 2) a global context module to
extract global contextual priors and upsample them to generate the global
features; and 3) a region-specific predictor based on tensor decomposition to
provide customized predictions for each region, which is very
parameter-efficient compared to previous methods. Extensive experiments on two
typical crowd flow analytics tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, stability,
and generality of our framework.

forms of human bias. The outcomes of Data Analytics [DA] or Machine Learning

large number of biased decision-making systems based on DA/ML have recently
attracted attention. In this paper we introduce Rosa, a free, web-based tool to
easily de-bias datasets with respect to a chosen characteristic. Rosa is based
on the principles of Fair Adversarial Networks, developed by illumr Ltd., and
can therefore remove interactive, non-linear, and non-binary bias. Rosa is
stand-alone pre-processing step / API, meaning it can be used easily with any
DA/ML pipeline. We test the efficacy of Rosa in removing bias from data-driven
decision making systems by performing standard DA tasks on five real-world
datasets, selected for their relevance to current DA problems, and also their
high potential for bias. We use simple ML models to model a characteristic of
analytical interest, and compare the level of bias in the model output both
with and without Rosa as a pre-processing step. We find that in all cases there
is a substantial decrease in bias of the data-driven decision making systems
when the data is pre-processed with Rosa.

bulk, but along the boundaries, only. They are of particular practical
importance, since it is considerably more difficult, by ``conventional'' means,
to affect their transport properties, than for the case of conventional
materials. They are, thus, particularly robust to perturbations. One way to
accomplish such changes is by engineering defects. The defects that have been
the most studied are domain walls; however flux compactifications can, also,
work. We recall the domain wall construction and compare it to the construction
from flux compactification.
  A particular way of engineering the presence of such defects is by
introducing anisotropic couplings for the gauge fields. In this case a new
phase appears, where matter is confined along layers and local degrees of
freedom cannot propagate through the bulk. It is, also, possible to take into
account the ``backreaction'' of the dynamics of the gauge fields on the defects
and find that a new phase, the layered phase, where, while transport of local
degrees of freedom is confined to surfaces, the topological properties can
propagate through the bulk, constituting an example of anomaly flow.
  The anisotropy itself can be understood as emerging from a particular
Maxwell--dilaton coupling.

ascribed to the composition gradient along the film normal direction. However,
the determined mechanisms for magnetization switching have not been fully
studied. With varying growth temperatures, we have prepared FePt single layers

the magnetization switching ratio becomes smaller as increasing L10 ordering.
The method for deriving effective spin torque fields in the previous studies
cannot fully explain the spin current generation and self-induced SOT in

anomalous Hall effect measurements, we concluded that the disorder should
determine the formation of domain walls, as well as the spin current
generation.

multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with several

user, in which an IRS is dedicatedly deployed for assisting the wireless
transmission and suppressing the inter-cell interference. Under this setup, we
jointly optimize the coordinated transmit beamforming at the BSs and the
reflective beamforming at the IRS, for the purpose of maximizing the minimum
weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the users, subject
to the individual maximum transmit power at the BSs and the reflection
constraints at the IRS. To solve the non-convex problem, we first present an
exact-alternating-optimization design to optimize the transmit and reflective
beamforming vectors in an alternating manner, in which the transmit and
reflective beamforming optimization subproblems are solved exactly by using the
technique of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). However, it has high computational
complexity and may lead to compromised performance due to the uncertainty of
randomization in SDR. To avoid these drawbacks, we further propose an
inexact-alternating-optimization design, in which the transmit and reflective

principle of successive convex approximation (SCA). In addition, to further
reduce the complexity, we propose a low-complexity
inexact-alternating-optimization design, in which the reflective beamforming
optimization subproblem is solved more inexactly. Numerical results show that
the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed three designs
against benchmark schemes. Moreover, the inexact-alternating-optimization
designs outperform the exact-alternating-optimization one in terms of both the

reduction for each material parameter. In order to control of the skyrmion
motion it is very important to impose certain positions along the nanotrack

antiferromagnetic racetracks can be useful for such purpose. In order to
provide guidelines for experimental studies, we vary both material parameters

initial mask, defining the target object, is only given at test-time. The main
difficulty is to effectively handle appearance changes and similar background
objects, while maintaining accurate segmentation. Most previous approaches
fine-tune segmentation networks on the first frame, resulting in impractical

during the inference stage using fast optimization techniques to predict a
coarse but robust target segmentation. The segmentation model is exclusively
trained offline, designed to process the coarse scores into high quality

However, in financial services, users have rich interactions and they
themselves always show multifaceted information. These data form a large
multiview network, which is not fully exploited by conventional methods.
Additionally, among the network, only very few of the users are labelled, which
also poses a great challenge for only utilizing labeled data to achieve a

  To address the problem, we expand the labeled data through their social
relations to get the unlabeled data and propose a semi-supervised attentive

chemistry for a pair of players, respectively. The offensive chemistry metric
measures the pair's joint performance in terms of scoring goals, whereas the
defensive chemistry metric measures their joint performance in preventing their
opponents from scoring goals. We compute our metrics for 361 seasons in 106
different competitions and present a number of concrete use cases. For
instance, we show that the partnership between Mohamed Salah and Roberto
Firmino in Liverpool's 2017/2018 Champions League campaign exhibited the
highest mutual chemistry between two players. Furthermore, we show that Mesut
\""Ozil's chemistry has rapidly started declining following Alexis S\'anchez'
departure to Manchester United in 2018.

single probe. Such a system suffers from low efficiency due to repeated
volumetric scanning within the phantom needed to capture the absorbed energy
throughout the volume. To speed up the measurement, fast SAR (specific
absorption rate) measuring systems have been developed. However, discrepancies
of measured results are observed between traditional and fast measuring

investigated. Here, the concerned fast measuring system estimates SAR based on
the reconstructed field of the region of interest while the amplitude and phase
of electric field are measured on a single plane with a probe array. The
numerical results presented indicate that the fast SAR measuring system has the
potential to yield more accurate estimations than the traditional system, but
no conclusion can be made on which kind of system is superior without knowledge

global source of data for studying a wide range of socioeconomic factors.
Recently, another more terrestrial source is producing data with similarly
uniform global coverage: anonymous and aggregated smart phone location. This
data, which measures the movement patterns of people and populations rather
than the light they produce, could prove just as valuable in decades to come.
In fact, since human mobility is far more directly related to the socioeconomic
variables being predicted, it has an even greater potential. Additionally,
since cell phone locations can be aggregated in real time while preserving
individual user privacy, it will be possible to conduct studies that would
previously have been impossible because they require data from the present. Of
course, it will take quite some time to establish the new techniques necessary
to apply human mobility data to problems traditionally studied with satellite
imagery and to conceptualize and develop new real time applications. In this
study we demonstrate that it is possible to accelerate this process by
inferring artificial nighttime satellite imagery from human mobility data,
while maintaining a strong differential privacy guarantee. We also show that
these artificial maps can be used to infer socioeconomic variables, often with
greater accuracy than using actual satellite imagery. Along the way, we find
that the relationship between mobility and light emissions is both nonlinear
and varies considerably around the globe. Finally, we show that models based on
human mobility can significantly improve our understanding of society at a

intervention, face some statistical challenges: in real-world settings
treatments are not randomly assigned and the analysis might be further
complicated by the presence of interference between units. Researchers have
started to develop novel methods that allow to manage spillover mechanisms in
observational studies; recent works focus primarily on binary treatments.
However, many policy evaluation studies deal with more complex interventions.
For instance, in political science, evaluating the impact of policies
implemented by administrative entities often implies a multivariate approach,
as a policy towards a specific issue operates at many different levels and can
be defined along a number of dimensions. In this work, we extend the
statistical framework about causal inference under network interference in
observational studies, allowing for a multi-valued individual treatment and an
interference structure shaped by a weighted network. The estimation strategy is
based on a joint multiple generalized propensity score and allows one to
estimate direct effects, controlling for both individual and network
covariates. We follow the proposed methodology to analyze the impact of the
national immigration policy on the crime rate. We define a multi-valued
characterization of political attitudes towards migrants and we assume that the
extent to which each country can be influenced by another country is modeled by
an appropriate indicator, summarizing their cultural and geographical
proximity. Results suggest that implementing a highly restrictive immigration
policy leads to an increase of the crime rate and the estimated effects is
larger if we take into account interference from other countries.
