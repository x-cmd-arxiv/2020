keV in the experimental area located 185 m from the CERN n\_TOF neutron
spallation source, using a metallic sample of gadolinium, enriched to 67$\%$ in
$^{154}$Gd. The capture measurement, performed with four C$_{6}$D$_{6}$
scintillation detectors, has been complemented by a transmission measurement
performed at the GELINA time-of-flight facility (JRC-Geel), thus minimising the
uncertainty related to sample composition. An accurate Maxwellian averaged
capture cross section (MACS) was deduced over the temperature range of interest
for s process nucleosynthesis modeling. We report a value of 880(50) mb for the
MACS at $kT=30$ keV, significantly lower compared to values available in
literature. The new adopted $^{154}$Gd(n,$\gamma$) cross section reduces the
discrepancy between observed and calculated solar s-only isotopic abundances
predicted by s-process nucleosynthesis models.

contrast, studies of reinforcement learning in mixed-motive games have
primarily leveraged homogeneous approaches. Given the defining characteristic
of mixed-motive games--the imperfect correlation of incentives between group
members--we study the effect of population heterogeneity on mixed-motive
reinforcement learning. We draw on interdependence theory from social
psychology and imbue reinforcement learning agents with Social Value
Orientation (SVO), a flexible formalization of preferences over group outcome
distributions. We subsequently explore the effects of diversity in SVO on
populations of reinforcement learning agents in two mixed-motive Markov games.
We demonstrate that heterogeneity in SVO generates meaningful and complex
behavioral variation among agents similar to that suggested by interdependence
theory. Empirical results in these mixed-motive dilemmas suggest agents trained
in heterogeneous populations develop particularly generalized, high-performing

judges. By successfully imitating a thinking entity such as a human, this
machine then proves that it can also think. Some objections claim that Turing
test is not a tool to demonstrate the existence of general intelligence or
thinking activity. A compelling alternative is the Lovelace test, in which the
agent must originate a product that the agent's creator cannot explain.
Therefore, the agent must be the owner of an original product. However, for
this to happen the agent must exhibit the idea of self and distinguish oneself
from others. Sustaining the idea of self within the Turing test is still
possible if the judge decides to act as a textual mirror. Self-recognition
tests applied on animals through mirrors appear to be viable tools to
demonstrate the existence of a type of general intelligence. Methodology here
constructs a textual version of the mirror test by placing the agent as the one
and only judge to figure out whether the contacted one is an other, a mimicker,
or oneself in an unsupervised manner. This textual version of the mirror test
is objective, self-contained, and devoid of humanness. Any agent passing this
textual mirror test should have or can acquire a thought mechanism that can be
referred to as the inner-voice, answering the original and long lasting
question of Turing ""Can machines think?"" in a constructive manner still within
the bounds of the Turing test. Moreover, it is possible that a successful
self-recognition might pave way to stronger notions of self-awareness in
artificial beings.

high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) {\gamma}-ray emitters. {\eta} Car is
the most prominent member of this object class and is confirmed to emit
phase-locked HE {\gamma} rays from hundreds of MeV to ~100 GeV energies. This
work aims to search for and characterise the very-high-energy (VHE; E >100 GeV)
{\gamma}-ray emission from {\eta} Car around the last periastron passage in
2014 with the ground-based High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). Methods.
The region around {\eta} Car was observed with H.E.S.S. between orbital phase p
= 0.78 - 1.10, with a closer sampling at p {\approx} 0.95 and p {\approx} 1.10
(assuming a period of 2023 days). Optimised hardware settings as well as
adjustments to the data reduction, reconstruction, and signal selection were
needed to suppress and take into account the strong, extended, and
inhomogeneous night sky background (NSB) in the {\eta} Car field of view.
Tailored run-wise Monte-Carlo simulations (RWS) were required to accurately
treat the additional noise from NSB photons in the instrument response
functions. Results. H.E.S.S. detected VHE {\gamma}-ray emission from the
direction of {\eta} Car shortly before and after the minimum in the X-ray
light-curve close to periastron. Using the point spread function provided by
RWS, the reconstructed signal is point-like and the spectrum is best described
by a power law. The overall flux and spectral index in VHE {\gamma} rays agree
within statistical and systematic errors before and after periastron. The
{\gamma}-ray spectrum extends up to at least ~400 GeV. This implies a maximum
magnetic field in a leptonic scenario in the emission region of 0.5 Gauss. No
indication for phase-locked flux variations is detected in the H.E.S.S. data.

transformation. This novel technique is based on a method due to Hoschele et
al. and relies only on the knowledge of a single integral of uniform
transcendental weight. As a corollary, the algorithm can also be used to test
the uniform transcendentality of a given integral. We discuss the application
to several cutting-edge examples, including non-planar four-loop HQET and
non-planar two-loop five-point integrals. A Mathematica implementation of our
algorithm is made available together with this paper.

  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  People deploy top-down, goal-directed attention to accomplish tasks, such as
finding lost keys. By tuning the visual system to relevant information sources,
object recognition can become more efficient (a benefit) and more biased toward
the target (a potential cost). Motivated by selective attention in
categorisation models, we developed a goal-directed attention mechanism that
can process naturalistic (photographic) stimuli. Our attention mechanism can be
incorporated into any existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs). The
processing stages in DCNNs have been related to ventral visual stream. In that
light, our attentional mechanism incorporates top-down influences from
prefrontal cortex (PFC) to support goal-directed behaviour. Akin to how
attention weights in categorisation models warp representational spaces, we
introduce a layer of attention weights to the mid-level of a DCNN that amplify
or attenuate activity to further a goal. We evaluated the attentional mechanism
using photographic stimuli, varying the attentional target. We found that
increasing goal-directed attention has benefits (increasing hit rates) and
costs (increasing false alarm rates). At a moderate level, attention improves
sensitivity (i.e., increases $d^\prime$) at only a moderate increase in bias
for tasks involving standard images, blended images, and natural adversarial
images chosen to fool DCNNs. These results suggest that goal-directed attention
can reconfigure general-purpose DCNNs to better suit the current task goal,
much like PFC modulates activity along the ventral stream. In addition to being
more parsimonious and brain consistent, the mid-level attention approach
performed better than a standard machine learning approach for transfer
learning, namely retraining the final network layer to accommodate the new
task.

Collecting additional information to better characterize reducible

analysis is a mathematical decision framework that quantifies expected
potential benefits of new data and assists with optimal allocation of resources
for information collection. However, analysis of VoI is computational very
costly because of the underlying Bayesian inference especially for
equality-type information. This paper proposes the first surrogate-based
framework for VoI analysis. Instead of modeling the limit state functions
describing events of interest for decision making, which is commonly pursued in
surrogate model-based reliability methods, the proposed framework models system
responses. This approach affords sharing equality-type information from
observations among surrogate models to update likelihoods of multiple events of
interest. Moreover, two knowledge sharing schemes called model and training
points sharing are proposed to most effectively take advantage of the knowledge
offered by costly model evaluations. Both schemes are integrated with an error
rate-based adaptive training approach to efficiently generate accurate Kriging
surrogate models. The proposed VoI analysis framework is applied for an optimal
decision-making problem involving load testing of a truss bridge. While
state-of-the-art methods based on importance sampling and adaptive Kriging
Monte Carlo simulation are unable to solve this problem, the proposed method is
shown to offer accurate and robust estimates of VoI with a limited number of
model evaluations. Therefore, the proposed method facilitates the application
of VoI for complex decision problems.

MoS2 flakes with novel, single phase High Entropy Alloy (HEA) nanoparticles
using facile and scalable cryomilling technique, followed by sonochemical
method. It is found that the decoration of HEA nanoparticles impart surface
enhanced Raman scattering effect and reduction in the work function of the
material from 4.9 to 4.75 eV as measured by UV photoelectron spectroscopy. This
change in the work function results in a schottky barrier between the gold
contact and HEA decorated MoS2 flakes as a result of drastic changes in the
surface chemical non-stoichiometry. The response to hydrogen gas is studied at
temperatures 30 to 100 oC and it shows unusual p-type nature due to surface
adsorbed oxygen species. The nanoscale junction formed between HEA and MoS2
shows 10 times increase in the response towards hydrogen gas at 80 oC. The
experimental observations are further explained with DFT simulation showing
more favourable hydrogen adsorption on HEA decorated MoS2 resulting for
enhanced response.

reactions are not readily reversible, especially in solid state physics. For
example, thermal diffusion is a widely known concept, used among others to
inject dopant atoms into the substitutional positions in the matrix and improve
the device properties. Typically, such a diffusion process will create a
concentration gradient extending over increasingly large regions, without
possibility to reverse this effect. On the other hand, while the bottom up
growth of semiconducting nanowires is interesting, it can still be difficult to
fabricate axial heterostructures with high control. In this paper, we report a
reversible thermal diffusion process occurring in the solid-state exchange
reaction between an Al metal pad and a Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloy nanowire observed
by in-situ transmission electron microscopy. The thermally assisted reaction
results in the creation of a Si-rich region sandwiched between the reacted Al
and unreacted SixGe1-x part, forming an axial Al/Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$
heterostructure. Upon heating or (slow) cooling, the Al metal can repeatably
move in and out of the Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloy nanowire while maintaining the
rod-like geometry and crystallinity, allowing to fabricate and contact nanowire
heterostructures in a reversible way in a single process step, compatible with
current Si based technology. This interesting system is promising for various
applications, such as phase change memories in an all crystalline system with

this study presents a new modeling framework, named physics regularized machine
learning (PRML), to encode classical traffic flow models (referred as physical
models) into the ML architecture and to regularize the ML training process.
More specifically, a stochastic physics regularized Gaussian process (PRGP)
model is developed and a Bayesian inference algorithm is used to estimate the
mean and kernel of the PRGP. A physical regularizer based on macroscopic
traffic flow models is also developed to augment the estimation via a shadow GP
and an enhanced latent force model is used to encode physical knowledge into
stochastic processes. Based on the posterior regularization inference
framework, an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm is also developed to
maximize the evidence lowerbound of the system likelihood. To prove the
effectiveness of the proposed model, this paper conducts empirical studies on a
real-world dataset which is collected from a stretch of I-15 freeway, Utah.
Results show the new PRGP model can outperform the previous compatible methods,
such as calibrated pure physical models and pure machine learning methods, in

density because the restriction arising from concurrent momentum and energy
conservation limits the Auger rate. Here, we surprisingly found that the Auger
recombination in bulk Fe2O3 films was more efficient than narrow-bandgap
high-mobility semiconductors that were supposed to have much higher Auger rate
constants than metal oxides. The Auger process in Fe2O3 was ascribed to the
Coulombically coupled self-trapped excitons (STEs), which was enhanced by the
relaxation of momentum conservation because of the strong spatial localization
of these STEs. Furthermore, due to this localization effect the kinetic traces
of the STE annihilation for different STE densities exhibited characteristics
of quantized Auger recombination, and we demonstrated that these traces could
be simultaneously modeled by taking into account the quantized Auger rates.

Here we follow the evolution of this stellar wind material through

Galactic halo medium and ionisation by UV sources. We use the code ramses to
run 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study for the first time the ICM evolution

ionisation is mandatory to explain why only a very low amount of ionised gas is
observed in the core of GCs. The same mechanisms operating in ancient GCs that
clear the gas could also be efficient at younger ages, meaning that young GCs

sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of
Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on

we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive
induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions compared
to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the
use of a ""cold posterior"" that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors
sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic
in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could

approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding

training with a diverse set of query structures. We propose a more general
architecture that employs a graph neural network to encode a graph
representation of the query, where nodes correspond to entities and variables.
The generality of our method allows it to encode a more diverse set of query
types in comparison to previous work. Our method shows competitive performance
against previous models for complex queries, and in contrast with these models,
it can answer complex queries when trained for link prediction only. We show
that the model learns entity embeddings that capture the notion of entity type

The paper expands this idea by including the effects of Rashba type spin-orbit
coupling. The problem is studied theoretically by mapping the system to an
analytic effective Hamiltonian for 8 low energy states, comprising singlet and
triplet on each dot diagonal. The validity of the mapping is confirmed by
comparing the energy and spin of full and mapped system, and also by the
reproduction of charge-oscillation dynamics in the presence of magnetic flux.
The newly introduced Rashba coupling significantly enriches the system
dynamics, affecting the magnitude of charge oscillations and allowing the
controlled transitions between singlet and triplet states due to the spin
rotations, induced by spin-orbit coupling. The results indicate the possibility
for use of the studied system for quantum information processing, while
possible extensions of the system to serve as a qubit in a universal quantum
computer, fulfilling all five DiVincenzo criteria, are also discussed.

varied scenarios, some heuristics of adaptive-thresholding appeared in the
literature for constant false alarm rate (CFAR) criteria. These schemes used
the same adaptive-thresholding form that was originally derived for detecting
Swerling-I (exponential) target in exponentially distributed clutter.
Statistical procedures obtained under such idealistic assumptions would affect
the detection performance when applied to newer target and clutter models, esp.
heavy tail distributions like Pareto. Further, in addition to the sea clutter
returns, it has also been reported that Generalized Pareto distribution fits
best for the measured Radar-cross-section (RCS) data of a SAAB aircraft.
Therefore, in Radar application scenarios like Airborne Warning and Control
System (AWACS), when both the target and clutter are Pareto distributed, we
pose the detection problem as a two-sample, Pareto vs. Pareto composite
hypothesis testing problem. We address this problem by corroborating the binary
hypothesis framework instead of the conventional way of tweaking the existing
adaptive-thresholding CFAR detector. Whereby, for the composite case,
considering no knowledge of both scale and shape parameters of Pareto
distributed clutter, we derive the new adaptive-thresholding detector based on
the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) statistic. We further show that
our proposed adaptive-thresholding detector has a CFAR property. We provide
extensive simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed

reworked sediments and erosional products, commonly referred to as till. The
complex interplay between ice, meltwater, and till at the subglacial bed
connects several fundamental problems in glaciology including the debate about
rapid mass loss from the ice sheets, the formation and evolution of subglacial
landforms, and the storage and transport of subglacial water. In-situ
measurements have probed the subglacial bed, but provide surprisingly variable
and seemingly inconsistent evidence of the depth where deformation occurs, even
at a given field site. These observations suggest that subglacial beds are
inherently dynamic. The goal of this paper is to advance our understanding of
the physical processes that contribute to the dynamics of subglacial beds as
reflected in existing observations of basal deformation. We build on recent
advances in modeling dense, granular flows to derive a new numerical model for
water-saturated till. Our model demonstrates that changes in the force balance
or temporal variations in water pressure can shift slip away from the ice-bed
interface and far into the bed, causing episodes of significantly enhanced till
transport because the entire till layer above the deep slip interface becomes
mobilized. We compare our model results against observations of basal
deformation from both mountain glacier and ice-stream settings in the past and
present. We also present an analytical solution to assess the variability of
till transport for different glacial settings and hydraulic properties.

the one between the symmetry energy ($J$) and its slope ($L_0$), and other one

unavailabilities such as failing or slow servers. These unavailabilities
adversely affect the tail latency of computation in distributed
infrastructures. The simple solution of replicating computation entails
significant resource overhead. Coded computation has emerged as a
resource-efficient alternative, wherein multiple units of data are encoded to
create parity units and the function to be computed is applied to each of these
units on distinct servers. A decoder can use the available function outputs to
decode the unavailable ones. Existing coded computation approaches are resource
efficient only for simple variants of linear functions such as multilinear,
with even the class of low degree polynomials requiring the same multiplicative
overhead as replication for practically relevant straggler tolerance.
  In this paper, we present a new approach to model coded computation via the
lens of locality of codes. We introduce a generalized notion of locality,
denoted computational locality, building upon the locality of an appropriately
defined code. We show that computational locality is equivalent to the required
number of workers for coded computation and leverage results from the
well-studied locality of codes to design coded computation schemes. We show
that recent results on coded computation of multivariate polynomials can be
derived using local recovering schemes for Reed-Muller codes. We present coded
computation schemes for multivariate polynomials that adaptively exploit
locality properties of input data-- an inadmissible technique under existing
frameworks. These schemes require fewer workers than the lower bound under
existing coded computation frameworks, showing that the existing multiplicative
overhead on the number of servers is not fundamental for coded computation of
nonlinear functions.

geometrical frustration gives rise to large elastic stresses, which render the

increase of the intrinsic curvature in proximity of the disclinations or by the
proliferation of excess dislocations, often organized in the form of
one-dimensional chains known as ""scars"". The associated strain field of the
scars is such to counterbalance the one resulting from the isolated
disclinations. Here, we develop a continuum theory of dislocation screening in
two-dimensional closed crystals with genus one. Upon modeling the flux of scars
emanating from a given disclination as an independent scalar field, we
demonstrate that the elastic energy of closed two-dimensional crystals with

radiation pressure accelerating cool gas and (2) a hot outflowing wind

powerful means of differentiating these scenarios because of their sensitivity
to the expected compression of the ISM clouds by the hot wind. Here, we report
the first spatially resolved UV emission spectroscopy of a prototypical

remarkably similar for outflowing gas clouds <100 pc and ~10 kpc from the

dominated dynamics. Comparing the observed line emission to models of clouds in
balance with radiation pressure and/or a hot wind, we rule out the presence of
a dynamically important hot wind and constrain the ratio of hot gas pressure to
radiation pressure to P_hot/P_rad<0.25 both at <100 pc and ~10 kpc from the

smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes. This can be explained as an
evaporation valley between planets with and without H/He that is caused by
atmospheric escape. First, we conduct numerical simulations of the evolution of
close-in low-mass planets with H/He undergoing escape. Second, we develop an
analytical model for the valley locus. We find that the bottom of the valley
quantified by the radius of the largest stripped core $R_{\rm b}$ at a given
orbital distance depends only weakly on post-formation H/He mass. The reason is
that a high initial H/He mass means that there is more gas to evaporate, but
also that the planet density is lower, increasing loss. Regarding stellar
$L_{\rm XUV}$, $R_{\rm b}$ scales as $L_{\rm XUV}^{0.135}$. The same weak
dependency applies to the efficiency factor $\varepsilon$ of energy-limited
evaporation. As found numerically and analytically, $R_{\rm b}$ varies as
function of orbital period $P$ for a constant $\varepsilon$ as $P^{-2 p_{\rm
c}/3}\approx P^{-0.18}$ where $M \propto R^{p_{\rm c}}$ is the mass-radius
relation of solid cores. $R_{\rm b}$ is about 1.7 $R_{\oplus}$ at a 10-day
orbit for an Earth-like composition, increasing linearly with ice mass
fraction. The numerical results are explained very well with the analytical
model where complete evaporation occurs if the temporal integral over the
stellar XUV irradiation absorbed by the planet is larger than binding energy of
the envelope in the gravitational potential of the core. The weak dependency on
primordial H/He mass, $L_{\rm XUV}$ and $\varepsilon$ explains why
observationally the valley is visible, and why theoretically models find
similar results. At the same time, given the large observed spread of $L_{\rm
XUV}$, the dependency on it is still strong enough to explain why the valley is
not completely empty.

Those arising from a gauged $U(1)$ with the vector made massive via Higgsing
with an axion. The latter necessarily couples to instantons, and their action
can be constrained, using both the electric and magnetic version of the axionic
weak gravity conjecture, in terms of the cutoff of the theory. As a result,
instanton-induced symmetry breaking operators with a suppression factor not
smaller than $\exp(-M_{\rm P}^2/\Lambda^2)$ are present, where $\Lambda$ is a
cutoff of the 4d effective theory. We provide a general argument and clarify
the meaning of $\Lambda$. Simple 4d and 5d models are presented to illustrate
this, and we recall that this is the standard way in which things work out in
string compactifications with brane instantons. The relation of our constraint
to bounds that can be derived from wormholes or gravitational instantons and to
those motivated by black-hole effects at finite temperature are discussed, and

intractable mathematical structure to analyze, such as non-uniqueness of
maximally resourceful states, lack of convexity, and infinite dimension. We
investigate state conversion and resource measures in general QRTs under
minimal assumptions to figure out universal properties of physically motivated
quantum resources that may have such intractable mathematical structure. In the
general setting, we prove the existence of maximally resourceful states in
one-shot state conversion. Also analyzing asymptotic state conversion, we
discover catalytic replication of quantum resources, where a resource state is
infinitely replicable by free operations. In QRTs without assuming uniqueness
of maximally resourceful states, we formulate the tasks of distillation and
formation of quantum resources, and introduce distillable resource and resource
cost based on the distillation and the formation, respectively. Furthermore, we
introduce consistent resource measures that quantify the amount of quantum
resources without contradicting the rate of state conversion even in QRTs with
non-unique maximally resourceful states. Progressing beyond the previous work
showing a uniqueness theorem for additive resource measures, we prove the
corresponding uniqueness inequality for the consistent resource measures; that
is, consistent resource measures of a quantum state take values between the
distillable resource and the resource cost of the state. These formulations and
results establish a foundation of QRTs applicable to mathematically intractable

investigate the effects of rotation on the bulk properties of convection at
different latitudes, focusing on determining the relation between the heat flux

rotating mixing length theory (RMLT). The simplest version of RMLT (due to
Stevenson) considers the single mode that transports the most heat. This works
reasonably well in explaining our results, but there is a systematic departure
from these predictions (up to approximately $30\%$ in the temperature gradient)
at mid-latitudes. We develop a more detailed treatment of RMLT that includes
the transport afforded by multiple modes, and we show that this accounts for
most of the systematic differences. We also show that convectively-generated
zonal flows and meridional circulations are produced in our simulations, and
that their properties depend strongly on the dimensions of the box. These flows
also affect the heat transport, contributing to departures from RMLT at some
latitudes. However, we find the theoretical predictions of the multi-mode
theory for the mid-layer temperature gradient, the root-mean-square (RMS)
vertical velocity, the RMS temperature fluctuation, and the spatial spectrum of
the heat transport at different latitudes, are all in reasonably good agreement

low-velocity. All of these effects weaken and eventually vanish at lower halo

reflecting the ratio of CR to thermal+gravitational pressure in the outer halo.

we present predictions for constraining cosmological parameters such as the

the evolution of the equation of state of dark energy ($w$) through the Hubble

show that the eROSITA quasars, complemented by redshift and broad-band
photometric information, will supply the largest quasar sample at z<2, but with
very few objects available for cosmology at higher redshifts that survives the
cut for the Malmquist bias, as eROSITA will sample the brighter end of the
X-ray luminosity function. The power of the quasar Hubble diagram for precision
cosmology lies in the high-redshift regime, where quasars can be observed up to
redshift ~7.5, essential to discriminate amongst different model
extrapolations. Therefore, to be competitive for cosmology, the eROSITA quasar
Hubble diagram must be complemented with the already available quasar samples
and dedicated (deep) large programmes at redshift z>3.

with respect to the large scale structures (LSS) of the universe, which we
quantify via the cross-correlation of galaxy catalogs with GW ones. By using
both existing and forthcoming galaxy catalogs and using realistic Monte Carlo
simulations of GW events, we find that the cross-correlation signal should be
marginally detectable in a 10-year data taking of advanced LIGO-Virgo detectors

addition of KAGRA and LIGO-India to the GW detector network would allow for a
firmer detection of this signal and, in combination with future cosmological
surveys, would also permit the detection of cross-correlation for coalescing
black holes. Such a measurement may unveil, for instance, a primordial origin
of coalescing black holes. To attain this goal, we find that it is crucial to
adopt a tomographic approach and to reach a sufficiently accurate localization
of GW events. The depth of forthcoming surveys will be fully exploited by third

suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that capture the $\sim 10^4$
$M_\odot$ Jeans mass of unheated gas to study density fluctuations during
reionization. Our simulations track the complex ionization and hydrodynamical
response of gas in the wake of ionization fronts. The clumping factor of
ionized gas (proportional to the recombination rate) rises to a peak value of
$5-20$ approximately $\Delta t = 10$ Myr after ionization front passage,
depending on the incident intensity, redshift, and degree to which the gas had
been pre-heated by the first X-ray sources. The clumping factor reaches its
relaxed value of $\approx 3$ by $\Delta t = 300$ Myr. The mean free path of
Lyman-limit photons evolves in unison, being up to several times shorter in
un-relaxed, recently reionized regions compared to those that were reionized
much earlier. Assessing the impact of this response on the global reionizaton

originally believed that COMs initially form in ices which are then irradiated
by UV radiation from the surrounding interstellar radiation field as well as
forming protostars and subsequently photodesorbed into the gas-phase. However,
starless and prestellar cores do not have internal protostars to heat-up and
sublimate the ices. Alternative models using chemical energy have been
developed to explain the desorption of COMs, yet in order to test these models
robust measurements of COM abundances are needed toward representative samples

their masses. We are able to observe this by constructing a configuration that
makes it possible to apply gauge/gravity methods to study fundamental degrees

light-matter interactions at the nanoscale by enabling closer investigation of

instance, on Bose-Einstein condensation and polaritonic lasing. Nevertheless,
observing and visualising polaritons is challenging, and traditional optical
microscopy techniques often lead to ambiguities regarding the emergence and
strength of the plasmon-exciton coupling. Electron microscopy offers a more
robust means to study and verify the nature of plexcitons, but is still
hindered by instrument limitations and resolution. A simple theoretical
description of electron beam-excited plexcitons is therefore vital to
complement ongoing experimental efforts. Here we apply analytic solutions for
the electron-loss and photon-emission probabilities to evaluate plasmon-exciton
coupling studied either with the recently adopted technique of electron
energy-loss spectroscopy, or with the so-far unexplored in this context
cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Foreseeing the necessity to account for
quantum corrections in the plasmonic response, we extend these solutions within
the framework of general nonlocal hydrodynamic descriptions. As a specific
example we study core-shell spherical emitter-molecule hybrids, going beyond
the standard local-response approximation through the hydrodynamic Drude model
for screening and the generalised nonlocal optical response theory for nonlocal
damping. We show that electron microscopies are extremely powerful in
describing the interaction of emitters with the otherwise weakly excited by
optical means higher-order plasmonic multipoles, a response that survives when
quantum-informed models are considered.

The simulation begins with a MURaM 3D MHD datacube and ends with a `synthetic

observed by GONG. We determine a calibration by comparing the synthetic
magnetic field measurements with the MURaM magnetic field values that produced
them. The previous two papers have described the GONG measurement process (both
instrument and data processing), our simulation of it, and the theory of
magnetogram comparison and calibration. In this paper, we address some final
points on calibration, combine all of this work into a set of calibration
curves, and consider the results. We also review the results of the previous
two papers for locality of reference. Our calibration indicates that GONG
magnetograms underestimate weak flux by a factor of over 2 near disk center,
but that factor decreases to about 1 as the line-of-sight approaches the limb.
A preliminary investigation of the generalizability of these results suggests
other instruments will be affected in a similar way. We also find that some
differences in previous magnetograph comparisons are artifacts of instrumental
resolution which do not reflect an intrinsic calibration difference, and the
measurements are more similar than sometimes thought. These results are
directly applicable to question of solar wind prediction model accuracies,
particularly in the search for the cause of the common discrepancy between
predicted solar wind magnetic flux at 1 AU and values measured in situ by
current satellite missions.

is a function of whether or not it preserves flux, independent of its spatial
resolution. However, we find that the one-dimensional comparison methods most
often used for magnetograph calibration and comparison will show dramatic
differences between two magnetograms with differing spatial resolution, even if
they both preserve flux. Some of the apparent disagreement between magnetograms
found in the literature are likely a result of these instrumental resolution
differences rather than any intrinsic calibration differences. To avoid them,
spatial resolution must be carefully matched prior to comparing magnetograms or

decoding algorithms. To analyze this issue, we first define inconsistency of a
decoding algorithm, meaning that the algorithm can yield an infinite-length
sequence that has zero probability under the model. We prove that commonly used
incomplete decoding algorithms - greedy search, beam search, top-k sampling,

language models are trained to produce sequences of finite length. Based on
these insights, we propose two remedies which address inconsistency: consistent

States had attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies hope to
reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies
affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a
hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to
evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency on weekdays using passenger
count data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012
and 2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when
observing the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time.
In other words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive in
terms of passengers per vehicle-trip. When observing the variation within each
route-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional
vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus
already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a
decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that low-frequency routes are
the most sensitive to changes in frequency. This paper can help transit
agencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service throughout the
network. As the quality and availability of passenger count data improve, this
paper can serve as the methodological basis to explore the dynamics of bus
ridership.

internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.
The precise form of this representation is often considered to be a metric
representation of space. An internal representation, however, is judged by its
contribution to performance on a given task, and may thus vary between
different types of navigation tasks. Here we train a recurrent neural network
that controls an agent performing several navigation tasks in a simple
environment. To focus on internal representations, we split learning into a
task-agnostic pre-training stage that modifies internal connectivity and a
task-specific Q learning stage that controls the network's output. We show that
pre-training shapes the attractor landscape of the networks, leading to either
a continuous attractor, discrete attractors or a disordered state. These
structures induce bias onto the Q-Learning phase, leading to a performance
pattern across the tasks corresponding to metric and topological regularities.
By combining two types of networks in a modular structure, we could get better
performance for both regularities. Our results show that, in recurrent
networks, inductive bias takes the form of attractor landscapes -- which can be
shaped by pre-training and analyzed using dynamical systems methods.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-metric representations are useful for
navigation tasks, and their combination with metric representation leads to
flexibile multiple-task learning.

formation histories of these hosts are diverse, including one post-starburst
galaxy (ASASSN-14li), two hosts with recent weak starbursts (ASASSN-14ae and
iPTF15af), and one early type (PTF09ge). Compared to early type galaxies of
similar stellar masses, the TDE hosts have higher central surface brightnesses
and stellar mass surface densities on 30-100 pc scales. The TDE hosts do not
show the large, kpc-scale tidal disruptions seen in some post-starburst
galaxies; the hosts have low morphological asymmetries similar to those of
early type galaxies. The lack of strong asymmetries are inconsistent with a
recent major (~1:1 mass) merger, although minor ($\lesssim$1:3) mergers are
possible. Given the time elapsed since the end of the starbursts in the three
post-burst TDE hosts and the constraints on the merger mass ratios, it is
unlikely that a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) has had time to
coalesce. The TDE hosts have low central (<140 pc) ellipticities compared to
early type galaxies. The low central ellipticities disfavor a strong radial
anisotropy as the cause for the enhanced TDE rate, although we cannot rule out
eccentric disks at the scale of the black hole gravitational radius of
influence (~1 pc). These observations suggest that the high central stellar
densities are a more important driver than SMBHBs or radial anisotropies in
increasing the TDE rate in galaxies with recent starbursts.

geometry of the circumstellar material close to the star and its surroundings
is crucial. Aims. We aim to study the nature (i.e. geometry, rates) of
mass-loss episodes. In this context, yellow hypergiants are great targets.
Methods. We analyse a large set of optical/near-infrared data, in spectroscopic
and photometric (X-shooter/VLT), spectropolarimetric (ISIS/WHT), and
interferometric GRAVITY-AMBER/VLTI) modes, toward the yellow hypergiant IRAS
17163-3907. We present the first model-independent reconstructed images of IRAS
17163-3907 at these wavelengths at milli-arcsecond scales. Lastly, we apply a
2D radiative transfer model to fit the dereddened photometry and the radial
profiles of published VISIR images at 8.59 {\mu}m, 11.85 {\mu}m and 12.81
{\mu}m simultaneously, adopting the revised Gaia distance (DR2). Results. The
interferometric observables around 2 {\mu}m show that the Br{\gamma} emission
is more extended and asymmetric than the Na i and the continuum emission. In
addition to the two known shells surrounding IRAS 17163-3907 we report on the
existence of a third hot inner shell with a maximum dynamical age of only 30
yr. Conclusions. The interpretation of the presence of Na i emission at closer
distances to the star compared to Br{\gamma} has been a challenge in various
studies. We argue that the presence of a pseudophotosphere is not needed, but
it is rather an optical depth effect. The three observed distinct mass-loss
episodes are characterised by different mass-loss rates and can inform the
theories on mass-loss mechanisms, which is a topic still under debate. We
discuss these in the context of photospheric pulsations and wind bi-stability
mechanisms.

coefficients and provide a procedure for constructing a solution for an

solution is highly dependent upon the coefficients of scattering between the
inner and outer horizons, so we present the low-frequency behavior of, and
numerical solutions for, these quantities. We find that, for low enough
frequency, field amplitudes of solutions with purely positive or negative
frequency at each horizon will acquire only a phase after passing both the
inner and outer horizons, while at higher frequencies the amplitudes will tend
to grow exponentially either to the future or to the past, and decay
exponentially in the other direction. Regardless, we can always construct a

formulation is to remove hydrodynamic moments that are not supported by the

orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials, the form of a filtered collision
operator is obtained directly via truncation of the Hermite expansion. In this
paper, we present an extension of the filtered collision operator formulation
to enforce Galilean invariance. This is accomplished by representing
hydrodynamic moments in the relative reference frame with respect to local
fluid velocity. The resulting collision operator has a compact and fully
Galilean invariant form, and it can then be exactly expressed in terms of an
infinite Hermite expansion. Giving a lattice velocity set of specific order of
isotropy, a proper truncation of this expansion can be directly determined.
Higher order terms are retained in the truncation if a higher order lattice
velocity set is used, so that Galilean invariance is attained asymptotically.
The previously known filtered collision operator forms can be seen as a limit
of zero fluid velocity.

/\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ bits, the contraction factor of DQ-GD is the same as
that of unquantized GD, i.e., there is no loss due to quantization. We show
that no algorithm within a certain class can converge faster than
$\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$. Since quantizers exist with $\rho_n \to
1$ as $n \to \infty$ (Rogers, 1963), this means that DQ-GD is asymptotically
optimal. The principle of differential quantization continues to apply to
gradient methods with momentum such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent,
and Polyak's heavy ball method. For these algorithms as well, if the rate is
above a certain threshold, there is no loss in contraction factor obtained by
the differentially quantized algorithm compared to its unquantized counterpart.
Experimental results on least-squares problems validate our theoretical
analysis.

traditional ""MPI everywhere'"" model to better handle the disproportionate
increase in the number of cores compared with other on-node resources. Current
implementations of these two models represent the two extreme cases of
communication resource sharing in modern MPI implementations. In the
MPI-everywhere model, each MPI process has a dedicated set of communication
resources (also known as endpoints), which is ideal for performance but is
resource wasteful. With MPI+threads, current MPI implementations share a single
communication endpoint for all threads, which is ideal for resource usage but
is hurtful for performance.
  In this paper, we explore the tradeoff space between performance and
communication resource usage in MPI+threads environments. We first demonstrate
the two extreme cases---one where all threads share a single communication
endpoint and another where each thread gets its own dedicated communication
endpoint (similar to the MPI-everywhere model) and showcase the inefficiencies
in both these cases. Next, we perform a thorough analysis of the different
levels of resource sharing in the context of Mellanox InfiniBand. Using the
lessons learned from this analysis, we design an improved resource-sharing
model to produce \emph{scalable communication endpoints} that can achieve the
same performance as with dedicated communication resources per thread but using
just a third of the resources.

described via a coalgebra in the category of relations, of a lifted functor. A
final coalgebra then gives rise to the coinduction principle, which states that
two bisimilar elements are equal. For polynomial functors, this leads to
well-known descriptions. In the present paper we look at the dual notion of
""apartness"". Intuitively, two elements are apart if there is a positive way to
distinguish them. Phrased differently: two elements are apart if and only if
they are not bisimilar. Since apartness is an inductive notion, described by a
least fixed point, we can give a proof system, to derive that two elements are
apart. This proof system has derivation rules and two elements are apart if and
only if there is a finite derivation (using the rules) of this fact.
  We study apartness versus bisimulation in two separate ways. First, for weak
forms of bisimulation on labelled transition systems, where silent (tau) steps
are included, we define an apartness notion that corresponds to weak
bisimulation and another apartness that corresponds to branching bisimulation.
The rules for apartness can be used to show that two states of a labelled
transition system are not branching bismilar. To support the apartness view on
labelled transition systems, we cast a number of well-known properties of
branching bisimulation in terms of branching apartness and prove them. Next, we
also study the more general categorical situation and show that indeed,
apartness is the dual of bisimilarity in a precise categorical sense: apartness
is an initial algebra and gives rise to an induction principle. In this
analogy, we include the powerset functor, which gives a semantics to
non-deterministic choice in process-theory.

input bits in the face of malicious agents, is a powerful primitive that lies
at the core of a vast range of distributed protocols. Interestingly, in
protocols with the best overall communication, the demands of the parties are
highly unbalanced: the amortized cost is $\tilde O(1)$ bits per party, but some
parties must send $\Omega(n)$ bits. In best known balanced protocols, the
overall communication is sub-optimal, with each party communicating $\tilde
O(\sqrt{n})$. In this work, we ask whether asymmetry is inherent for optimizing
total communication. Our contributions in this line are as follows:
  1) We define a cryptographic primitive, succinctly reconstructed distributed
signatures (SRDS), that suffices for constructing $\tilde O(1)$ balanced BA. We
provide two constructions of SRDS from different cryptographic and Public-Key
Infrastructure (PKI) assumptions.
  2) The SRDS-based BA follows a paradigm of boosting from ""almost-everywhere""
agreement to full agreement, and does so in a single round. We prove that PKI
setup and cryptographic assumptions are necessary for such protocols in which
every party sends $o(n)$ messages.
  3) We further explore connections between a natural approach toward attaining
SRDS and average-case succinct non-interactive argument systems (SNARGs) for a
particular type of NP-Complete problems (generalizing Subset-Sum and
Subset-Product).
  Our results provide new approaches forward, as well as limitations and
barriers, towards minimizing per-party communication of BA. In particular, we
construct the first two BA protocols with $\tilde O(1)$ balanced communication,
offering a tradeoff between setup and cryptographic assumptions, and answering
an open question presented by King and Saia (DISC'09).

approach is able to accurately simulate problems in scattering dominated
regimes. However, it requires less memory and yields a faster computational
time than a uniform DG discretization. In addition, the underlying splitting
allows naturally for hybridization in both space and angle. Numerical results

importance of tuning hyperparameters, it remains expensive and is often done in
a naive and laborious way. A recent solution to this problem is Population
Based Training (PBT) which updates both weights and hyperparameters in a single
training run of a population of agents. PBT has been shown to be particularly
effective in RL, leading to widespread use in the field. However, PBT lacks
theoretical guarantees since it relies on random heuristics to explore the
hyperparameter space. This inefficiency means it typically requires vast
computational resources, which is prohibitive for many small and medium sized
labs. In this work, we introduce the first provably efficient PBT-style
algorithm, Population-Based Bandits (PB2). PB2 uses a probabilistic model to
guide the search in an efficient way, making it possible to discover high
performing hyperparameter configurations with far fewer agents than typically
required by PBT. We show in a series of RL experiments that PB2 is able to
achieve high performance with a modest computational budget.

(asymmetric dumbbell) as a function of the Reynolds number (Re) and investigate
how the onset and gradual increase of inertia impacts the swimming behavior: a
reversal in the swim direction, flow directions, and the swim stroke. We divide
the swim stroke into the expansion and compression of the two spheres and
relate them to power and recovery strokes. We find that the switch in swim
direction also corresponds to a switch in power and recovery strokes. We obtain
expressions for the mean swimming velocity by collapsing the net displacement
during expansion and compression under power law relationships with respect to
Re, the swimmer's amplitude, and the distance between the two spheres.
Analyzing the fluid flows, we see the averaged flow field during expansion
always resembles a pusher and compression always a puller, but when averaged
over the whole cycle, the flow that dominates is the one that occurs during the
power stroke. We also relate the power and recovery strokes to the swimming
efficiency during times of expansion and compression, and we find that the
power stroke is, surprisingly, not always more efficient than the recovery
stroke. Our results may have important implications for biology and ultimately
the design of artificial swimmers.

the linearized small signal model near the operating point. Therefore, the
performance of the controller in the start up, load change, or reference change

The neural network predictive controller optimally controls the buck converter
by following the concept of the traditional model predictive controller. The
advantage of the NNPC is that the neural network system identification
decreases the inaccuracy of the system model with inaccurate parameters. A NNPC
with a well trained neural network can perform as an optimal controller for the
buck converter. To compare the effectiveness of the traditional buck converter

semi-supervised domain adaptation by unifying the learning of opposite

source-scattering classifier and the target-clustering classifier), which are
trained for contradictory purposes. The target-clustering classifier attempts
to cluster the target features to improve intra-class density and enlarge
inter-class divergence. Meanwhile, the source-scattering classifier is designed
to scatter the source features to enhance the decision boundary's smoothness.
Through the alternation of source-feature expansion and target-feature
clustering procedures, the target features are well-enclosed within the dilated
boundary of the corresponding source features. This strategy can make the
cross-domain features to be precisely aligned against the source bias
simultaneously. Moreover, to overcome the model collapse through training, we
progressively update the measurement of feature's distance and their
representation via an adversarial training paradigm. Extensive experiments on
the benchmarks of DomainNet and Office-home datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

codes. We use constraints from pressure modes to infer the CBM properties of
Kepler and CoRoT main-sequence and subgiant oscillators, as well as in two
radial velocity targets (Procyon A and $\alpha$ Cen A). Collectively these
targets allow us to identify how measurement precision, stellar spectral type,

physical expectations and calibrations from binaries and clusters. However, two
F-stars in the CoRoT field (HD 49933 and HD 181906) still necessitate high
overshoot in the models. Due to short mode lifetimes, mode identification can
be difficult in these stars. We demonstrate that an incongruence between the

the cause of seemingly anomalous physics for such stars is vital for inferring

which is mostly unavoidable.
  The focus of this paper is to investigate practical solutions to mine

can be used for educated decision making on water planning strategies. We
perform a systematic study of the errors existing in a large-scale smart water

  Identifying customers contributing to a load peak is used as the main filter.
The filter outputs are then combined with the domain expert knowledge to
evaluate their accuracy and validity and also to look for potential errors.
After discovering each error, we analyze its trails in the data and track back
its source, which would eventually lead to the removal of the error or dealing
with it accordingly. This procedure is applied progressively to ensure that all
detectable errors are discovered and characterized in the data model.
  We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using the smart water

this category is not the usual one, but rather a warping of it by a certain
monoidal comonad $Q$. Thus the enrichment base is not a monoidal category in
the usual sense, but rather a skew monoidal category in the sense of
Szlach\'anyi. Our first main result is that cartesian differential categories
are the same as categories with finite products enriched over this skew
monoidal base.
  The comonad $Q$ involved is, in fact, an example of a differential modality.
Differential modalities are a kind of comonad on a symmetric monoidal
$k$-linear category with the characteristic feature that their co-Kleisli
categories are cartesian differential categories. Using our first main result,
we are able to prove our second one: that every small cartesian differential
category admits a full, structure-preserving embedding into the cartesian
differential category induced by a differential modality (in fact, a monoidal
differential modality on a monoidal closed category -- thus, a model of
intuitionistic differential linear logic). This resolves an important open
question in this area.

configuration of an isolated black hole is the Kerr spacetime, which has a
unique multipolar structure and a spherical shape when non-spinning. This is in
striking contrast to the case of other self-gravitating objects, which instead
can in principle have arbitrary deformations even in the static case. Here we
develop a general perturbative framework to construct stationary stars with
small axisymmetric deformations, and study explicitly compact stars with an
intrinsic quadrupole moment. The latter can be sustained, for instance, by
crust stresses or strong magnetic fields. While our framework is general, we
focus on quadrupolar deformations of neutron stars induced by an anisotropic
crust, which continuously connect to spherical neutron stars in the isotropic
limit. Deformed neutron stars might provide a more accurate description for
stellar remnants formed in supernovae and in binary mergers, and can be used to
improve constraints on the neutron-star equation of state through
gravitational-wave detections and through the observation of low-mass X-ray
binaries. We argue that, if the (dimensionless) intrinsic quadrupole moment is
of a few percent or higher, the effect of the deformation is stronger than that
of tidal interactions in coalescing neutron-star binaries, and might also
significantly affect the electromagnetic signal from accreting neutron stars.

coupled to a semiconductor (gap $2 \Delta$) and weakly coupled to a metal,
displays a 'reentrant' Kondo stage at low temperatures. The NRG analysis of the
corresponding Single Impurity Anderson Model (SIAM) shows that the reentrant
stage is characterized by a second sequence of SIAM fixed points: free orbital
(FO) > local moment (LM) > strong coupling (SC). In the first stage, the SC
fixed point (Kondo temperature $T_{K1}$) is unstable, while the second stage
exhibits a much lower Kondo temperature $T_{K2}$, associated to a stable SC
fixed point. The results indicate that the reentrant Kondo screening is
associated to an effective SIAM, with an effective repulsion $U_{eff}$. This
low temperature effective SIAM, which we dub as 'reentrant' SIAM, behaves as a
'replica' of the high temperature (bare) SIAM. The intuitive picture that
emerges is that the first Kondo state develops through impurity screening by
semiconducting electrons, while the second Kondo state involves screening by
metallic electrons, once the semiconducting electrons are out of reach to
thermal excitations ($T < \Delta$) and only the metallic spectral weight inside
the gap is available for impurity screening. In addition, we analyze a hybrid
system formed by a QI `sandwiched' between an armchair graphene nanoribbon
(AGNR) and a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with respective couplings
set to reproduce the generic model described above. The energy gap in the AGNR
can be externally tuned by an electric-field-induced Rashba spin-orbit
interaction. We analyzed this system for realistic parameter values, using NRG,
and concluded that the reentrant SIAM, with its associated second stage Kondo,
is worthy of experimental investigation.

interacting binary stars. Our aim is to find analytical formulae describing the
outflow structure. In each binary system the more massive star is in the
asymptotic giant branch and its wind is driven by a combination of pulsations
in the stellar surface layers and radiation pressure on dust, while the less
massive star is in the main sequence. Time averages of density and outflow
velocity of the stellar wind are calculated and plotted as profiles against
distance from the centre of mass and colatitude angle. We find that mass is
lost mainly through the outer Lagrangian point L2. The resultant outflow
develops into a spiral at low distances from the binary. The outflowing spiral
is quickly smoothed out by shocks and becomes an excretion disk at larger
distances. This leads to the formation of an outflow structure with an
equatorial density excess, which is greater in binaries with smaller orbital
separation. The pole-to-equator density ratio reaches a maximum value of
$\sim10^5$ at Roche-Lobe Overflow state. We also find that the gas stream
leaving L2 does not form a circumbinary ring for stellar mass ratios above
0.78, when radiation pressure on dust is taken into account. Analytical
formulae are obtained by curve fitting the 2-dimensional, azimuthally averaged
density and outflow velocity profiles. The formulae can be used in future
studies to setup the initial outflow structure in hydrodynamic simulations of
common-envelope evolution and formation of planetary nebulae.

introduces a plug-and-play module named `multimodal controller' to generate
multimodal data without introducing additional learning parameters. In the
absence of the controllers, our model reduces to non-conditional generative
models. We test the efficacy of multimodal controllers on CIFAR10, COIL100, and

This work incorporates the final Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalog and data
products and augments them with updated stellar properties using Gaia DR2 and
2MASS PSC. We apply a set of selection criteria to select a sample of 1,746
Kepler M dwarf targets that host 89 associated planet candidates. These early M
dwarfs and late K dwarfs were selected from cross-referenced targets using
several photometric quality flags from Gaia DR2 and color-magnitude cuts using
2MASS magnitudes. We estimate a habitable zone occurrence rate of
$f_{\textrm{M,HZ}} = 0.33^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$ for planets with $0.75-1.5$
R$_\oplus$ size. We caution that occurrence rate estimates for Kepler M stars
are sensitive to the choice of prior due to the small sample of target stars
and planet candidates. For example, we find an occurrence rate of
$4.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}$ or $8.4^{+1.2}_{-1.1}$ planets per M dwarf (integrating
over $R_p = 0.5-4~\textrm{R}_\oplus$ and $P = 0.5-256$ days) for our two
choices of prior. These occurrence rates are greater than those for FGK dwarf
target when compared at the same range of orbital periods, but similar to
occurrence rates when computed as a function of equivalent stellar insolation.
Combining our result with recent studies of exoplanet architectures indicates
that most, and potentially all, early-M dwarfs harbor planetary systems.

deliver better policy interventions. One key ingredient in optimal ITR
estimation problems is to estimate the average treatment effect conditional on
a subject's covariate information, which is often challenging in observational
studies due to the universal concern of unmeasured confounding. Instrumental
variables (IVs) are widely-used tools to infer the treatment effect when there
is unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome. In this work, we
propose a general framework of approaching the optimal ITR estimation problem

introduce a novel notion of optimality called ""IV-optimality"". A treatment rule
is said to be IV-optimal if it minimizes the maximum risk with respect to the
putative IV and the set of IV identification assumptions. We derive a bound on
the risk of an IV-optimal rule that illuminates when an IV-optimal rule has
favorable generalization performance. We propose a classification-based

analysis of the spectral graph and studied the properties of existing graph

the newly proposed dynamic system, which can be considered as the suspected

the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of

algorithms and comparing statistical quantities such as mean or variance in
stationary segments. We thus derive the existence of such equivalence relations

great success owing to the powerful feature representation ability of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Among these methods, classification-based
tracking methods exhibit excellent performance while their speeds are heavily
limited by the expensive computation for massive proposal feature extraction.
In contrast, matching-based tracking methods (such as Siamese networks) possess
remarkable speed superiority. However, the absence of online updating renders
these methods unadaptable to significant object appearance variations. In this
paper, we propose a novel real-time visual tracking method, which adopts an
object-adaptive LSTM network to effectively capture the video sequential

computational efficiency, we also present a fast proposal selection strategy,
which utilizes the matching-based tracking method to pre-estimate dense
proposals and selects high-quality ones to feed to the LSTM network for
classification. This strategy efficiently filters out some irrelevant proposals
and avoids the redundant computation for feature extraction, which enables our
method to operate faster than conventional classification-based tracking
methods. In addition, to handle the problems of sample inadequacy and class
imbalance during online tracking, we adopt a data augmentation technique based
on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to facilitate the training of the
LSTM network. Extensive experiments on four visual tracking benchmarks
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in terms of both

by considering the awareness of self-protection of individuals. In the model, a
tuning parameter is introduced to quantify the reaction strength of individuals
when they are aware of the disease. And then, a coupled model of resource
allocation and disease spreading is proposed to study the impact of
self-awareness on resource allocation and, its impact on the dynamics of
epidemic spreading. Through theoretical analysis and extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, we find that in the stationary state, the system converges to two
states: the whole healthy or the completely infected, which indicates an abrupt
increase in the prevalence when there is a shortage of resources. More
importantly, we find that too cautious and too selfless for the people during
the outbreak of an epidemic are both not suitable for disease control. Through
extensive simulations, we find the optimal point, at which there is a maximum
value of the epidemic threshold, and an outbreak can be delayed to the greatest
extent. At last, we study further the effects of network structure on the
coupled dynamics. We find that the degree heterogeneity promotes the outbreak
of disease, and the network structure does not alter the optimal phenomenon in

Block Model (SBM), the Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM), and the Popularity

block models do not have a nested structure. In addition, there is a
substantial jump in the number of parameters from the DCBM to the PABM. The
objective of this paper is formulation of a hierarchy of block model which does
not rely on arbitrary identifiability conditions. We propose a Nested Block
Model (NBM) that treats the SBM, the DCBM and the PABM as its particular cases
with specific parameter values, and, in addition, allows a multitude of
versions that are more complicated than DCBM but have fewer unknown parameters
than the PABM. The latter allows one to carry out clustering and estimation
without preliminary testing, to see which block model is really true.

us to organize a reduced $ \hbar$ expansion for the collision term and to
formally identity the spin-diffusion effect and the spin-polarization effect at

smoothly reduces to the chiral kinetic theory in the massless limit, serving as
a consistency check. In the absence of electromagnetic fields, we further

the nonlinear nature of the models, the state estimation problem is generally
intractable as it involves integrals of general nonlinear functions and the
filtered and smoothed state distributions lack closed-form solutions. As such,
it is common to approximate the state estimation problem. In this paper, we
develop an assumed Gaussian solution based on variational inference, which
offers the key advantage of a flexible, but principled, mechanism for
approximating the required distributions. Our main contribution lies in a new
formulation of the state estimation problem as an optimisation problem, which
can then be solved using standard optimisation routines that employ exact
first- and second-order derivatives. The resulting state estimation approach
involves a minimal number of assumptions and applies directly to nonlinear
systems with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian probabilistic models. The
performance of our approach is demonstrated on several examples; a challenging
scalar system, a model of a simple robotic system, and a target tracking
problem using a von Mises-Fisher distribution and outperforms alternative
assumed Gaussian approaches to state estimation.

terms of increasing statistical power, enabling detection of effects of smaller
magnitude than would be possible when analyzing each study separately and also
allowing to systematically investigate between-study differences. Restrictions
due to privacy or proprietary data as well as more practical concerns can make
it hard to share neuroimaging datasets, such that analyzing all data in a
common location might be impractical or impossible. Meta-analytic methods
provide a way to overcome this issue, by combining aggregated quantities like
model parameters or risk ratios. Most meta-analytic tools focus on parametric
statistical models, and methods for meta-analyzing semi-parametric models like
generalized additive models have not been well developed. Parametric models are
often not appropriate in neuroimaging, where for instance age-brain
relationships may take forms that are difficult to accurately describe using
such models. In this paper we introduce meta-GAM, a method for meta-analysis of
generalized additive models which does not require individual participant data,
and hence is suitable for increasing statistical power while upholding privacy
and other regulatory concerns. We extend previous works by enabling the
analysis of multiple model terms as well as multivariate smooth functions. In
addition, we show how meta-analytic $p$-values can be computed for smooth
terms. The proposed methods are shown to perform well in simulation
experiments, and are demonstrated in a real data analysis on hippocampal volume
and self-reported sleep quality data from the Lifebrain consortium. We argue
that application of meta-GAM is especially beneficial in lifespan neuroscience

optimization and deep learning, we propose a model-driven approach to jointly
design the common measurement matrix and GROUP LASSO-based jointly sparse
signal recovery method for complex sparse signals, based on the standard
auto-encoder structure for real numbers. The encoder achieves noisy linear
compression for jointly sparse signals, with a common measurement matrix. The
GROUP LASSO-based decoder realizes jointly sparse signal recovery based on an
iterative parallel-coordinate descent (PCD) algorithm which is proposed to
solve GROUP LASSO in a parallel manner. In particular, the decoder consists of
an approximation part which unfolds (several iterations of) the proposed
iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate solution of GROUP LASSO and a
correction part which reduces the difference between the approximate solution
and the actual jointly sparse signals. The proposed model-driven approach
achieves higher recovery accuracy with less computation time than the classic
GROUP LASSO method, and the gain significantly increases in the presence of
extra structures in sparse patterns. The common measurement matrix obtained by
the proposed model-driven approach is also suitable for the classic GROUP LASSO
method. We consider an application example, i.e., channel estimation in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)-based grant-free random access which is
proposed to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) for Internet of
Things (IoT). By numerical results, we demonstrate the substantial gains of the
proposed model-driven approach over GROUP LASSO and AMP when the number of
jointly sparse signals is not very large.

of work exists for the Travelling Thief Problem, including multi-objective

However, as many realistic scenarios are non-static in time, dynamic
formulations have yet to be considered for the TTP. Definition of dynamics
within three areas of the TTP problem are addressed; in the city locations,
availability map and item values. Based on the elucidation of solution
conservation between initial sets and obtained non-dominated sets, we define a
range of initialisation mechanisms using solutions generated via solvers,
greedily and randomly. These are then deployed to seed the population after a
change and the performance in terms of hypervolume and spread is presented for
comparison. Across a range of problems with varying TSP-component and
KP-component sizes, we observe interesting trends in line with existing
conclusions; there is little benefit to using randomisation as a strategy for
initialisation of solution populations when the optimal TSP and KP component
solutions can be exploited. Whilst these separate optima don't guarantee good
TTP solutions, when combined, provide better initial performance and therefore
in some examined instances, provides the best response to dynamic changes. A
combined approach that mixes solution generation methods to provide a composite
population in response to dynamic changes provides improved performance in some
instances for the different dynamic TTP formulations. Potential for further
development of a more cooperative combined method are realised to more
cohesively exploit known information about the problems.

parameters. As ancillary contributions, a new approximate discrete inference
procedure is presented which uses evidence on loops in a graph and is based on

anonymous and execute the same deterministic algorithm, so symmetry can be
broken only in one way: by different wake-up times of the nodes. In which
situations is it possible to break symmetry and elect a leader using time as
symmetry breaker? To answer this question, we consider configurations. A
configuration is the underlying graph with nodes tagged by non-negative
integers with the following meaning. A node can either wake up spontaneously in
the round shown on its tag, according to some global clock, or can be woken up
hearing a message sent by one of its already awoken neighbours. The local clock
of a node starts at its wakeup and nodes do not have access to the global clock
determining their tags. A configuration is feasible if there exists a
distributed algorithm that elects a leader for this configuration.
  Our main result is a complete algorithmic characterization of feasible
configurations: we design a centralized decision algorithm, working in
polynomial time, whose input is a configuration and which decides if the
configuration is feasible. We also provide a dedicated deterministic
distributed leader election algorithm for each feasible configuration that
elects a leader for this configuration in time $O(n^2\sigma)$, where $n$ is the
number of nodes and $\sigma$ is the difference between the largest and smallest
tag of the configuration. We then prove that there cannot exist a universal
deterministic distributed algorithm electing a leader for all feasible
configurations. In fact, we show that such a universal algorithm cannot exist
even for the class of 4-node feasible configurations. We also prove that a

Two overlooked issues are how large we can take the timestep in these

standard recipe that relies on Hamiltonian lattice QFT. The first issue is
crucial in practice for, e.g., trapped-ion experiments which actually have a
lower bound on the possible ratio of timestep to lattice spacing. To this end,
we show that a timestep equal to or going to zero faster than the spatial
lattice spacing is necessary for quantum simulations of QFT, but far more
importantly a timestep equal to the lattice spacing is actually sufficient. To
do this, first for $\phi^4$ theory, we give a quantum circuit exactly
equivalent to the real-time path integral from the discrete-time Lagrangian
formulation of lattice QFT. Next we give another circuit with no lattice QFT
analogue, but, by using Feynman rules applied to the circuit, we see that it
also reproduces the correct continuum behaviour. Finally, we look at
non-abelian gauge fields, showing that the discrete-time lattice QFT
path-integral is exactly equivalent to a finite-depth local circuit. All of
these circuits have an analogue of a lightcone on the lattice and therefore are
examples of quantum cellular automata. Aside from the potential practical
benefit of these circuits, this all suggests that the path-integral approach to
lattice QFT need not be overlooked in quantum simulations of physics and has a

viewers. It encourages users engagement on online video sites, and is also a
good benchmark for video-to-text generation. Recent work on this task adopts
encoder-decoder models to generate comments. However, these methods do not
model the interaction between videos and comments explicitly, so they tend to
generate popular comments that are often irrelevant to the videos. In this
work, we aim to improve the relevance between live comments and videos by
modeling the cross-modal interactions among different modalities. To this end,
we propose a multimodal matching transformer to capture the relationships among
comments, vision, and audio. The proposed model is based on the transformer
framework and can iteratively learn the attention-aware representations for
each modality. We evaluate the model on a publicly available live commenting
dataset. Experiments show that the multimodal matching transformer model
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

wave of research on representation learning for source code, which builds on
similar NLP methods. The overall objective is then to produce code embeddings
that capture the maximum of program semantics. State-of-the-art approaches
invariably rely on a syntactic representation (i.e., raw lexical tokens,
abstract syntax trees, or intermediate representation tokens) to generate
embeddings, which are criticized in the literature as non-robust or
non-generalizable. In this work, we investigate a novel embedding approach
based on the intuition that source code has visual patterns of semantics. We
further use these patterns to address the outstanding challenge of identifying
semantic code clones. We propose the WYSIWIM (""What You See Is What It Means"")
approach where visual representations of source code are fed into powerful
pre-trained image classification neural networks from the field of computer
vision to benefit from the practical advantages of transfer learning. We
evaluate the proposed embedding approach on two variations of the task of
semantic code clone identification: code clone detection (a binary
classification problem), and code classification (a multi-classification
problem). We show with experiments on the BigCloneBench (Java) and Open Judge
(C) datasets that although simple, our WYSIWIM approach performs as effectively
as state of the art approaches such as ASTNN or TBCNN. We further explore the
influence of different steps in our approach, such as the choice of visual
representations or the classification algorithm, to eventually discuss the
promises and limitations of this research direction.

the variational distribution to a more compact parameterization. For a variety
of deep Bayesian neural networks trained using Gaussian mean-field variational
inference, we find that the posterior standard deviations consistently exhibit
strong low-rank structure after convergence. This means that by decomposing
these variational parameters into a low-rank factorization, we can make our
variational approximation more compact without decreasing the models'

improve the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradient estimates of the

orthorhombic ferroelectric (FE) state that is ideal for applications, e.g. in
memories or negative-capacitance field-effect transistors. The origin of this
FE state remains a mystery, though, as none of the proposed mechanisms for its
stabilization -- from surface and size effects to formation kinetics -- is
fully convincing. Interestingly, it is known that doping HfO2 with various
cations favors the occurrence of the FE polymorph; however, existing
first-principles works suggest that doping by itself is not sufficient to
stabilize the polar phase over the usual non-polar monoclinic ground state.
Here we use first-principles methods to reexamine this question. We consider
two representative isovalent substitutional dopants, Si and Zr, and study their
preferred arrangement within the HfO2 lattice. Our results reveal that small
atoms like Si can adopt very stable configurations (forming layers within
specific crystallographic planes) in the FE orthorhombic phase of HfO2, but
comparatively less so in the non-polar monoclinic one. Further, we find that,
at low concentrations, such a dopant ordering yields a FE ground state, the
usual paraelectric phase becoming a higher-energy metastable polymorph. We
discuss the implications of our findings, which constitute a definite step
forward towards understanding ferroelectricity in HfO2.

range of imaging applications in which the SSIM can be employed as a fidelity

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising success in many

practical challenges in terms of slow learning rates, sample inefficiency, and

challenging situation such as dense traffic scenarios. The effectiveness of the
proposed policy is validated by using metrics of task success rate and

outside. Such a remarkable property leads to good (resp.\ poor) reconstruction
for normal (resp.\ abnormal) data and therefore provides a strong guarantee for
anomaly detection. Decoded memory units in MEMGAN are more interpretable and
disentangled than previous methods, which further demonstrates the
effectiveness of the memory mechanism. Experimental results on twenty anomaly
detection datasets of CIFAR-10 and MNIST show that MEMGAN demonstrates
significant improvements over previous anomaly detection methods.

(MW) halo, exploring the parameter space for a widely-used star formation and
feedback model in the {\tt Enzo} simulation code. We propose a novel way to
match observations, using functional fits to the observed baryon makeup over a
wide range of halo masses. The model MW galaxy is calibrated using three
parameters: the star formation efficiency $\left(f_*\right)$, the efficiency of
thermal energy from stellar feedback $\left(\epsilon\right)$ and the region
into which feedback is injected $\left(r\ {\rm and}\ s\right)$. We find that
changing the amount of feedback energy affects the baryon content most
significantly. We then identify two sets of feedback parameter values that are
both able to reproduce the baryonic properties for haloes between
$10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $10^{12}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We can potentially
improve the agreement by incorporating more parameters or physics. If we choose
to focus on one property at a time, we can obtain a more realistic halo baryon
makeup. We show that the employed feedback prescription is insensitive to dark
matter mass resolution between $10^5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and $10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}$.
Contrasting both star formation criteria and the corresponding combination of
optimal feedback parameters, we also highlight that feedback is
self-consistent: to match the same baryonic properties, with a relatively
higher gas to stars conversion efficiency, the feedback strength required is
lower, and vice versa. Lastly, we demonstrate that chaotic variance in the code
can cause deviations of approximately 10\% and 25\% in the stellar and baryon
mass in simulations evolved from identical initial conditions.

it is intractable to deliver all senses at the highest quality, we propose a
resource distribution scheme in order to achieve an optimal perceptual

resource balancing for multi-modal scenarios composed of aural, visual and

experiment identified perceptual boundaries for olfactory computation. In the
second experiment, participants (N=25) were asked, across a fixed number of
budgets (M=5), to identify what they perceived to be the best visual, acoustic

demonstrate that participants tend to prioritise visual quality compared to
other sensory stimuli. However, as the budget size is increased, users prefer a
balanced distribution of resources with an increased preference for having
smell impulses in the VE. Based on the collected data, a quality prediction
model is proposed and its accuracy is validated against previously unused
budgets and an untested scenario in a third and final experiment.

by affirmative phrases (""At least"") or negative phrases (""Not less than"").
Problem: It is long assumed that negation in quantification negatively affects
the readability of requirements, however, empirical research on these topics
remains sparse. Principal Idea: In a web-based experiment with 51 participants,
we compare the impact of negations and quantifiers on readability in terms of

need to combine constraints on the expansion rate and growth of structure. The
growth rate is usually extracted from three dimensional galaxy maps by
exploiting the effects of peculiar motions on galaxy clustering. However,
theoretical models of the probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy
pairwise peculiar velocities are not accurate enough on small scales to reduce
the error on theoretical predictions to the level required to match the
precision expected for measurements from future surveys. Here, we improve the
modelling of the pairwise velocity distribution by using the Skew-T PDF, which
has nonzero skewness and kurtosis. Our model accurately reproduces the
redshift-space multipoles (monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole) predicted by
N-body simulations, above scales of about $10\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We illustrate
how a Taylor expansion of the streaming model can reveal the contributions of
the different moments to the clustering multipoles, which are independent of
the shape of the velocity PDF. The Taylor expansion explains why the Gaussian
streaming model works well in predicting the first two redshift-space
multipoles, although the velocity PDF is non-Gaussian even on large scales.
Indeed, any PDF with the correct first two moments would produce precise
results for the monopole down to scales of about $10\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and for
the quadrupole down to about $30\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. An accurate model for the

  In previous works \cite{C,Y2}, some qualitative properties of solutions of

more general case where $a>0$. The additional difficulties of this case come
from the fact that the nonlinearity is no longer monotone and the data are

solutions by the monotonicity method combined with the supersolutions and
subsolutions technique. Instead we develop a new and self-contained approach
which enables us to emphasize the role played by the gravitation in the gauged

$(E)$ has a layer's structure of solutions $\{u_\beta\}_{\beta\in(-2(N-M),\,

$u_{\beta}=\beta\ln |x|+O(1)$ for $-2(N-M)<\beta<-2$ and $u_{-2}=-2\ln

the set of solutions to problem $(E)$ has a much richer structure: besides the
topological solutions, there exists a sequence of non-topological solutions in
type I, i.e. such that $u $ tends to $-\infty$ at infinity, and of
non-topological solutions of type II, which tend to $\infty$ at infinity. The
existence of these types of solutions depends on the values of the parameters
$N,\, M,\, \beta$ and on the gravitational interaction associated to $a$.

Heusler compounds to adjust the degree of spin polarization P from 60 to 100%

experimentally that the damping decreases when increasing the spin polarization
from 1.1 10-3 for Co2MnAl with 63% spin polarization to an ultra-low value of
4.10-4 for the half-metal magnet Co2MnSi. This allows us investigating the
relation between these two parameters and the ultrafast demagnetization time
characterizing the loss of magnetization occurring after femtosecond laser
pulse excitation. The demagnetization time is observed to be inversely
proportional to 1-P and as a consequence to the magnetic damping, which can be

phonons, while for other properties, such as the free energy, especially
high-frequency phonons count. For all these quantities one needs to know the
entire phonon band structure, whose simulation becomes exceedingly expensive
for more complex systems when using methods like dispersion-corrected density
functional theory (DFT). Therefore, in the present contribution we evaluate the
performance of more approximate methodologies, including density functional
tight binding (DFTB) and a pool of force fields (FF) of varying complexity and
sophistication. Beyond merely comparing phonon band structures, we also
critically evaluate to what extent derived quantities, like
temperature-dependent heat capacities, mean squared thermal displacements and
temperature-dependent free energies are impacted by shortcomings in the
description of the phonon bands. As a benchmark system, we choose (deuterated)
naphthalene, as the only organic semiconductor material for which to date
experimental phonon band structures are available in the literature. Overall,
the best performance amongst the approximate methodologies is observed for a
system-specifically parametrized second-generation force field. Interestingly,
in the low-frequency regime also force fields with a rather simplistic model
for the bonding interactions (like the General Amber Force Field) perform
rather well. As far as the tested DFTB parametrization is concerned, we obtain
a significant underestimation of the unit cell volume resulting in a pronounced
overestimation of the phonon energies in the low frequency region. This cannot
be mended by relying on the DFT-calculated unit cell, since with this unit cell
the DFTB phonon frequencies significantly underestimate the experiments.

understood. Observations of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) are
challenging due to their rarity, short formation timescale, large distances,
and high circumstellar extinction. Here, we present the results of a
spectroscopic analysis of a population of MYSOs in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). We took advantage of the spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of
X-shooter (300-2500 nm), mounted on the European Southern Observatory Very
Large Telescope, to detect characteristic spectral features in a dozen MYSO
candidates near 30 Doradus, the largest starburst region in the Local Group
hosting the most massive stars known. The X-shooter spectra are strongly
contaminated by nebular emission. We used a scaling method to subtract the
nebular contamination from our objects. We detect H$\alpha,\beta$, [O I] 630.0
nm, Ca II infrared triplet, [Fe II] 1643.5 nm, fluorescent Fe II 1687.8 nm,
H$_2$ 2121.8 nm, Br$\gamma$, and CO bandhead emission in the spectra of
multiple candidates. This leads to the spectroscopic confirmation of 10
candidates as bona fide MYSOs. We compare our observations with photometric
observations from the literature and find all MYSOs to have a strong
near-infrared excess. We compute lower limits to the brightness and luminosity
of the MYSO candidates, confirming the near-infrared excess and the massive
nature of the objects. No clear correlation is seen between the Br$\gamma$
luminosity and metallicity. Combining our sample with other LMC samples results
in a combined detection rate of disk features such as fluorescent Fe II and CO
bandheads which is consistent with the Galactic rate (40\%). Most of our MYSOs
show outflow features.

of the classical dam-break problem, is obtained in the shallow-water (SW)
approximation for two immiscible fluids with slightly different densities. The
problem is solved by the method of characteristics using analytic expressions
for the Riemann invariants. The obtained solution, which represents an inviscid
approximation to the high-Reynolds-number limit, is in general discontinuous
containing up to three hydraulic jumps which are due to either multivaluedness
or instability of the continuous SW solution. Hydraulic jumps are resolved by
applying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for the SW mass and generalized
momentum conservation equations. The latter contains a free parameter $\alpha$
which defines the relative contribution of each layer to the interfacial
pressure gradient. We consider a solution for $\alpha=0,$ which corresponds to
both layers affecting the interfacial pressure gradient with equal weight
coefficients. This solution is compared with the solutions resulting from the
application of the classical Benjamin's front condition as well as the
circulation conservation condition, which correspond to $\alpha=-1$ and
$\alpha\rightarrow\infty,$ respectively. The SW solution reproduces all
principal features of 2D numerical solution for viscous fluids. The gravity
current speed is found to agree well with experimental and numerical results
when the front acquires the largest stable height which occurs at
$\alpha=\sqrt{5}-2.$ We show that two-layer SW equations for the mass and
generalized momentum conservation can describe interfacial waves containing
hydraulic jumps in a self-contained way without external closure conditions.

different condition numbers, which eventually define the iteration complexity
of first-order methods and the number of oracle calls required to achieve given
accuracy. Motivated by the desire to call more expensive oracle less number of
times, in this paper we consider minimization of a sum of two functions and
propose a generic algorithmic framework to separate oracle complexities for

covers also the setting of strongly convex objectives, the setting when $g$ is

decreases with the increase of jamming power, and becomes null when the jamming
power is higher than 3 dB, while for out-of-band jamming, the impact is maximal
for a specific jamming power, 1.75 dB in our simulation. Considering multiple
positions of attackers, we attained the highest blocking probability 32% for a
specific jamming power 2 dB. We conclude that the impact of jamming depends on
attacker positions as well as the jamming power.

as a shape encoder because of its coefficient interpretability and fast
implementation. FourierNet shows promising results compared to polygon
representation methods, achieving 30.6 mAP on the MS COCO 2017 benchmark. At
lower image resolutions, it runs at 26.6 FPS with 24.3 mAP. It reaches 23.3 mAP
using just eight parameters to represent the mask (note that at least four
parameters are needed for bounding box prediction only). Qualitative analysis
shows that suppressing a reasonable proportion of higher frequencies of Fourier
series, still generates meaningful masks. These results validate our
understanding that lower frequency components hold higher information for the
segmentation task, and therefore, we can achieve a compressed representation.

is seen in a merged and exposure corrected Chandra X-ray image of WR 121a as

121a has been well-explained by a thermal plasma emission model with
temperatures of 0.98+/-0.34 keV and 3.55+/-0.69 keV for the cool and hot
components, respectively and non-solar abundances. The present study indicates
that WR121a is one of the X-ray bright massive binaries with an X-ray
luminosity of ~10^34 erg/s, which can be explained by an active wind collision
between its components. The phase-locked modulations have been seen in the flux
variation of WR 121a where the flux is increased by a factor of ~1.6 from
minimum to maximum in 0.3-10.0 keV energy band. These variations could be
caused by an eclipse of the wind collision region by the secondary star in a
binary orbit. The winds of both components of WR 121a appear to be radiative.
Radiative inhibition as well as radiative braking are the most likely processes

efficiently for open-shell nuclei, a novel many-body method coined as
Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory (BMBPT) was recently formalized and
applied at low orders. Based on the breaking of U(1) symmetry associated with
particle-number conservation, this perturbation theory must operate under the
constraint that the average number of particles is self-consistently adjusted
at each perturbative order. The corresponding formalism is presently detailed
with the goal to characterize the behavior of the associated Taylor series.
BMBPT is, thus, investigated numerically up to high orders at the price of
restricting oneself to a small, i.e. schematic, portion of Fock space. While
low-order results only differ by 2 - 3 % from those obtained via a
configuration interaction (CI) diagonalization, the series is shown to
eventually diverge. The application of a novel resummation method coined as
eigenvector continuation further increase the accuracy when built from
low-order BMBPT corrections and quickly converges towards the CI result when
applied at higher orders. Furthermore, the numerically-costly self-consistent
particle number adjustment procedure is shown to be safely bypassed via the use
of a computationally cheap a posteriori correction method. Eventually, the
present work validates the fact that low order BMBPT calculations based on an a
posteriori (average) particle number correction deliver controlled results and
demonstrates that they can be optimally complemented by the eigenvector
continuation method to provide results with sub-percent accuracy. This approach
is, thus, planned to become a workhorse for realistic ab initio calculations of
open-shell nuclei in the near future.

confinement pressure can be orders of magnitude lower than in a ground based

The refinement with respect to previous fRG-based computation schemes relies on
an accurate treatment of the frequency and momentum dependences of the

our fRG results for the self-energy and momentum-dependent susceptibilities and
the corresponding solution of the parquet approximation to determinant quantum
Monte Carlo data, demonstrating that the fRG is remarkably accurate up to
moderate interaction strengths. The presented methodological improvements
illustrate how fRG flows can be brought to a quantitative level for
two-dimensional problems, providing a solid basis for the application to more

widespread use, there is a need to study adversarial attacks on such detection
methods to better protect the systems that depend upon them. The extensive
research performed on adversarial attacks on image and malware classification
has little relevance to the physical system state prediction domain, which most
of the ICS attack detection systems belong to. Moreover, such detection systems
are typically retrained using new data collected from the monitored system,
thus the threat of adversarial data poisoning is significant, however this
threat has not yet been addressed by the research community. In this paper, we
present the first study focused on poisoning attacks on online-trained
autoencoder-based attack detectors. We propose two algorithms for generating
poison samples, an interpolation-based algorithm and a back-gradient
optimization-based algorithm, which we evaluate on both synthetic and
real-world ICS data. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can generate
poison samples that cause the target attack to go undetected by the autoencoder
detector, however the ability to poison the detector is limited to a small set
of attack types and magnitudes. When the poison-generating algorithms are
applied to the popular SWaT dataset, we show that the autoencoder detector
trained on the physical system state data is resilient to poisoning in the face
of all ten of the relevant attacks in the dataset. This finding suggests that
neural network-based attack detectors used in the cyber-physical domain are
more robust to poisoning than in other problem domains, such as malware

that lead to the formation of redback pulsars. Recently there has been some
debate on the origin of such systems and the formation mechanism of redbacks
may still be considered as an open problem. We show that the operation of a
strong evaporation mechanism, starting from the moment when the donor star
becomes fully convective (or alternatively since the formation of the neutron
star by accretion induced collapse), produces systems with donor masses and
orbital periods in the range corresponding to redbacks with donors appreciably
smaller than their Roche lobes, i.e., they have low filling factors (lower than
$0.75$). Models of redback pulsars can be constructed assuming the occurrence
of irradiation feedback. They have been shown to undergo cyclic mass transfer
during the epoch at which they attain donor masses and orbital periods
corresponding to redbacks, and stay in quasi-Roche lobe overflow conditions
with {\it high} filling factors. We show that, if irradiation feedback occurs
and radio ejection inhibits further accretion onto the neutron star after the
first mass transfer cycle, the redback systems feature {\it high} filling
factors. We suggest that the filling factor should be considered as a useful
tool for discriminating among those redback formation mechanisms. We compare
theoretical results with available observations, and conclude that observations
tend to favour models with high filling factors.

  Differences, and Context-Dependent Grey Areas",,,"10.1016/j.infsof.2019.106253",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Quality requirements (QRs) are a topic of constant discussions both
in industry and academia. Debates entwine around the definition of quality
requirements, the way how to handle them, or their importance for project
success. While many academic endeavors contribute to the body of knowledge
about QRs, practitioners may have different views. In fact, we still lack a
consistent body of knowledge on QRs since much of the discussion around this
topic is still dominated by observations that are strongly context-dependent.
This holds for both academic and practitioners' views. Our assumption is that,
in consequence, those views may differ. Objective: We report on a study to
better understand the extent to which available research statements on quality
requirements, as found in exemplary peer-reviewed and frequently cited
publications, are reflected in the perception of practitioners. Our goal is to
analyze differences, commonalities, and context-dependent grey areas in the
views of academics and practitioners to allow a discussion on potential
misconceptions (on either sides) and opportunities for future research. Method:
We conducted a survey with 109 practitioners to assess whether they agree with
research statements about QRs reflected in the literature. Based on a
statistical model, we evaluate the impact of a set of context factors to the
perception of research statements. Results: Our results show that a majority of
the statements is well respected by practitioners; however, not all of them.
When examining the different groups and backgrounds of respondents, we noticed
interesting deviations of perceptions within different groups that may lead to
new research questions. Conclusions: Our results help identifying prevalent
context-dependent differences about how academics and practitioners view QRs
and pinpointing statements where further research might be useful.

reinforcement learning (RL), with many naive approaches succumbing to
exponential sample complexity. To isolate the challenges of exploration, we
propose a new ""reward-free RL"" framework. In the exploration phase, the agent
first collects trajectories from an MDP $\mathcal{M}$ without a pre-specified
reward function. After exploration, it is tasked with computing near-optimal
policies under for $\mathcal{M}$ for a collection of given reward functions.
This framework is particularly suitable when there are many reward functions of
interest, or when the reward function is shaped by an external agent to elicit
desired behavior.
  We give an efficient algorithm that conducts
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(S^2A\mathrm{poly}(H)/\epsilon^2)$ episodes of exploration
and returns $\epsilon$-suboptimal policies for an arbitrary number of reward
functions. We achieve this by finding exploratory policies that visit each
""significant"" state with probability proportional to its maximum visitation
probability under any possible policy. Moreover, our planning procedure can be
instantiated by any black-box approximate planner, such as value iteration or
natural policy gradient. We also give a nearly-matching
$\Omega(S^2AH^2/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound, demonstrating the near-optimality of
our algorithm in this setting.

the cross-correlation method -- a powerful tool for the unambiguous

magnetic field in a model that describes two 5f bands (of either $\alpha$ or
$\beta$ characters) which hybridize with a single itinerant conduction band.
The 5f-electrons interact through Coulomb and exchange terms. The AF order
parameter is a N\'eel vector, which is assumed to be fixed by an Ising
anisotropy. The applied magnetic field is transverse to the anisotropy axis.
Without field, our results for the temperature - pressure phase diagram show
that, at low temperatures, a first-order phase transition occurs between two
distinct antiferromagnetic phases, AF$_1$ and AF$_2$, as the pressure is
increased. The two phases are characterized by the gaps of bands $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ given by $\Delta_{\alpha}$ and $\Delta_{\beta}$, respectively. The
AF$_1$ phase occurs when $\Delta_{\beta}>\Delta_{\alpha}>0$, while in the
AF$_2$ phase, the gaps satisfy $\Delta_{\alpha}>\Delta_{\beta}>0$. The
application of a magnetic field produces a drastic change in the phase diagram.
The AF1 and AF2 phases separate with the latter acquiring a dome shape which is
eventually suppressed for large values of the applied field. The evolution of
the phase diagram under pressure, without and with magnetic field, shows the
presence of multicritical points. Our results show that the evolution of these
multicritical points by the simultaneous application of pressure and field is
also drastic with the suppression of some multicritical points and the
emergence of others ones. We believe that these results may have relevance for
the growing field of multicritical points (classical and quantum) in the
physics of Uranium compounds.

be more than twice as prevalent in our depressed cohort, in particular
Personalizing and Emotional Reasoning. This effect is specific to the distorted

emerged only recently, and they have been in constant evolution as new features

researchers to maintain a clear view of the technology space. (2) Methods: we
present a descriptive feature comparison study of the three most prominent
orchestration frameworks: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos, which can be
combined with Marathon, Aurora or DC/OS. This study aims at (i) identifying the
common and unique features of all frameworks, (ii) comparing these frameworks
qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to genericity in terms of
supported features, and (iii) investigating the maturity and stability of the
frameworks as well as the pioneering nature of each framework by studying the
historical evolution of the frameworks on GitHub. (3) Results: (i) we have
identified 124 common features and 54 unique features that we divided into a
taxonomy of 9 functional aspects and 27 functional sub-aspects. (ii) Kubernetes
supports the highest number of accumulated common and unique features for all 9
functional aspects; however, no evidence has been found for significant
differences in genericity with Docker Swarm and DC/OS. (iii) Very little
feature deprecations have been found and 15 out of 27 sub-aspects have been
identified as mature and stable. These are pioneered in descending order by
Kubernetes, Mesos, and Marathon. (4) Conclusion: there is a broad and mature
foundation that underpins all container orchestration frameworks. Likely areas
for further evolution and innovation include system support for improved
cluster security and container security, performance isolation of GPU, disk and
network resources, and network plugin architectures.

almost identical correlation lengths and amplitudes, indicating that dwarf

formation of halos along the caustics of particle trajectories and the phase
synchronisation of density perturbations on various scales) transforms the

from space-based photometric missions and the accuracy of the resulting
frequencies motivate a careful consideration of the accuracy of computed

model properties.
  Aims. Based on models of red-giant stars that have been independently
calculated using different stellar evolution codes, we investigate the extent
to which the differences in the model calculation affect the model oscillation
frequencies.
  Methods. For each of the models, which cover four different masses and
different evolution stages on the red-giant branch, we computed full sets of
low-degree oscillation frequencies using a single pulsation code and, from
these frequencies, typical asteroseismic diagnostics. In addition, we carried
out preliminary analyses to relate differences in the oscillation properties to
the corresponding model differences.
  Results. In general, the differences in asteroseismic properties between the
different models greatly exceed the observational precision of these
properties, in particular for the nonradial modes whose mixed acoustic and
gravity-wave character makes them sensitive to the structure of the deep
stellar interior. In some cases, identifying these differences led to
improvements in the final models presented here and in Paper I; here we
illustrate particular examples of this.
  Conclusions. Further improvements in stellar modelling are required in order
fully to utilise the observational accuracy to probe intrinsic limitations in
the modelling. However, our analysis of the frequency differences and their
relation to stellar internal properties provides a striking illustration of the
potential of the mixed modes of red-giant stars for the diagnostics of stellar
interiors.

period of 18 months, ranging from 12th January 2018 to 17th July 2019. Here, we
consider three representations of the BLN: the daily snapshot one, the weekly

properties of the three representations above, we find that the total volume of
transacted bitcoins approximately grows as the square of the network size;
however, despite the huge activity characterising the BLN, the bitcoins
distribution is very unequal: the average Gini coefficient of the node
strengths (computed across the entire history of the Bitcoin Lightning Network)
is, in fact, ~0.88 causing the 10% (50%) of the nodes to hold the 80% (99%) of
the bitcoins at stake in the BLN (on average, across the entire period). This
concentration brings up the question of which minimalist network model allows
us to explain the network topological structure. Like for other economic
systems, we hypothesise that local properties of nodes, like the degree,
ultimately determine part of its characteristics. Therefore, we have tested the
goodness of the Undirected Binary Configuration Model (UBCM) in reproducing the
structural features of the BLN: the UBCM recovers the disassortative and the
hierarchical character of the BLN but underestimates the centrality of nodes;
this suggests that the BLN is becoming an increasingly centralised network,
more and more compatible with a core-periphery structure. Further inspection of
the resilience of the BLN shows that removing hubs leads to the collapse of the
network into many components, an evidence suggesting that this network may be a
target for the so-called split attacks.

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback, which can redistribute mass and energy on large
scales. We constrain the signatures of AGN feedback on the 1D power spectrum of
the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest using a series of eight hydro-cosmological
simulations performed with the Adaptative Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. This
series starts from the Horizon-AGN simulation and varies the sub-grid
parameters for AGN feeding, feedback and stochasticity. These simulations cover
the whole plausible range of feedback and feeding parameters according to the
resulting galaxy properties. AGNs globally suppress the Lyman-$\alpha$ power at
all scales. On large scales, the energy injection and ionization dominate over
the supply of gas mass from AGN-driven galactic winds, thus suppressing power.
On small scales, faster cooling of denser gas mitigates the suppression. This
effect increases with decreasing redshift. We provide lower and upper limits of
this signature at nine redshifts between $z=4.25$ and $z=2.0$, making it
possible to account for it at post-processing stage in future work given that
running simulations without AGN feedback can save considerable amounts of
computing resources. Ignoring AGN feedback in cosmological inference analyses
leads to strong biases with 2\% shift on $\sigma_8$ and 1\% shift on $n_s$,

only by a single set of measurements for each party or a single quantum state,
up to local unitaries, one refers to such a phenomenon as self-testing. For
instance, the maximal quantum violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality certifies that the underlying state contains the two-qubit maximally
entangled state and the measurements of one party contains a pair of
anti-commuting qubit observables. As a consequence, the other party
automatically verifies the set of states remotely steered, namely the
""assemblage"", is in the eigenstates of a pair of anti-commuting observables. It
is natural to ask if the quantum violation of the Bell inequality is not
maximally achieved, or if one does not care about self-testing the state or
measurements, are we capable of estimating how close the underlying assemblage
is to the reference one? In this work, we provide a systematic
device-independent estimation by proposing a framework called ""robust
self-testing of steerable quantum assemblages"". In particular, we consider
assemblages violating several paradigmatic Bell inequalities and obtain the
robust self-testing statement for each scenario. Our result is
device-independent (DI), i.e., no assumption is made on the shared state and
the measurement devices involved. Our work thus not only paves a way for
exploring the connection between the boundary of quantum set of correlations
and steerable assemblages, but also provides a useful tool in the areas of DI
quantum certification. As two explicit applications, we show 1) that it can be
used for an alternative proof of the protocol of DI certification of all
entangled two-qubit states proposed by Bowles et al., and 2) that it can be
used to verify all non-entanglement-breaking qubit channels with fewer
assumptions compared with the work of Rosset et al.

distribution propagation within the hierarchy. Recently, [1] pointed out that
the hierarchical structure of DGP well suited modeling the multi-fidelity
regression, in which one is provided sparse observations with high precision
and plenty of low fidelity observations. We propose the conditional DGP model
in which the latent GPs are directly supported by the fixed lower fidelity
data. Then the moment matching method in [2] is applied to approximate the
marginal prior of conditional DGP with a GP. The obtained effective kernels are
implicit functions of the lower-fidelity data, manifesting the expressivity
contributed by distribution propagation within the hierarchy. The
hyperparameters are learned via optimizing the approximate marginal likelihood.
Experiments with synthetic and high dimensional data show comparable
performance against other multi-fidelity regression methods, variational
inference, and multi-output GP. We conclude that, with the low fidelity data
and the hierarchical DGP structure, the effective kernel encodes the inductive
bias for true function allowing the compositional freedom discussed in [3,4].

and non-smooth. I.e., for two states with similar representations, their
optimal policies can be significantly different. In this case, representing the
entire policy with a function approximator (FA) with shared parameters for all
states maybe not desirable, as the generalization ability of parameters sharing
makes representing discontinuous, non-smooth policies difficult. A common way
to solve this problem, known as Mixture-of-Experts, is to represent the policy
as the weighted sum of multiple components, where different components perform
well on different parts of the state space. Following this idea and inspired by
a recent work called advantage-weighted information maximization, we propose to
learn for each state weights of these components, so that they entail the
information of the state itself and also the preferred action learned so far
for the state. The action preference is characterized via the advantage
function. In this case, the weight of each component would only be large for
certain groups of states whose representations are similar and preferred action
representations are also similar. Therefore each component is easy to be
represented. We call a policy parameterized in this way an Advantage Weighted
Mixture Policy (AWMP) and apply this idea to improve soft-actor-critic (SAC),
one of the most competitive continuous control algorithm. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAC with AWMP clearly outperforms SAC in four commonly used
continuous control tasks and achieve stable performance across different random

well-known issue in computer security for a long time and remain one of the
root causes of exploitable vulnerabilities. Most of the existing mitigation
tools adopt a fail-stop strategy to protect programs from intrusions, which
means the victim program will be terminated upon detecting a memory safety
violation. Unfortunately, the fail-stop strategy harms the availability of
software.
  In this paper, we propose Saturation Memory Access (SMA), a memory spatial
error mitigation mechanism that prevents out-of-bounds access without
terminating a program. SMA is based on a key observation that developers
generally do not rely on out-of-bounds accesses to implement program logic. SMA
modifies dynamic memory allocators and adds paddings to objects to form an
enlarged object boundary. By dynamically correcting all the out-of-bounds
accesses to operate on the enlarged protecting boundaries, SMA can tolerate
out-of-bounds accesses. For the sake of compatibility, we chose tagged pointers
to record the boundary metadata of a memory object in the pointer itself, and
correct the address upon detecting out-of-bounds access.
  We have implemented the prototype of SMA on LLVM 10.0. Our results show that
our compiler enables the programs to execute successfully through buffer
overflow attacks. Experiments on MiBench show that our prototype incurs an
overhead of 78\%. Further optimizations would require ISA supports.

and hence are not known precisely, due to the inherent non-linearity of the

probabilistic approach by inferring the values of the diffusion and loss term

procedure and typically involves a series of sequential solutions of linear
systems with similar, albeit not identical system matrices, derived for
different data models of the same data set. Sequences of this kind arise for
instance in the maximization of the data likelihood with respect to foreground
parameters or sampling of their posterior distribution. However, they are also
common in many other contexts. In this work we consider solving the component
separation problem directly in the measurement (time) domain, which can have a
number of important advantageous over the more standard pixel-based methods, in
particular if non-negligible time-domain noise correlations are present as it
is commonly the case. The time-domain based approach implies, however,
significant computational effort due to the need to manipulate the full volume
of time-domain data set. To address this challenge, we propose and study
efficient solvers adapted to solving time-domain-based, component separation
systems and their sequences and which are capable of capitalizing on
information derived from the previous solutions. This is achieved either via
adapting the initial guess of the subsequent system or through a so-called
subspace recycling, which allows to construct progressively more efficient,

that can improve the approximation error of an estimation method by combining
linearly several estimates obtained from different values of one of its
hyperparameters, without the need to know in details the inner structure of the
original estimation method. The main goal of this paper is to study when
Richardson extrapolation can be used within machine learning, beyond the
existing applications to step-size adaptations in stochastic gradient descent.
We identify two situations where Richardson interpolation can be useful: (1)
when the hyperparameter is the number of iterations of an existing iterative
optimization algorithm, with applications to averaged gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe algorithms (where we obtain asymptotically rates of $O(1/k^2)$ on
polytopes, where $k$ is the number of iterations), and (2) when it is a
regularization parameter, with applications to Nesterov smoothing techniques
for minimizing non-smooth functions (where we obtain asymptotically rates close
to $O(1/k^2)$ for non-smooth functions), and ridge regression. In all these
cases, we show that extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in
performance, but with sometimes strong gains, and we provide theoretical
justifications based on asymptotic developments for such gains, as well as
empirical illustrations on classical problems from machine learning.

rewards, and use it to plan the agent's next actions. However, jointly modeling
future observations can be computationally expensive or even intractable if the
observations are high-dimensional (e.g. images). For this reason, previous
works have considered partial models, which model only part of the observation.
In this paper, we show that partial models can be causally incorrect: they are
confounded by the observations they don't model, and can therefore lead to
incorrect planning. To address this, we introduce a general family of partial
models that are provably causally correct, yet remain fast because they do not
need to fully model future observations.

the outcome in a brief document [1]. A full-day debate with 180 delegates was
held at CERN, followed by a survey collecting quantitative input. During the
debate, the ECRs discussed future colliders in terms of the physics prospects,
their implications for accelerator and detector technology as well as computing
and software. The discussion was organised into several topic areas. From these
areas two common themes were particularly highlighted by the ECRs: sociological
and human aspects; and issues of the environmental impact and sustainability of

degradation was observed due to the transfer process, and a significant
reduction in device temperature (327 {\deg}C to 132 {\deg}C at 600 mW) was
observed when directly bonded to a silicon carbide (SiC) wafer relative to the
starting wafer. With the use of a benzocyclobutene (BCB) adhesion interlayer,
devices were easily transferred and characterized on Kapton and ceramic films,
representing an exciting opportunity for integration onto arbitrary substrates.
Upon reduction of this polymer adhesive layer thickness, the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs
transferred onto a BCB/SiC substrate resulted in comparable peak temperatures
during operation at powers as high as 600 mW to the as-grown wafer, revealing
that by optimizing interlayer characteristics such as thickness and thermal
conductivity, transferrable devices on polymer layers can still improve
performance outputs.

increasing stellar effective temperature (Teff). In this paper, with the final
Kepler Data Release (DR25) catalog, we revisit the relation between stellar
effective temperature (as well as mass) and planet occurrence, but in terms of
the fraction of stars with planets and the number of planets per planetary
system (i.e. planet multiplicity). We find that both the fraction of stars with
planets and planet multiplicity decrease with increasing stellar temperature
and mass. Specifically, about 75% late-type stars (Teff<5000 K) have
Kepler-like planets with an average planet multiplicity of ~2.8; while for
early-type stars (Teff>6500 K), this fraction and the average multiplicity fall
down to ~35% and ~1.8, respectively. The decreasing trend in the fraction of
stars with planets is very significant with ${\Delta}$AIC> 30, though the trend
in planet multiplicity is somewhat tentative with ${\Delta}$AIC~5. Our results
also allow us to derive the dispersion of planetary orbital inclinations in
relationship with stellar effective temperature. Interestingly, it is found to
be similar to the well-known trend between obliquity and stellar temperature,
indicating that the two trends might have a common origin.

  Theory of Relativity","17 pages, LaTex, 3 figures",,,,"gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finslerian extension of the theory of relativity implies that space-time can
be not only in an amorphous state which is described by Riemann geometry but
also in ordered, i.e. crystalline states which are described by Finsler
geometry. Transitions between various metric states of space-time have the
meaning of phase transitions in its geometric structure. These transitions
together with the evolution of each of the possible metric states make up the
general picture of space-time manifold dynamics. It is shown that there are
only two types of curved Finslerian spaces endowed with local relativistic
symmetry. However the metric of only one of them satisfies the correspondence
principle with Riemannian metric of the general theory of relativity and
therefore underlies viable Finslerian extension of the GR. Since the existing
purely geometric approaches to a Finslerian generalization of Einstein's
equations do not allow one to obtain such generalized equations which would
provide a local relativistic symmetry of their solutions, special attention is
paid to the property of the specific invariance of viable Finslerian metric
under local conformal transformations of those fields on which it explicitly
depends. It is this property that makes it possible to use the well-known
methods of conventional field theory and thereby to circumvent the
above-mentioned difficulties arising within the framework of purely geometric
approaches to a Finslerian generalization of Einstein's equations.

Nevertheless, it is not known how accurately curved geometry can describe
actual microscopic models. Here, we demonstrate that the low-energy properties
of the Kitaev honeycomb lattice model, a topological superconductor that
supports localised Majorana zero modes at its vortex excitations, are
faithfully described in terms of Riemann-Cartan geometry. In particular, we
show analytically that the continuum limit of the model is given in terms of
the Majorana version of the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to both curvature and
torsion. We numerically establish the accuracy of the geometric description for
a wide variety of couplings of the microscopic model. Our work opens up the
opportunity to accurately predict dynamical properties of the Kitaev model from
its effective geometric description.

density function belongs to a predetermined convex family $\mathcal{P}$. First,
estimating differential entropy to any accuracy is shown to be infeasible if
the differential entropy of densities in $\mathcal{P}$ is unbounded, clearly
showing the necessity of additional assumptions. Subsequently, we investigate
sufficient conditions that enable confidence bounds for the estimation of

histogram based estimation of differential entropy from a fixed number of

with known Lipschitz constant and known, bounded support. Our focus is on
differential entropy, but we provide examples that show that similar results
hold for mutual information and relative entropy as well.

cell biology. Especially for three-dimensional datasets, manual segmentation is
prohibitively time-consuming, motivating the need for automated methods.
Learning-based methods trained on pixel-wise ground-truth segmentations have
been shown to yield state-of-the-art results on 2d benchmark image data of
nuclei, yet a respective benchmark is missing for 3d image data. In this work,
we perform a comparative evaluation of nuclei segmentation algorithms on a
database of manually segmented 3d light microscopy volumes. We propose a novel
learning strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy by means of a simple
auxiliary task, thereby robustly outperforming each of our baselines.
Furthermore, we show that one of our baselines, the popular three-label model,
when trained with our proposed auxiliary task, outperforms the recent
StarDist-3D. As an additional, practical contribution, we benchmark nuclei
segmentation against nuclei detection, i.e. the task of merely pinpointing
individual nuclei without generating respective pixel-accurate segmentations.
For learning nuclei detection, large 3d training datasets of manually annotated
nuclei center points are available. However, the impact on detection accuracy
caused by training on such sparse ground truth as opposed to dense pixel-wise
ground truth has not yet been quantified. To this end, we compare nuclei
detection accuracy yielded by training on dense vs. sparse ground truth. Our
results suggest that training on sparse ground truth yields competitive nuclei
detection rates.

that the outer disc has 46% of its mass in stars >5 Gyr, 48% in stars between 1

protocol, the relay can work opportunistically in either pure energy harvesting

fluctuation of R's residual energy is difficult to quantify and track. To solve
this problem, we apply a novel discrete-state Markov Chain (MC) method in which
the practical finite-capacity energy storage is considered. Furthermore, to
improve the privacy level of the proposed HOR relaying system, covert
transmission performance analysis is developed and investigated, where
closed-form expressions of optimal detection threshold and minimum detection
error probability are derived. Last but not least, with the aid of stationary
distribution of the MC, closed-form expression of transmission outage
probability is calculated, based on which transmission outage performance is
analyzed. Numerical results have validated the correctness of analyses on
transmission outage and covert communication. The impacts of key system
parameters on the performance of transmission outage and covert communication
are given and discussed. Based on mathematical analysis and numerical results,
it is fair to say that the proposed HOR model is able to not only reliably
enhance the transmission performance via smartly managing residual energy but
also efficiently improve the privacy level of the legitimate transmission party
via dynamically adjust the optimal detection threshold.

Directed hypergraphs can be used to model data flow and execution dependencies
in streaming applications. Thus, hypergraph partitioning algorithms can be used
to obtain efficient parallelizations for multiprocessor architectures. However,
an acyclicity constraint on the partition is necessary when mapping streaming
applications to embedded multiprocessors due to resource restrictions on this

have one head and arbitrary many tails. Based on this, we engineer a memetic
algorithm to further reduce communication cost, as well as to improve
scheduling makespan on embedded multiprocessor architectures. Experiments
indicate that our algorithm outperforms previous algorithms that focus on the
directed acyclic graph case which have previously been employed in the
application domain. Moreover, our experiments indicate that using the directed
hypergraph model for this type of application yields a significantly smaller
makespan.

of three major structural components; thin discs, thick discs, and central
bulges. Dominance of bulges increases with the galaxy mass (Hubble sequence)
whereas thick discs are more prominent in lower mass galaxies. Because galaxies
grow with the accretion of matter, this observed variety should reflect
diversity in accretion history. On the basis of the prediction by the cold-flow
theory for galactic gas accretion and inspired by the results of previous
studies, we put a hypothesis that associates different accretion modes with
different components. Namely, thin discs form as the shock-heated hot gas in
high-mass halos gradually accretes to the central part, thick discs grow by the
direct accretion of cold gas from cosmic webs when the halo mass is low, and
finally bulges form by the inflow of cold gas through the shock-heated gas in
high-redshift massive halos. We show that this simple hypothesis reproduces the
mean observed variation of galaxy morphology with the galaxy mass. This
scenario also predicts that thick discs are older and poorer in metals than
thin discs, in agreement with the currently available observational data.

In this work we apply two different approaches to characterize all types of

procedure and the Smith Decomposition method. The symmetry eigenvalues or
irreps of any electronic band in a given space group can be expressed as the
superposition of the eigenvalues of a relatively small number of building units

obtained following a group-subgroup chain starting from P1. Once the whole set
of basic bands are known in a space group, all other types of bands (trivial,
strong topological or fragile topological) can be easily derived. In
particular, we confirm previous calculations of the fragile root bands in all
the space groups. Furthermore, we define an automorphism group of equivalences
of the electronic bands which allows to define minimum subsets of, for
instance, independent basic or fragile root bands.

much more important than frequent, typical events. An interesting counterpoint
to the prediction of such events is their retrodiction -- given a process in an
outlier state, how did the events leading up to this endpoint unfold? In
particular, was there only a single, massive event, or was the history a
composite of multiple, smaller but still significant events? To investigate
this problem we take heavy-tailed stochastic processes (specifically,the
symmetric, $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes) as prototypical random walks. A
natural and useful characteristic scale arises from the analysis of processes
conditioned to arrive in a particular final state (L\'evy bridges). For final
displacements longer than this scale, the scenario of a single, long jump is
most likely, even though it corresponds to a rare, extreme event. On the other
hand, for small final displacements, histories involving extreme events tend to
be suppressed. To further illustrate the utility of this analysis, we show how
it provides an intuitive framework for understanding three problems related to
boundary crossings of heavy-tailed processes. These examples illustrate how
intuition fails to carry over from diffusive processes, even very close to the
Gaussian limit. One example yields a computationally and conceptually useful
representation of L\'evy bridges that illustrates how conditioning impacts the
extreme-event content of a random walk. The other examples involve the
conditioned boundary-crossing problem and the ordinary first-escape problem; we
discuss the observability of the latter example in experiments with

specific question of creating synthetic populations made of two types of

the creation of dwellings inhabited by households, households owning cars,
dwellings equipped with appliances, worker employed by firms, etc. We propose a
theoretical framework to tackle this problem. We then highlight how this
problem is over-constrained and requires relaxation of some constraints to be
solved. We propose a method to solve the problem analytically which lets the
user select which input data should be preserved and adapts the others in order
to make the data consistent. We illustrate this method by synthesizing a
population made of dwellings containing 0, 1 or 2 households in the city of
Lille (France). In this population, the distributions of the dwellings' and
households' characteristics are preserved, and both are linked according to
statistical pairing statistics.

wind and solar above 80% can be affordable, economists have raised concerns
about market integration. Correlated generation from variable renewable sources
depresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalise their
own revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This
cannibalisation appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and
thus to contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here
we show from theory and with simulation examples how market incentives interact
with prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline
in average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy
assumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with
subsidies or quotas. This decline is mathematically guaranteed regardless of
whether the subsidised technology is variable or not. If instead the driving
policy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without
cannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar
above 80%. The strong dependence of market value on the policy regime means
that market value needs to be used with caution as a measure of market
integration. Declining market value is not necessarily a sign of integration
problems, but rather a result of policy choices.

implementing data management for the CRC 1002 and CRC 1190. A fully equipped
data management software should improve documentation of experiments and
materials, enable data storage and sharing according to the FAIR Guiding
Principles while maximizing usability, information security, as well as
software sustainability and reusability. Results: We introduce the modular web
portal software menoci for data collection, experiment documentation, data
publication, sharing, and preservation in biomedical research projects. Menoci
modules are based on the Drupal content management system which enables
lightweight deployment and setup, and creates the possibility to combine
research data management with a customisable project home page or collaboration
platform. Conclusions: Management of research data and digital research
artefacts is transforming from individual researcher or groups best practices
towards project- or organisation-wide service infrastructures. To enable and
support this structural transformation process, a vital ecosystem of open

complete their goal. Dialog State Tracking (DST), which is often a core
component of these systems, tracks the system's understanding of the user's
goal throughout the conversation. To enable accurate multi-domain DST, the
model needs to encode dependencies between past utterances and slot semantics
and understand the dialog context, including long-range cross-domain
references. We introduce a novel architecture for this task to encode the
conversation history and slot semantics more robustly by using attention
mechanisms at multiple granularities. In particular, we use cross-attention to
model relationships between the context and slots at different semantic levels
and self-attention to resolve cross-domain coreferences. In addition, our
proposed architecture does not rely on knowing the domain ontologies beforehand
and can also be used in a zero-shot setting for new domains or unseen slot
values. Our model improves the joint goal accuracy by 5% (absolute) in the
full-data setting and by up to 2% (absolute) in the zero-shot setting over the
present state-of-the-art on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset.

units that can enforce this constraint over an LSTM encoder and decoder. We
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance across a variety of

Chinese translation. In these cases, our model outperforms the standard LSTM
encoder and decoder architecture on many or all of our metrics. To demonstrate
that our model achieves the desired separation between the lexicon and syntax,

any SSR should belong to either variable-independent (F.1) or -dependent (F.2)
