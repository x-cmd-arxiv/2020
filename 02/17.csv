on the Semantic Web, which has led to new opportunities for advanced analysis,
such as Spatial Online Analytical Processing (SOLAP). The RDF Data Cube (QB)
and QB4OLAP vocabularies have been widely used for annotating and publishing
statistical and multidimensional RDF data. Although such statistical data sets
might have spatial information, such as coordinates, the lack of spatial
semantics and spatial multidimensional concepts in QB4OLAP and QB prevents
users from employing SOLAP queries over spatial data using SPARQL. The QB4SOLAP
vocabulary, on the other hand, fully supports annotating spatial and
multidimensional data on the Semantic Web and enables users to query endpoints
with SOLAP operators in SPARQL. To bridge the gap between QB/QB4OLAP and
QB4SOLAP, we propose an RDF2SOLAP enrichment model that automatically annotates
spatial multidimensional concepts with QB4SOLAP and in doing so enables SOLAP
on existing QB and QB4OLAP data on the Semantic Web. Furthermore, we present
and evaluate a wide range of enrichment algorithms and apply them on a
non-trivial real-world use case involving governmental open data with complex
geometry types.

of research, and shown remarkable achievements on a variety of computer vision
tasks. DNNs, however, are known to often make overconfident yet incorrect
predictions on out-of-distribution samples, which can be a major obstacle to
real-world deployments because the training dataset is always limited compared
to diverse real-world samples. Thus, it is fundamental to provide guarantees of
robustness to the distribution shift between training and test time when we
construct DNN models in practice. Moreover, in many cases, the deep learning
models are deployed as black boxes and the performance has been already
optimized for a training dataset, thus changing the black box itself can lead
to performance degradation. We here study the robustness to the geometric
transformations in a specific condition where the black-box image classifier is
given. We propose an additional learner, \emph{REinforcement Spatial Transform
learner (REST)}, that transforms the warped input data into samples regarded as
in-distribution by the black-box models. Our work aims to improve the
robustness by adding a REST module in front of any black boxes and training
only the REST module without retraining the original black box model in an
end-to-end manner, i.e. we try to convert the real-world data into training
distribution which the performance of the black-box model is best suited for.
We use a confidence score that is obtained from the black-box model to
determine whether the transformed input is drawn from in-distribution. We
empirically show that our method has an advantage in generalization to
geometric transformations and sample efficiency.

metric-based linear interpolation algorithm is demonstrated, which guarantees
that generated stimuli follow a customizable similarity relationship with

generation of a rich range of meaningful and realistic input patterns,
improving virtual test coverage and reducing the need for expensive field

step is to build class representatives to represent classes in datasets by
aggregating prominent features extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network

representatives and new data. The proposed CRL model demonstrated superior
performance compared to the current state-of-the-art research in ZSL and mobile

periphery from orbits with less than 2:1 frequency ratio. The most number of
such orbits is enclosed in a 'farfalle'-shape (Italian pasta) form and turns
out to be non-periodic. We conclude that the X-structure is only the envelope
of regions of high density caused by the crossing or folding of different types
of orbits at their highest points, and does not have a ""backbone"" similar to
that of the in-plane bar. Comparing the orbital structure of two different
numerical models, we show that the dominance of one or another family of orbits
with a certain ratio of the vertical oscillations frequency to the in-plane
frequency depends on the parameters of the underlying galaxy and ultimately
determines the morphology of the X-structure and the opening angle of its rays.

binary segmentation, an approach relying on a deterministic construction of
background intervals, called seeded intervals, in which single change points
are searched. The final selection of change points based on the candidates from
seeded intervals can be done in various ways, adapted to the problem at hand.
Thus, seeded binary segmentation is easy to adapt to a wide range of change
point detection problems, let that be univariate, multivariate or even
high-dimensional.
  We consider the univariate Gaussian change in mean setup in detail. For this
specific case we show that seeded binary segmentation leads to a near-linear
time approach (i.e. linear up to a logarithmic factor) independent of the
underlying number of change points. Furthermore, using appropriate selection
methods, the methodology is shown to be asymptotically minimax optimal. While
computationally more efficient, the finite sample estimation performance
remains competitive compared to state of the art procedures. Moreover, we
illustrate the methodology for high-dimensional settings with an inverse
covariance change point detection problem where our proposal leads to massive
computational gains while still exhibiting good statistical performance.

improving the quality and intelligibility of separated speech from mixed audio.
Most previous methods focused on generating a single-channel output for each of
the target speakers, hence discarding the spatial cues needed for the
localization of sound sources in space. However, preserving the spatial
information is important in many applications that aim to accurately render the
acoustic scene such as in hearing aids and augmented reality (AR). Here, we
propose a speech separation algorithm that preserves the interaural cues of
separated sound sources and can be implemented with low latency and high
fidelity, therefore enabling a real-time modification of the acoustic scene.
Based on the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a single-channel
time-domain speech separation system that can be implemented in real-time, we
propose a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) end-to-end extension of TasNet that
takes binaural mixed audio as input and simultaneously separates target
speakers in both channels. Experimental results show that the proposed
end-to-end MIMO system is able to significantly improve the separation
performance and keep the perceived location of the modified sources intact in
various acoustic scenes.

as some authors found that heterogeneity sustains cooperation, while others

on the individual perception of risks and rewards related to a generic event,
that can show up in a number of social and biological systems. The modelling
approach is based on the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory. To represent
this kind of heterogeneity, we implement small and local perturbations on the
payoff matrix of simple 2-strategy games, as the Prisoner's Dilemma. So, while
usually the payoff is considered as a global and time-invariant structure, i.e.
it is the same for all individuals of a population at any time, in our model
its value is continuously affected by small variations, both in time and space
(i.e. position on a lattice). We found that such perturbations can be
beneficial or detrimental to cooperation, depending on their setting. Notably,
cooperation is strongly supported when perturbations act on the main diagonal
of the payoff matrix, whereas when they act on the off-diagonal the resulting
effect is more difficult to quantify. To conclude, the proposed model shows a
rich spectrum of possible equilibria, whose interpretation might offer insights
and enrich the description of several systems.

contribute to this problem, we performed the first statistical study of
relationships between flare hard X-ray (HXR; $50-100$ keV) sources observed by
the \textit{Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager} (RHESSI) and
photospheric vertical electric currents (PVECs, $j_{r}$) calculated using
vector magnetograms obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
on-board the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO). A sample of 48 flares,
from C3.0 to X3.1 class, observed in central part of the solar disk by both
instruments in 2010--2015 was analyzed. We found that $\approx 70$\% of all HXR
sources overlapped with islands or ribbons of enhanced ($\left| j_{r} \right|
\gtrsim 10^{4}$ statampere~cm$^{-2}$) PVECs. However, less than $\approx 40$\%
of the HXR sources overlapped with PVEC maxima, with an accuracy of $\pm
3^{\prime\prime}$. More than in half of the flares there were HXR sources
outside regions of enhanced PVECs. We found no correlation between intensity of
the HXR sources and PVEC density or total PVEC under them. No systematic
dissipation of PVECs under the HXR sources was found during the flares.
Collectively, the results do not support the current-interruption flare models.
However, the results indicate the importance of the presence of longitudinal
currents in flare regions. Understanding of their specific role in the
processes of energy release, plasma heating, and acceleration of particles
requires further investigation.

the power network by aiding existing frequency control mechanisms. TCLs are,
however, characterized by an intrinsic limit cycle behavior which raises the
risk that these could synchronize when coupled with the frequency dynamics of
the power grid, i.e. simultaneously switch, inducing persistent and possibly
catastrophic power oscillations. To address this problem, schemes with a
randomized response time in their control policy have been proposed in the
literature. However, such schemes introduce delays in the response of TCLs to
frequency feedback that may limit their ability to provide fast support at
urgencies. In this paper, we present a deterministic control mechanism for TCLs
such that those switch when prescribed frequency thresholds are exceeded in
order to provide ancillary services to the power network. For the considered
scheme, we provide analytic conditions which ensure that synchronization is
avoided. In particular, we show that as the number of loads tends to infinity,
there exist arbitrarily long time intervals where the frequency deviations are
arbitrarily small. Our analytical results are verified with simulations on the
Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 140-bus system, which demonstrate
that the proposed scheme offers improved frequency response compared to
conventional implementations.

predicts the class of an unlabeled query point as the label of its closest
point in the set. To improve the time and space complexity of classification, a
natural question is how to reduce the training set without significantly
affecting the accuracy of the nearest-neighbor rule. Nearest-neighbor
condensation deals with finding a subset $R \subseteq P$ such that for every
point $p \in P$, $p$'s nearest-neighbor in $R$ has the same label as $p$. This
relates to the concept of coresets, which can be broadly defined as subsets of
the set, such that an exact result on the coreset corresponds to an approximate
result on the original set. However, the guarantees of a coreset hold for any
query point, and not only for the points of the training set.
  This paper introduces the concept of coresets for nearest-neighbor
classification. We extend existing criteria used for condensation, and prove
sufficient conditions to correctly classify any query point when using these
subsets. Additionally, we prove that finding such subsets of minimum
cardinality is NP-hard, and propose quadratic-time approximation algorithms
with provable upper-bounds on the size of their selected subsets. Moreover, we
show how to improve one of these algorithms to have subquadratic runtime, being
the first of this kind for condensation.

different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across
layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the

Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word
models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word
representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is
required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and

constructed for sharp null hypotheses, i.e. hypotheses which fully impute the
missing potential outcomes. Oftentimes inference is instead desired for the
weak null that the sample average of the treatment effects takes on a
particular value while leaving the subject-specific treatment effects
unspecified. Without proper care, tests valid for sharp null hypotheses may be
anti-conservative should only the weak null hold, creating the risk of
misinterpretation when randomization tests are deployed in practice. We develop
a general framework for unifying modes of inference for sharp and weak nulls,
wherein a single procedure simultaneously delivers exact inference for sharp
nulls and asymptotically valid inference for weak nulls. To do this, we employ
randomization tests based upon prepivoted test statistics, wherein a test
statistic is first transformed by a suitably constructed cumulative
distribution function and its randomization distribution assuming the sharp
null is then enumerated. For a large class of commonly employed test
statistics, we show that prepivoting may be accomplished by employing the
push-forward of a sample-based Gaussian measure based upon a suitably
constructed covariance estimator. In essence, the approach enumerates the
randomization distribution (assuming the sharp null) of a P-value for a
large-sample test known to be valid under the weak null, and uses the resulting
randomization distribution to perform inference. The versatility of the method
is demonstrated through a host of examples, including rerandomized designs and
regression-adjusted estimators in completely randomized designs.

Several apparent problems affect it however at galactic scales, such as the
small scale problems at low redshift and more recent issues involving early
massive galaxy and black hole formation. As these problems arise where complex
baryonic physics becomes important, the associated unknowns are often assumed
to be behind the problems. But the same scales are also those where the
primordial spectrum is relatively unconstrained, and there are several ways in
which it can be modified. We focus on that arising from effects possibly
associated with the crossing of high energy cutoff scale by fluctuation modes
during inflation. Elementary arguments show that adiabatic evolution cannot
modify the near scale invariance, we thus discuss a simple model for the
contrary extreme of sudden transition. Numerical calculations and simple
arguments suggest that its predictions, for parameters considered here, are
more generic than may be expected, with significant modifications requiring a
rapid transition. We examine the implications of such a scenario, in this
simplest form of sudden jump, on the matter power spectrum and halo mass
function in light of the limitations imposed by particle production. We show
that enhancement and oscillation in the power spectrum on currently nonlinear
scales can potentially simultaneously alleviate both the apparent problem of
early structure formation and, somewhat counterintuitively, problems at low
redshift such as the apparent dearth of dwarf galaxies. We discuss consequences
that can observationally constrain the scenario and its parameters, including
an inflationary Hubble scale $\lesssim 10^{-8} M_{\rm Pl}$, while touching on
the possibility of simultaneous modification of power on the largest scales.

input dimension $d$, and with an unnatural activation function. Our work proves
convergence to low robust training loss for \emph{polynomial} width instead of
exponential, under natural assumptions and with the ReLU activation. Key
element of our proof is showing that ReLU networks near initialization can
approximate the step function, which may be of independent interest.

  sequence-reproducing task with cognitive priming",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leveraging the perceptual phenomenon of crossmoal correspondence has been
shown to facilitate peoples information processing and improves sensorimotor
performance. However for goal-oriented interactive tasks, the question of how
to enhance the perception of specific Crossmodal information, and how
Crossmodal information integration takes place during interaction is still
unclear. The present paper reports two experiments investigating these
questions. In the first experiment, a cognitive priming technique was
introduced as a way to enhance the perception of two Crossmodal stimuli, in two
conditions respectively, and their effect on sensory-motor performance was
observed. Based on the results, the second experiment combined the two
Crossmodal stimuli in the same interfaces in a way that their correspondence
congruency was mutually exclusive. The same priming techniques was applied as a
manipulating factor to observe the Crossmodal integration process. Results
showed that first, the Crossmodal integration during interaction can be
enhanced by the priming technique, but the effect varies according to the
combination of Crossmodal stimuli and the types of priming material. Moreover,
peoples subjective evaluations towards priming types were in contradiction with
their objective behavioural data. Second, when two Crossmodal sequences can be
perceived simultaneously, results suggested different perceptual weights are
possessed by different participants, and the perceptual enhancement effect was
observed only on the dominant one, the pitch-elevation. Furthermore, the
Crossmodal integration tended to be integrated in a selective manner without
priming. These results contribute design implications for multisensory feedback
and mindless computing.

retraining.
  We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing
together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual
novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative
stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past

prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the
convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal

play an important role in the projection-valued truth value assignment of
observational propositions in quantum mechanics. Takeuti's quantum set theory
extends this assignment to all the set-theoretical statements on the universe
of quantum sets. However, Takeuti's quantum set theory has a problem in that De
Morgan's Laws do not hold between universal and existential bounded
quantifiers. Here, we solve this problem by introducing a new truth value
assignment for bounded quantifiers that satisfies De Morgan's Laws. To justify
the new assignment, we prove the Transfer Principle, showing that this
assignment of a truth value to every bounded ZFC theorem has a lower bound
determined by the commutator, a projection-valued degree of commutativity, of
constants in the formula. We study the most general class of truth value
assignments and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for them to satisfy
the Transfer Principle, to satisfy De Morgan's Laws, and to satisfy both. For
the class of assignments with polynomially definable logical operations, we
determine exactly 36 assignments that satisfy the Transfer Principle and
exactly 6 assignments that satisfy both the Transfer Principle and De Morgan's

problem concerns finding a partition of the data points into $k$ clusters such
that the within-cluster variation is minimized. Despite its importance and wide
applicability, a theoretical understanding of the $k$-means problem has not
been completely satisfactory. Existing algorithms with theoretical performance
guarantees often rely on sophisticated (sometimes artificial) algorithmic
techniques and restricted assumptions on the data. The main challenge lies in
the non-convex nature of the problem; in particular, there exist additional
local solutions other than the global optimum. Moreover, the simplest and most
popular algorithm for $k$-means, namely Lloyd's algorithm, generally converges
to such spurious local solutions both in theory and in practice.
  In this paper, we approach the $k$-means problem from a new perspective, by
investigating the structures of these spurious local solutions under a
probabilistic generative model with $k$ ground truth clusters. As soon as
$k=3$, spurious local minima provably exist, even for well-separated and
balanced clusters. One such local minimum puts two centers at one true cluster,
and the third center in the middle of the other two true clusters. For general
$k$, one local minimum puts multiple centers at a true cluster, and one center
in the middle of multiple true clusters. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that
this is essentially the only type of spurious local minima under a separation
condition. Our results pertain to the $k$-means formulation for mixtures of
Gaussians or bounded distributions. Our theoretical results corroborate
existing empirical observations and provide justification for several improved
algorithms for $k$-means clustering.

in bimetric spacetime: their incompressible superfluid cores (SuSu-cores) are
embedded in flat spacetime, whereas the ambient compressible and dissipative
media are enclosed in Schwarzschild spacetime. In this letter we apply this
model to the Crab and Vela pulsars and show that a newly born pulsar initially
of $1.25\text{M}_{\odot}$ and an embryonic SuSu-core of $0.029\text{M}_{\odot}$
could evolve into a \ARZL{Crab-like}\ARZR pulsar after 1000 years and into a
\ARZL{Vela-like}\ARZR pulsar 10000 years later to finally fade away as an
invisible dark energy object after roughly 10 Myr. Based thereon we infer that
the Crab and the Vela pulsars should have SuSu-cores of $0.15\text{M}_{\odot}$

overshootings phenomena observed to accompany the glitch events of the Vela
pulsar are rather a common phenomenon of glitching pulsars that can be
well-explained within the framework of bimetric spacetime.

mechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and
non-truthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction
format $A$ satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item
auctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be
paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the
prior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of
realized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism
using a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many
common non-truthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and
extends the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16] beyond truthful auctions.
  Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as
simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay
auctions. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue
guarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments,
addressing an open question in the literature [RST17]. If all-pay auctions are
used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that
the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after
observing agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for
multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal
revenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful
$O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning
via online learning techniques.

Here we propose a generalized and combined approach to sample target densities:
Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) -- an arbitrary sequence of deterministic
invertible functions and stochastic sampling blocks. We show that stochasticity
overcomes expressivity limitations of normalizing flows resulting from the
invertibility constraint, whereas trainable transformations between sampling
steps improve efficiency of pure MCMC/LD along the flow. By invoking ideas from
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics we derive an efficient training procedure
by which both the sampler's and the flow's parameters can be optimized
end-to-end, and by which we can compute exact importance weights without having
to marginalize out the randomness of the stochastic blocks. We illustrate the
representational power, sampling efficiency and asymptotic correctness of SNFs

rate their safety at several locations, with the goal of predicting safety and
learning important patterns. These approaches are meant to help articulate
differences in experiences, fostering a discussion that will help communities
identify issues and policymakers develop safer communities. A generalized
linear mixed model incorporating spatial information taken from existing maps
of Kibera showed significant predictors of perceived lack of safety included
being alone and time of day; in debrief interviews, participants described
feeling unsafe in spaces with hiding places, disease carrying animals, and
dangerous individuals. This pilot study demonstrates promise for detecting
spatial patterns of violence, which appear to be confirmed by actual rates of
measured violence at schools. Several factors relevant to community building
consistently predict perceived safety and emerge in participants' qualitative
descriptions, telling a cohesive story about perceived safety and empowering
communication to community stakeholders.

drastically reduced when the raw voltage data are digitally filtered through an
arbitrarily large number $n$ of orthornormal bandpass profiles (eigen-filters)
sharing the same intensity bandwidth, and the resulting intensity series are
co-added. Specifically, the relative noise variance of the summed series at the
resolution of one coherence time or less, goes down with increasing $n$ as
$1/n$, although (consistent with the radiometer equation) the advantage
gradually disappears when the series is bin averaged to lower resolution. Thus
the algorithm is designed to enhance the sensitivity of detecting transients
that are smoothed out by time averaging and too faint to be visible in the
noisy unaveraged time series, as demonstrated by the simulation of a weak
embedded time varying signal of either a periodic nature or a fast and
unrepeated pulse. The algorithm is then applied to a 10 minute observation of
the pulsar PSR 1937+21 by the VLA, where the theoretical predictions were
verified by the data. Moreover, it is shown that microstructures within the
time profile are better defined as the number $n$ of filters used increases,
and a periodic signal of period $1.86 \times 10^{-5}$~s ($53.9$~kHz) is
discovered in the pulse profile. Lastly, we apply the algorithm to the first
binary black hole merger detected by LIGO, GW150914. We find the SNR of the
mean peak intensity increases as $\sqrt{n}$ and cross correlation of the event
between the LIGO-Hanford-Livingston detector pair increases with filter order
$n$.

indistinguishable under adaptive chosen plaintext attack. Quantitative analysis
reveals that lightweight AMOUN shows lower average computational cost than both
RSA and Multi-RSA, for both encryption and decryption, even when the key sizes
are four times larger. For a given prime size, in case of encryption, AMOUN
shows 98% and 99% lower average computational cost than RSA and Multi-RSA,

  In this paper, we propose BatchEnsemble, an ensemble method whose

BatchEnsemble achieves this by defining each weight matrix to be the Hadamard
product of a shared weight among all ensemble members and a rank-one matrix per
member. Unlike ensembles, BatchEnsemble is not only parallelizable across
devices, where one device trains one member, but also parallelizable within a
device, where multiple ensemble members are updated simultaneously for a given

out-of-distribution tasks, BatchEnsemble yields competitive accuracy and
uncertainties as typical ensembles; the speedup at test time is 3X and memory
reduction is 3X at an ensemble of size 4. We also apply BatchEnsemble to
lifelong learning, where on Split-CIFAR-100, BatchEnsemble yields comparable
performance to progressive neural networks while having a much lower

scale up to lifelong learning on Split-ImageNet which involves 100 sequential

light curves with temporal breaks suggests on the basis of the standard
forward-shock synchrotron radiation model that the X-ray radiation is narrowly
collimated with an opening angle $\theta_{n,j}<\sim6^{\circ}$ whereas the radio
radiation originated from wider jets ($\sim27^{\circ}$). The temporal and
spectral evolutions of the radio afterglow agree with those expected from a
synchrotron radiation modelling with typical physical parameters except for the
fact that the observed wide jet opening angle for the radio emission is
significantly larger than the theoretical maximum opening angle. By contrast,
the opening angle of the X-ray afterglow is consistent with the typical value
of GRB jets. Since the theory of the relativistic cocoon afterglow emission is
similar to that of a regular afterglow with an opening angle of
$\sim30^{\circ}$, the observed radio emission can be interpreted as the shocked
jet cocoon emission. This result therefore indicates that the two components of

repositioning under NYC congestion pricing. In the first case study, the model
is validated by the agreement between the derived optimal control from BO and
that from an analytical solution. With a simple piecewise linear service

corresponding to the flux quantum. In contrast, loops with broadened
transitions at around 3 K are void of such junctions and show standard

improve traffic control algorithms to handle future air travel demand and
improve airspace capacity. We address the conflict resolution problem in air
traffic control using a novel approach for aircraft collision avoidance with
trajectory recovery. We present a two-stage algorithm that first solves all
initial conflicts by adjusting aircraft headings and speeds, before identifying
the optimal time for aircraft to recover towards their target destination. The
collision avoidance stage extends an existing mixed-integer programming
formulation to heading control. For the trajectory recovery stage, we introduce
a novel exact mixed-integer programming formulation as well as a greedy
heuristic algorithm. The proposed two-stage approach guarantees that all
trajectories during both the collision avoidance and recovery stages are
conflict-free. Numerical results on benchmark problems show that the proposed
heuristic for trajectory recovery is competitive while also emphasizing the
difficulty of this optimization problem. The proposed approach can be used as a
decision-support tool for introducing automation in air traffic control.

fine-tuning deep convolutional neural networks online using the given mask of
the first frame or predicted masks of subsequent frames. However, the online
fine-tuning process is usually time-consuming, limiting the practical use of
such methods. We propose a directional deep embedding and appearance learning
(DDEAL) method, which is free of the online fine-tuning process, for fast VOS.
First, a global directional matching module, which can be efficiently
implemented by parallel convolutional operations, is proposed to learn a
semantic pixel-wise embedding as an internal guidance. Second, an effective
directional appearance model based statistics is proposed to represent the
target and background on a spherical embedding space for VOS. Equipped with the
global directional matching module and the directional appearance model
learning module, DDEAL learns static cues from the labeled first frame and
dynamically updates cues of the subsequent frames for object segmentation. Our
method exhibits state-of-the-art VOS performance without using online
fine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves a J & F mean score of 74.8% on DAVIS
2017 dataset and an overall score G of 71.3% on the large-scale YouTube-VOS
dataset, while retaining a speed of 25 fps with a single NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU.
Furthermore, our faster version runs 31 fps with only a little accuracy loss.

or system execution is monitored and analyzed, to check whether certain
properties are satisfied or violated after a finite number of steps. The use of
RV has led to interest in deciding whether a property is monitorable: whether
it is always possible for the satisfaction or violation of the property to be
determined after a finite future continuation. However, classical two-valued
monitorability suffers from two inherent limitations. First, a property can
only be evaluated as monitorable or non-monitorable; no information is
available regarding whether only one verdict (satisfaction or violation) can be
detected. Second, monitorability is defined at the language-level and does not
tell us whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from the
current monitor state during system execution.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new notion of four-valued
monitorability for $\omega$-languages and applies it at the state-level.
Four-valued monitorability is more informative than two-valued monitorability
as a property can be evaluated as a four-valued result, denoting that only
satisfaction, only violation, or both are active for a monitorable property. We
can also compute state-level weak monitorability, i.e., whether satisfaction or
violation can be detected starting from a given state in a monitor, which
enables state-level optimizations of monitoring algorithms. Based on a new
six-valued semantics, we propose procedures for computing four-valued
monitorability of $\omega$-regular languages, both at the language-level and at
the state-level. We have developed a new tool that implements the proposed
procedure for computing monitorability of LTL formulas.

model factors, such as climate, culture, and socioeconomic opportunities,
aggregate migration rates obey a universal, parameter-free, `radiation' model.
Recent work has further shown that the detailed spectral decomposition of these
flows -- defined as the number of individuals that visit a given location with
frequency $f$ from a distance $r$ away -- also obeys simple rules, namely,
scaling as a universal inverse square law in the combination, $rf$. However,
this surprising regularity, derived on general grounds, has not been explained
through microscopic mechanisms of individual behavior. Here we confirm this by
analyzing large-scale cell phone datasets from three distinct regions and show
that a direct consequence of this scaling law is that the average `travel
energy' spent by visitors to a given location is constant across space, a
finding reminiscent of the well-known travel budget hypothesis of human
movement. The attractivity of different locations, which we define by the total
number of visits to that location, also admits non-trivial, spatially-clustered
structure. The observed pattern is consistent with the well-known central place
theory in urban geography, as well as with the notion of Weber optimality in
spatial economy, hinting to a collective human capacity of optimizing recurrent
movements. We close by proposing a simple, microscopic human mobility model
which simultaneously captures all our empirical findings. Our results have
relevance for transportation, urban planning, geography, and other disciplines
in which a deeper understanding of aggregate human mobility is key.

their interactions with the circumstellar and interstellar media, and the
evolution in morphology of the ejecta. We have obtained narrow-band images of a
sample of five nova shells, namely DQHer, FHSer, TAur, V476Cyg, and V533Her,
with ages in the range from 50 to 130 years. These images have been compared
with suitable available archival images to derive their angular expansion
rates. We find that all the nova shells in our sample are still in the free
expansion phase, which can be expected, as the mass of the ejecta is 7-45 times
larger than the mass of the swept-up circumstellar medium. The nova shells will
keep expanding freely for time periods up to a few hundred years, reducing
their time dispersal into the interstellar medium.

distributionally robust two-stage stochastic linear programs over 1-Wasserstein
balls. We start from the case with distribution uncertainty only in the
objective function and exactly reformulate it as an SOCP problem. Then, we
study the case with distribution uncertainty only in constraints, and show that
such a robust program is generally NP-hard as it involves a norm maximization
problem over a polyhedron. However, it is reduced to an SOCP problem if the
extreme points of the polyhedron are given as a prior. This motivates to design
a constraint generation algorithm with provable convergence to approximately
solve the NP-hard problem. In sharp contrast to the exiting literature, the
distribution achieving the worst-case cost is given as an ""empirical""
distribution by simply perturbing each sample for both cases. Finally,
experiments illustrate the advantages of the proposed model in terms of the
out-of-sample performance and the computational complexity.

Technique (VGT), which is an advanced tool for magnetic field studies, reveal
that the gradients of spectroscopic observables change their directions by 90
degrees with respect to the magnetic fields in the regions of gravitational
collapse. In this study, we perform 3D MHD numerical simulations. We observe
that star formation successfully proceeds in strongly magnetized and fully

gradients' orientation and high gradients' amplitude. We explore two ways of
identifying collapsing self-gravitating regions through the double-peak feature

show that velocity gradients' morphology and amplitude can be synthetically

new tool for studying the gas dynamics and tracing magnetic field in

demonstrate the synergy of VGT and IGT can determine the collapsing stages in a

both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node
classification but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of

However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN
has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and
GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how
the feature/label of one node is spread over its neighbors; And, (2)
feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node
influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical
analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node
classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA
serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that
lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as
learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented
than existing feature-based attention models. In a number of experiments on
real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art GCN-based
methods in terms of node classification accuracy.

these two datasets so that the TTS can learn to respect the labels produced by
the style extraction model during inference. To solve these, we adopted a
semi-supervised approach that uses the style extraction model to create style

  in Thermal images","5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object detection in thermal images is an important computer vision task and
has many applications such as unmanned vehicles, robotics, surveillance and
night vision. Deep learning based detectors have achieved major progress, which
usually need large amount of labelled training data. However, labelled data for
object detection in thermal images is scarce and expensive to collect. How to
take advantage of the large number labelled visible images and adapt them into
thermal image domain, is expected to solve. This paper proposes an unsupervised
image-generation enhanced adaptation method for object detection in thermal
images. To reduce the gap between visible domain and thermal domain, the
proposed method manages to generate simulated fake thermal images that are
similar to the target images, and preserves the annotation information of the
visible source domain. The image generation includes a CycleGAN based
image-to-image translation and an intensity inversion transformation. Generated
fake thermal images are used as renewed source domain. And then the
off-the-shelf Domain Adaptive Faster RCNN is utilized to reduce the gap between
generated intermediate domain and the thermal target domain. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the
architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is
challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing

generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates

for statistical voice conversion (VC) with direct waveform modification based

achieves high-quality conversion but requires heavy computation in filtering.
This is because the minimum phase using a fixed lifter of the Hilbert transform
often results in a long-tap filter. One of our methods is a data-driven method
for lifter training. Since this method takes filter truncation into account in
training, it can shorten the tap length of the filter while preserving
conversion accuracy. Our other method is sub-band processing for extending the
conventional method from narrow-band (16 kHz) to full-band (48 kHz) VC, which
can convert a full-band waveform with higher converted-speech quality.
Experimental results indicate that 1) the proposed lifter-training method for
narrow-band VC can shorten the tap length to 1/16 without degrading the
converted-speech quality and 2) the proposed sub-band-processing method for
full-band VC can improve the converted-speech quality than the conventional
method.

combining lenses to obtain better optical performance and new functionalities.
The arrival of nanotechnology has brought to this effort engineered surfaces
called metalenses, which promise to make imaging devices more compact. However,
unaddressed by this promise is the space between the lenses, which is crucial
for image formation but takes up by far the most room in imaging systems. Here,
we address this issue by presenting the concept of and experimentally
demonstrating an optical 'spaceplate', an optic that effectively propagates
light for a distance that can be considerably longer than the plate thickness.
Such an optic would shrink future imaging systems, opening the possibility for
ultra-thin monolithic cameras. More broadly, a spaceplate can be applied to
miniaturize important devices that implicitly manipulate the spatial profile of
light, for example, solar concentrators, collimators for light sources,
integrated optical components, and spectrometers.

a class of dynamical spacetime solutions of the Einstein field equations of
gravity and the dynamics of its corresponding dual fluid flows governed by the
Navier-Stokes (NS) equations of hydrodynamics. This striking connection has
been explored in several dynamics-based approaches and has surfaced in various
forms over the past four decades. In a recent construction, it has been shown
that the manifold properties of geometric duals are in fact intimately
connected to the dynamics of incompressible fluids, thus bypassing the
conventional on-shell standpoints. Following such a prescription, we construct
the geometrical description that effectively captures the dynamics of an
incompressible NS fluid with respect to a uniformly rotating frame. We propose
the gravitational dual(s) described by bulk metric(s) in $(p+2)$-dimensions
such that the equations of parallel transport of an appropriately defined bulk
velocity vector field when projected onto an induced timelike hypersurface
require that the incompressible NS equation of a fluid relative to a uniformly
rotating frame be satisfied at the relevant perturbative order in
$(p+1)$-dimensions. We argue that free fluid flows on manifold(s) described by
the proposed metric(s) can be effectively considered as an equivalent theory of
non-relativistic viscous fluid dynamics with respect to (w.r.t) a uniform
rotating frame. We also present suggestive insights as to how space-time
rotation parameters encode information pertaining to the inertial effects in
the corresponding fluid dual.

of this concatenation are called polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
codes. In this scheme, a pair of polar mapper and demapper as pre- and
postprocessing devices are deployed around a memoryless channel, which provides
polarized information to an outer decoder leading to improved error correction
performance of the outer code. In this paper, the list decoding and sequential
decoding (including Fano decoding and stack decoding) are first adapted for use
to decode PAC codes. Then, to reduce the complexity of sequential decoding of
PAC/polar codes, we propose (i) an adaptive heuristic metric, (ii) tree search
constraints for backtracking to avoid exploration of unlikely sub-paths, and
(iii) tree search strategies consistent with the pattern of error occurrence in
polar codes. These contribute to the reduction of the average decoding time
complexity from 50% to 80%, trading with 0.05 to 0.3 dB degradation in error
correction performance within FER=10^-3 range, respectively, relative to not
applying the corresponding search strategies. Additionally, as an important
ingredient in Fano decoding of PAC/polar codes, an efficient computation method
for the intermediate LLRs and partial sums is provided. This method is
effective in backtracking and avoids storing the intermediate information or
restarting the decoding process. Eventually, all three decoding algorithms are
compared in terms of performance, complexity, and resource requirements.

the optimal control process without sacrificing cost. We also show that, akin
to communication systems, every LQR has a $Capacity~Region$ associated with it,
that dictates and quantifies how much cost is achievable at a given level of

tasks, is very essential for computer vision. Tremendous computing and storage
resources can be preserved with a trivial amount of visual information.
Conventional image compression methods tend to obtain compressed images by
minimizing their appearance discrepancy with the corresponding original images,
but pay little attention to their efficacy in downstream perception tasks,
e.g., image recognition and object detection. Thus, some of compressed images
could be recognized with bias. In contrast, this paper aims to produce
compressed images by pursuing both appearance and perceptual consistency. Based
on the encoder-decoder framework, we propose using a pre-trained CNN to extract
features of the original and compressed images, and making them similar. Thus
the compressed images are discernible to subsequent tasks, and we name our
method as Discernible Image Compression (DIC). In addition, the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) is employed to minimize the difference between feature
distributions. The resulting compression network can generate images with high
image quality and preserve the consistent perception in the feature domain, so
that these images can be well recognized by pre-trained machine learning
models. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that images compressed by using
the proposed method can also be well recognized by subsequent visual
recognition and detection models. For instance, the mAP value of compressed
images by DIC is about 0.6% higher than that of using compressed images by
conventional methods.

function, and the straggling rate. In addition, we compute the friction
coefficient which constitutes a key quantity for the adequate Langevin dynamics
simulation of ions. Considering typical experimental WDM parameters with
partially degenerate electrons, we find that the friction coefficient is of the
order of $\gamma/\omega_{pi}=0.01$, where $\omega_{pi}$ is the ionic plasma
frequency. This analysis is performed by comparing QMC based data to results
from the random phase approximation (RPA), the Mermin dielectric function, and
the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\""olander (STLS) approximation. It is revealed that the
widely used relaxation time approximation (Mermin dielectric function) has
severe limitations regarding the description of the energy loss properties of
correlated partially degenerate electrons. Moreover, by comparing QMC based
data with the results obtained using STLS, we find that energy loss properties
are not sensitive to the inaccuracy of the static LFC at large wave numbers
$k/k_{F}>2$ (with $k_F$ being the usual Fermi wave number), but that a correct
description of the static LFC at $k/k_{F}\lesssim 1.5$ is important.

weights in $[1,W]$, we construct vertex sensitive distance oracles (VSDO),
which are data structures that preprocess the graph, and answer the following
kind of queries: Given a source vertex $u$, a target vertex $v$, and a batch of
$d$ failed vertices $D$, output (an approximation of) the distance between $u$
and $v$ in $G-D$ (that is, the graph $G$ with vertices in $D$ removed). An
oracle has stretch $\alpha$ if it always holds that
$\delta_{G-D}(u,v)\le\tilde{\delta}(u,v)\le\alpha\cdot\delta_{G-D}(u,v)$, where
$\delta_{G-D}(u,v)$ is the actual distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G-D$, and
$\tilde{\delta}(u,v)$ is the distance reported by the oracle.
  In this paper we construct efficient VSDOs for any number $d$ of failures.
For any constant $c\geq 1$, we propose two oracles:
  $\bullet$ The first oracle has size $n^{2+1/c}(\log n/\epsilon)^{O(d)}\cdot
\log W$, answers a query in ${\rm poly}(\log n,d^c,\log\log W,\epsilon^{-1})$
time, and has stretch $1+\epsilon$, for any constant $\epsilon>0$.

answers a query in ${\rm poly}(\log n,d^c,\log\log W)$ time, and has stretch
${\rm poly}(\log n,d)$.
  Both of these oracles can be preprocessed in time polynomial in their space
complexity. These results are the first approximate distance oracles of
poly-logarithmic query time for any constant number of vertex failures in
general undirected graphs. Previously there are $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
$d$-edge sensitive distance oracles [Chechik et al. 2017] answering distance
queries when $d$ edges fail, which have size $O(n^2(\log n/\epsilon)^d\cdot

task remains challenging due to many issues. One major issue is related to the
confounding factors from the background instrumental music that is mixed with
the vocals in music production. A singer identification model may learn to
extract non-vocal related features from the instrumental part of the songs, if
a singer only sings in certain musical contexts (e.g., genres). The model
cannot therefore generalize well when the singer sings in unseen contexts. In
this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we employ
open-unmix, an open source tool with state-of-the-art performance in source
separation, to separate the vocal and instrumental tracks of music. We then
investigate two means to train a singer identification model: by learning from
the separated vocal only, or from an augmented set of data where we
""shuffle-and-remix"" the separated vocal tracks and instrumental tracks of
different songs to artificially make the singers sing in different contexts. We
also incorporate melodic features learned from the vocal melody contour for
better performance. Evaluation results on a benchmark dataset called the
artist20 shows that this data augmentation method greatly improves the accuracy
of singer identification.

adjustment sets are, however, not unique. Recent research has introduced a
graphical criterion for an 'optimal' valid adjustment set (O-set). For a given
graph, adjustment by the O-set yields the smallest asymptotic variance compared
to other adjustment sets in certain parametric and non-parametric models. In

set of the outcome node(s) in a suitable latent projection graph, which we call
the forbidden projection. An important property is that the forbidden
projection preserves all information relevant to total causal effect estimation
via covariate adjustment, making it a useful methodological tool in its own
right. Second, we extend the existing IDA algorithm to use the O-set, and argue
that the algorithm remains semi-local. This is implemented in the R-package

  using Aerial Images and Trajectories","7 pages, AAAI 2020 accepted paper",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic map extraction is of great importance to urban computing and
location-based services. Aerial image and GPS trajectory data refer to two
different data sources that could be leveraged to generate the map, although
they carry different types of information. Most previous works on data fusion
between aerial images and data from auxiliary sensors do not fully utilize the
information of both modalities and hence suffer from the issue of information
loss. We propose a deep convolutional neural network called DeepDualMapper
which fuses the aerial image and trajectory data in a more seamless manner to
extract the digital map. We design a gated fusion module to explicitly control
the information flows from both modalities in a complementary-aware manner.
Moreover, we propose a novel densely supervised refinement decoder to generate
the prediction in a coarse-to-fine way. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that DeepDualMapper can fuse the information of images and
trajectories much more effectively than existing approaches, and is able to
generate maps with higher accuracy.

viewed at relatively large angles towards the observer. This emission can be
produced in the kpc scale jets whose Lorentz factors are decelerated from
values of the order of several at the parsec scale distances. We consider in
detail the model in which TeV gamma-ray emission is produced by the
relativistic electrons in the kpc scale jet which comptonize strongly beamed
radiation from the inner (parsec scale) jet. As an example, we study morphology
of the TeV gamma-ray emission from the decelerated kpc scale jet in the nearby
radio galaxy Cen~A. It is shown that TeV gamma-ray emission can extend
throughout the kpc scale distances, being relatively smoothly distributed along
the jet for some parameters of the considered model. Investigation of the
morphological structure of such specific gamma-ray emission by the future
Cherenkov Telescope Array (e.g. CTA) should provide important constraints on
the content and dynamics of the kpc scale jet in Cen~A.

the polarization froze. Almost all ortho-H2 molecules were converted to para-H2

Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of
abstract reasoning. The subject is asked to identify the correct choice from
the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM (e.g., a

studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have

ignore necessary inductive biases of RPM solver, such as order sensitivity
within each row/column and incremental rule induction. To address this problem,
in this paper we propose a Stratified Rule-Aware Network (SRAN) to generate the
rule embeddings for two input sequences. Our SRAN learns multiple granularity
rule embeddings at different levels, and incrementally integrates the
stratified embedding flows through a gated fusion module. With the help of

summarized. Secondly, based on the principle of this alignment method, the

model, the unknown parameters of the apparent velocity model are estimated by

estimated parameters. Based on the reconstructed observation vectors, the

can represent the viscous and incompressible fluidic motions at the

interfaces can be described by the surface Navier-Stokes equations defined on
2-manifolds or two-dimensional manifolds, where the elementary tangential
calculus is implemented in terms of exterior differential operators expressed
in a Cartesian system. Based on the topology optimization model for fluidic
flows with porous medium filling the design domain, an artificial Darcy
friction is added to the area force term of the surface Navier-Stokes equations
and the physical area forces are penalized to eliminate their existence in the
fluidic regions and to avoid the invalidity of the porous medium model.
Topology optimization for steady and unsteady surface flows can be implemented
by iteratively evolving the impermeability of the porous medium on the
2-manifolds, where the impermeability is interpolated by the material density
derived from a design variable. The related partial differential equations are
solved by using the surface finite element method. Numerical examples have been
provided to demonstrate this topology optimization approach for surface flows,

upload received transactions to governors after verifying and labeling them;
and governors validate a part of received labeled transactions, pack valid ones
into a block, and append a new block on the ledger. Collectors in the
hierarchical model play a crucial role in the design: they have connections
with both providers and governors, and are responsible for collecting,
verifying, and uploading transactions. However, collectors are rational and
some of them may behave maliciously (not necessarily for their own benefits).
In this paper, we introduce a reputation protocol as a measure of the
reliability of collectors in the permissioned blockchain environment. Its
objective is to encourage collectors to behave truthfully and, in addition, to
reduce the verification cost. The verification cost on provider $p$ is defined
as the total number of invalid transactions provided by $p$ and checked by
governors. Through theoretical analysis, our protocol with the reputation
mechanism has a significant improvement in efficiency. Specifically, the
verification loss that governors suffer is proved to be asymptotically
$O(\sqrt{T_{total}})$ ($T_{total}$, representing the number of transactions
verified by governors and provided by $p$), as long as there exists at least
one collector who behaves well. At last, two typical cases where our model can
be well applied are also demonstrated.

Inference Attacks (MIA), which infer the membership of a given data point in

the key factors for the success of MIA have not yet been fully understood,
existing defense mechanisms such as using L2 regularization
\cite{10shokri2017membership} and dropout layers \cite{salem2018ml} take only
the model's overfitting property into consideration. In this paper, we provide
an empirical analysis of the impact of both the data and ML model properties on
the vulnerability of ML techniques to MIA. Our results reveal the relationship
between MIA accuracy and properties of the dataset and training model in use.
In particular, we show that the size of shadow dataset, the class and feature
balance and the entropy of the target dataset, the configurations and fairness
of the training model are the most influential factors. Based on those
experimental findings, we conclude that along with model overfitting, multiple
properties jointly contribute to MIA success instead of any single property.
Building on our experimental findings, we propose using those data and model
properties as regularizers to protect ML models against MIA. Our results show
that the proposed defense mechanisms can reduce the MIA accuracy by up to 25\%
without sacrificing the ML model prediction utility.

H$_2$ directly measured from the CS emission and the Herschel dust emission
indicates that the CS molecule is depleted by a factor of $\sim$3 toward the

L1197 which is classified as relatively the least evolved core in our targets

span of functionality that differs significantly from the bulk behavior. Among
such interfaces, domain walls in ferroelectrics draw special attention because
they can be moved deterministically with external voltage, while they remain at
place after voltage removal, paving the way to novel neuromorphic and low-power
data-processing technologies. Ferroic domains arise to release strain, which
depends on material thickness, following Kittel scaling law. Hence, a major
hurdle is to reduce the device footprint for a given thickness, i.e., to form
and move high-density domain walls. Here, we used transmission electron
microscopy to produce domain walls with periodicity as high as 2 nm without the
use of contact electrodes, while observing their formation and dynamics in situ
in $BaTiO_3$. Large-area coverage of the engineered domain walls was
demonstrated. The domain-wall density was found to increase with increasing
effective stress, until arriving to a saturation value that reflects 150-fold
effective stress enhancement. Exceeding this value resulted in strain release
by domain-wall rotation. In addition to revealing this multiscale
strain-releasing mechanism, we offer a device design that allows controllable
switching of domain-walls with 2-nm periodicity, reflecting a potential
$144-Tb/inch^2$ neuromorphic network.

examined fields span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements,
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and

  On the positive side, we provide tools for handling markets beyond

motivated for understanding strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions of
nature. We briefly review emergence of new formulas for running fermion masses
valid in direct breaking of GUTs. High scale mixing unification of quark and
neutrino mixings and existence of theorems on vanishing theoretical
uncertainties in GUT predictions are discussed. D-Parity properties of SO(10)
representations leading to large number of intermediate breaking models are
pointed out. Unification predictions of SUSY SO(10) in the light of neutrino
mass, lepton flavor violation, baryogenesis via leptogenesis within gravitino
constraint, and proton decay are noted. We further discuss realisation of
flavour unification and possibility of fitting all fermion masses through
R-Parity and D-Parity conserving left-right symmetric intermediate breaking in
SUSY SO(10)$\times S_4$. In the absence of SUSY two interesting possibilities
of minimal grand desert modifications with only one intermediate mass scalar in
each case and their applications to dark matter decay through type-I seesaw are
briefly noted. Heavy scalar triplet decay leptogenesis through new ansatz for
type-II seesaw dominance in non-SUSY SO(10), emergence of new CP asymmetry
formulas and model capabilities to explain WIMP dark matter, vacuum stability
of the scalar potential and experimentally observed limit on proton lifetime
are briefly summarized.

Clauset et al.(2009) to estimate the power-law exponent in data coming from a
distribution function with regularly-varying tail. In the complex systems
community, PLFit has emerged as the method of choice to estimate the power-law
exponent. Yet, its mathematical properties are still poorly understood.
  The difficulty in PLFit is that it is a minimum-distance estimator. It first
chooses a threshold that minimizes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the
data points larger than the threshold and the Pareto tail, and then applies the
Hill estimator to this restricted data. Since the number of order statistics
used is random, the general theory of consistency of power-law exponents from
extreme value theory does not apply. Our proof consists in first showing that
the Hill estimator is consistent for general intermediate sequences for the
number of order statistics used, even when that number is random. Here, we call
a sequence intermediate when it grows to infinity, while remaining much smaller
than the sample size. The second, and most involved, step is to prove that the
optimizer in PLFit is with high probability an intermediate sequence, unless
the distribution has a Pareto tail above a certain value. For the latter
special case, we give a separate proof.

individual 22 GHz water maser cloudlets, characterized by sizes that are within
a few au, with respect to the radio thermal emission from young stellar objects
(YSO). For this purpose, we have been carrying out the Protostellar Outflows at
the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey of a sample (38) of high-mass YSOs. The
water maser positions and three-dimensional (3D) velocities were determined
through Very Long Baseline Array observations with accuracies of a few
milliarcsec (mas) and a few km/s, respectively. The position of the ionized
core of the protostellar wind, marking the YSO, was determined through
sensitive continuum Jansky Very Large Array observations with a typical error
of 20 mas. The statistic of the separation of the water masers from the radio
continuum shows that 84% of the masers are found within 1000 au from the YSO
and 45% of them are within 200 au. Therefore, we can conclude that the 22 GHz
water masers are a reliable proxy for the YSO position. The distribution of
maser luminosity is strongly peaked towards low values, indicating that about
half of the maser population is still undetected with the current Very Long
Baseline Interferometry detection thresholds of 50-100 mJy/beam.
Next-generation, sensitive radio interferometers will exploit these weak masers
for an improved sampling of the velocity and magnetic fields around the YSOs.
The average direction of the water maser proper motions provides a
statistically-significant estimate for the orientation of the jet emitted by
the YSO: 55% of the maser proper motions are directed on the sky within an
angle of 30 deg from the jet axis. Finally, we show that our measurements of 3D
maser velocities statistically support models in which water maser emission
arises from planar shocks with propagation direction close to the plane of the
sky.

In theory, they provide flexible priors over function classes that can encode a
wide range of interesting assumptions. In practice, however, efficient
inference by optimisation or marginalisation is difficult, a problem further
exacerbated with big data and high dimensional input spaces. We propose a novel
variational autoencoder (VAE) called the prior encoding variational autoencoder
($\pi$VAE). The $\pi$VAE is finitely exchangeable and Kolmogorov consistent,
and thus is a continuous stochastic process. We use $\pi$VAE to learn low
dimensional embeddings of function classes. We show that our framework can
accurately learn expressive function classes such as Gaussian processes, but
also properties of functions to enable statistical inference (such as the
integral of a log Gaussian process). For popular tasks, such as spatial
interpolation, $\pi$VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency. Perhaps most usefully, we demonstrate
that the low dimensional independently distributed latent space representation
learnt provides an elegant and scalable means of performing Bayesian inference
for stochastic processes within probabilistic programming languages such as

successful deployment of self-driving vehicles. This controller-design problem
is especially challenging for a general 2-trailer with a car-like tractor due
to the vehicle's structurally unstable joint-angle kinematics in backward
motion and the car-like tractor's curvature limitations which can cause the
vehicle segments to fold and enter a jackknife state. Furthermore, advanced
sensors with a limited field of view have been proposed to solve the
joint-angle estimation problem online, which introduce additional restrictions
on which vehicle states that can be reliably estimated. To incorporate these
restrictions at the level of control, a model predictive path-following
controller is proposed. By taking the vehicle's physical and sensing
limitations into account, it is shown in real-world experiments that the
performance of the proposed path-following controller in terms of suppressing
disturbances and recovering from non-trivial initial states is significantly
improved compared to a previously proposed solution where the constraints have
been neglected.

  * the membership oracle, which, for each $i\in [n]$, can answer whether $i\in

  * the uniform superposition $|\psi_x\rangle = \sum_{i\in x}

different ways how the algorithm can access this state:
  ** the algorithm can have copies of the state $|\psi_x\rangle$;
  ** the algorithm can execute the reflecting oracle which reflects about the
state $|\psi_x\rangle$;
  ** the algorithm can execute the state-generating oracle (or its inverse)
which performs the transformation $|0\rangle\mapsto |\psi_x\rangle$.
  Without the second type of resources (related to $|\psi_x\rangle$), the
problem is well-understood, see Brassard et al. The study of the problem with
the second type of resources was recently initiated by Aaronson et al.
  We completely resolve the problem for all values of $1/k \le \epsilon\le 1$,
giving tight trade-offs between all types of resources available to the
algorithm. Thus, we close the main open problems from Aaronson et al.
  The lower bounds are proven using variants of the adversary bound by Belovs

were included in our Tully-Fisher analysis while the distorted ones were used
to study the role of cluster-specific interactions with respect to star
formation and AGN activity. We report a higher fraction of galaxies with
irregular gas kinematics in the cluster environment than in the field. Cluster
galaxies with regular rotation display a moderate brightening in the B-band
Tully-Fisher relation compatible with the gradual evolution of the stellar
populations with lookback time, and no significant evolution in the
stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation, in line with previous studies at similar
redshift. Average specific star formation rate (sSFR) values are slightly lower

star-forming galaxies, confirming the role of the environment in the early
quenching of star formation in clusters. Finally, we carried out an exploratory

physical parameters shows an anti-ferromagnetic behavior with a
Neel-temperature of about TN=12 K. This value is found to be in good agreement
with the literature. Moreover, the effect of varying the crystal field, the

The input data to the CNN model consists of multistation 3C broadband and

sequence for M $\ge$ 3.0. We find that the CNN is capable of predicting
accurately the IMs at stations far from the epicenter and that have not yet
recorded the maximum ground shaking when using a 10 s window starting at the
earthquake origin time. The CNN IM predictions do not require previous
knowledge of the earthquake source (location and magnitude). Comparison between
the CNN model predictions and the predictions obtained with Bindi et al. (2011)
GMPE (which require location and magnitude) has shown that the CNN model
features similar error variance but smaller bias. Although the technique is not
strictly designed for earthquake early warning, we found that it can provide
useful estimates of ground motions within 15-20 sec after earthquake origin
time depending on various setup elements (e.g., times for data transmission,
computation, latencies). The technique has been tested on raw data without any
initial data pre-selection in order to closely replicate real-time data

was found to be stable predicting accurately the ground shaking intensity

in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) which satisfies the appropriate Ward identities
and has the right trace anomaly. The tensor is defined by regularizing the
theory on a lattice, and by fixing its renormalization constants
non-perturbatively by suitable Ward identities associated to the Poincare'
invariance of the continuum theory. The latter are derived in thermal QCD with
a non-zero imaginary chemical potential formulated in a moving reference frame.
A renormalization group analysis leads to simple
renormalization-group-invariant definitions of the gluonic and fermionic
contributions to either the singlet or the non-singlet components of the
tensor, and therefore of their form factors among physical states. The lattice
discussion focuses on the Wilson discretization of quark fields but the
strategy is general. Specific to that case, we also carry out the analysis for
the on-shell O(a)-improvement of the energy-momentum tensor. The
renormalization and improvement programs profit from the fact that, as shown
here, the thermal theory enjoys de-facto automatic O(a)-improvement at finite
temperature. The validity of the proposal is scrutinized analytically by a
study to 1-loop order in lattice perturbation theory with shifted and twisted
(for quarks only) boundary conditions. The latter provides also additional
useful insight for a precise non-perturbative calculation of the
renormalization constants. The strategy proposed here is accessible to Monte
Carlo computations, and in this sense it provides a practical way to define
non-perturbatively the energy-momentum tensor in QCD.

well as eclipse timing variation curves. Also, for the first time, we included
in the simultaneous fits multiple star spectral energy distribution data and
theoretical PARSEC stellar isochrones, taking into account Gaia DR2 parallaxes

binaries and a lower mass tertiary star. In the TIC 167692429 system the inner
binary is moderately inclined ($i_{mut}=27^o$) with respect to the outer orbit,
and the binary vs. outer (triple) orbital periods are 10.3 vs. 331 days,
respectively. The mutually inclined orbits cause a driven precession of the
binary orbital plane which leads to the disappearance of binary eclipses for
long intervals. In the case of TIC 220397947 the two orbital planes are more
nearly aligned and the inner vs. outer orbital periods are 3.5 and 77 days,
respectively. In the absence of radial velocity observations, we were unable to
calculate highly accurate masses and ages for the two systems. According to
stellar isochrones TIC 167692429 might be either a pre-main sequence or an
older post-MS system. In the case of TIC 220397947 our solution prefers a
young, pre-MS scenario.

are two fundamental load balancing policies. Under both policies the dispatcher
does not maintain any information on the queue length or load of the servers.
In this paper we analyze the performance of these policies when the dispatcher
has some memory available to store the ids of some of the idle servers. We
consider methods where the dispatcher discovers idle servers as well as methods
where idle servers inform the dispatcher about their state.
  We focus on large-scale systems and our analysis uses the cavity method. The
main insight provided is that the performance measures obtained via the cavity
method for a load balancing policy {\it with} memory reduce to the performance
measures for the same policy {\it without} memory provided that the arrival
rate is properly scaled. Thus, we can study the performance of load balancers
with memory in the same manner as load balancers without memory. In particular
this entails closed form solutions for joining the shortest or least loaded
queue among $d$ randomly selected queues with memory in case of exponential job
sizes. Moreover, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the (scaled)
expected waiting time as the system tends towards instability.

flow-focusing configuration implemented in polymer or glass chips. The planar
geometry, however, suffers from many limitations and drawbacks, such as the
need of specific coatings or the use of dedicated surfactants, depending on the
fluids in play. On the contrary, and thanks to their axisymmetric geometry,
glass capillary-based droplet generators are a priori not fluid-dependent.
Nevertheless, they have never reached the market because their assembly
requires art-dependent and not scalable fabrication techniques. Here we present
a new device, called Raydrop, based on the alignment of two capillaries
immersed in a pressurized chamber containing the continuous phase. The
dispersed phase exits one of the capillaries through a 3D-printed nozzle,
placed in front of the extraction capillary for collecting the droplets. This
non-embedded implementation of an axisymmetric flow-focusing is referred to
{\it co-flow-focusing}. Experimental results demonstrate the universality of
the device in terms of the variety of fluids that can be emulsified, as well as
the range of droplet radii that can be obtained, without neither the need of
surfactant nor coating. Additionally, numerical computations of the
Navier-Stokes equations based on the quasi-steadiness assumption are shown to
correctly predict the droplet radius in the dripping regime and the
dripping-jetting transition when varying the geometrical and fluid parameters.
The monodispersity ensured by the dripping regime, the robustness of the
fabrication technique, the optimization capabilities from the numerical
modeling and the universality of the configuration confer to the Raydrop
technology a very high potential in the race towards high-throughput droplet
generation processes.

are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets.
Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness

velocities and explosion energies. To this end, we perform cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation to follow mixing of the dispersed r-process
elements driven by star formation and the associated stellar feedback in
progenitors of UFDs. We show that the observed europium abundance in Reticulum
II is reproduced by our inner explosion model where a NSM is triggered at the
centre of the galaxy, whereas the relatively low abundance in Tucana III is
reproduced if a NSM occurs near the virial radius of the progenitor galaxy. The
latter case is realised only if the neutron-star binary has a large natal kick
velocity and travels over a long distance of a kilo-parsec before merger. In
both the inner and outer explosion cases, it is necessary for the progenitor
galaxy to sustain prolonged star formation over a few hundred million years
after the NSM, so that the dispersed r-process elements are well mixed within
the inter-stellar medium. Short-duration star formation results in inefficient
mixing, and then a large variation is imprinted in the stellar europium
abundances, which is inconsistent with the observations of Reticulum II and
Tucana III.

equation models arise as critical points of an underlying (energy) functional.
If such solutions are saddle points, rather than being maxima or minima, then
the theoretical framework is non-standard, and the development of suitable
numerical approximation procedures turns out to be highly challenging. In this
paper, our aim is to present an iterative discretization methodology for the
numerical solution of nonlinear variational problems with multiple (saddle

which typically fail in such situations, the key idea of the current work is to
employ a simultaneous interplay of a previously developed local minimax
approach and adaptive Galerkin discretizations. We thereby derive an adaptive
local minimax Galerkin (LMMG) method, which combines the search for saddle
point solutions and their approximation in finite-dimensional spaces in a
highly effective way. Under certain assumptions, we will prove that the
generated sequence of approximate solutions converges to the solution set of
the variational problem. This general framework will be applied to the specific
context of finite element discretizations of (singularly perturbed) semilinear

Young SNRs are characterized by strong shocks that heat and ionize the gas,
generate magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, and accelerate particles to
relativistic energies. They radiate at all wavelengths, especially in the X-ray
domain, where spectro-imaging observations can provide a wealth of information.
This paper presents recent progress in the modelling of SNRs, particularly by
the means of numerical simulations, and with a focus on three-dimensional
aspects. In the first part we will consider SNRs as producers of cosmic rays
(CRs). If SNRs are accelerators efficient enough to power the Galactic
component of CRs, this must have a visible impact on their dynamics, and
therefore on the thermal emission from the plasma, as well as on their
non-thermal emission. In the second part we will consider SNRs as probes of the
explosion mechanism. The time has come to connect multi-dimensional simulations
of SNe and simulations of SNRs, opening the possibility to study the explosion
mechanism via the dynamics and morphology of SNRs.

This model is then fine-tuned and tested on an independent dataset of another
hospital of 18 patients, each having 7 to 10 daily CT scans. For the prostate,
seminal vesicles, bladder and rectum, the model fine-tuned on each specific

and resource allocation technique is proposed for increasing the QoE of
vehicular devices. The proposed approach exploits the queuing dynamics and
channel states of vehicular devices, to maximize the QoE while ensuring
seamless video playback at the end users with high probability. The network
wide QoE maximization problem is decoupled into two subparts. First, a network
slicing based clustering algorithm is applied to partition the vehicles into
multiple logical networks. Secondly, vehicle scheduling and quality selection
is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem which is solved using the
Lyapunov drift plus penalty method. Numerical results show that the proposed
algorithm ensures high video quality experience compared to the baseline.
Simulation results also show that the proposed technique achieves low latency

transfer statistics is Poissonian, while it becomes correlated by the dynamic

scanning tunneling microscopy, this leads to new types of one dimensional
nanostructures that are not only tunable in size and shape but can be fully
reversible erased and reformed without changes in final sizes and shapes. This
unique behavior is caused by the free surface energy renormalization caused by
the large step entropy of vicinal surfaces. In thermodynamic equilibrium, this
favors the formation of a planar 2D surface at higher temperatures, where-as
the nanostructured surface is the preferred low-temperature configuration.
Taking the step entropy into account, the critical phase transition temperature
is derived by free energy calculations and is shown to scale nearly linearly
with the Ge coverage, in excellent agreement with the experiments. Due to
self-limitation, the nanowire size is solely controlled by the Ge coverage and
vicinal angle, completely independent of the growth or an-nealing conditions.
Thus, highly reproducible nanostructures with tunable geometries are obtained.
This opens new avenues for controlled nanostructure formation for practical
de-vice applications.

the semiconductor detectors are seeing a collective inelastic process,
consistent with exciting a plasmon. We further show that plasmon excitation
could arise in two compelling dark matter scenarios, both of which can explain
rates of existing signal excesses in germanium and, at least at the order of

one of these scenarios also yields the correct relic density from thermal

attacks on MIDs; (3) mapping the discovered attacks into a known attack

the medical domain with the assistance of a panel of senior healthcare

recently attracted a vigorous scientific interest owing to their peculiar
thermodynamic behavior, which is highly reminiscent of a temperature-driven
phase transition. The pseudotransitions of one-dimensional lattice-statistical
spin models differ from actual phase transitions in several important aspects:
the first-order derivatives of the Gibbs free energy such as entropy or
magnetization exhibit near a pseudo-transition an abrupt continuous change
instead of a true discontinuity, whereas the second-order derivatives of the
Gibbs free energy such as specific heat or susceptibility display near a
pseudo-transition a vigorous finite peak instead of an actual power-law
divergence. In the present chapter we will comprehensively examine a
pseudo-critical behavior of the spin-1/2 Ising diamond and tetrahedral chains
by a detailed examination of basic magnetothermodynamic quantities such as the
entropy, specific heat and susceptibility. It will be demonstrated that density
plots of these magnetothermodynamic quantities provide a useful tool for
establishing a finite-temperature diagram, which clearly delimits boundaries
between individual quasi-phases in spite of a lack of true spontaneous
long-range order at any nonzero temperature. It is suggested that a substantial
difference between the degeneracies of two ground states of the spin-1/2 Ising
diamond and tetrahedral chains is an essential prerequisite for observation of
a relevant pseudo-critical behavior in a close vicinity of their ground-state

commonly used approach to improve sample efficiency, but gradient estimators
using past trajectories typically have high variance. Existing sampling
strategies for experience replay like uniform sampling or prioritised
experience replay do not explicitly try to control the variance of the gradient
estimates. In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm, adaptive
experience selection (AES), to adaptively learn an experience sampling
distribution that explicitly minimises this variance. Using a regret
minimisation approach, AES iteratively updates the experience sampling
distribution to match the performance of a competitor distribution assumed to
have optimal variance. Sample non-stationarity is addressed by proposing a
dynamic (i.e. time changing) competitor distribution for which a closed-form
solution is proposed. We demonstrate that AES is a low-regret algorithm with
reasonable sample complexity. Empirically, AES has been implemented for deep
deterministic policy gradient and soft actor critic algorithms, and tested on 8
continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym library. Ours results show that
AES leads to significantly improved performance compared to currently available
experience sampling strategies for policy gradient.

factorizations of matrices that are too large to fit in RAM, and must instead
be stored on slow external memory devices such as solid-state or spinning disk
hard drives (out-of-core or out-of-memory). Traditional algorithms for
computing rank revealing factorizations, such as the column pivoted QR
factorization, or techniques for computing a full singular value decomposition
of a matrix, are very communication intensive. They are naturally expressed as
a sequence of matrix-vector operations, which become prohibitively expensive
when data is not available in main memory. Randomization allows these methods
to be reformulated so that large contiguous blocks of the matrix can be
processed in bulk. The paper describes two distinct methods. The first is a
blocked version of column pivoted Householder QR, organized as a ""left-looking""
method to minimize the number of write operations (which are more expensive
than read operations on a spinning disk drive). The second method results in a
so called UTV factorization which expresses a matrix $A$ as $A = U T V^*$ where
$U$ and $V$ are unitary, and $T$ is triangular. This method is organized as an
algorithm-by-blocks, in which floating point operations overlap read and write
operations. The second method incorporates power iterations, and is
exceptionally good at revealing the numerical rank; it can often be used as a
substitute for a full singular value decomposition. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the new algorithms are almost as fast when processing data
stored on a hard drive as traditional algorithms are for data stored in main
memory. To be precise, the computational time for fully factorizing an $n\times
n$ matrix scales as $cn^{3}$, with a scaling constant $c$ that is only
marginally larger when the matrix is stored out of core.

The database uniquely defines a pure Horn function $h$, representing the

determines the value for attribute $v$, then $A\rightarrow v$ is an implicate
of $h$. If $K$ is a key of the database, then $K\rightarrow v$ is an implicate

  Keys of small sizes play a crucial role in various problems. We present
structural and complexity results on the set of minimal keys of pure Horn
functions. We characterize Sperner hypergraphs for which there is a unique pure
Horn function with the given hypergraph as the set of minimal keys.
Furthermore, we show that recognizing such hypergraphs is co-NP-complete
already when every hyperedge has size two. On the positive side, we identify
several classes of graphs for which the recognition problem can be decided in
polynomial time.

target sets, our approach can be used to generate all minimal target sets with
polynomial delay when the thresholds are bounded by a constant. As a byproduct,
our proof shows that the Minimum Key problem is at least as hard as the Minimum
Target Set Selection problem with bounded thresholds.

the termination shock, if it is a hydrodynamical shock. For MHD shocks the
stagnation point does not, in general, lie on the inflow line, which is the
line parallel to the inflow vector and passing through the star. Thus an
estimate via the Bernoulli equation as in the HD case is, in general, not
possible. We also show that in O-star astrospheres, distinct regions exist in
which the fast, slow, Alfv\'enic, and sonic Mach numbers become lower than one,
implying sub-slow magnetosonic as well as sub-fast and sub-sonic flows.

and interpretability of deep neural networks, we here introduce a novel
theoretical framework based on the compositional structure of piecewise linear
activation functions. By defining a direct acyclic graph representing the
composition of activation patterns through the network layers, it is possible
to characterize the instances of the input data with respect to both the
predicted label and the specific (linear) transformation used to perform
predictions. Preliminary tests on the MNIST dataset show that our method can
group input instances with regard to their similarity in the internal
representation of the neural network, providing an intuitive measure of input
complexity.

selection from set of random, alternative options, when evaluation is costly.
This includes, for example, the problem of hiring a skilled worker, where only
one hire can be made, but the evaluation of each candidate is an expensive
procedure. Weitzman showed that the Pandora's Box Problem admits an elegant,
simple solution, where the options are considered in decreasing order of
reservation value,i.e., the value that reduces to zero the expected marginal
gain for opening the box. We study for the first time this problem when order -
or precedence - constraints are imposed between the boxes. We show that,
despite the difficulty of defining reservation values for the boxes which take
into account both in-depth and in-breath exploration of the various options,
greedy optimal strategies exist and can be efficiently computed for tree-like
order constraints. We also prove that finding approximately optimal adaptive
search strategies is NP-hard when certain matroid constraints are used to
further restrict the set of boxes which may be opened, or when the order
constraints are given as reachability constraints on a DAG. We complement the
above result by giving approximate adaptive search strategies based on a
connection between optimal adaptive strategies and non-adaptive strategies with
bounded adaptivity gap for a carefully relaxed version of the problem.

networks: \emph{Is it possible to enable spectrally-efficient spectrum sharing
for heterogeneous wireless networks with different, possibly incompatible,
spectrum access technologies on the same spectrum bands; without modifying the
protocol stacks of existing wireless networks?} To answer this question, this
article explores the system challenges that need to be addressed to enable a
new spectrum sharing paradigm based on beamforming, which we refer to as {\em
CoBeam}. In CoBeam, a secondary wireless network is allowed to access a
spectrum band based on {\em cognitive beamforming} without mutual temporal
exclusion, i.e., without interrupting the ongoing transmissions of coexisting
wireless networks on the same bands; and without cross-technology
communication. We first describe the main components of CoBeam, including
\emph{programmable physical layer driver}, \emph{cognitive sensing engine}, and
\emph{beamforming engine}, and then we showcase the potential of the CoBeam
framework by designing a practical coexistence scheme between Wi-Fi and LTE on
unlicensed bands. We present a prototype of the resulting coexisting
Wi-Fi/U-LTE network built on off-the-shelf software radios based on which we
evaluate the performance of CoBeam through an extensive experimental campaign.
Performance evaluation results indicate that CoBeam can achieve on average
$169\%$ throughput gain while requiring \emph{no} signaling exchange between
the coexisting wireless networks.

C$_2$H$_2$ with H-atoms and OH-radicals, which are produced along the H$_2$O
formation sequence on grain surfaces at 10 K. Ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
experiments were performed to study the surface chemistry observed during
C$_2$H$_2$ + O$_2$ + H codeposition, where O$_2$ was used for the in-situ
generation of OH-radicals. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS)
was applied to in situ monitor the initial and newly formed species. After
that, a temperature-programmed desorption experiment combined with a Quadrupole
mass spectrometer (TPD-QMS) was used as a complementary analytical tool. The
investigated 10 K surface chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with H-atoms and OH-radicals
not only results in semi and fully saturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene

provides a so far experimentally unreported solid-state route for the formation

energy-dominated, universe. Similarly to what has been proposed for galactic
dynamics, the anisotropic fluid gives an effective description of baryonic
matter, dark energy and their possible interaction, without assuming the
presence of dark matter. The resulting anisotropic fluid spacetime naturally
generates inhomogeneities at small scales, triggered by an anisotropic stress,
and could therefore be responsible for structure formation at these scales.
Solving the cosmological equations, we show that the dynamics of the scale
factor $a$ is described by usual FLRW cosmology and decouples completely from
that describing inhomogeneities. We assume that the cosmological anisotropic
fluid inherits the equation of state from that used to describe galaxy rotation
curves. We show that, in the large scale regime, the fluid can be described as
a generalized Chaplygin gas and fits well the distance modulus experimental
data of type Ia supernovae, thus correctly modelling the observed accelerated
expansion of the universe. Conversely, in the small scale regime, we use
cosmological perturbation theory to derive the power spectrum $P(k)$ for mass
density distribution. At short wavelengths, we find a $1/k^4$ behaviour, in
good accordance with the observed correlation function for matter distribution
at small scales.

replication systems to design deterministic agreement protocols in the
eventually synchronous communication model. We first prove that no such
protocol can guarantee bounded communication cost before the global
stabilization time and propose a different approach that hopes for the best
(synchrony) but prepares for the worst (asynchrony). Accordingly, we design an
optimistic byzantine agreement protocol that first tries an efficient
deterministic algorithm that relies on synchrony for termination only, and
then, only if an agreement was not reached due to asynchrony, the protocol uses
a randomized asynchronous protocol for fallback that guarantees termination
with probability 1.
  We formally prove that our protocol achieves optimal communication complexity
under all network conditions and failure scenarios. We first prove a lower
bound of $\Omega(ft+ t)$ for synchronous deterministic byzantine agreement
protocols, where $t$ is the failure threshold, and $f$ is the actual number of
failures. Then, we present a tight upper bound and use it for the synchronous
part of the optimistic protocol. Finally, for the asynchronous fallback, we use
a variant of the (optimal) VABA protocol, which we reconstruct to safely
combine it with the synchronous part.
  We believe that our adaptive to failures synchronous byzantine agreement
protocol has an independent interest since it is the first protocol we are
aware of which communication complexity optimally depends on the actual number
of failures.

we formulate an automatic FPGA placement algorithm for these hard blocks as a
multi-objective optimization problem that targets wirelength squared and
maximum bounding box size metrics. We build an end-to-end placement and routing
flow called RapidLayout using the Xilinx RapidWright framework. RapidLayout
runs 5-6$\times$ faster than Vivado with manual constraints and eliminates the
weeks-long effort to generate placement constraints manually for the hard
blocks. We also perform automated post-placement pipelining of the long wires
inside each convolution block to target 650MHz URAM-limited operation.
RapidLayout outperforms (1) the simulated annealer in VPR by 33% in runtime,
1.9-2.4$\times$ in wirelength, and 3-4$\times$ in bounding box size, while also
(2) beating the analytical placer UTPlaceF by 9.3$\times$ in runtime,

employ transfer learning from a base FPGA device to speed-up placement
optimization for similar FPGA devices in the UltraScale+ family by
11-14$\times$ than learning the placements from scratch.

further show that the lightest one among the three right handed neutrinos can
be a viable DM candidate. The stability of DM can be owed to a remnant $Z_2$

integrals that model the physics of light transport in virtual scenes for
computer graphics applications. These methods rely on the law of large numbers
to estimate expectations via simulation, typically resulting in slow
convergence. Their errors usually manifest as undesirable grain in the pictures
generated by image synthesis algorithms. It is well known that these errors
diminish when the samples are chosen appropriately. A well known technique for
reducing error operates by subdividing the integration domain, estimating
integrals in each \emph{stratum} and aggregating these values into a stratified
sampling estimate. Na\""{i}ve methods for stratification, based on a lattice
(grid) are known to improve the convergence rate of Monte Carlo, but require
samples that grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the domain.
  We propose a simple stratification scheme for $d$ dimensional hypercubes
using the kd-tree data structure. Our scheme enables the generation of an
arbitrary number of equal volume partitions of the rectangular domain, and $n$
samples can be generated in $O(n)$ time. Since we do not always need to
explicitly build a kd-tree, we provide a simple procedure that allows the
sample set to be drawn fully in parallel without any precomputation or storage,
speeding up sampling to $O(\log n)$ time per sample when executed on $n$ cores.
If the tree is implicitly precomputed ($O(n)$ storage) the parallelised run
time reduces to $O(1)$ on $n$ cores. In addition to these benefits, we provide
an upper bound on the worst case star-discrepancy for $n$ samples matching that
of lattice-based sampling strategies, which occur as a special case of our
proposed method. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative tests to
compare our method against state of the art samplers for image synthesis.

a set of crucial complex organic molecules in a sample of sources, with
well-known physical structure, covering the various phases of Solar-type star
formation. One representative object of the transition from the prestellar core
to the protostar phases has been observed toward the Very Low Luminosity Object
(VeLLO) called L1521F. This type of source is important to study to make the
link between prestellar cores and Class 0 sources and also to constrain the
chemical evolution during the process of star formation. Two frequency windows
(81.6-82.6 GHz and 96.65-97.65 GHz) were used to observe the emission from
several complex organics toward the L1521F VeLLO. Only 2 transitions of
methanol (A+, E2) have been detected in the narrow window centered at 96.7 GHz
(with an upper limit on E1) in a very compact emission blob (~7'' corresponding
to ~1000au) toward the NE of the L1521F protostar. The CS 2-1 transition is
also detected within the WideX bandwidth. Consistently, with what has been
found in prestellar cores, the methanol emission appears ~1000au away from the
dust peak. The location of the methanol blob coincides with one of the
filaments previously reported in the literature. The Tex of the gas inferred
from methanol is (10$\pm$2) K, while the H2 gas density (estimated from the
detected CS 2-1 emission and previous CS 5-4 ALMA obs.) is a factor >25 higher
than the density in the surrounding environment (n(H2) >10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$).
From its compactness, low excitation temperature and high gas density, we
suggest that the methanol emission detected with NOEMA is either a cold and
dense shock-induced blob, recently formed ($\leq$ few hundred years) by
infalling gas or a cold and dense fragment that may have just been formed as a
result of the intense gas dynamics found within the L1521F VeLLO system.

environments is still to a large extent an open subject in soft matter physics
and biology. In this paper, we employ large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations
to investigate how the diffusion of a tracer is influenced by the combined
action of excluded-volume and weak attractive crowder-tracer interactions. We
consider two species of tracers, standard hard-core particles described by the
Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) repulsive potential and core-softened (CS)
particles, which model, e.g., globular proteins, charged colloids and
nanoparticles covered by polymeric brushes. These systems are characterized by
the presence of two length scales in the interaction and can show water-like
anomalies in their diffusion, stemming from the inherent competition between
different length scales. Here we report a comprehensive study of both diffusion
and structure of these two tracer species in an environment crowded by quenched
configurations of polymers at increasing density. We analyze in detail how the
tracer-polymer affinity and the system density affect transport as compared to
the emergence of specific static spatial correlations. In particular, we find
that, while hardly any differences emerge in the diffusion properties of WCA
and CS particles, the propensity to develop structural order for large crowding
is strongly frustrated for CS particles. Surprisingly, for large enough
affinity for the crowding matrix, the diffusion coefficient of WCA tracers
display a non-monotonic trend as their density is increased when compared to
the zero affinity scenario. This water-like anomaly turns out to be even larger
than what observed for CS particle and appears to be rooted in a similar
competition between excluded-volume and affinity effects.

process, exemplified by the rising costs of small molecule therapeutic
discovery. One class of techniques of growing interest for early-stage drug
discovery is de novo molecular generation and optimization, catalyzed by the
development of new deep learning approaches. These techniques can suggest novel
molecular structures intended to maximize a multi-objective function, e.g.,
suitability as a therapeutic against a particular target, without relying on
brute-force exploration of a chemical space. However, the utility of these
approaches is stymied by ignorance of synthesizability. To highlight the
severity of this issue, we use a data-driven computer-aided synthesis planning
program to quantify how often molecules proposed by state-of-the-art generative
models cannot be readily synthesized. Our analysis demonstrates that there are
several tasks for which these models generate unrealistic molecular structures
despite performing well on popular quantitative benchmarks. Synthetic
complexity heuristics can successfully bias generation toward
synthetically-tractable chemical space, although doing so necessarily detracts
from the primary objective. This analysis suggests that to improve the utility
of these models in real discovery workflows, new algorithm development is
warranted.

were conducted to systematically investigate the competition between cleavage
decohesion and dislocation emission from a crack tip in the body-centered cubic
refractory HEAs HfNbTiZr, MoNbTaVW, MoNbTaW, MoNbTiV, and NbTiVZr. This
crack-tip competition is evaluated for tensile loading and a totality of 15
crack configurations and slip systems. Our results predict that dislocation
plasticity at the crack tip is generally unfavorable -- although the
competition is close for some crack orientations, suggesting intrinsic
brittleness and low crack-tip fracture toughness in these five HEAs at zero
temperature. Fluctuations in local alloy composition, investigated for
HfNbTiZr, can locally reduce the resistance to dislocation emission for a slip
system relative to the configuration average of that slip system, but do not
change the dominant crack-tip response. In the case of single-crystal MoNbTaW,
where an experimental, room-temperature fracture-toughness value is available
for a crack on a \{100\} plane, theoretical and experimental results agree
favorably. Factors that may limit the agreement are discussed. We survey the
effect of material anisotropy on preferred crack tip orientations, which are
found to be alloy specific. Mixed-mode loadings are found to shift the
competition in favor of cleavage or dislocation nucleation, depending on crack

quantitative test of the Weyl equation taking into account realistic
anisotropic properties. These anisotropies are mostly contained in the form of
the emergent magnetic moment of the excitations, which determines how they
couple to the neutron. Although there are many material parameters, we find
several quantitative predictions that are universal and demonstrate that the
excitations are described by solutions to the Weyl equation. The realistic,
anisotropic coupling between electrons and neutrons implies that even fully
unpolarized neutrons can reveal the spin-momentum locking of the Weyl fermions
because the neutrons will couple to some components of the Weyl fermion
pseudospin more strongly. On the other hand, in an experiment with polarized
neutrons, the scattered neutron beam remains fully polarized in a direction
that varies as a function of momentum transfer (within the range of validity of
the Weyl equation). This allows measurement of the chirality of Weyl fermions
for inversion symmetric nodes. Furthermore, we estimate that the scattering
rate may be large enough for such experiments to be practical; in particular,
the magnetic moment may be larger than the ordinary Bohr magneton, compensating
for a small density of states.

  arXiv:1907.00648",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Supersymmetry deviations from the SM signal strengths of the 125 GeV Higgs
boson can occur, because of possible SUSY contributions in diagrams with loops,
which leads to different deviations in signal strengths for processes with and
without loop diagrams. In the Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(NMSSM) additional deviations may occur, because of the mixing with the
additional singlet-like Higgs boson and/or additional decays into pairs of
light particles, like neutralinos, pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons or singlet-like
Higgs bosons. In this paper we study these ""genuine"" NMSSM deviations in detail
to check not only their possible size, but also look for correlations or
anti-correlations with respect to other channels in the hope to find specific
patterns in the deviations as for the SUSY contributions, which occur
predominantly in processes including loops in the diagrams. The whole NMSSM
parameter space is sampled in a deterministic way. The novel scanning method is
discussed in detail in the Appendix. We found three different regions with
""genuine"" NMSSM deviations, which are largely independent of the production
mode. What was surprising: some regions show negativ correlations between final
states with fermions and bosons meaning if the signal strengths for fermions
decrease the signal strengths for bosonic final states increase, while other
regions show positive correlations. The sign of the correlations is a strong
function of the mass difference between the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson and
the Higgs singlet, so looking for correlations could give useful hints about
the existence and mass of the singlet Higgs boson. The features of these
""genuine"" NMSSM effects have been investigated in representative benchmark
points for each of the three regions where a single effect is dominant. These
benchmark points have been detailed in the Appendix.

distribution) is needed for accurate dose-effect modeling. For childhood cancer
survivors who underwent radiotherapy in the pre-CT era, only 2D radiographs
were acquired, thus 3D dose distributions must be reconstructed from limited
information. State-of-the-art methods achieve this by using 3D surrogate
anatomies. These can lack personalization and lead to coarse reconstructions.
We present and validate a surrogate-free dose reconstruction method based on
Machine Learning (ML). Abdominal planning CTs ($n$=142) of recently-treated
childhood cancer patients were gathered, their organs at risk were segmented,
and 300 artificial Wilms' tumor plans were sampled automatically. Each
artificial plan was automatically emulated on the 142 CTs, resulting in 42,600
3D dose distributions from which dose-volume metrics were derived. Anatomical
features were extracted from digitally reconstructed radiographs simulated from
the CTs to resemble historical radiographs. Further, patient and radiotherapy
plan features typically available from historical treatment records were
collected. An evolutionary ML algorithm was then used to link features to
dose-volume metrics. Besides 5-fold cross-validation, a further evaluation was
done on an independent dataset of five CTs each associated with two clinical
plans. Cross-validation resulted in Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) $\leq$0.6 Gy
for organs completely inside or outside the field. For organs positioned at the
edge of the field, MAEs $\leq$1.7 Gy for D$_{mean}$, $\leq$2.9 Gy for
D$_{2cc}$, and $\leq$13% for V$_{5Gy}$ and V$_{10Gy}$, were obtained, without
systematic bias. Similar results were found for the independent dataset. Our
novel, ML-based organ dose reconstruction method is not only accurate but also
efficient, as the setup of a surrogate is no longer needed.

It
assesses a given policy by estimating the corresponding value function. When
using parameterized value functions, common approaches minimize the sum of
squared Bellman temporal-difference errors and receive a point-estimate for the
parameters. Kalman-based and Gaussian-processes based frameworks were suggested
to evaluate the policy by treating the value as a random variable. These
frameworks can learn uncertainties over the value parameters and exploit them
for policy exploration. When adopting these frameworks to solve deep RL tasks,
several limitations are revealed: excessive computations in each optimization
step, difficulty with handling batches of samples which slows training and the
effect of memory in stochastic environments which prevents off-policy learning.
In this work, we discuss these limitations and propose to overcome them by an
alternative general framework, based on the extended Kalman filter. We devise
an optimization method, called Kalman Optimization for Value Approximation
(KOVA) that can be incorporated as a policy evaluation component in policy
optimization algorithms. KOVA minimizes a regularized objective function that
concerns both parameter and noisy return uncertainties. We analyze the
properties of KOVA and present its performance on deep RL control tasks.

  solve the twin primes conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture",,,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ABSTRACT. In this article we present a point of view that highlights the
importance of finding the upper bounds for prime gaps, in order to solve the
twin primes conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture. For this purpose, we
present a procedure for the determination of the upper bounds for prime gaps
different from the most famous and known approaches. The proposed method
analyzes the distribution of prime numbers using the set of relative numbers.
Using negative numbers too, it becomes intuitive to understand that that the
arrangement of 2P+1 consecutive numbers that goes -P to P, is the only
arrangement that minimizes the distance between two powers having the same
absolute value of the base D, with |D|<=P. This arrangement is considered
important because by increasing the number of powers of the prime numbers
within a range of consecutive numbers, it is presumed to decrease the overlap
between the prime numbers considered. Consequently, by reducing these overlaps,
we suppose to obtain an arrangement, in which the prime numbers less than and
equal to P and their multiples occupy the greatest possible number of positions
within a range of 2P+1 consecutive numbers. If this result could be
demonstrated, would imply not only the resolution of the Legendre conjecture,
but also a step forward in the resolution of the twin primes conjecture and the
Goldbach conjecture.

Additionally, some parts of the arriving tasks can be outsourced and thus
completed by non-team members, at a premium. Our contribution is an efficient
online cost-minimizing algorithm for hiring and firing team members and

automated design of mechanical components while ensuring the result can be
manufactured using multi-axis machining. Although TO improves the part's
performance, the as-designed model is often geometrically too complex to be
machined and the as-manufactured model can significantly vary due to machining
constraints that are not accounted for during TO. In other words, many of the
optimized design features cannot be accessed by a machine tool without
colliding with the part (or fixtures). The subsequent post-processing to make
the part machinable with the given setup requires trial-and-error without
guarantees on preserving the optimized performance. Our proposed approach is
based on the well-established accessibility analysis formulation using
convolutions in configuration space that is extensively used in spatial
planning and robotics. We define an 'inaccessibility measure field' (IMF) over
the design domain to identify non-manufacturable features and quantify their
contribution to non-manufacturability. The IMF is used to penalize the
sensitivity field of performance objectives and constraints to prevent
formation of inaccessible regions. Unlike existing discrete formulations, our
IMF provides a continuous spatial field that is desirable for TO convergence.
Our approach applies to arbitrary geometric complexity of the part, tools, and
fixtures, and is highly parallelizable on multi-core architecture. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on benchmark and realistic
examples in 2D and 3D. We also show that it is possible to directly construct
manufacturing plans for the optimized designs based on the accessibility
information.

been seen before, using two given images: content image and style image. The
content image forms the structure, the basic geometric lines and shapes of the
resulting image, while the style image sets the color and texture of the
result. The word ""arbitrary"" in this context means the absence of any one
pre-learned style. So, for example, convolutional neural networks capable of
transferring a new style only after training or retraining on a new amount of
data are not con-sidered to solve such a problem, while networks based on the
attention mech-anism that are capable of performing such a transformation
without retraining - yes. An original image can be, for example, a photograph,
and a style image can be a painting of a famous artist. The resulting image in
this case will be the scene depicted in the original photograph, made in the
stylie of this picture. Recent arbitrary style transfer algorithms make it
possible to achieve good re-sults in this task, however, in processing portrait

excessive distortion of facial features, or weakly expressed, not bearing the

of all, to ensure the economy and security of the power system, the MORPD model
aiming to minimize active power loss and voltage deviation is formulated. And
then the two-step approach integrating decision-making into optimization is
proposed to solve the model. Specifically speaking, the first step aims to seek
the Pareto optimal solutions (POSs) with good distribution by using a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm named classification and Pareto
domination based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (CPSMOEA). Furthermore,
the reference Pareto-optimal front is generated to validate the Pareto front
obtained using CPSMOEA; in the second step, integrated decision-making by
combining fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) with grey relation projection method
(GRP) aims to extract the best compromise solutions which reflect the
preferences of decision-makers from the POSs. Based on the test results on the
IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, it is demonstrated that the proposed
approach not only manages to address the MORPD issue but also outperforms other
commonly-used MOO algorithms including multi-objective particle swarm
optimization (MOPSO), preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithm (PICEAg) and
the third evolution step of generalized differential evolution (GDE3).

solar mass pose a new challenge for compact objects such as hybrid stars and
neutron stars. Extensions of the bag model and the Nambu-Jona-Lasino model have
been used to model these stars to get higher mass stars. Quark matter has been
predicted in the cores of these massive stars. In this work we show that an
extension of the bag model, with a chemical potential dependent bag parameter
can lead to an isentropic phase transition in the core of the neutron star. Our
model shows that an EoS having all three quarks $u$, $d$ and $s$ would lead to
massive stars with stable quark matter. We find that the mass of the stars not
only depends on the bag constant but also on the mass of the strange quark. The
mass - radius ratio which determines the redshift values on the surface,
indicates that it is possible to obtain stable self bound strange quark matter
stars with reasonable values of the bag pressure which correspond to the recent
observations of large mass stars.

collisions is non-exponential and attenuation does not respect Beer's law.
Generalized radiative transfer (GRT) extends the classical theory to account
for such two-point correlation between collisions and neglects all higher order
correlations. For this form of transport, we derive the exact time-independent
Green's functions for the isotropic point source in infinite 3D homogeneous
media with general anisotropic scattering. Green's functions for both collision
rate density, which characterizes absorption and reaction rates in the system,
and radiance/flux, which characterizes displacement of radiation/particles, are
solved in Fourier space. We validate the derivations using gamma random flights
to produce the first anisotropic scattering benchmark solutions for the
generalized linear Boltzmann equation. For gamma-4 flights with linearly
anisotropic scattering and gamma-6 flights with Rayleigh scattering the
collision rate density is found explicitly in real space as a sum of diffusion
modes.

(OAM) with structural asymmetry quantum dot molecules characterized by four
energy levels. We demonstrate how the inter-dot tunneling endows exchange of
optical vortices between different frequencies. We consider a case where a weak
probe beam has an optical vortex and thus has a zero intensity at the center.
The presence of tunneling coupling generates an additional weak laser beam with
the same vorticity as that of the incident vortex beam. We analyze conditions
for the vortex of the initial beam to be transferred efficiently to the
generated beam. The propagation of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams possessing OAM
states characterized by both azimuthal and radial indices is then investigated
for the case where the strong control beam is also an OAM mode. It is shown
that the conservation of OAM states is always satisfied over the OAM exchange
process. Yet, an abnormal case is observed in which the radial index induces
some intensity patterns of the generated beam which differs from a pure LG beam
of incident beams. Analytical solutions are provided to elucidate such effects
induced by radial indices on propagation characteristics of OAM beams. When
superimposing two initially present weak OAM modes, it is observed that the
resulting optical vortices move about the beam axis as the light propagates,
forming a sort of ""constellation"" around the center. The shift in axis of such
a composite pulses is due to the effect of inter-dot tunneling which is
controlled by an external electric voltage. The optical angular momenta may add
a new degree of freedom in the study of solid systems suitable for quantum

introduce a new practical method for computing lesion-based white matter
disconnection maps that require only moderate computational resources. We
achieve this by creating diffusion tractography models of the brains of healthy

these connectivity models by projecting patients' lesions into them to compute
predicted white matter disconnection. A quantified disconnection map can be

useful patterns and fundamental sub-comments from their architectures,
providing researchers with strong prior knowledge to design proper CNN

  Global Symmetry-Breaking Approach","Accepted for publication in Journal of Elasticity",,,,"nlin.PS cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the classic stability problem of the buckling of an inextensible,
axially compressed beam on a nonlinear elastic foundation with a
semi-analytical approach to understand how spatially localized deformation
solutions emerge in many applications in mechanics. Instead of a numerical
search for such solutions using arbitrary imperfections, we propose a
systematic search using branch-following and bifurcation techniques along with
group-theoretic methods to find all the bifurcated solution orbits (primary,
secondary, etc.) of the system and to examine their stability and hence their
observability. Unlike previously proposed methods that use multi-scale
perturbation techniques near the critical load, we show that to obtain a
spatially localized deformation equilibrium path for the perfect structure, one
has to consider the secondary bifurcating path with the longest wavelength and
follow it far away from the critical load. The novel use of group-theoretic
methods here illustrates a general methodology for the systematic analysis of
structures with a high degree of symmetry.

  Load Readings from Smart Meters","33 Pages, 12 Figures, Submitted as a book chapter to Springer",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fuel poverty affects between 50 and 125 million households in Europe and is a
significant issue for both developed and developing countries globally. This
means that fuel poor residents are unable to adequately warm their home and run
the necessary energy services needed for lighting, cooking, hot water, and
electrical appliances. The problem is complex but is typically caused by three
factors; low income, high energy costs, and energy inefficient homes. In the
United Kingdom (UK), 4 million families are currently living in fuel poverty.
Those in series financial difficulty are either forced to self-disconnect or
have their services terminated by energy providers. Fuel poverty contributed to
10,000 reported deaths in England in the winter of 2016-2107 due to homes being
cold. While it is recognized by governments as a social, public health and
environmental policy issue, the European Union (EU) has failed to provide a
common definition of fuel poverty or a conventional set of indicators to
measure it. This chapter discusses current fuel poverty strategies across the
EU and proposes a new and foundational behavior measurement indicator designed
to directly assess and monitor fuel poverty risks in households using smart
meters, Consumer Access Device (CAD) data and machine learning. By detecting
Activities of Daily Living (ADLS) through household appliance usage, it is
possible to spot the early signs of financial difficulty and identify when
support packages are required.

makes it desirable to find representative subsets to reduce the dimensionality
of these movements for a variety of applications, including the design and
control of robotic and prosthetic devices. This paper presents a novel method
and the results of an extensive human subjects study to obtain representative
arm joint angle trajectories that span naturalistic motions during Activities
of Daily Living (ADLs). In particular, we seek to identify sets of useful
motion trajectories of the upper limb that are functions of a single variable,
allowing, for instance, an entire prosthetic or robotic arm to be controlled
with a single input from a user, along with a means to select between motions
for different tasks. Data driven approaches are used to obtain clusters as well
as representative motion averages for the full-arm 7 degree of freedom (DOF),
elbow-wrist 4 DOF, and wrist-only 3 DOF motions. The proposed method makes use
of well-known techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to obtain a
divergence measure between motion segments, DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) to
obtain averages, Ward's distance criterion to build hierarchical trees,
batch-DTW to simultaneously align multiple motion data, and functional
principal component analysis (fPCA) to evaluate cluster variability. The
clusters that emerge associate various recorded motions into primarily hand
start and end location for the full-arm system, motion direction for the
wrist-only system, and an intermediate between the two qualities for the
elbow-wrist system. The proposed clustering methodology is justified by
comparing results against alternative approaches.

oil exploration, and earthquake prediction. In contrast to prior accelerometers
using piezoelectric or electronic capacitance readout techniques, optical
readout provides narrow-linewidth high-sensitivity laser detection along with
low-noise resonant optomechanical transduction near the thermodynamical limits.
Here an optomechanical inertial sensor with 8.2micro-g/Hz^1/2 velocity random
walk (VRW) at acquisition rate of 100 Hz and 50.9 micro-g bias instability is
demonstrated, suitable for consumer and industrial grade applications, e.g.,
inertial navigation, inclination sensing, platform stabilization, and/or
wearable device motion detection. Driven into optomechanical
sustained-oscillation, the slot photonic crystal cavity provides
radio-frequency readout of the optically-driven transduction with enhanced 625
microg/Hz sensitivity. Measuring the optomechanically-stiffened oscillation
shift, instead of the optical transmission shift, provides a 220x VRW
enhancement over pre-oscillation mode detection due to the strong
optomechanical transduction. Supported by theory, this inertial sensor operates
2.56x above the thermodynamical limit at small integration times, with 43-dB
dynamic range, in a solid-state room-temperature readout architecture.

evolution reaction (HER) is the key for molecular hydrogen (H2) production from
electrochemical water splitting. Transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2), most
notably group-6 MX2 (e.g., MoS2 and WS2), are appealing catalysts for the HER
alternative to the best, but highly expensive, Pt-group elements. However,
their HER activity is typically restricted to their edge sites rather than
their basal plane. Furthermore, their semiconducting properties hinder an
efficient electron transfer to the catalytic sites, which impedes a high rate
of H2 production. Herein, we exploit liquid-phase exfoliation-produced metallic
(1H, 2H and 3R) NbS2 nanoflakes, belonging to the class of metallic layered
group-5 MX2, to overcome the abovementioned limitations. Both chemical
treatment with hygroscopic Li salt and electrochemical in operando
self-nanostructuring are exploited to improve the NbS2 nanoflake HER activity.
The combination of NbS2 with other MX2, in our case MoSe2, also provides
heterogeneous catalysts accelerating the HER kinetics of the individual
counterparts. The designed NbS2-based catalysts exhibit an overpotential at a
cathodic current of 10 mA cm-2 (n10) as low as 0.10 and 0.22 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M
H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the HER activity of the
NbS2-based catalysts is also superior to those of the Pt/C benchmark at current
densities higher than 80 mA cm-2. Our work provides general guidelines for a
scalable and cost-effective exploitation of NbS2, as well as the entire MX2
portfolio, for attaining a viable H2 production through electrochemical routes.
