mosaic of interconnected models. We define global first and second order
structural and correlative sensitivity analyses for random counting measures
acting on risk functionals of input-output maps. These are the ANOVA
decomposition of the intensity measure and the decomposition of the random
measure variance, each into subspaces. Orthogonal random measures furnish
sensitivity distributions. We show that the random counting measure may be used
to construct positive random fields, which admit decompositions of covariance
and sensitivity indices and may be used to represent interacting particle
systems. The first and second order global sensitivity analyses conveyed
through random counting measures elucidate and integrate different notions of
uncertainty quantification, and the global sensitivity analysis of random
fields conveys the proportionate functional contributions to covariance. This
framework complements others when used in conjunction with for instance
algorithmic uncertainty and model selection uncertainty frameworks.

  Compositional Data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Biclustering is a powerful data mining technique that allows simultaneously
clustering rows (observations) and columns (features) in a matrix-format data
set, which can provide results in a checkerboard-like pattern for visualization
and exploratory analysis in a wide array of domains. Multiple biclustering
algorithms have been developed in the past two decades, among which the convex
biclustering can guarantee a global optimum by formulating in as a convex
optimization problem. On the other hand, the application of biclustering has
not progressed in parallel with the algorithm techniques. For example,
biclustering for increasingly popular microbiome research data is under-applied
possibly due to its compositional constraints for each sample. In this
manuscript, we propose a new convex biclustering algorithm, called the bi-ADMM,
under general setups based on the ADMM algorithm, which is free of extra
smoothing steps to visualize informative biclusters required by existing convex
biclustering algorithms. Furthermore, we tailor it to the algorithm named
biC-ADMM specifically to tackle compositional constraints confronted in
microbiome data. The key step of our methods utilizes the Sylvester Equation to
derive the ADMM algorithm, which is new to the clustering research. The
effectiveness of the proposed methods is examined through a variety of
numerical experiments and a microbiome data application.

Connectivity of the physical qubits is one such constraint that restricts
two-qubit operations, such as CNOT, to ""connected"" qubits. SWAP gates can be
used to place the logical qubits on admissible physical qubits, but they entail
a significant increase in CNOT-count. In this paper we consider the problem of
reducing the CNOT-count in Clifford+T circuits on connectivity constrained
architectures, like noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing devices.
We ""slice"" the circuit at the position of Hadamard gates and ""build"" the
intermediate {CNOT,T} sub-circuits using Steiner trees, significantly improving
on previous methods. We compared the performance of our algorithms while
mapping different benchmark and random circuits to some well-known
architectures such as 9-qubit square grid, 16-qubit square grid, Rigetti
16-qubit Aspen, 16-qubit IBM QX5 and 20-qubit IBM Tokyo. Our methods give less

Assuming most of the errors in a NISQ circuit implementation are due to CNOT
errors, then our method would allow circuits with few times more CNOT gates be
reliably implemented than the previous methods would permit.

observations of two primary transits of the highly-irradiated, ultra-hot
Jupiter-size planet WASP-76b. We investigate the presence of several key atomic
and molecular features of interest that may reveal the atmospheric properties
of the planet. Methods. We extracted two transmission spectra of WASP-76b with
R approx 140,000 using a procedure that allowed us to process the full ESPRESSO
wavelength range (3800-7880 A) simultaneously. We observed that at a high
signal-to-noise ratio, the continuum of ESPRESSO spectra shows wiggles that are
likely caused by an interference pattern outside the spectrograph. To search
for the planetary features, we visually analysed the extracted transmission
spectra and cross-correlated the observations against theoretical spectra of
different atomic and molecular species. Results. The following atomic features
are detected: Li I, Na I, Mg I, Ca II, Mn I, K I, and Fe I. All are detected
with a confidence level between 9.2 sigma (Na I) and 2.8 sigma (Mg I). We did
not detect the following species: Ti I, Cr I, Ni I, TiO, VO, and ZrO. We impose
the following 1 sigma upper limits on their detectability: 60, 77, 122, 6, 8,

I as previously reported in the literature. We show that the procedure employed
in this work can detect features down to the level of ~ 0.1 % in the
transmission spectrum and ~ 10 ppm by means of a cross-correlation method. We
discuss the presence of neutral and singly ionised features in the atmosphere
of WASP-76b.

for a variety of potential types, we divide the analyzed potentials in two
families, each of them containing potentials with varying large- or small-field

have a universal feature, with the peak around the physical wavenumber $k/a
\sim m$ at the inflaton oscillation period, irrespective of the exact potential
shape. This can be used as a smoking-gun for deducing the existence of a
violent preheating phase and possible oscillon formation after inflation.
Despite this apparent universality, we find differences in the shape of the
emitted GW spectra between the two potential families, leading to
discriminating features between them. In particular, all potentials show the
emergence of a two-peak structure in the GW spectrum, arising at the time of
oscillon formation. However, potentials exhibiting efficient parametric
resonance tend to smear out this structure and by the end of the simulation the
GW spectrum exhibits a single broad peak. We further compute the properties of
the produced oscillons for each potential, finding differences in the number
density and size distribution of stable oscillons and transient overdensities.
We perform a linear fluctuation analysis and use Floquet charts to relate the
results of our simulations to the structure of parametric resonance. We find
that the growth rate of scalar perturbations and the associated oscillon
formation time are sensitive to the small-field potential shape while the
macroscopic physical properties of oscillons (e.g. total number) depend on the
large-field potential shape.

molecular machine learning is a classically low-data regime and it isn't clear
that graph neural networks can avoid overfitting in low-resource settings. In
contrast, fingerprint methods are the traditional standard for low-data
environments due to their reduced number of parameters and manually engineered
features. In this work, we investigate whether graph neural networks are
competitive in small data settings compared to the parametrically 'cheaper'
alternative of fingerprint methods. When we find that they are not, we explore
pretraining and the meta-learning method MAML (and variants FO-MAML and ANIL)
for improving graph neural network performance by transfer learning from
related tasks. We find that MAML and FO-MAML do enable the graph neural network
to outperform models based on fingerprints, providing a path to using graph
neural networks even in settings with severely restricted data availability. In
contrast to previous work, we find ANIL performs worse that other meta-learning
approaches in this molecule setting. Our results suggest two reasons: molecular
machine learning tasks may require significant task-specific adaptation, and
distribution shifts in test tasks relative to train tasks may contribute to
worse ANIL performance.

these methods directly on three topical problems of interest in waveguide-QED,
including (i) a two-level system (TLS) coupled to an infinite (one-dimensional)
waveguide, (ii) a TLS coupled to a terminated waveguide with a time-delayed
coherent feedback, and (iii) two spatially separated TLSs coupled within an
infinite waveguide. Both approaches are shown to efficiently model multi-photon
nonlinear dynamics in highly non-Markovian regimes, and we highlight the
advantages and disadvantages of these methods for modelling waveguide QED
interactions, including their implementation in Python, computational run
times, and ease of conceptual understanding. We explore both vacuum dynamics as
well as regimes of strong optical pumping, where a weak excitation
approximation cannot be applied. The MPS approach scales better when modelling
multi-photon dynamics and long delay times, and explicitly includes
non-Markovian memory effects. In contrast, the SDW model accounts for
non-Markovian effects through space discretization, and solves Markovian
equations of motion, yet rigorously includes the effects of retardation. The
SDW model, based on an extension of recent collisional pictures in quantum
optics, is solved through quantum trajectory techniques, and can more easily
add in additional dissipation processes, including off-chip decay and TLS pure
dephasing. The impact of these processes is shown directly on feedback-induced
population trapping and TLS entanglement between spatially separated TLSs.

However, the quality of generated speech by autoregressive based neural

propose a novel vocoder model: TFGAN, which is adversarially learned both in
time and frequency domain. On one hand, we propose to discriminate ground-truth
waveform from synthetic one in frequency domain for offering more consistency
guarantees instead of only in time domain. On the other hand, in contrast to
the conventionally frequency-domain STFT loss approach or feature map loss by
discriminator to learn waveform, we propose a set of time-domain loss that
encourage the generator to capture the waveform directly. TFGAN has nearly same
synthesis speed as MelGAN, but the fidelity is significantly improved by our
novel learning method. In our experiments, TFGAN shows the ability to achieve
comparable mean opinion score (MOS) than autoregressive vocoder under speech

train the classifier. Recently, an auto-associative kernel extreme learning
machine was developed for the OCC task. This paper introduces a novel extension
of this classifier by embedding minimum variance information within its
architecture and is referred to as VAAKELM. The minimum variance embedding
forces the network output weights to focus in regions of low variance and
reduces the intra-class variance. This leads to a better separation of target
samples and outliers, resulting in an improvement in the generalization
performance of the classifier. The proposed classifier follows a
reconstruction-based approach to OCC and minimizes the reconstruction error by
using the kernel extreme learning machine as the base classifier. It uses the
deviation in reconstruction error to identify the outliers. We perform
experiments on 15 small-size and 10 medium-size one-class benchmark datasets to
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed classifier. We compare the results
with 13 existing one-class classifiers by considering the mean F1 score as the
comparison metric. The experimental results show that VAAKELM consistently
performs better than the existing classifiers, making it a viable alternative
for the OCC task.

critical fluid and thus it is a fluctuating quantity itself. While the mean CCF
is universal, its (static) variance has previously been found to depend on the
microscopic details of the system which effectively set a large-momentum cutoff
in the underlying field theory, rendering it potentially large. This raises the
question how the properties of the force variance are reflected in
experimentally observable quantities, such as the thickness of a wetting film
or the position of a suspended colloidal particle. Here, based on a rigorous
definition of the instantaneous force, we analyze static and dynamic
correlations of the CCF for a conserved fluid in film geometry for various
boundary conditions within the Gaussian approximation. We find that the dynamic
correlation function of the CCF is independent of the momentum cutoff and
decays algebraically in time. Within the Gaussian approximation, the associated
exponent depends only on the dynamic universality class but not on the boundary
conditions. We furthermore consider a fluid film, the thickness of which can
fluctuate under the influence of the time-dependent CCF. The latter gives rise
to an effective non-Markovian noise in the equation of motion of the film
boundary and induces a distinct contribution to the position variance. Within
the approximations used here, at short times, this contribution grows
algebraically in time whereas, at long times, it saturates and contributes to
the steady-state variance of the film thickness.

objectives; the landscape of these nonconvex objective functions is sensitive
to interactions but the objectives themselves do not explicitly model

attractive:
  (a) The stationary points of the objective are automatically sparse (i.e.
performs selection) -- no explicit $\ell_1$ penalization is needed.

suspensions of swimming bacteria, as well as in the collective motion of active
colloids. The corresponding large-scale dynamical patterns were reproduced in a
simple model of a polar fluid, assuming a constant density of active particles.
Recent, more detailed experimental studies revealed additional interesting
aspects, such as anomalous velocity statistics and clustering phenomena. Those
phenomena cannot be explained by currently available models for active polar
fluids. Herein, we extend the continuum model suggested by Dunkel et al. to
include density variations and a feedback between the local density and
self-propulsion speed of the active particles. If the velocity decreases strong
enough with the density, a linear stability analysis of the resulting model
shows that, in addition to the short-wavelength instability of the original
model, a long-wavelength instability occurs. This is typically observed for
high densities of polar active particles and is analogous to the well-known
phenomenon of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in scalar active matter.
We determine a simple phase diagram indicating the linear instabilities and
perform systematic numerical simulations for the various regions in the
corresponding parameter space. The interplay between the well understood
short-range instability and the long-range instability leads to interesting
dynamics and novel phenomena concerning nucleation and coarsening processes.
Our simulation results display a rich variety of novel patterns, including
phase separation into domains with dynamically changing irregularly shaped
boundaries. Anomalous velocity statistics are observed in all phases where the
system segregates into regions of high and low densities. This offers a simple

functional theory cluster calculations involving up to 24H$_2$O, C$^+$ reacts
consistently with HCN embedded in ice to yield the neutral HOCHNC radical with
no barrier, along with H$_3$O+ as a byproduct. If HOCHNC then reacts with H,
three species can be formed: HOCH$_2$CN (isocyanomethanol), HOCH$_2$CN

widely used auction mechanisms: first price and VCG-nearest. We also explore
the structural properties of the winner determination problem that cause this
phenomenon, and we use the insights gained to investigate how impactful complex
bidding may be. We find that, in the worst case, a bidder's optimal complex bid
may require bidding on an exponential number of bundles, even if the bidder is
interested only in a single good. Thus, this phenomenon can greatly impact the
auction's outcome and should not be ignored by bidders and auction designers
alike.

multi-user massive MIMO systems when channel induced Doppler spread is high.
Recently, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to
be robust to channel induced Doppler spread. In OTFS based systems, information
symbols are embedded in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where they are jointly
modulated to generate the time-domain transmit signal. Due to the multi-path
delay and Doppler shifts, the DD domain information symbols need to be jointly
demodulated at the receiver. For multi-carrier based communication (e.g.,
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)), massive MIMO systems have
been shown to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency with low complexity
multi-user precoding in the downlink. Extending the same to OTFS based downlink
multi-user massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the requirement for joint
demodulation of all information symbols at the user terminal (UT). In this
paper, we solve this problem by proposing a novel OTFS based multi-user
precoder at the base station (BS) and a corresponding low complexity detector
(LCD) at the user terminals (UTs), which allows for separate demodulation of
each DD domain information symbol at the UT. The complexity of the proposed
precoder increases only linearly with increasing number BS antennas Q and the
number of UTs. We show, through analysis, that as Q increases (with total
transmitted power decreased linearly with Q), the proposed low complexity
detector achieves a sum SE close to that achieved with optimal joint
demodulation at each UT. Numerical simulations confirm our analysis and also
show that the SE and error rate performance of the proposed OTFS based massive
MIMO precoder and LCD detector is significantly more robust to channel induced
Doppler spread when compared to OFDM based multi-user massive MIMO systems.

arguing that gradient-free approaches are unaffected by barren plateaus. Here
we show that, indeed, gradient-free optimizers do not solve the barren plateau

basis for making decisions in a gradient-free optimization, are exponentially
suppressed in a barren plateau. Hence, without exponential precision,
gradient-free optimizers will not make progress in the optimization. We
numerically confirm this by training in a barren plateau with several
gradient-free optimizers (Nelder-Mead, Powell, and COBYLA algorithms), and show
that the numbers of shots required in the optimization grows exponentially with
the number of qubits.

train a recurrent neural network-based machine learning architecture using long

hardware domain when executing multiple variants of ransomware as well as
benign programs. We create timeseries to develop intrinsic statistical features
using the information of related HPCs and improve the detection accuracy of
RanStop and reduce noise by via LSTM and global average pooling. As an early
detection scheme, RanStop can accurately and quickly identify ransomware within
2ms from the start of the program execution by analyzing HPC information
collected for 20 timestamps each 100us apart. This detection time is too early
for a ransomware to make any significant damage, if none. Moreover, validation
against benign programs with behavioral (sub-routine-centric) similarity with
that of a crypto-ransomware shows that RanStop can detect ransomware with an

observation that every CDCR system to date was developed, trained, and tested
only on a single respective corpus. This raises strong concerns on their
generalizability -- a must-have for downstream applications where the magnitude
of domains or event mentions is likely to exceed those found in a curated
corpus. To investigate this assumption, we define a uniform evaluation setup
involving three CDCR corpora: ECB+, the Gun Violence Corpus and the Football
Coreference Corpus (which we reannotate on token level to make our analysis
possible). We compare a corpus-independent, feature-based system against a
recent neural system developed for ECB+. Whilst being inferior in absolute
numbers, the feature-based system shows more consistent performance across all
corpora whereas the neural system is hit-and-miss. Via model introspection, we
find that the importance of event actions, event time, etc. for resolving
coreference in practice varies greatly between the corpora. Additional analysis

which bias toward active systems. We obtain optical spectra of 9 new systems at
Lick Observatory and confirm that all objects are CV systems. We measure
$P_{orb}$ for 7 systems using archival Gaia and Palomar Transient Factory light
curves, 3 of which do not have previous $P_{orb}$ measurements. We use the
CMD-$P_{orb}$ relation to infer the detectability of these systems to the
upcoming LISA mission, and find that six sources may be coherent LISA
verification binaries, with an estimated SNR > 5 in the 4 yr mission. This
paper demonstrates that the time-averaged Gaia catalog is a powerful tool in
the methodical discovery and characterization of time-varying objects, making
it complementary to missions like ZTF, TESS, and the Vera Rubin LSST.

cylinder agents in simulation and transferring them to real wheeled robots.
Deploying such navigation policies on legged robots can be challenging due to
their complex dynamics, and the large dynamical difference between cylinder
agents and legged systems. In this work, we learn hierarchical navigation
policies that account for the low-level dynamics of legged robots, such as
maximum speed, slipping, contacts, and learn to successfully navigate cluttered
indoor environments. To enable transfer of policies learned in simulation to
new legged robots and hardware, we learn dynamics-aware navigation policies
across multiple robots with robot-specific embeddings. The learned embedding is
optimized on new robots, while the rest of the policy is kept fixed, allowing
for quick adaptation. We train our policies across three legged robots in
simulation - 2 quadrupeds (A1, AlienGo) and a hexapod (Daisy). At test time, we
study the performance of our learned policy on two new legged robots in
simulation (Laikago, 4-legged Daisy), and one real-world quadrupedal robot
(A1). Our experiments show that our learned policy can sample-efficiently
generalize to previously unseen robots, and enable sim-to-real transfer of

hold for an arbitrary number of reflecting elements, and various channel fading

quickly repurposed for detection of materials in paintings. Second, we show
that learning from paintings can be beneficial for neural networks that are

and study the number of gates needed for the distribution over measurement
outcomes for typical circuit instances to be anti-concentrated, roughly meaning
that the probability mass is not too concentrated on a small number of
measurement outcomes. Understanding the conditions for anti-concentration is
important for determining which quantum circuits are difficult to simulate
classically, as anti-concentration has been in some cases an ingredient of
mathematical arguments that simulation is hard and in other cases a necessary
condition for easy simulation. Our definition of anti-concentration is that the
expected collision probability, that is, the probability that two independently
drawn outcomes will agree, is only a constant factor larger than if the
distribution were uniform. We show that when the 2-local gates are each drawn
from the Haar measure (or any two-design), at least $\Omega(n \log(n))$ gates
(and thus $\Omega(\log(n))$ circuit depth) are needed for this condition to be
met on an $n$ qudit circuit. In both the case where the gates are
nearest-neighbor on a 1D ring and the case where gates are long-range, we show
$O(n \log(n))$ gates are also sufficient, and we precisely compute the optimal
constant prefactor for the $n \log(n)$. The technique we employ relies upon a
mapping from the expected collision probability to the partition function of an
Ising-like classical statistical mechanical model, which we manage to bound
using stochastic and combinatorial techniques.

hydraulic fracture mechanics (LHFM): linear elastic fracture mechanics and
smooth parallel plates lubrication fluid flow. We relax these hypotheses and
investigate the growth of a plane-strain hydraulic fracture in an impermeable
medium accounting for a rough cohesive zone and a fluid lag. In addition to a
dimensionless toughness and the time-scale of coalescence of the fluid and
fracture fronts as in the LHFM case, the solution now also depends on the
in-situ-to-cohesive stress ratio and the intensity of the flow deviation
induced by aperture roughness. The solution is appropriately described by a
nucleation time-scale, which delineates the fracture growth into a nucleation
phase, an intermediate stage and a late time stage where convergence toward
LHFM predictions finally occurs. A highly non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling
takes place as the fluid front enters the rough cohesive zone which itself
evolves during the nucleation and intermediate stages. This coupling leads to
significant additional viscous flow dissipation. As a result, the fracture
evolution deviates from LHFM solutions with shorter fracture lengths, larger
widths and net pressures. These deviations ultimately decrease at late times as
the lag and cohesive zone fractions both become smaller. The deviations
increase with larger dimensionless toughness and in-situ-to-cohesive stress
ratio, as both further localize viscous dissipation near the fluid front
located in the rough cohesive zone. The convergence toward LHFM can occur at
very late time for realistic values of in-situ-to-cohesive stress ratio
encountered at depth. The impact of a rough cohesive zone appears to be
prominent for laboratory experiments and short in-situ injections in
quasi-brittle rocks with ultimately a larger energy demand compared to LHFM
predictions.

handle the extremely low FLOPs based upon two design principles: (a) avoiding
the reduction of network width by lowering the node connectivity, and (b)
compensating for the reduction of network depth by introducing more complex
non-linearity per layer. Firstly, we propose Micro-Factorized convolution to
factorize both pointwise and depthwise convolutions into low rank matrices for
a good tradeoff between the number of channels and input/output connectivity.

improve the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an

their parameters are adapted to the input. Building upon Micro-Factorized

explore relationships between the structural properties of GCs and the fraction
of second population (2P) stars. Given the correlations we find, we conclude
that the main factor driving the formation/evolution of 2P stars is the cluster
mass. The existing strong correlations between the 2P fraction and the
rotational velocity and concentration parameter could derive from their
correlation with the cluster mass. Furthermore, we observe that increasing
cluster escape velocity corresponds to higher 2P fractions. Each of the
correlations found is bimodal, with a different behaviour detected for low and
high mass (or escape velocity) clusters. These correlations could be consistent
with an initial formation of more centrally concentrated 2P stars in deeper
cluster potentials, followed by a long-term tidal stripping of stars from
clusters outskirts. The latter are dominated by the more extended distributed
first population (1P) stars, and therefore stronger tidal stripping would
preferentially deplete the 1P population, raising the cluster 2P fraction. This
also suggests a tighter distribution of initial 2P fractions than observed
today. In addition, higher escape velocities allow better retention of
low-velocity material ejected from 1P stars, providing an
alternative/additional origin for the observed differences and the
distributions of 2P fractions amongst GCs.

anomalous rotation curves are caused by dark matter halos or Milgromian
Dynamics (MOND). We investigate this by setting up a MOND model of M33. We
first simulate it in isolation for 6 Gyr, starting from an initial good match
to the rotation curve (RC). Too large a bar and bulge form when the gas is too
hot, but this is avoided by reducing the gas temperature. A strong bar still
forms in 1 Gyr, but rapidly weakens and becomes consistent with the observed
weak bar. Previous work showed this to be challenging in Newtonian models with
a live dark matter halo, which developed strong bars. The bar pattern speed
implies a realistic corotation radius of 3 kpc. However, the RC still rises too
steeply, and the central line of sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD) is too high.
We then add a constant external acceleration field of $8.4 \times 10^{-12}$
m/s$^2$ at $30^\circ$ to the disk as a first order estimate for the gravity
exerted by M31. This suppresses buildup of material at the centre, causing the
RC to rise more slowly and reducing the central LOSVD. Overall, this simulation
bears good resemblance to several global properties of M33, and highlights the
importance of including even a weak external field on the stability and
evolution of disk galaxies. Further simulations with a time-varying external
field, modeling the full orbit of M33, will be needed to confirm its
resemblance to observations.

Starfish and cloudless Sonora-Bobcat model atmospheres to analyze
low-resolution ($R\approx80-250$) near-infrared ($1.0-2.5$ $\mu$m) spectra of T

metallicities, radii, and masses, and by accounting for uncertainties from
model interpolation and correlated residuals due to instrumental effects and
modeling systematics, produces more realistic parameter posteriors than
traditional ($\chi^2$-based) spectral-fitting analyses. We validate our
framework by fitting the model atmospheres themselves and finding negligible
offsets between derived and input parameters. We apply our methodology to three
well-known benchmark late-T dwarfs, HD 3651B, GJ 570D, and Ross 458C, using
both solar and non-solar metallicity atmospheric models. We also derive these
benchmarks' physical properties using their bolometric luminosities, their
primary stars' ages and metallicities, and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary models.
Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, we find our
atmospheric-based, forward-modeling analysis produces two outcomes. For HD
3615B and GJ 570D, spectral fits provide accurate $T_{\rm eff}$ and $R$ but
underestimated $\log{g}$ (by $\approx1.2$ dex) and $Z$ (by $\approx0.35$ dex),
likely due to the systematics from modeling the potassium line profiles. For
Ross 458C, spectral fits provide accurate $\log{g}$ and $Z$ but overestimated
$T_{\rm eff}$ (by $\approx120$ K) and underestimated $R$ (by
$\approx1.6\times$), likely because our model atmospheres lack clouds, reduced
vertical temperature gradients, or disequilibrium processes. Finally, the
spectroscopically inferred masses of these benchmarks are all considerably
underestimated.

study the role of aeolian (wind) erosion in the evolution of solids in WD
debris disks. Aeolian erosion is a destructive process that plays a key role in
shaping the properties and size-distribution of planetesimals, boulders and
pebbles in gaseous protoplanetary disks. Our analysis of aeolian erosion in WD

study the effects of aeolian erosion under different conditions of the disk,

find that solid bodies smaller than $\sim 5 \rm{km}$ will be eroded within the
short disk lifetime. We compare the role of aeolian erosion in respect to other
destructive processes such as collisional fragmentation and thermal ablation.
We find that aeolian erosion is the dominant destructive process for objects

from the WD. Thereby, aeolian erosion constitutes the main destructive pathway
linking fragmentational collisions operating on large objects with sublimation

linear stability of unstratified disk models, which represent the midplane of
protoplanetary disks. We extend such studies by carrying out vertically-global
linear stability analyses of dust layers in protoplanetary disks. We find the
dominant form of instability in stratified dust layers is one driven by the
vertical gradient in the rotation velocity of the dust-gas mixture, but also
requires partial dust-gas coupling. These vertically-shearing streaming
instabilities grow on orbital timescales and occur on radial length scales
$\sim10^{-3}H_\mathrm{g}$, where $H_\mathrm{g}$ is the local pressure scale
height. The classic streaming instability, associated with the relative radial
drift between dust and gas, occur on radial length scales
$\sim10^{-2}H_\mathrm{g}$, but have much smaller growth rates than
vertically-shearing streaming instabilities. Including gas viscosity is
strongly stabilizing and leads to vertically-elongated disturbances. We briefly

signatures such as enhanced N and Na and simultaneously depleted C and O
abundances. In this paper we present an extensive chemical abundance analysis
of the halo star J110842, which was previously kinematically associated with
the massive MW GC $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$Cen), and we discuss viable
scenarios from escape to encounter. Based on a high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise spectrum of this star using the UVES spectrograph, we were able
to measure 33 species of 31 elements across all nucleosynthetic channels. The
star's low metallicity of [FeII/H]=$-2.10$$\pm$0.02(stat.)$\pm0.07$(sys.) dex

compatible with $\omega$Cen's broad abundance distribution. However, given the
major overlap of this object's abundances with the bulk of all of the MW
components, this does not allow for a clear-cut distinction of the star's
origin. In contrast, our measurements of an enhancement in CN and its position
on the Na-strong locus of the Na-O anticorrelation render it conceivable that

dominated by the Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling and gas temperature fluctuations
caused by the first sources of radiation. While early efforts to model this
epoch relied on analytical techniques, the community quickly transitioned to
more expensive semi-numerical models. Here, we re-assess the viability of
simpler approaches that allow for rapid explorations of the vast astrophysical
parameter space. We propose a new analytical method to calculate the 21-cm
power spectrum based on the framework of the halo model. Both the
Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling and temperature fluctuations are described by
overlapping radiation flux profiles that include spectral red-shifting and
source attenuation due to look-back (light-cone) effects. The 21-cm halo model
is compared to the semi-numerical code 21cmFAST exhibiting generally good
agreement, i.e., the power spectra differ by less than a factor of three over a
large range of $k$-modes and redshifts. We show that the remaining differences
between the two methods are comparable to the expected variations from
modelling uncertainties associated with the abundance, bias, and accretion
rates of haloes. While these current uncertainties must be reduced in the
future, our work suggests that inference at acceptable accuracy will become
feasible with very efficient halo models of the cosmic dawn.

-- realizes a monomer-dimer model on the kagome lattice with a single-site
kinetic term. This can be interpreted as a $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory whose
dynamics is generated by monomer fluctuations. We obtain its phase diagram
using the numerical density matrix renormalization group method and find a
topological quantum liquid (TQL) as evidenced by multiple measures including
(i) a continuous transition between two featureless phases, (ii) a topological
entanglement entropy of $\ln 2$ as measured in various geometries, (iii)
degenerate topological ground states and (iv) the expected modular matrix from
ground state overlap. Next, we show that the TQL persists upon including
realistic, algebraically-decaying van der Waals interactions $V(r) \sim 1/r^6$
for a choice of lattice parameters. Moreover, we can directly access
topological loop operators, including the Fredenhagen-Marcu order parameter. We
show how these can be measured experimentally using a dynamic protocol,
providing a ``smoking gun'' experimental signature of the TQL phase. Finally,
we show how to trap an emergent anyon and realize different topological
boundary conditions, and we discuss the implications for exploring
fault-tolerant quantum memories.

planets at large separations to be rare. It is important to push towards
detections at smaller separations, the part of the parameter space containing
most planets. The performance of traditional methods for post-processing of
pupil-stabilized observations decreases at smaller separations, due to the
larger field-rotation required to displace a source on the detector in addition
to the intrinsic difficulty of higher stellar contamination. We developed a
method of extracting exoplanet signals that improves performance at small
angular separations. A data-driven model of the temporal behavior of the
systematics for each pixel can be created using reference pixels at a different
position, assuming the underlying causes of the systematics are shared across
multiple pixels. This is mostly true for the speckle pattern in high-contrast
imaging. In our causal regression model, we simultaneously fit the model of a
planet signal ""transiting"" over detector pixels and non-local reference
lightcurves describing a basis of shared temporal trends of the speckle pattern
to find the best fitting temporal model describing the signal. With our
implementation of a spatially non-local, temporal systematics model, called
TRAP, we show that it is possible to gain up to a factor of 6 in contrast at
close separations ($<3\lambda/D$) compared to a model based on spatial
correlations between images displaced in time. We show that better temporal
sampling resulting in significantly better contrasts. At short integration
times for $\beta$ Pic data, we increase the SNR of the planet by a factor of 4
compared to the spatial systematics model. Finally, we show that the temporal
model can be used on unaligned data which has only been dark and flat
corrected, without the need for further pre-processing.

extragalactic studies. Since spectroscopic redshifts require additional
telescope and human resources, millions of galaxies are known without
spectroscopic redshifts. Therefore, it is crucial to have methods for
estimating the redshift of a galaxy based on its photometric properties, the
so-called photo-$z$. We developed NetZ, a new method using a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict the photo-$z$ based on galaxy images, in
contrast to previous methods which often used only the integrated photometry of
galaxies without their images. We use data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program (HSC SSP) in five different filters as training data. The
network over the whole redshift range between 0 and 4 performs well overall and
especially in the high-$z$ range better than other methods on the same data. We
obtain an accuracy $|z_\text{pred}-z_\text{ref}|$ of $\sigma = 0.12$ (68%
confidence interval) with a CNN working for all galaxy types averaged over all
galaxies in the redshift range of 0 to $\sim$4. By limiting to smaller redshift
ranges or to Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), we find a further notable
improvement. We publish more than 34 million new photo-$z$ values predicted
with NetZ here. This shows that the new method is very simple and fast to
apply, and, importantly, covers a wide redshift range limited only by the
available training data. It is broadly applicable and beneficial to imaging
surveys, particularly upcoming surveys like the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
of Space and Time which will provide images of billions of galaxies with
similar image quality as HSC.

sources relative to the cluster centers, we find between 30% and 42% of COBRA
bent sources are outgoing and have passed through the cluster center, while
between 8% and 58% of COBRA bent sources are infalling. Although these sources
typically do not follow directly radial paths, the large population of outgoing
sources contrasts what is observed in low-z samples of bent sources and may
indicate that the intracluster medium is less dense in these high-z clusters.

on new secret interactions among electron and muon neutrinos from several
laboratory experiments. Our study indicates the presence of a strongly
interaction mode which implies a late-decoupling of the neutrinos just prior to
matter radiation equality. Using the degeneracy of the coupling strength with
other cosmological parameters, we explain the origin of this new mode as a
result of better fit to certain features in the CMB data. We find that if only
one or two of the three active neutrino flavors are interacting, then the
statistical significance of the strongly-interacting neutrino mode increases
substantially relative to the flavor-universal scenario. However, the central
value of the coupling strength for this interaction mode does not change by any
appreciable amount in the flavor-specific cases. We also briefly analyze a
scenario with more than three neutrino species of which only one is
self-interacting. In none of the cases, we find a large enough Hubble constant

protoplanetary disks, in particular around the water snowline. However, the
close proximity of the water snowline to the host star and water in the Earth's
atmosphere makes a direct detection of the water snowline in protoplanetary
disks challenging. Following earlier work on protostellar envelopes, the aim of
this research is to investigate the validity of HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$, as
tracers of the water snowline in protoplanetary disks, as HCO$^+$ is destroyed
by gas-phase water. Two small chemical networks are used to predict the HCO$^+$
abundance in a typical Herbig Ae disk. Subsequently, the corresponding emission
profiles are modelled for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$ $J=2-1$, which provides
the best balance between brightness and optical depth effects of the continuum
emission. The HCO$^+$ abundance jumps by two orders of magnitude just outside
the water snowline at 4.5 AU. We find that the emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and
HCO$^+$ is ring-shaped due to three effects: destruction of HCO$^+$ by
gas-phase water, continuum optical depth, and molecular excitation effects. The
presence of gas-phase water causes an additional drop of only $\sim$13% and 24%
in the center of the disk, for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$, respectively. For
the much more luminous outbursting source V883Ori, our models predict that the
effect of dust and excitation are not limiting if the snowline is located
outside $\sim$40 AU. Our analysis of ALMA observations of HCO$^+$ $J=3-2$ is
consistent with the water snowline located around 100 AU. The HCO$^+$ abundance
drops steeply around the water snowline, but dust and excitation can conceal
the drop in HCO$^+$ emission due to the water snowline. Therefore, locating the
water snowline with HCO$^+$ in Herbig disks is very difficult, but it is
possible for outbursting sources like V883Ori.

spectrum of Arcturus acquired with the GIANO-B echelle spectrograph as a
laboratory to define and calibrate an optimal line list and new diagnostic
tools to derive accurate stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Methods.
We inspected several hundred NIR atomic and molecular lines to derive
abundances of 26 different chemical species, including CNO, iron-group, alpha,
Z-odd, and neutron-capture elements. We then performed a similar analysis in
the optical using Arcturus VLT-UVES spectra. Results. Through the combined NIR

giant stars, based on the comparison of carbon (for the thermometer) and oxygen
(for the gravitometer) abundances, as derived from atomic and molecular lines.

Arcturus over the full 4800 - 24500 {\AA} spectral range and compared them with

origin of the compact round stellar structure, generally interpreted as the
bulge of the galaxy, but unusually off-set by $\simeq1$ kpc in projection from
the visual and the kinematic centres of both the star and the gas discs. We
argue that it is very unlikely that the putative bulge is in a co-planar orbit
in the disc plane, showing that such a configuration would be hardly compatible
with its smooth and regular spatial distribution, and, in case its mass is
above $10^8\,M_{\odot}$, also with the regular HI velocity field of NGC 5474.
Instead, if the putative bulge is in fact an early-type satellite galaxy
orbiting around NGC 5474, not only the off-set can be easily produced by
projection effects, but our simulations suggest that the gravitational
interaction between the two systems can explain also the warped HI distribution
of NGC 5474 and the formation of its loose spiral arms. As a by-product of the
simulations, we find that the peculiar over-density of old stars detected in
the south-west region of NGC 5474 may be explained with the interaction between
NGC 5474 and a smaller stellar system, unrelated to the putative bulge,

the aerodynamic characteristics of finite-aspect-ratio swept wings with a NACA

sweep angle ($\Lambda=0^{\circ}-45^{\circ}$) on the aerodynamic force
coefficients are examined for finite-aspect-ratio wings ($sAR=0.5$, 1, and 2)
over a wide range of angles of attack ($\alpha=0^{\circ}-30^{\circ}$). The
unsteady laminar separated flows exhibit complex aerodynamic characteristics
with respect to these parameters. The introduction of sweep enhances lift for
wings with low aspect ratios of $sAR=0.5$ and 1, due to the lift generated by
the vortical structures near the midspan. For these cases, the dependence of
drag coefficients on the sweep angle is less noticeable, particularly at lower
angles of attack. The lift-to-drag ratios for low-aspect-ratio wings increase
with the sweep angle. However, such favorable effects of sweep angle on the
lift coefficients and lift-to-drag ratios are not observed for wings with
higher aspect ratios, where the midspan effects are relatively weaker over the
wing span. The results herein provide a laminar aerodynamic characterization of
the low-aspect-ratio wings and complement the unsteady low-Reynolds-number

Nickel titanium, Ni50.28Ti49.36, was solution heat treated and characterized
using differential scanning calorimetry and Xenon Flash to determine
transformation temperature (78deg-C), latent heat (183 kJm-3), and thermal
conductivity in the Austenite and Martensite phases (12.92/12.64 Wm-1K-1). Four

composite solid-solid/solid-liquid PCM module (Ni50.28Ti49.36/1-octadecanol).
By using high-conductivity solid-solid PCMs, and eliminating the need for
encapsulants and conductivity enhancements, we are able to demonstrate a
1.73-3.38 times improvement in volumetric thermal capacity and a 2.03-3.21
times improvement in power density as compared to the conventional approaches.
These experimental results are bolstered by analytical models to explain the
observed heat transfer physics and reveal a 5.86 times improvement in thermal

Before starting classification, feature selection used to predict the

algorithms of decision trees used to predict the output and extract the
influential relationship between inputs and output. To make sure get the
highest accuracy, ensemble algorithm (Bagging) used to deploy four algorithms

probability distributions, are fundamental in statistics and machine learning
to characterize model robustness, detect out-of-distribution samples
(outliers), and protect against adversarial attacks. To be effective, these
measures should (i) account for the wide variety of models used in practice,
(ii) be computable for trained models or at least avoid modifying established
training procedures, (iii) forgo the use of data, which can expose them to the
same robustness issues and attacks as the underlying model, and (iv) be
followed by theoretical guarantees. These principles underly the framework
developed in this work, which expresses the credibility as a risk-fit
trade-off, i.e., a compromise between how much can fit be improved by
perturbing the model input and the magnitude of this perturbation (risk). Using
a constrained optimization formulation and duality theory, we analyze this
compromise and show that this balance can be determined counterfactually,
without having to test multiple perturbations. This results in an unsupervised,
a posteriori method of assigning prediction credibility for any (possibly

being alive at a specific time point. We develop a flexible Bayesian
semi-parametric predictive estimator for population inference when longitudinal
auxiliary information is known for the target population. We evaluate
sensitivity of the results to untestable assumptions and further compare our
approach to other methods used for population inference in a simulation study.
The proposed approach is motivated by 15-year longitudinal data from the Betula
longitudinal cohort study. We apply our approach to estimate lifespan
trajectories in episodic memory, with the aim to generalize findings to a
target population.

driven by reflected ions, perturbations that they generate, and nonlinear
amplification of the perturbations. Our analyses show that reflected ions
create modest magnetic enhancements upstream of the shock which evolve in a
nonlinear manner as they traverse the shock foot. They can transform into
proto-shocks that propagate at small angles to the magnetic field and towards
the bow shock. The nonstationary bow shock shows signatures of both reformation
and surface ripples. Our observations indicate that although shock reformation
occurs, the main shock layer never disappears. These observations are at high
plasma $\beta$, a parameter regime which has not been well explored by

the fact that a local control from one agent has limited impact on agents
distant from it, we exploit a novel spatial discount factor to reduce the
effect from remote agents, to expedite the training process and improve
scalability. Furthermore, a differentiable, learning-based communication
protocol is employed to foster the collaborations among neighboring agents. In

introduced during on-policy learning, we utilize an action smoothing factor to
stabilize the policy execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
develop PGSim, an efficient, high-fidelity powergrid simulation platform.
Experimental results in two microgrid setups show that the developed PowerNet

the set of the orders of vanishing elements, $\mathrm{Vo}_{p} (G)$ be the
subset of $ \mathrm{Vo}(G) $ consisting of those orders of vanishing elements
divisible by $p$ and $\mathrm{Vo}_{p'} (G) $ be the subset of $ \mathrm{Vo}(G)

Pacifi, Sanus and Spiga proved that if $ a $ is not a $ p $-power for all $
a\in \mathrm{Vo}(G)$, then $ G $ has a normal Sylow $ p $-subgroup. In another
article, the same authors also show that if if $ \mathrm{Vo}_{p'}(G) =\emptyset
$, then $ G $ has a normal nilpotent $ p $-complement. These results are
variations of the well known Ito-Michler and Thompson theorems. In this article
we study solvable groups such that $|\mathrm{Vo}_{p}(G)| = 1 $ and show that $
P' $ is subnormal. This is analogous to the work of Isaacs, Mor\'eto, Navarro
and Tiep where they considered groups with just one character degree divisible
by $ p $. We also study certain finite groups $G$ such that
$|\mathrm{Vo}_{p'}(G)| = 1 $ and we prove that $ G $ has a normal subgroup $ L
$ such that $ G/L $ a normal $ p $-complement and $ L $ has a normal $ p

Schaeffer Fry on character degrees with a few $p'$-character degrees.
Bubboloni, Dolfi and Spiga studied finite groups such that every vanishing
element is of order $ p^{m} $ for some integer $ m\geqslant 1 $. As a
generalization, we investigate groups such that $ \gcd(a,b)=p^{m} $ for some
integer $ m \geqslant 0 $, for all $ a,b\in \mathrm{Vo}(G) $. We also study
finite solvable groups whose irreducible characters vanish only on elements of

side has fixed preferences, termed priorities. Specifically, we ask which
priorities are such that the strategyproofness of deferred acceptance (DA) can
be recognized by agents unable to perform contingency reasoning, that is,
\emph{when is DA obviously strategyproof} (Li, 2017)?
  We answer this question by completely characterizing those priorities which
make DA obviously strategyproof (OSP). This solves an open problem of Ashlagi
and Gonczarowski, 2018. We find that when DA is OSP, priorities are either
acyclic (Ergin, 2002), a restrictive condition which allows priorities to only
differ on only two agents at a time, or contain an extremely limited cyclic
pattern where all priority lists are identical except for exactly two. We
conclude that, for stable matching mechanisms, the tension between
understandability (in the sense of OSP) and expressiveness of priorities is
very high.

Choosing specific localised forms for the free metric functions $H'(u)$

including time series, text, image, and video, has attracted increasing
interests of researchers from the data analytic community. In this paper, we
focus on a multivariate time series regression problem. Specifically, we aim to
learn mathematical mappings from multiple chronologically measured numerical
variables within a certain time interval S to multiple numerical variables of
interest over time interval T. Prior arts, including the multivariate
regression model, the Seq2Seq model, and the functional linear models, suffer
from several limitations. The first two types of models can only handle
regularly observed time series. Besides, the conventional multivariate
regression models tend to be biased and inefficient, as they are incapable of
encoding the temporal dependencies among observations from the same time
series. The sequential learning models explicitly use the same set of
parameters along time, which has negative impacts on accuracy. The
function-on-function linear model in functional data analysis (a branch of
statistics) is insufficient to capture complex correlations among the
considered time series and suffer from underfitting easily. In this paper, we
propose a general functional mapping that embraces the function-on-function
linear model as a special case. We then propose a non-linear
function-on-function model using the fully connected neural network to learn
the mapping from data, which addresses the aforementioned concerns in the
existing approaches. For the proposed model, we describe in detail the
corresponding numerical implementation procedures. The effectiveness of the
proposed model is demonstrated through the application to two real-world
problems.

the covariates, hoping that they adequately correct for confounding. However,
including every observed covariate in the adjustment runs the risk of including
`bad controls', variables that induce bias when they are conditioned on. The
problem is that we do not always know which variables in the covariate set are
safe to adjust for and which are not. To address this problem, we develop
Nearly Invariant Causal Estimation (NICE). NICE uses invariant risk
minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to learn a representation of the covariates that,
under some assumptions, strips out bad controls but preserves sufficient
information to adjust for confounding. Adjusting for the learned
representation, rather than the covariates themselves, avoids the induced bias

other bad controls, NICE performs better than adjusting for all the covariates.

driven by a Hawkes process. We are interested in the estimations of the
volatility function and of the jump function from discrete high-frequency
observations in a long time horizon which remained an open question until now.
First, we propose to estimate the volatility coefficient. For that, we
introduce a truncation function in our estimation procedure that allows us to
take into account the jumps of the process and estimate the volatility function
on a linear subspace of L2(A) where A is a compact interval of R. We obtain a
bound for the empirical risk of the volatility estimator, ensuring its
consistency, and then we study an adaptive estimator w.r.t. the regularity.
Then, we define an estimator of a sum between the volatility and the jump
coefficient modified with the conditional expectation of the intensity of the
jumps. We also establish a bound for the empirical risk for the non-adaptive
estimators of this sum, the convergence rate up to the regularity of the true
function, and an oracle inequality for the final adaptive estimator.Finally, we
give a methodology to recover the jump function in some applications. We
conduct a simulation study to measure our estimators' accuracy in practice and
discuss the possibility of recovering the jump function from our estimation
procedure.

multiple access (NOMA) into massive machine-type communications (mMTC) to
increase the uplink connectivity. Multiple transmit power levels are provided
at the user end to enable open-loop power control, which is absent from the
traditional uplink NOMA with the fixed transmit power. The basics of this
solution are firstly presented to analytically show the inherent performance
gain in terms of the average arrival rate (AAR). Then, a practical framework
based on a novel power map is proposed to associate a set of well-designed
transmit power levels with each geographical region for handling the no
instantaneous channel state information problem. Based on this framework, the
semi-grant-free (semi-GF) transmission with two practical protocols is
introduced to enhance the connectivity, which has higher AAR than both the
conventional grand-based and GF transmissions. When the number of active GF
devices in mMTC far exceeds the available resource blocks, the corresponding
AAR tends to zero. To solve this problem, user barring techniques are employed
into the semi-GF transmission to stable the traffic flow and thus increase the
AAR. Lastly, promising research directions are discussed for improving the
proposed networks.

investigate the directional nature of hydrophobic interactions. It means that
the hydrophobic interactions are dependent on the relative orientations as the
solutes tend to be aggregated in water. In H1w process, they are attracted to
approach each other in the specific direction with lower energy barrier until
their surfaces become contact. In H2s process, to maximize the hydrogen
bondings of water, the solutes are aggregated in the specific direction to
minimize the ratio of surface area to volume of them. Additionally, with
decreasing the separation between them, the short-range interactions between
the solutes become stronger. In addition, these can be demonstrated by the
calculated potential of mean force (PMF) using molecular dynamics simulation.
From this work, the hydrophobic driven model is proposed to understand the

well chosen perturbations of a state feedback law can yield new observability

the observability issues. We apply them on a case of systems with linear

cause serious injury to people and damage to property. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
Reachability is a formal method that verifies safety in multi-agent interaction
and provides a safety controller for collision avoidance. However, due to the
worst-case assumption on the cars future behaviours, reachability might result
in too much conservatism such that the normal operation of the vehicle is badly
hindered. In this paper, we leverage the power of trajectory prediction and
propose a prediction-based reachability framework to compute safety
controllers. Instead of always assuming the worst case, we cluster the car's
behaviors into multiple driving modes, e.g. left turn or right turn. Under each
mode, a reachability-based safety controller is designed based on a less
conservative action set. For online implementation, we first utilize the
trajectory prediction and our proposed mode classifier to predict the possible
modes, and then deploy the corresponding safety controller. Through simulations
in a T-intersection and an 8-way roundabout, we demonstrate that our
prediction-based reachability method largely avoids collision between two
interacting cars and reduces the conservatism that the safety controller brings
to the car's original operation.

mechanical and optoelectronic properties. Surface-catalyzed coupling of
halogenated sp-carbon-based molecular precursors represents a promising
bottom-up strategy to fabricate extended 2D carbon systems with engineered

on-surface synthesis. The formation of such 2D nanonetwork at its different
stages as a function of the annealing temperature after the deposition is
monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Raman spectroscopy and
combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-resolution STM
imaging and the high sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to the bond nature
provide a unique strategy to unravel the atomic-scale properties of sp-sp2
carbon nanostructures. We show that hybridization between the 2D carbon
nanonetwork and the underlying substrate states strongly affects its electronic
and vibrational properties, modifying substantially the density of states and
the Raman spectrum compared to the free standing system. This opens the way to
the modulation of the electronic properties with significant prospects in
future applications as active nanomaterials for catalysis, photoconversion and
carbon-based nanoelectronics.

shifted towards solid-state systems, which are much more practical for
applications. In particular, a new field has recently emerged that is concerned
with the study of quantum systems based on single spins localized near point
defects in crystalline solids. One such system is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
defect in diamond. Initially used as an experimental breadboard for testing
concepts of quantum physics and quantum computation, the NV defect was soon
proposed as a sensitive magnetometer, capable of detecting minute magnetic
fields, down to ultimate level of single spins. This atomic-sized magnetometer
can be used as a standalone sensor, or integrated into an imaging system
providing spatial resolution down to the atomic scale. Diamond-based
instruments thus offer new pathways to probe the magnetism of matter from the
mesoscale down to the nanoscale. This book chapter gives an overview of the
field of diamond-based magnetic sensing and imaging, with an emphasis on
already demonstrated applications of this technology. The chapter is divided
into three main sections. In Section 2, the underlying physics and methods of
diamond-based magnetometry are described. Section 3 is devoted to various
experimental implementations that employ this new class of sensors for magnetic
sensing and imaging. Finally, some recent applications are presented in Section

plausible alternative to the ubiquitous backpropagation algorithm for training

backward pass, DFA successfully trains state-of-the-art models such as
Transformers. On the other hand, it notoriously fails to train convolutional
networks. An understanding of the inner workings of DFA to explain these
diverging results remains elusive. Here, we propose a theory for the success of
DFA. We first show that learning in shallow networks proceeds in two steps: an
alignment phase, where the model adapts its weights to align the approximate
gradient with the true gradient of the loss function, is followed by a
memorisation phase, where the model focuses on fitting the data. This two-step
process has a degeneracy breaking effect: out of all the low-loss solutions in
the landscape, a network trained with DFA naturally converges to the solution
which maximises gradient alignment. We also identify a key quantity underlying
alignment in deep linear networks: the conditioning of the alignment matrices.
The latter enables a detailed understanding of the impact of data structure on
alignment, and suggests a simple explanation for the well-known failure of DFA
to train convolutional neural networks. Numerical experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR10 clearly demonstrate degeneracy breaking in deep non-linear networks and
show that the align-then-memorise process occurs sequentially from the bottom
layers of the network to the top.

informative features and patterns from languages. The two most successful
neural architectures are LSTM and transformers, used in large pretrained
language models such as BERT. While cross-lingual approaches are on the rise,
most current NLP techniques are designed and applied to English, and
less-resourced languages are lagging behind. In morphologically rich languages,
information is conveyed through morphology, e.g., through affixes modifying
stems of words. Existing neural approaches do not explicitly use the
information on word morphology. We analyse the effect of adding morphological
features to LSTM and BERT models. As a testbed, we use three tasks available in
many less-resourced languages: named entity recognition (NER), dependency
parsing (DP), and comment filtering (CF). We construct baselines involving LSTM
and BERT models, which we adjust by adding additional input in the form of part
of speech (POS) tags and universal features. We compare models across several
languages from different language families. Our results suggest that adding
morphological features has mixed effects depending on the quality of features
and the task. The features improve the performance of LSTM-based models on the
NER and DP tasks, while they do not benefit the performance on the CF task. For
BERT-based models, the morphological features only improve the performance on
DP when they are of high quality while not showing practical improvement when
they are predicted. Even for high-quality features, the improvements are less
pronounced in language-specific BERT variants compared to massively
multilingual BERT models. As in NER and CF datasets manually checked features
are not available, we only experiment with predicted features and find that
they do not cause any practical improvement in performance.

limit of the Keller and Rubinow model for Liesegang rings as introduced by
Hilhorst et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 135, 2009, pp. 107-132). The model is
characterized by a discontinuous reaction term which can be seen as an instance
of spatially distributed non-ideal relay hysteresis. In general, uniqueness of
solutions for such models is conditional on certain transversality conditions.
For the model studied here, we give an explicit description of the
precipitation boundary which gives rise to two scenarios for non-uniqueness,
which we term ""spontaneous precipitation"" and ""entanglement"". Spontaneous
precipitation can be easily dismissed by an additional, physically reasonable
criterion in the concept of weak solution. The second scenario is one where the
precipitation boundaries of two distinct solutions cannot be ordered in any
neighborhood of some point on their common precipitation boundary. We show that
for a finite, possibly short interval of time, solutions are unique. Beyond
this point, unique continuation is subject to a spatial or temporal
transversality condition. The temporal transversality condition takes the same
form that would be expected for a simple multicomponent semilinear ODE with
discontinuous reaction terms.

the need through utilizing event log data stored in information systems. By
extracting knowledge about the actual behavior of resources participating in
business processes from event logs, organizational models can be constructed,
which facilitate the analysis of the de facto grouping of human resources
relevant to process execution. Nevertheless, open research gaps remain to be
addressed when applying the state-of-the-art process mining to analyze resource

developing a novel framework built upon a richer definition of organizational
models coupling resource grouping with process execution knowledge. By
introducing notions of conformance checking for organizational models, the
framework allows effective evaluation of organizational models, and therefore
provides a foundation for analyzing and improving resource grouping based on
event logs. We demonstrate the feasibility of this framework by proposing an
approach underpinned by the framework for organizational model discovery, and
also conduct experiments on real-life event logs to discover and evaluate

decomposition of a unitary matrix $A$ with no eigenvalues equal to $\pm i$.
This decomposition factorizes $A$ as the product of an involutory matrix $S =
\operatorname{sign}(A) = A(A^2)^{-1/2}$ times a matrix $N = (A^2)^{1/2}$ with
spectrum contained in the open right half of the complex plane. Our iterations
rely on a recently discovered formula for the best (in the minimax sense)
unimodular rational approximant of the scalar function $\operatorname{sign}(z)
= z/\sqrt{z^2}$ on subsets of the unit circle. When $A$ has eigenvalues near
$\pm i$, the iterations converge significantly faster than Pad\'e iterations.
Numerical evidence indicates that the iterations are backward stable, with
backward errors often smaller than those obtained with direct methods. This
contrasts with other iterations like the scaled Newton iteration, which suffers
from numerical instabilities if $A$ has eigenvalues near $\pm i$. As an
application, we use our iterations to construct a stable spectral
divide-and-conquer algorithm for the unitary eigendecomposition.

efficiency and model generalization based on the invariance principles of
causality. Our proposal posits a meta-distributional scenario, where the data

solve the redundancy resolution problem: joint-space torque optimization for

the existing approaches, this paper provides the first solution (TOAUJ-based

Chandra observations of five $z>6.5$ quasars. By combining with archival
Chandra observations of six additional $z>6.5$ quasars, we perform a systematic
analysis on the X-ray properties of these earliest accreting supermassive black
holes (SMBHs). We measure the black hole masses, bolometric luminosities
($L_{\rm bol}$), Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), emission line
properties, and infrared luminosities ($L_{\rm IR}$) of these quasars using
infrared and sub-millimeter observations. Correlation analysis indicates that
the X-ray bolometric correction (the factor that converts from X-ray luminosity
to bolometric luminosity) decreases with increasing $L_{\rm bol}$, and that the
UV/optical-to-X-ray ratio, $\alpha_{\rm ox}$, strongly correlates with $L_{\rm
2500}$, and moderately correlates with $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ and blueshift of CIV
emission lines. These correlations are consistent with those found in lower-$z$
quasars, indicating quasar accretion physics does not evolve with redshift. We
also find that $L_{\rm IR}$ does not correlate with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ in these
luminous distant quasars, suggesting that the ratio of the SMBH growth rate and
their host galaxy growth rate in these early luminous quasars are different
from those of local galaxies. A joint spectral analysis of the X-ray detected
$z>6.5$ quasars yields an average X-ray photon index of $
\Gamma=2.32^{+0.31}_{-0.30}$, steeper than that of low-$z$ quasars. By
comparing it with the $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ relation, we conclude that the
steepening of $\Gamma$ for quasars at $z>6.5$ is mainly driven by their higher
Eddington ratios.

covering a wide frequency range from 0.7 to 4 GHz over a period of 5 months.
The magnetar exhibits significant temporal profile evolution over this period,
including the emergence of a new profile component with an inverted spectrum,
two distinct types of radio emission mode switching, detected during two
separate observations, and the appearance and disappearance of multiple
polarization modes. These various phenomena are likely a result of ongoing
reconfiguration of the plasma content and electric currents within the

we are viewing the magnetar at an angle of $\sim$99$^{\circ}$ from the spin
axis, and its magnetic and rotation axes are misaligned by $\sim$112$^{\circ}$.
While conducting these fits, we found the position angle swing had reversed

interpretability, with efficient distributed representations coming at the cost
of the loss of feature to dimension mapping. This implies that there is
obfuscation in the way concepts are captured in these embedding spaces. Its
effects are seen in many representations and tasks, one particularly
problematic one being in language representations where the societal biases,
learned from underlying data, are captured and occluded in unknown dimensions
and subspaces. As a result, invalid associations (such as different races and
their association with a polar notion of good versus bad) are made and
propagated by the representations, leading to unfair outcomes in different
tasks where they are used. This work addresses some of these problems

learning curves for evaluating and comparing the data scaling properties of two
neural networks (NNs) and two gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models
trained on four drug screening datasets. The learning curves are accurately
fitted to a power law model, providing a framework for assessing the data
scaling behavior of these predictors. The curves demonstrate that no single
model dominates in terms of prediction performance across all datasets and
training sizes, suggesting that the shape of these curves depends on the unique
model-dataset pair. The multi-input NN (mNN), in which gene expressions and
molecular drug descriptors are input into separate subnetworks, outperforms a

superior performance as compared with both NNs at the lower range of training

increasing the sample size is expected to further improve prediction scores of
both NNs. These observations demonstrate the benefit of using learning curves

understand who the blocker of the pull request is and nudge the appropriate
actor (author or reviewer(s)). The key novelty of Nudge is that it succeeds in
reducing pull request resolution time, while ensuring that developers perceive
the notifications sent as useful, at the scale of thousands of repositories. In
a randomized trial on 147 repositories in use at Microsoft, Nudge was able to
reduce pull request resolution time by 60% for 8,500 pull requests, when
compared to overdue pull requests for which Nudge did not send a notification.
Furthermore, developers receiving Nudge notifications resolved 73% of these
notifications as positive. We observed similar results when scaling up the
deployment of Nudge to 8,000 repositories at Microsoft, for which Nudge sent
210,000 notifications during a full year. This demonstrates Nudge's ability to
scale to thousands of repositories. Lastly, our qualitative analysis of a
selection of Nudge notifications indicates areas for future research, such as
taking dependencies among pull requests and developer availability into
account.

shared prediction model while keeping data locally on participating devices. In
this paper, we study a new model of multiple federated learning services at the
multi-access edge computing server. Accordingly, the sharing of CPU resources
among learning services at each mobile device for the local training process
and allocating communication resources among mobile devices for exchanging
learning information must be considered. Furthermore, the convergence
performance of different learning services depends on the hyper-learning rate
parameter that needs to be precisely decided. Towards this end, we propose a
joint resource optimization and hyper-learning rate control problem, namely
MS-FEDL, regarding the energy consumption of mobile devices and overall
learning time. We design a centralized algorithm based on the block coordinate
descent method and a decentralized JP-miADMM algorithm for solving the MS-FEDL
problem. Different from the centralized approach, the decentralized approach
requires many iterations to obtain but it allows each learning service to
independently manage the local resource and learning process without revealing
the learning service information. Our simulation results demonstrate the
convergence performance of our proposed algorithms and the superior performance
of our proposed algorithms compared to the heuristic strategy.

transferring models trained on one labeled source domain to another unlabeled
target domain. In this paper, we focus on UDA in visual emotion analysis for
both emotion distribution learning and dominant emotion classification.
Specifically, we design a novel end-to-end cycle-consistent adversarial model,
termed CycleEmotionGAN++. First, we generate an adapted domain to align the
source and target domains on the pixel-level by improving CycleGAN with a
multi-scale structured cycle-consistency loss. During the image translation, we
propose a dynamic emotional semantic consistency loss to preserve the emotion
labels of the source images. Second, we train a transferable task classifier on
the adapted domain with feature-level alignment between the adapted and target

complex and dynamic background. Thus motivated, in this paper we introduce an
improved proposal refinement module, Cascaded Regression-Align-Classification
(CRAC), which yields new state-of-the-art performances on many benchmarks.
  First, having observed that the offsets from box regression can serve as
guidance for proposal feature refinement, we design CRAC as a cascade of box
regression, feature alignment and box classification. The key is to bridge box
regression and classification via an alignment step, which leads to more
accurate features for proposal classification with improved robustness. To

gaseous protoplanetary discs with thermal diffusion, by means of
high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. We confirm that
thermal torques essentially depend on the offset between the planet and its
corotation, and find a good agreement with analytic estimates when this offset
is small compared to the size of the thermal disturbance. For larger offsets
that may be attained in discs with a large pressure gradient or a small thermal
diffusivity, thermal torques tend toward an asymptotic value broadly compatible
with results from a dynamical friction calculation in an unsheared medium. We
perform a convergence study and find that the thermal disturbance must be
resolved over typically 10 zones for a decent agreement with analytic
predictions. We find that the luminosity at which the net thermal torque
changes sign matches that predicted by linear theory within a few percents. Our
study confirms that thermal torques usually supersede Lindblad and corotation
torques by almost an order of magnitude for low mass planets. As we increase
the planetary mass, we find that the ratio of thermal torques to Lindblad and
corotation torques is progressively reduced, and that the thermal disturbance
is increasingly distorted by the horseshoe flow. Overall, we find that thermal
torques are dominant for masses up to an order of magnitude larger than
implemented in recent models of planetary population synthesis. We finally

method for conditional settings with class labels by creating a hypersphere for
each category and performing class-wise discrimination and update. In
experiments, we validate the effectiveness for both unconditional and
conditional generation on standard benchmarks, achieving the state of the art.

  informing intervention via fundamental diagrams",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Congestion; operational delays due to a vicious circle of
passenger-congestion and train-queuing; is an escalating problem for metro
systems because it has negative consequences from passenger discomfort to
eventual mode-shifts. Congestion arises due to large volumes of passenger
boardings and alightings at bottleneck stations, which may lead to increased
stopping times at stations and consequent queuing of trains upstream, further
reducing line throughput and implying an even greater accumulation of
passengers at stations. Alleviating congestion requires control strategies such
as regulating the inflow of passengers entering bottleneck stations. The
availability of large-scale smartcard and train movement data from day-to-day
operations facilitates the development of models that can inform such
strategies in a data-driven way. In this paper, we propose to model
station-level passenger-congestion via empirical passenger boarding-alightings
and train flow relationships, henceforth, fundamental diagrams (FDs). We
emphasise that estimating FDs using station-level data is empirically
challenging due to confounding biases arising from the interdependence of
operations at different stations, which obscures the true sources of congestion
in the network. We thus adopt a causal statistical modelling approach to
produce FDs that are robust to confounding and as such suitable to properly
inform control strategies. The closest antecedent to the proposed model is the
FD for road traffic networks, which informs traffic management strategies, for
instance, via locating the optimum operation point. Our analysis of data from
the Mass Transit Railway, Hong Kong indicates the existence of concave FDs at
identified bottleneck stations, and an associated critical level of
boarding-alightings above which congestion sets-in unless there is an
intervention.

for solving relatively straightforward control tasks, it remains an open
problem how to best incorporate planning into existing deep RL paradigms to
handle increasingly complex environments. One prominent framework, Model-Based
RL, learns a world model and plans using step-by-step virtual rollouts. This
type of world model quickly diverges from reality when the planning horizon
increases, thus struggling at long-horizon planning. How can we learn world
models that endow agents with the ability to do temporally extended reasoning?
In this work, we propose to learn graph-structured world models composed of

applications, such as pedestrian surveillance, vehicle counting, security
monitoring, etc. Active contour model (ACM) is one of the most widely used
image segmentation tools at present, but the existing methods only utilize the
local or global single feature information of image to minimize the energy
function, which is easy to cause false segmentations in IR images. In this
paper, we propose a multi-feature driven active contour segmentation model to
handle IR images with intensity inhomogeneity. Firstly, an especially-designed
signed pressure force (SPF) function is constructed by combining the global
information calculated by global average gray information and the local
multi-feature information calculated by local entropy, local standard deviation
and gradient information. Then, we draw upon adaptive weight coefficient
calculated by local range to adjust the afore-mentioned global term and local
term. Next, the SPF function is substituted into the level set formulation
(LSF) for further evolution. Finally, the LSF converges after a finite number
of iterations, and the IR image segmentation result is obtained from the
corresponding convergence result. Experimental results demonstrate that the
presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of precision
rate and overlapping rate in IR test images.

shallow-water waves limit. Even though this method was originally formulated
for shallow-water waves based on the conventional piston type wavemaker,
extending its use to deeper water conditions provides a more practical and
computationally cost efficient solution compared to other available numerical
wave absorption alternatives. For this sake, absorption of unidirectional
monochromatic waves in a semi-infinite flume by means of a static wall is
investigated theoretically and numerically. Moreover, implementation to a
practical wave-structure interaction application is investigated numerically
and experimentally. A phase-resolving numerical model based on the
Reynold-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is implemented using the open
source C++ toolbox OpenFOAM. The study presents the performance of the
static-boundary method, in a dimensionless manner, by limiting the depth at
which the active-absorption conventional-piston velocity profile is introduced;
as a function of incident wave conditions. Moreover, it is shown that the
performance of the static-boundary method can be significantly enhanced where
wave reflection was reduced to about half of that of the conventional setup in
deep-water conditions. Furthermore, the absorption depth is correlated to the
incident wave conditions; providing an optimization framework for the selection
of the proper dimensions of an absorbing wall. Finally, wave-structure
interaction experimental tests were conducted to validate the numerical model
performance; which shows an acceptable agreement between the model and the
experimental observations. The proposed limiter is straight forward to be
applied in pre-existing wave-structure interaction CFD solvers, without the
need of code modifications.

the paper addresses the problem of extinction of simulation codes and attempts
to understand their evolution and development within those frameworks. We show
that simulation codes of closed type develop to the level of creoles, becoming
local languages and standards of scientific centers and disappearing as their
few main developers leave, whereas codes of open types become universal
languages, imposing problem-solving patterns on the entire community and
crowding out other codes. The paper suggests that because of simulations'
reliance on tacit knowledge, practices entrenched in codes cannot be
exhaustively explicated or transmitted through writing alone; on the contrary,
the life cycle of a simulation code is determined by the life cycle of its
trading zone. We examine the extent to which both of these phenomena pose a
risk to the preservation of knowledge. Bearing upon intergenerational ethics,
we draw analogies between the pure intergenerational problem (PIP) and the
problem of preserving the knowledge implemented in simulation codes and
transmitting it to future generations. We argue that for the complete transfer
of knowledge, it is necessary to develop and maintain inhabitability and
sustainability of simulation trading zones in a controllable way, at least

selectivity using the Great Wall structures is presented in this paper. The
proposed structure comprises a container containing horizontal and vertical
channels enabling dividable injection of water, and a cross-gap FSS. The
novelty of the design lies in its switchability among four different operating
states by injecting water or not into the water channels. When the container is
empty, the structure acts as a polarization-intensive FSS with a -0.42 dB
insertion loss passband at 3.75 GHz. When the horizontal channel is filled with
water and there is no water in the vertical channel, this structure can be used
as an FSR with single polarization selectivity. The FSR with -10 dB absorption
band from 6.8 GHz to 18.8 GHz only allows certain polarized electromagnetic
(EM) waves to pass at 3.1 GHz with an insertion loss of -0.78 dB, while another
polarized EM wave cannot pass. When the container is full of water, the
structure operates as an absorber with a reflection band below the absorption
band, where neither of polarization EM waves can transmit. Besides, a
reconfigurable water-based FSR automatic control system is built to achieve
state switching and temperature constancy of the water within the container.
Ultimately, a prototype of the presented design is fabricated, simulated and
measured to verify the feasibility. This work has potential application in
radome design to realize the out-of-band RCS reduction.

noninvasiveness. The number of chest X-ray images has skyrocketed, but reading
chest X-rays still have been manually performed by radiologists, which creates
huge burnouts and delays. Traditionally, radiomics, as a subfield of radiology
that can extract a large number of quantitative features from medical images,
demonstrates its potential to facilitate medical imaging diagnosis before the
deep learning era. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end framework,
ChexRadiNet, that can utilize the radiomics features to improve the abnormality
classification performance. Specifically, ChexRadiNet first applies a
light-weight but efficient triplet-attention mechanism to classify the chest
X-rays and highlight the abnormal regions. Then it uses the generated class
activation map to extract radiomic features, which further guides our model to
learn more robust image features. After a number of iterations and with the
help of radiomic features, our framework can converge to more accurate image
regions. We evaluate the ChexRadiNet framework using three public datasets: NIH
ChestX-ray, CheXpert, and MIMIC-CXR. We find that ChexRadiNet outperforms the
state-of-the-art on both disease detection (0.843 in AUC) and localization

quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater
Houston, Texas. In this paper, we determined human mobility using
pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal
study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total
travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip
distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent
disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular,
there was a strong negative correlation ($\rho$ = -0.90) between a traveler's
estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility
adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets
experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of
distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The
findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the
mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The
study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and

has recently been an increasing interest in computationally-efficient learning
methods, e.g., quantization, pruning and channel gating. However, most existing
techniques cannot adapt to different tasks quickly. In this work, we advocate a
holistic approach to jointly train the backbone network and the channel gating
which enables dynamical selection of a subset of filters for more efficient

meta-learning approach to jointly learn good meta-initializations for both
backbone networks and gating modules, by making use of the model similarity
across learning tasks on different nodes. In this way, the learnt meta-gating
module effectively captures the important filters of a good meta-backbone
network, based on which a task-specific conditional channel gated network can
be quickly adapted, i.e., through one-step gradient descent, from the
meta-initializations in a two-stage procedure using new samples of that task.
The convergence of the proposed federated meta-learning algorithm is
established under mild conditions. Experimental results corroborate the
effectiveness of our method in comparison to related work.

Here, we demonstrate using a toy model for a colloid-linker mixture that linker
flexibility plays a key role in determining both phase behavior and structure
of the mixture. We fix the linker length and systematically vary its bending
stiffness to span the flexible, semiflexible, and rigid regimes. At fixed

We correlate and attribute this qualitatively different behavior to undesirable

oscillatory flat plate solution in the limit of large sphere radius and the
Stokes flow solutions in the incompressible limit of infinite sound speed. As a
companion analytical result, the steady second order acoustic streaming flow is
obtained. This streaming flow is driven by the Reynolds stress tensor that
arises from the axisymmetric first order primary flow around such a rigid

relationships (i.e. links) among users (i.e. nodes) given their existing
positive and negative interactions observed. Most of the prior efforts are
devoted to learning node embeddings with graph neural networks (GNNs), which
preserve the signed network topology by message-passing along edges to
facilitate the downstream link prediction task. Nevertheless, the existing
graph-based approaches could hardly provide human-intelligible explanations for
the following three questions: (1) which neighbors to aggregate, (2) which path
to propagate along, and (3) which social theory to follow in the learning
process. To answer the aforementioned questions, in this paper, we investigate
how to reconcile the \textit{balance} and \textit{status} social rules with
information theory and develop a unified framework, termed as Signed Infomax
Hyperbolic Graph (\textbf{SIHG}). By maximizing the mutual information between
edge polarities and node embeddings, one can identify the most representative
neighboring nodes that support the inference of edge sign. Different from
existing GNNs that could only group features of friends in the subspace, the
proposed SIHG incorporates the signed attention module, which is also capable
of pushing hostile users far away from each other to preserve the geometry of
antagonism. The polarity of the learned edge attention maps, in turn, provide
interpretations of the social theories used in each aggregation. In order to
model high-order user relations and complex hierarchies, the node embeddings
are projected and measured in a hyperbolic space with a lower distortion.
Extensive experiments on four signed network benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed SIHG framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in
signed link prediction.

device-independently by using the Hardy and Cabello-Liang-Li (CLL) nonlocality
relations is provided in the two parties - two measurements per party - two
outcomes per measurement (2-2-2) scenario. For the Hardy nonlocality, it is
revealed that for a given amount of nonlocality signified by a particular
non-zero value of the Hardy parameter, the amount of Hardy-certifiable
randomness is not unique, unlike the way the amount of certifiable randomness
is related to the CHSH nonlocality. This is because any specified non-maximal
value of Hardy nonlocality parameter characterises a set of quantum extremal
distributions. Then this leads to a range of certifiable amounts of randomness
corresponding to a given Hardy parameter. On the other hand, for a given amount
of CLL-nonlocality, the certifiable randomness is unique, similar to that for
the CHSH nonlocality. Furthermore, the tightness of our analytical treatment
evaluating the respective guaranteed bounds for the Hardy and CLL relations is
demonstrated by their exact agreement with the Semi-Definite-Programming based
computed bounds. Interestingly, the analytically evaluated maximum achievable
bounds of both Hardy and CLL-certified randomness have been found to be
realisable for non-maximal values of the Hardy and CLL nonlocality parameters.
In particular, we have shown that even close to the maximum 2 bits of
CLL-certified randomness can be realised from non-maximally entangled pure
two-qubit states corresponding to small values of the CLL nonlocal parameter.
This, therefore, clearly illustrates the quantitative incommensurability

the transverse and longitudinal Hall geometry magnetization relaxation
measurements, which agrees with pinning sites and Joule heating effect at probe

required huge computational cost restricts the applicable parameter region of
coherent search. In this work, we propose and examine a new method to select
candidates, which reduces the cost of coherent search by following-up only the
selected candidates. As a first step, we consider an idealized situation in
which only a single-detector having 100\% duty cycle is available and its
detector noise is approximated by the stationary Gaussian noise. Also, we
assume the signal has no spindown and the polarization angle, the inclination
angle, and the initial phase are fixed to be $\psi=0$, $\cos\iota=1$, and
$\phi_0=0$, and they are treated as known parameters. We combine several
methods: 1) the short-time Fourier transform with the re-sampled data such that
the Earth motion for the source is canceled in some reference direction, 2) the
excess power search in the Fourier transform of the time series obtained by
picking up the amplitude in a particular frequency bin from the short-time
Fourier transform data, and 3) the deep learning method to further constrain

screened and the ideal Gaussian chain statistics is recovered. The experimental
fact that linear viscoelasticity of unentangled polymers can be well described
by the Rouse model is naively considered as due to this screening effect.
Although various theoretical models are based on the screening effect and the
screening effect is believed to be reasonable, the screening effect cannot be
fully justified on a solid theoretical basis. In this work, we study the
screening effect by utilizing a simple dumbbell type model. We perform
simulations for dumbbell systems in which particles interact via the Gaussian
soft-core potential. We show that, if the density of dumbbells is high, the
Gaussian soft-core interaction is actually screened and the static structures
are well described by the ideal model without Gaussian soft-core interaction.
We also show that the relaxation moduli of interacting dumbbell systems
approximately coincide to those of the non-interacting dumbbell systems. In the
low density systems, we observe the deviations from the ideal non-interacting
systems. For example, the relaxation moduli become relatively broad. However,
the relaxation moduli of such systems can be decomposed into the relaxation
modes by the Gaussian soft-core interaction and the bond. The bond relaxation
mode can be successfully described by a single Maxwell relaxation with
effective relaxation strength and time. Our results support a naive use of the
Rouse model to analyze unentangled polymer melts.

Inexact Gradient (RHIG), and analyze its performance by dynamic regrets in
terms of the temporal variation of the environment and the prediction errors.
RHIG only considers at most $W$-step-ahead predictions to avoid being misled by
worse predictions in the longer term. The optimal choice of $W$ suggested by
our regret bounds depends on the tradeoff between the variation of the

silo. The time-averaged flow fields of various parameters like velocity, area
fraction, pressure, shear stress etc, obtained from coarse-graining technique
are presented for both the above-mentioned cases. A modified Beverloo scaling
is reported for the flow discharging through the lateral orifice. The dynamic
friction is found to increase with an increase in the addition of dumbbells.
This resulted in a decrease in the flow rate through a lateral orifice with the
addition of dumbbells. Self-similar velocity profiles are observed for mixtures
for the whole range of lateral orifice widths studied. The flow rate decreases
with an increase in the inter-orifice distance L/d for the multiple orifice
case. The velocity profile and flow fields revealed an interaction zone between
the two orifices at small L/d which is almost absent when the orifices are wide
apart. This interaction zone or flow through an orifice influenced by the
presence of an adjacent orifice is the reason for a higher velocity above each

symmetry breaking are mountaining, and to catch up with this fast development,
new notions of global symmetry are introduced. Among them, the higher-form
symmetry, whose symmetry charges are spatially extended, can be used to
describe topologically ordered phases as the spontaneous breaking of the
symmetry, and consequently unify the unconventional and conventional phases
under the same conceptual framework. However, such conceptual tools have not
been put into quantitative test except for certain solvable models, therefore
limiting its usage in the more generic quantum manybody systems. In this work,
we study Z2 higher-form symmetry in a quantum Ising model, which is dual to the
global (0-form) Ising symmetry. We compute the expectation value of the Ising
disorder operator, which is a non-local order parameter for the higher-form
symmetry, analytically in free scalar theories and through unbiased quantum
Monte Carlo simulations for the interacting fixed point in (2+1)d. From the
scaling form of this extended object, we confirm that the higher-form symmetry
is indeed spontaneously broken inside the paramagnetic, or quantum disordered
phase (in the Landau sense), but remains symmetric in the ferromagnetic/ordered
phase. At the Ising critical point, we find that the higher-form symmetry is
also spontaneously broken, even though the 0-form symmetry is preserved. We
discuss examples where both the global 0-form symmetry and the dual higher-form
symmetry are preserved, in systems with a codimension-1 manifold of gapless
points in momentum space. These results provide non-trivial working examples of
higher-form symmetry operators, including the first computation of one-form
order parameter in an interacting conformal field theory, and open the avenue
for their generic implementation in quantum many-body systems.

  analysis using satellite data",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Index insurance has been promoted as a promising solution for reducing
agricultural risk compared to traditional farm-based insurance. By linking
payouts to a regional factor instead of individual loss, index insurance
reduces monitoring costs, and alleviates the problems of moral hazard and
adverse selection. Despite its theoretical appeal, demand for index insurance
has remained low in many developing countries, triggering a debate on the
causes of the low uptake. Surprisingly, there has been little discussion in
this debate about the experience in the United States. The US is an unique case
as both farm-based and index-based products have been available for more than
two decades. Furthermore, the number of insurance zones is very large, allowing
interesting comparisons over space. As in developing countries, the adoption of
index insurance is rather low -- less than than 5\% of insured acreage. Does
this mean that we should give up on index insurance?
  In this paper, we investigate the low take-up of index insurance in the US
leveraging a field-level dataset for corn and soybean obtained from satellite
predictions. While previous studies were based either on county aggregates or
on relatively small farm-level dataset, our satellite-derived data gives us a
very large number of fields (close to 1.8 million) comprised within a large
number of index zones (600) observed over 20 years. To evaluate the suitability
of index insurance, we run a large-scale simulation comparing the benefits of
both insurance schemes using a new measure of farm-equivalent risk coverage of
index insurance. We make two main contributions. First, we show that in our
simulations, demand for index insurance is unexpectedly high, at about 30\% to
40\% of total demand. This result is robust to relaxing several assumptions of
the model and to using prospect theory instead of expected utility.

critical and non-trivial task, more attention is required for brownfield IIoT
systems. This is a consequence of long life cycles of their legacy devices
which were initially designed without considering security and IoT
connectivity, but they are now becoming more connected and integrated with
emerging IoT technologies and messaging communication protocols. Deploying
today's methodologies and solutions in brownfield IIoT systems is not viable,
as security solutions must co-exist and fit these systems requirements. This
necessitates a realistic standardized IIoT testbed that can be used as an
optimal format to measure the credibility of security solutions of IIoT
networks, analyze IIoT attack landscapes and extract threat intelligence.
Developing a testbed for brownfield IIoT systems is considered a significant
challenge as these systems are comprised of legacy, heterogeneous devices,
communication layers and applications that need to be implemented holistically
to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a new generic end-to-end
IIoT security testbed, with a particular focus on the brownfield system and
provide details of the testbed's architectural design and the implementation
process. The proposed testbed can be easily reproduced and reconfigured to
support the testing activities of new processes and various security scenarios.
The proposed testbed operation is demonstrated on different connected devices,
communication protocols and applications. The experiments demonstrate that this
testbed is effective in terms of its operation and security testing. A

learning have only focused on gradient descent with a sufficient small learning
rate or even gradient flow (infinitesimal learning rate). Such researches,
however, have neglected a reasonably large learning rate applied in most
practical applications. In this work, we characterize the implicit bias effect
of deep linear networks for binary classification using the logistic loss in
the large learning rate regime, inspired by the seminal work by Lewkowycz et
al. [26] in a regression setting with squared loss. They found a learning rate
regime with a large stepsize named the catapult phase, where the loss grows at
the early stage of training and eventually converges to a minimum that is
flatter than those found in the small learning rate regime. We claim that
depending on the separation conditions of data, the gradient descent iterates
will converge to a flatter minimum in the catapult phase. We rigorously prove
this claim under the assumption of degenerate data by overcoming the difficulty
of the non-constant Hessian of logistic loss and further characterize the
behavior of loss and Hessian for non-separable data. Finally, we demonstrate
that flatter minima in the space spanned by non-separable data along with the
learning rate in the catapult phase can lead to better generalization
empirically.

increasing interest as they allow the production of bulk nanostructured
materials with superior mechanical and functional properties. However, because
of mechanically induced grain boundary migration, the achievable grain size
reduction is not indefinite but tends to stagnate once sufficient strain has
been applied. Consequently, addition of solute elements or second phase
particles offers the possibility to access the true nanocrystalline regime. Due
to their low solubility and high mobility, interstitial elements are extremely
effective at subduing boundary migration. Herein the effect of carbon on grain
refinement and the resulting mechanical properties are summarized. As carbon
may not only be added as graphite but could also be introduced in other forms
or as allotropes such as nanotubes, nanodiamonds, or carbides, the respective
advantages and problems associated with it are the center of discussion.
Independent of the strategy used, strength levels hardly achievable with other
alloying elements can be obtained. Moreover, as carbon does not have a negative
effect on grain boundary cohesion, despite the enormous strength levels even
ductility and toughness can be widely maintained.

technique with its computation task subjected to sequential task dependency,
which is critical for video stream processing and other intelligent
applications. To minimize energy consumption per IoT device while limiting task
processing delay, task offloading strategy, communication resource, and
computation resource are optimized jointly under both slow and fast fading
channels. In slow fading channels, an optimization problem is formulated, which
is non-convex and involves one integer variable. To solve this challenging
problem, we decompose it as a one-dimensional search of task offloading
decision problem and a non-convex optimization problem with task offloading
decision given. Through mathematical manipulations, the non-convex problem is
transformed to be a convex one, which is shown to be solvable only with the
simple Golden search method. In fast fading channels, optimal online policies
depending on instant channel state are derived even though they are entangled.
In addition, it is proved that the derived policy will converge to the offline
policy when channel coherence time is low, which can help to save extra
computation complexity. Numerical results verify the correctness of our

showed a puzzling discrepancy between the distribution of the electron density
in the interlayer region obtained by X-ray diffraction data and that computed
by DFT, even adopting DFT functionals that should properly include vdW effects.
Such a discrepancy could indicate a partial failure of state-of-the-art DFT
approaches in describing the weak interlayer interactions of TiS2 and,
possibly, of similar systems too. In order to shed light on this issue, we have
carried out simulations based on different DFT functionals, basically
confirming the mentioned discrepancy with the experimental findings.
Subsequently, we have tried to reproduce the experimental interlayer electronic
density deformation both by changing the parameters characterizing the rVV10
DFT functional (in such a way to artificially modify the strength of the vdW
interactions at short or long range), and also by adopting a modified
pseudopotential for Sulfur atoms, involving d orbitals. The latter approach
turns out to be particularly promising. In fact, using this novel, more
flexible pseudopotential, we obtain not only an electronic density deformation
closer to the experimental profile, but also a better estimate of the
interlayer binding energy. Interestingly, this improvement in the theoretical
DFT description is not limited to TiS2 but also applies to other similar
layered systems involving S atoms, such as TaS2 , HfS2 , and MoS2 .

be able to test whether that assumption actually holds true or not. Various
tests have been proposed in the literature for this problem. To the best of our
knowledge, none of them has been implemented in R. The focus of this paper is
the implementation of several well-known tests for elliptical symmetry together
with some recent tests. We demonstrate the testing procedures with a real data
example.

derivatives of the electric field strength. The quality of density functional
theory (DFT) prediction of molecular multipole moments thus characterizes
errors in modeling the electron density itself, as well as the performance in
describing molecules interacting with external electric fields. However, only
the lowest non-zero moment is translationally invariant, making the higher
order moments origin-dependent. Therefore, instead of using the $3 \times 3$
quadrupole moment matrix, we utilize the translationally invariant $3 \times 3$
matrix of second cumulants (or spatial variances) of the electron density as
the quantity of interest (denoted by $\mathcal{K}$). The principal components
of ${\mathcal{K}}$ are the square of the spatial extent of the electron density
along each axis. A benchmark dataset of the prinicpal components of
${\mathcal{K}}$ for 100 small molecules at the coupled cluster singles and
doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) at the complete basis set (CBS)

The performance of 47 popular and recent density functionals is assessed
against this Var213 dataset. Several functionals, especially double hybrids,
and also SCAN and SCAN0 yield reliable second cumulants, although some modern,
empirically parameterized functionals yield more disappointing performance. The
H and Be atoms in particular are challenging for nearly all methods, indicating
that future functional development could benefit from inclusion of their
density information in training or testing protocols.

labeled datasets, the performance of fully-supervised person re-identification
(Person Re-ID) has been improved significantly in recent years. However, these
models trained on a single dataset usually suffer from considerable performance
degradation when applied to videos of a different camera network. To make
Person Re-ID systems more practical and scalable, several cross-dataset domain
adaptation methods have been proposed, which achieve high performance without
the labeled data from the target domain. However, these approaches still
require the unlabeled data of the target domain during the training process,
making them impractical. A practical Person Re-ID system pre-trained on other
datasets should start running immediately after deployment on a new site
without having to wait until sufficient images or videos are collected and the
pre-trained model is tuned. To serve this purpose, in this paper, we
reformulate person re-identification as a multi-dataset domain generalization
problem. We propose a multi-dataset feature generalization network (MMFA-AAE),
which is capable of learning a universal domain-invariant feature
representation from multiple labeled datasets and generalizing it to `unseen'
camera systems. The network is based on an adversarial auto-encoder to learn a
generalized domain-invariant latent feature representation with the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions across multiple
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. Our MMFA-AAE approach not only outperforms most of the domain
generalization Person Re-ID methods, but also surpasses many state-of-the-art
supervised methods and unsupervised domain adaptation methods by a large

post-processing have never been optimized during training due to several
problems. No gradient is received by the lengths so they cannot be learned
during back-propagation. The median-filtering inserted in the models also
causes block in gradient flowing and the smoothing process misleads the model
by ignoring errors. To resolve these problems, we provide different channels of
features smoothed to different extents along with the original feature, so the
model can optimize the weights while cognizing all the errors. We then use a
linear layer to integrate the results and produce a linear combination. We
further design the soft-median function to dredge the gradient flow. The
proposed framework is called Soft-Median Choice (SMC). Experiments show that
the SMC block not only automatically smooths the features based on the training
set, but also forces the model to extract common features shared by all the
frames of a sound event. The performance of the proposed method outperforms the

to such an extent that one can distinguish sub-Newtonian, Newtonian, galactic,
extragalactic and cosmological terms. The last of these dominates at the
largest length scale of the model, where superfluid vacuum induces an
asymptotically Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker-type spacetime, which

the discrepancy between measurements of the Hubble constant using different

galactic rotation curves, and also why their profiles can vary depending on the
galaxy. It also makes a number of predictions about the behaviour of gravity at
larger galactic and extragalactic scales. We demonstrate how the behaviour of
rotation curves varies with distance from a gravitating center, growing from an
inner galactic scale towards a metagalactic scale: a squared orbital velocity's
profile crosses over from Keplerian to flat, and then to non-flat. The
asymptotic non-flat regime is thus expected to be seen in the outer regions of

multiple scenes / levels from the same task, and has become essential for many
generalization applications. However, the inclusion of multiple scenes leads to
an increase in sample variance for policy gradient computations, often
resulting in suboptimal performance with the direct application of traditional
methods (e.g. PPO, A3C). One strategy for variance reduction is to consider
each scene as a distinct Markov decision process (MDP) and learn a joint value
function dependent on both state (s) and MDP (M). However, this is non-trivial
as the agent is usually unaware of the underlying level at train / test times
in multi-scene RL. Recently, Singh et al. [1] tried to address this by
proposing a dynamic value estimation approach that models the true joint value
function distribution as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In this paper, we
argue that the error between the true scene-specific value function and the
predicted dynamic estimate can be further reduced by progressively enforcing
sparse cluster assignments once the agent has explored most of the state space.
The resulting agents not only show significant improvements in the final reward
score across a range of OpenAI ProcGen environments, but also exhibit increased
navigation efficiency while completing a game level.

the ICO of two thermalizing channels to exhibit how the mechanism works, and
show that the working substance can be cooled or heated albeit it undergoes
thermal contacts with reservoirs of the same temperature. Moreover, we
construct a single cycle of the ICO refrigerator based on the Maxwell's demon
mechanism, and evaluate its performance by measuring the work consumption and
the heat energy extracted from the low-temperature reservoir. Unlike classical
refrigerators in which the coefficient of performance (COP) is perversely
higher the closer the temperature of the high-temperature and low-temperature
reservoirs are to each other, the ICO refrigerator's COP is always bounded to
small values due to the non-unit success probability in projecting the
ancillary qubit to the preferable subspace. To enhance the COP, we propose and
experimentally demonstrate a general framework based on the density matrix
exponentiation (DME) approach, as an extension to the ICO refrigeration. The
COP is observed to be enhanced by more than three times with the DME approach.
Our work demonstrates a new way for non-classical heat exchange, and paves the
way towards construction of quantum refrigerators on a quantum system.

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies a new design of the optimization algorithm for training
deep learning models with a fixed architecture of the classification network in
a continual learning framework. The training data is non-stationary and the
non-stationarity is imposed by a sequence of distinct tasks. We first analyze a
deep model trained on only one learning task in isolation and identify a region
in network parameter space, where the model performance is close to the
recovered optimum. We provide empirical evidence that this region resembles a
cone that expands along the convergence direction. We study the principal
directions of the trajectory of the optimizer after convergence and show that
traveling along a few top principal directions can quickly bring the parameters
outside the cone but this is not the case for the remaining directions. We
argue that catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning setting can be
alleviated when the parameters are constrained to stay within the intersection
of the plausible cones of individual tasks that were so far encountered during
training. Based on this observation we present our direction-constrained
optimization (DCO) method, where for each task we introduce a linear
autoencoder to approximate its corresponding top forbidden principal
directions. They are then incorporated into the loss function in the form of a
regularization term for the purpose of learning the coming tasks without
forgetting. Furthermore, in order to control the memory growth as the number of
tasks increases, we propose a memory-efficient version of our algorithm called
compressed DCO (DCO-COMP) that allocates a memory of fixed size for storing all
autoencoders. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm performs favorably
compared to other state-of-art regularization-based continual learning methods.

simultaneously best match users' mutual preferences. Intuitively, the mutual
preferences might be affected by a few key attributes that users like or
dislike. Meanwhile, the interactions between users' attributes and their key
attributes are also important for key attributes selection. Motivated by these
observations, in this paper we propose a novel reinforced random convolutional

non-adjacent features to capture their interaction information and learn
feature embeddings of key attributes to make the final recommendation.
Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning based strategy to integrate with
the random CNN component to select salient attributes to form the candidate set
of key attributes. We evaluate the proposed RRCN against a number of both
baselines and the state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world datasets, and

Here, we show that for different alloy compositions of WS2(1-x)Se2x this trend
may be significantly affected by the alloy content and we demonstrate that the
sample with the highest Se ratio presents a strongly reduced effect. The
highest micro-PL intensity is found for bilayer WS2(1-x)Se2x (x = 0.8) with a
decrease of its maximum value by only a factor of 2 when passing from mono- to
bi-layer. To better understand this factor and explore the layer-dependent band
structure evolution of WS2(1-x)Se2x, we performed a nano-angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy study coupled with first-principles calculations. We
find that the high micro-PL value for bilayer WS2(1-x)Se2x (x = 0.8) is due to
the overlay of direct and indirect optical transitions. This peculiar high PL
intensity in WS2(1-x)Se2x opens the way for spectrally tunable light-emitting

of previous methods has been limited to datasets with little variation in
position, scale and saliency of the foreground object. As a consequence, we
find that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity
possessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance
pipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction

introduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through
a neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial
transformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular

then amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward.
The proposed agent does not require any supervision on human stroke-data and
successfully handles variations in foreground object attributes, thus,
producing much higher quality canvases for the CUB-200 Birds and Stanford
Cars-196 datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the further efficacy of our method
on complex datasets with multiple foreground object instances by evaluating an

constant, the functions of the mass dependence on the baryonic chemical
potential have regions of ambiguity which leads to a phase transition in
non-strange quark matter with an abrupt change in the baryon number density. We
show that within the framework of the NJL model, the hypothesis on the absolute

combinator which axiomatizes the directional derivative. Important models of
Cartesian differential categories include classical differential calculus of
smooth functions and categorical models of the differential $\lambda$-calculus.
However, Cartesian differential categories cannot account for other interesting
notions of differentiation of a more discrete nature such as the calculus of
finite differences. On the other hand, change action models have been shown to
capture these examples as well as more ""exotic"" examples of differentiation.
But change action models are very general and do not share the nice properties
of Cartesian differential categories. In this paper, we introduce Cartesian
difference categories as a bridge between Cartesian differential categories and
change action models. We show that every Cartesian differential category is a
Cartesian difference category, and how certain well-behaved change action
models are Cartesian difference categories. In particular, Cartesian difference
categories model both the differential calculus of smooth functions and the
calculus of finite differences. Furthermore, every Cartesian difference
category comes equipped with a tangent bundle monad whose Kleisli category is
again a Cartesian difference category.

by the procedure of image denoising. We suggest that the RO property should be
utilized and the decimation should be avoided in image restoration. To achieve
this, we propose a new framework comprised of two modules, i.e., the RO
decomposition and RO reconstruction. The RO decomposition is developed to
decompose a corrupted image into the RO components and residual. This is
achieved by successively applying RO projections to the image or its residuals
to extract the RO components. The RO projections, based on neural networks,
extract the closest RO component of an image. The RO reconstruction is aimed to
reconstruct the important information, respectively from the RO components and
residual, as well as to restore the image from this reconstructed information.
Experimental results on four tasks, i.e., noise-free image super-resolution
(SR), realistic image SR, gray-scale image denoising, and color image
denoising, show that the method is effective and efficient for image
restoration, and it delivers superior performance for realistic image SR and
color image denoising.

applying various schemes to model spatial and temporal visual information
effectively. To better understand the current progress of appearance-based
action recognition, we provide a comprehensive review of recent achievements in
this area. In particular, we summarise and discuss several dozens of related
research papers, which can be roughly divided into four categories according to
different appearance modelling strategies. The obtained categories include 2D
convolutional methods, 3D convolutional methods, motion representation-based
methods, and context representation-based methods. We analyse and discuss
representative methods from each category, comprehensively. Empirical results
are also summarised to better illustrate cutting-edge algorithms. We conclude
by identifying important areas for future research gleaned from our

computationally intensive, especially for large machine learning models such as

practical, computationally efficient encryption based protocol for federated
deep learning, where the key pairs are collaboratively generated without the
help of a third party. By quantization of the model parameters on the clients
and an approximated aggregation on the server, the proposed method avoids
encryption and decryption of the entire model. In addition, a threshold based
secret sharing technique is designed so that no one can hold the global private
key for decryption, while aggregated ciphertexts can be successfully decrypted
by a threshold number of clients even if some clients are offline. Our
experimental results confirm that the proposed method significantly reduces the

such claims hinge upon a conflation of Leibnizian notions of bounded infinity

We exploit an axiomatic framework for infinitesimal analysis called SPOT

the states of the two nodes prior to the interaction. The efficiency of a
population protocol is measured in terms of both time (which is the number of
interactions until the nodes collectively have a valid output) and the number
of possible states of nodes used by the protocol. By convention, we consider
the parallel time cost, which is the time divided by $n$.

a Keplerian disk, the line profile variability suggests that the broad emission
line region is likely more complex. The continuum polarization of Mrk 1018 is
low; it is not higher in the current faint state compared to the past bright
state, confirming that dust obscuration is not the mechanism at the origin of
the change of look. The polarization profile of the H$\alpha$ line is
asymmetric with no rotation of the polarization angle, which possibly reveals
line formation in a polar outflow. Alternatively, the polarization profile may

reconstruct a source genome from an assembly graph built from a set of reads
(short strings sequenced from the genome). A notion of genome assembly solution
is that of an arc-covering walk of the graph. Since assembly graphs admit many
solutions, the goal is to find what is definitely present in all solutions, or
what is safe. Most practical assemblers are based on heuristics having at their
core unitigs, namely paths whose internal nodes have unit in-degree and
out-degree, and which are clearly safe. The long-standing open problem of
finding all the safe parts of the solutions was recently solved [RECOMB 2016]
yielding a 60% increase in contig length. This safe and complete genome
assembly algorithm was followed by other works improving the time bounds, as
well as extending the results for different notions of assembly solution. But
it remained open whether one can be complete also for models of genome assembly
of practical applicability.
  In this paper we present a universal framework for obtaining safe and
complete algorithms which unify the previous results, while also allowing for
easy generalisations to assembly problems including many practical aspects.
This is based on a novel graph structure, called the hydrostructure of a walk,
which highlights the reachability properties of the graph from the perspective
of the walk. The hydrostructure allows for simple characterisations of the
existing safe walks, and of their new practical versions. Almost all of our
characterisations are directly adaptable to optimal verification algorithms,
and simple enumeration algorithms. Most of these algorithms are also improved
to optimality using an incremental computation procedure and a previous optimal
algorithm of a specific model.

GAN-based semantic image synthesis models. We propose to randomly warp object
shapes in the semantic label maps used as an input to the generator. The local
shape discrepancies between the warped and non-warped label maps and images
enable the GAN to learn better the structural and geometric details of the
scene and thus to improve the quality of generated images. While benchmarking
the augmented GAN models against their vanilla counterparts, we discover that
the quantification metrics reported in the previous semantic image synthesis
studies are strongly biased towards specific semantic classes as they are
derived via an external pre-trained segmentation network. We therefore propose
to improve the established semantic image synthesis evaluation scheme by
analyzing separately the performance of generated images on the biased and
unbiased classes for the given segmentation network. Finally, we show strong
quantitative and qualitative improvements obtained with our augmentation
scheme, on both class splits, using state-of-the-art semantic image synthesis

asymmetry of the Universe. The lepton asymmetry is produced in interactions of
$N_{2,3}$ (with masses in the GeV region) at temperatures below the sphaleron
freeze out $ T \lesssim 130$ GeV and can enhance the cosmological production of
dark matter (DM) sterile neutrinos $N_1$ (with the mass of the keV scale)
happening at $T \sim 200$ MeV due to active-sterile neutrino mixing. This
asymmetry can be generated in freeze-in, freeze-out, or later in decays of
heavy neutral leptons. In this work, we address the question of the magnitude
of the late-time asymmetry (LTA) generated by the heavy neutral leptons
$N_{2,3}$ during their freeze-in and freeze-out, leaving the decays for later
work. We study how much of this asymmetry can survive down to the lower
temperatures relevant for the sterile neutrino DM creation. We find that this
LTA could result in the production of a sizeable fraction of dark matter. We
also examine a role played by magnetic fields and the Abelian chiral anomaly in
the generation of LTA, not accounted for in the previous studies. We argue that
the production of LTA can be increased significantly and make an estimate of
the influence of this effect.

attention for their many remarkable experimental properties, and the promise
that they hold for realising elusive states of matter in the laboratory. We
propose that these systems can, in fact, be used as a robust quantum simulation
platform that enables the study of strongly correlated physics and topology in
quantum materials. Among the features that make these materials a versatile
toolbox are the tunability of their properties through readily accessible
external parameters such as gating, straining, packing and twist angle; the
feasibility to realize and control a large number of fundamental many-body
quantum models relevant in the field of condensed-matter physics; and finally,
the availability of experimental readout protocols that directly map their rich
phase diagrams in and out of equilibrium. This general framework makes it
possible to robustly realize and functionalize new phases of matter in a
modular fashion, thus broadening the landscape of accessible physics and
holding promise for future technological applications.

to a general control synthesis setting. We present an algorithm that uses a
demonstrator (typically given by a trajectory optimizer) to automatically
synthesize feedback controllers for steering ordinary differential equations
into a goal set. The resulting feedback control law switches between the
demonstrations that it uses as reference trajectories which results in a hybrid
closed loop system. In comparison to the direct use of trajectory optimization
as a control law, for example, in the form of model predictive control, this
allows for a much simpler and more efficient implementation of the controller.
The synthesis algorithm comes with rigorous convergence and optimality results,
and computational experiments confirm its efficiency.

  Segmentation","13 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  It has been widely recognized that the success of deep learning in image
segmentation relies overwhelmingly on a myriad amount of densely annotated
training data, which, however, are difficult to obtain due to the tremendous
labor and expertise required, particularly for annotating 3D medical images.
Although self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great potential to address
this issue, most SSL approaches focus only on image-level global consistency,
but ignore the local consistency which plays a pivotal role in capturing
structural information for dense prediction tasks such as segmentation. In this
paper, we propose a PriorGuided Local (PGL) self-supervised model that learns
the region-wise local consistency in the latent feature space. Specifically, we
use the spatial transformations, which produce different augmented views of the
same image, as a prior to deduce the location relation between two views, which
is then used to align the feature maps of the same local region but being
extracted on two views. Next, we construct a local consistency loss to minimize
the voxel-wise discrepancy between the aligned feature maps. Thus, our PGL
model learns the distinctive representations of local regions, and hence is
able to retain structural information. This ability is conducive to downstream
segmentation tasks. We conducted an extensive evaluation on four public
computerized tomography (CT) datasets that cover 11 kinds of major human organs
and two tumors. The results indicate that using pre-trained PGL model to
initialize a downstream network leads to a substantial performance improvement
over both random initialization and the initialization with global
consistency-based models. Code and pre-trained weights will be made available

show that the evaluation of the statistical performance of the quality measures

to classification problems that aim at recognizing audio instances of sound
classes, which have no available training data but only semantic side
information. In this paper, we address zero-shot learning by employing factored
linear and nonlinear acoustic-semantic projections. We develop factored linear
projections by applying rank decomposition to a bilinear model, and use
nonlinear activation functions, such as tanh, to model the non-linearity
between acoustic embeddings and semantic embeddings. Compared with the prior
bilinear model, experimental results show that the proposed projection methods
are effective for improving classification performance of zero-shot learning in
audio classification.

outskirts of spiral galaxies. In this letter, using about 0.2 million stars
selected from the LAMOST data and combining precise photometry and parallaxes
from the Gaia DR2, we have constructed a two-dimensional foreground dust
reddening map towards the M31 and M33 region ($111.2{\deg} {\le} gl {\le}
136.2{\deg}, -36.5{\deg} {\le} gb {\le} -16.5{\deg}$). The map has a typical
spatial resolution of about 12 arc-minute and precision of 0.01 mag. The
complex structure of dust clouds towards the M31 is revealed. By carefully
removing the foreground extinction from the dust reddening map of Schlegel et
al. (1998), we thus have obtained a residual map to study dust distributions in
the outskirts of M31 and M33. A large amount of dust is detected in the M31
halo out to a distance of over 100 kpc. Dust in the M31 disk is found to extend
out to about 2.5 times its optical radius, whose distribution is consistent
with either an exponential disk of scale length of 7.2 kpc or two disks with
scale length of 11.1 kpc within its optical radius and 18.3 kpc beyond its
optical radius. Dust in the disk of M33 is also found to extend out to about
2.5 times its optical radius, its distribution beyond one optical radius is
consistent with an exponential disk of scale length of 5.6 kpc. Our results
provide new clues on the distributions and cycling of dust in galaxies.

of disentangled data representations. We propose augmenting the original deep
restricted kernel machine formulation for kernel PCA by orthogonality
constraints on the latent variables to promote disentanglement and to make it
possible to carry out optimization without first defining a stabilized
objective. After illustrating an end-to-end training procedure based on a
quadratic penalty optimization algorithm with warm start, we quantitatively
evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness in disentangled feature learning.
We demonstrate on four benchmark datasets that this approach performs similarly
overall to $\beta$-VAE on a number of disentanglement metrics when few training
points are available, while being less sensitive to randomness and
hyperparameter selection than $\beta$-VAE. We also present a deterministic
initialization of Constr-DRKM's training algorithm that significantly improves
the reproducibility of the results. Finally, we empirically evaluate and
discuss the role of the number of layers in the proposed methodology, examining
the influence of each principal component in every layer and showing that
components in lower layers act as local feature detectors capturing the broad
trends of the data distribution, while components in deeper layers use the
representation learned by previous layers and more accurately reproduce
higher-level features.

interpolation between real and complex enumerative geometries via tropical

extended by G\""ottsche and Schroeter in the case of rational curves.
  In this paper, we study the polynomial behavior of coefficients of these

polynomials in the Newton polygon of the curves under enumeration, when one
fixes the genus of the latter. This provides a somehow surprising resurgence,
in some sort of dual setting, of the so-called node polynomials and G\""ottsche

suggest phenomenons in complex enumerative geometry that have not been studied

  In the particular case of rational curves, we extend our polynomiality
results by including the extra parameter $s$ recording the number of $\psi$
classes. Contrary to the polynomiality with respect to $ \Delta$, the one with
respect to $s$ may be expected from considerations on Welschinger invariants in
real enumerative geometry. This pleads in particular in favor of a geometric

hierarchical temporal structure of auditory events. Although rhythm processing
has been addressed in the context of predictive coding, the properties of the
oscillatory response in different cortical areas is still not clear. We
explored the oscillatory properties of the neural response to rhythmic
incongruence and explored the cross-frequency coupling between multiple
frequencies to provide links between the concepts of predictive coding and
rhythm perception. We designed an experiment to investigate the neural response
to rhythmic deviations in which the tone either arrived earlier than expected
or the tone in the same metrical position was omitted. These two manipulations
modulate the rhythmic structure differently, with the former creating a larger
violation of the general structure of the musical stimulus than the latter.
Both deviations resulted in an MMN response, whereas only the rhythmic deviant
resulted in a subsequent P3a. Rhythmic deviants due to the early occurrence of
a tone, but not omission deviants, elicited a late high gamma response (60-80
Hz) at the end of the P3a over the left frontal region, which, interestingly,
correlated with the P3a amplitude over the same region and was also nested in
theta oscillations. The timing of the elicited high-frequency gamma
oscillations related to rhythmic deviation suggests that it might be related to
the update of the predictive neural model, corresponding to the temporal
structure of the events in higher-level cortical areas.

long-range correlated quantum state known as the Kondo screening cloud. While a
macroscopic number of particles clearly take part in forming this extended
structure, assessing the number of truly entangled degrees of freedom requires
a careful analysis of the relevant many-body wavefunction. For this purpose, we
examine the natural single-particle orbitals that are eigenstates of the
single-particle density (correlation) matrix for the ground state of two
quantum impurity problems: the interacting resonant level model (IRLM) and the
single impurity Anderson model (SIAM). As a simple and general probe for
few-body versus many-body character we consider the rate of exponential decay
of the correlation matrix eigenvalues towards inactive (fully empty or filled)
orbitals. We find that this rate remains large in the physically most relevant
region of parameter space, implying a few-body character. Genuine many-body
correlations emerge only when the Kondo temperature becomes exponentially
small, for instance near a quantum critical point. In addition, we demonstrate
that a simple numerical diagonalization of the few-body problem restricted to
the Fock space of the most correlated orbitals converges exponentially fast
with respect to the number of orbitals, to the true ground state of the IRLM.
We also show that finite size effects drastically affect the correlation
spectrum, shedding light on an apparent paradox arising from previous studies
on short chains.

whose coefficients can easily be computed from two features extracted from the

better physical treatment of convective energy transport in 3D models when

The 3D log(g) corrections are most significant for T_eff < 18000 K, reaching up
to -0.20 dex at log(g) = 8.0. However, in this low effective temperature range,
the surface gravity determined from the spectroscopic technique can also be
significantly affected by the treatment of the neutral van der Waals line
broadening of helium and by non-ideal effects due to the perturbation of helium
by neutral atoms. Thus, by removing uncertainties due to 1D convection, our
work showcases the need for improved description of microphysics for DB and DBA

available in other languages as well as the synthetic audio from a
text-to-speech (TTS) engine. Our experiments demonstrate that transfer learning
from a multilingual model, using a post-ASR text-to-text mapping and synthetic
audio deliver additive improvements, allowing us to bootstrap a model for a new
language with a fraction of the data that would otherwise be needed. The best
system achieved a 46% relative word error rate (WER) reduction compared to the
monolingual baseline, among which 25% relative WER improvement is attributed to
the post-ASR text-to-text mappings and the TTS synthetic data.

nonlinear mechanics of individual biopolymers and a summary of constitutive
models for the nonlinear elasticity of biopolymer gels. We next show that the
simple 3-chain model can give predictions that well fit the shear experiments
of some biopolymer gels, including the effects of strain-stiffening and
negative normal stress. We then review continuum models for the transmission of
internal active forces that are induced by a spherically contracting cell
embedded in a three-dimensional biopolymer gel. Various scaling regimes for the
decay of cell-induced displacements are identified for linear isotropic and
anisotropic materials, and for biopolymer gels with nonlinear
compressive-softening and strain-stiffening elasticity, respectively. After
that, we present (using an energetic approach) the generic and unified
continuum theory proposed in [Ben-Yaakov, Soft Matter, 2015, 11, 1412] about
how the transmission of forces in the biogel matrix can mediate long-range

phase of quantum matter, can be achieved by inducing superconductivity in
topological materials. In search of such topological superconductors, certain
topological insulators (like, Bi$_2$Se$_3$) were successfully turned into
superconductors by metal-ion (Cu, Pd, Sr, Nb etc. ) intercalation.
Superconductivity could be induced in topological materials through applying
pressure as well. for example, a pressure-induced superconducting phase was
found in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. However, in all such cases, no
conclusive signature of topological superconductivity was found. In this
review, we will discuss about another novel way of inducing superconductivity
in a non-superconducting topological material -- by creating a mesoscopic
interface on the material with a non-superconducting, normal metallic tip where
the mesoscopic interface becomes superconducting. Such a phase is now known as
a tip-induced superconducting (TISC) phase. This was first seen in 2014 on
Cd$_3$As$_2$ at IISER Mohali, India. Following that, a large number of other
topological materials were shown to display TISC. Since the TISC phase emerges
only at a confined region under a mesoscopic point contact, traditional bulk
tools for characterizing superconductivity cannot be employed to detect/confirm
such a phase. On the other hand, such a point contact geometry is ideal for
probing the possible existence of a temperature and magnetic field dependent
superconducting energy gap and a temperature and magnetic field dependent
critical current. We will review the details of the experimental signatures
that can be used to prove the existence of superconductivity even when the
""text-book"" tests for detecting superconductivity cannot be performed. Then, we
will review different systems where a TISC phase could be realized.

performed quite well, most of them estimate depth maps at a fixed resolution
using plane sweep volumes with a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane, which
requires densely sampled planes for desired accuracy and therefore is difficult
to achieve high resolution depth maps. In this paper we introduce a
coarseto-fine depth inference strategy to achieve high resolution depth. This
strategy estimates the depth map at coarsest level, while the depth maps at
finer levels are considered as the upsampled depth map from previous level with
pixel-wise depth residual. Thus, we narrow the depth searching range with
priori information from previous level and construct new cost volumes from the
pixel-wise depth residual to perform depth map refinement. Then the final depth
map could be achieved iteratively since all the parameters are shared between
different levels. At each level, the self-attention layer is introduced to the
feature extraction block for capturing the long range dependencies for depth
inference task, and the cost volume is generated using similarity measurement
instead of the variance based methods used in previous work. Experiments were

analytical study of gravitational waves emitted by localized perfect fluid
sources. It is assumed these perfect fluids are such that it is possible to
define small parameters for asymptotic expansions. Asymptotic expansions in
this approach are called post-Minkowskian and post-Newtonian expansions. By
plugging these expansions into the Einstein field equation, post-Minkowskian
and post-Newtonian equations are obtained. The usual methods for solving these
equations are to use the retarded and Poisson integrals. However, they cannot
provide solutions up to any arbitrary order in these cases because of their
divergence. In fact, these divergences motivated Blanchet and Damour to employ
a new approach to solve the post-Minkowskian and post-Newtonian equations. They
obtained the general solutions by means of a specific process of analytic
continuation. These solutions have some unknown terms that if one determines,
the gravitational field is described everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A matching
procedure, which depends deeply on analytic continuation, is used to determine
these unknown terms.

approximation theorem, we first formulate the problem explicitly, which boils
down to determining the interpolation weights and high-order approximation

by analyzing the local geometry of the input point cloud. The proposed method
can be interpreted by the explicit formulation, and thus is more

that work only for a pre-defined and fixed upsampling factor, the proposed
framework only requires a single neural network with one-time training to
handle various upsampling factors within a typical range, which is highly
desired in real-world applications. In addition, we propose a simple yet
effective training strategy to drive such a flexible ability. In addition, our
method can handle non-uniformly distributed and noisy data well. Extensive

Following that, AI ethics underwent a practical turn, but without deviating
from the principled approach and the many shortcomings associated with it. This
paper proposes a different approach. It defines four basic AI virtues, namely
justice, honesty, responsibility and care, all of which represent specific
motivational settings that constitute the very precondition for ethical
decision making in the AI field. Moreover, it defines two second-order AI
virtues, prudence and fortitude, that bolster achieving the basic virtues by
helping with overcoming bounded ethicality or the many hidden psychological
forces that impair ethical decision making and that are hitherto disregarded in
AI ethics. Lastly, the paper describes measures for successfully cultivating

  Causally Ordered Mediators",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Causal mediation analysis concerns the pathways through which a treatment
affects an outcome. While most of the mediation literature focuses on settings
with a single mediator, a flourishing line of research has examined settings
involving multiple mediators, under which path-specific effects (PSEs) are
often of interest. We consider estimation of PSEs when the treatment effect
operates through K(\geq1) causally ordered, possibly multivariate mediators. In
this setting, the PSEs for many causal paths are not nonparametrically
identified, and we focus on a set of PSEs that are identified under Pearl's
nonparametric structural equation model. These PSEs are defined as contrasts
between the expectations of 2^{K+1} potential outcomes and identified via what
we call the generalized mediation functional (GMF). We introduce an array of
regression-imputation, weighting, and ""hybrid"" estimators, and, in particular,
two K+2-robust and locally semiparametric efficient estimators for the GMF. The
latter estimators are well suited to the use of data-adaptive methods for
estimating their nuisance functions. We establish the rate conditions required
of the nuisance functions for semiparametric efficiency. We also discuss how
our framework applies to several estimands that may be of particular interest
in empirical applications. The proposed estimators are illustrated with a
simulation study and an empirical example.

care, feeding and conducive environment. To manage future uncertainty related
to life expectancy, various insurance institutions have resolved to come up
with financial instruments that are indexed-linked to the longevity of the
population. These new instrument is known as longevity bonds. In this article,
we present a novel classical Vasicek one factor affine model in modelling zero
coupon longevity bond price (ZCLBP) with financial and mortality risk. The
interest rate r(t) and the stochastic mortality of the constructed model are
dependent but with uncorrelated driving noises. The model is presented in a
linear state-space representation of the contiuous-time infinite horizon and
used Kalman filter for its estimation. The appropriate state equation and
measurement equation derived from our model is used as a method of pricing a
longevity bond in a financial market. The empirical analysis results show that
the unobserved instantaneous interest rate shows a mean reverting behaviour in
the U.S. term structure. The zero-coupon bonds yields are used as inputs for
the estimation process. The results of the analysis are gotten from the monthly
observations of U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds from December, 1992 to January,
1993. The empirical evidence indicates that to model properly the historical
mortality trends at different ages, both the survival rate and the yield data
are needed to achieve a satisfactory empirical fit over the zero coupon
longevity bond term structure. The dynamics of the resulting model allowed us
to perform simulation on the survival rates, which enables us to model
longevity risk.

the first step utilizes a convolutional autoencoder to extract the latent
features from the whole available dataset. The second step performs source
localization via an encoder multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on a limited
labeled portion of the dataset. The proposed approach has been validated on the
public dataset SwllEx-96 Event S5. The result shows the framework has appealing
accuracy and robustness on the unseen data, especially when the number of data

  Application to Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Geochemical processes in subsurface reservoirs affected by microbial activity
change the material properties of porous media. This is a complex
biogeochemical process in subsurface reservoirs that currently contains strong
conceptual uncertainty. This means, several modeling approaches describing the
biogeochemical process are plausible and modelers face the uncertainty of
choosing the most appropriate one. Once observation data becomes available, a
rigorous Bayesian model selection accompanied by a Bayesian model
justifiability analysis could be employed to choose the most appropriate model,
i.e. the one that describes the underlying physical processes best in the light
of the available data. However, biogeochemical modeling is computationally very
demanding because it conceptualizes different phases, biomass dynamics,
geochemistry, precipitation and dissolution in porous media. Therefore, the
Bayesian framework cannot be based directly on the full computational models as
this would require too many expensive model evaluations. To circumvent this
problem, we suggest performing both Bayesian model selection and justifiability
analysis after constructing surrogates for the competing biogeochemical models.
Here, we use the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion. We account for the
approximation error in the Bayesian analysis by introducing novel correction
factors for the resulting model weights. Thereby, we extend the Bayesian
justifiability analysis and assess model similarities for computationally
expensive models. We demonstrate the method on a representative scenario for
microbially induced calcite precipitation in a porous medium. Our extension of
the justifiability analysis provides a suitable approach for the comparison of
computationally demanding models and gives an insight on the necessary amount
of data for a reliable model performance.

  Communication",,,,,"cs.IT cs.AI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a deep learning (DL) framework for the optimization of the
resource allocation in multi-channel cellular systems with device-to-device
(D2D) communication is proposed. Thereby, the channel assignment and discrete
transmit power levels of the D2D users, which are both integer variables, are
optimized to maximize the overall spectral efficiency whilst maintaining the
quality-of-service (QoS) of the cellular users. Depending on the availability
of channel state information (CSI), two different configurations are
considered, namely 1) centralized operation with full CSI and 2) distributed
operation with partial CSI, where in the latter case, the CSI is encoded
according to the capacity of the feedback channel. Instead of solving the
resulting resource allocation problem for each channel realization, a DL
framework is proposed, where the optimal resource allocation strategy for
arbitrary channel conditions is approximated by deep neural network (DNN)
models. Furthermore, we propose a new training strategy that combines
supervised and unsupervised learning methods and a local CSI sharing strategy
to achieve near-optimal performance while enforcing the QoS constraints of the
cellular users and efficiently handling the integer optimization variables
based on a few ground-truth labels. Our simulation results confirm that
near-optimal performance can be attained with low computation time, which
underlines the real-time capability of the proposed scheme. Moreover, our
results show that not only the resource allocation strategy but also the CSI
encoding strategy can be efficiently determined using a DNN. Furthermore, we
show that the proposed DL framework can be easily extended to communications
systems with different design objectives.

sensor data, is an important problem with applications across industry and
defense. While classification algorithms continue to improve, they often
require more training data than is available or they do not transfer well to
settings not represented in the training set. These problems are mitigated by
transfer learning (TL), where knowledge gained in a well-understood source
domain is transferred to a target domain of interest. In this context, the
target domain could represents a poorly-labeled dataset, a different sensor, or
an altogether new set of classes to identify.
  While TL for classification has been an active area of machine learning (ML)
research for decades, transfer learning within a deep learning framework
remains a relatively new area of research. Although deep learning (DL) provides
exceptional modeling flexibility and accuracy on recent real world problems,
open questions remain regarding how much transfer benefit is gained by using DL
versus other ML architectures. Our goal is to address this shortcoming by
comparing transfer learning within a DL framework to other ML approaches across
transfer tasks and datasets. Our main contributions are: 1) an empirical
analysis of DL and ML algorithms on several transfer tasks and domains
including gene expressions and satellite imagery, and 2) a discussion of the
limitations and assumptions of TL for aided target recognition -- both for DL
and ML in general. We close with a discussion of future directions for DL
transfer.

maximal efficiency is studied as a function of the non-radiative recombination

single junction solar cells, with a possible efficiency improvement of 10%

real-world applications, especially for e-commerce companies. To retrieve
appropriate responses for users, it is necessary to compute the matching
degrees between candidate responses and users' queries with historical dialogue
utterances. As the contexts are usually much longer than responses, it is thus
necessary to expand the responses (usually short) with richer information.
Recent studies on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in query expansion for search engines, hence we consider
expanding response using PRF information. However, existing PRF approaches are
either based on heuristic rules or require heavy manual labeling, which are not
suitable for solving our task. To alleviate this problem, we treat the PRF
selection for response expansion as a learning task and propose a reinforced
learning method that can be trained in an end-to-end manner without any human
annotations. More specifically, we propose a reinforced selector to extract
useful PRF terms to enhance response candidates and a BERT-based response
ranker to rank the PRF-enhanced responses. The performance of the ranker serves
as a reward to guide the selector to extract useful PRF terms, which boosts the
overall task performance. Extensive experiments on both standard benchmarks and
commercial datasets prove the superiority of our reinforced PRF term selector
compared with other potential soft or hard selection methods. Both case studies
and quantitative analysis show that our model is capable of selecting
meaningful PRF terms to expand response candidates and also achieving the best
results compared with all baselines on a variety of evaluation metrics. We have
also deployed our method on online production in an e-commerce company, which
shows a significant improvement over the existing online ranking system.

the standard Bell scenario but display nonlocality after local filtering.
However, there exist entangled states for which all measurement statistics can
be described via a local hidden variable model even after local filtering. In
this work we consider the scenario that measurement outcomes and settings of
Alice can influence measurements of Bob in subsequent time steps (and vice
versa), however, there is no signaling among them for measurements at the same
time step. We show that in this scenario states that only display local
statistics after local filtering remain local even when considering the
complete statistics of arbitrary sequences and therefore no advantage can be
gained by performing longer sequences in this scenario. We first determine the
extreme points of the polytope defined by the no-signaling conditions within
the same time step and the arrow-of-time constraints. Based on these results we
introduce a notion of locality and provide a complete representation of the
corresponding local polytope in terms of inequalities in the simplest scenario.
These results imply that in the scenario considered here there is no
nonlocality beyond hidden nonlocality. We further propose a device-dependent
Schmidt number witness and we compare our finding to known local models in the
sequential scenario.

shortens training time while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. In this

computationally efficient plant models. Our previous work has shown that the
classical compartmentalization model reduction approach for distillation
columns can be enhanced by replacing parts of the system of equations by
artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on offline solved solutions to
improve computational performance. In real-life applications, the absence of a
high-fidelity model for data generation can, however, prevent the deployment of
this approach. Therefore, we propose a method that utilizes solely plant
measurement data, starting from a small initial data set and then continuously
adapting to newly measured data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is
examined in silico for a distillation column from literature. To this end, we
first adjust our reduced hybrid mechanistic/data-driven modeling approach that
originally builds on compartmentalization to a stage-aggregation procedure,
tailoring it for the application within the adaptive learning framework.
Second, we apply an adaptive learning algorithm that trains the ANNs replacing
the stationary stage-to-stage calculations on newly available data. We apply
the adaptive learning of the hybrid model within a regulatory NMPC framework
and conduct closed-loop simulations. We demonstrate that by using the proposed
method, the control performance can be steadily improved over time compared to
a non-adaptive approach while being real-time applicable. Moreover, we show
that the performance when using either a model trained on excessive amounts of
offline generated data or the original high-fidelity model can be approached in
the limit.

with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from

with a wide variety of applications, such as approximating the permanent, and
pre-conditioning linear systems to make them more numerically stable. We study
the power and limitations of quantum algorithms for these problems.
  We provide quantum implementations of two classical (in both senses of the
word) methods: Sinkhorn's algorithm for matrix scaling and Osborne's algorithm
for matrix balancing. Using amplitude estimation as our main tool, our quantum
implementations both run in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{mn}/\varepsilon^4)$ for
scaling or balancing an $n \times n$ matrix (given by an oracle) with $m$
non-zero entries to within $\ell_1$-error $\varepsilon$. Their classical
analogs use time $\tilde O(m/\varepsilon^2)$, and every classical algorithm for
scaling or balancing with small constant $\varepsilon$ requires $\Omega(m)$
queries to the entries of the input matrix. We thus achieve a polynomial
speed-up in terms of $n$, at the expense of a worse polynomial dependence on
the obtained $\ell_1$-error $\varepsilon$. We emphasize that even for constant
$\varepsilon$ these problems are already non-trivial (and relevant in
applications).
  Along the way, we extend the classical analysis of Sinkhorn's and Osborne's
algorithm to allow for errors in the computation of marginals. We also adapt an
improved analysis of Sinkhorn's algorithm for entrywise-positive matrices to
the $\ell_1$-setting, leading to an $\tilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^3)$-time
quantum algorithm for $\varepsilon$-$\ell_1$-scaling in this case.
  We also prove a lower bound, showing that our quantum algorithm for matrix
scaling is essentially optimal for constant $\varepsilon$: every quantum
algorithm for matrix scaling that achieves a constant $\ell_1$-error with
respect to uniform marginals needs to make at least $\Omega(\sqrt{mn})$
queries.

which a recursive Gaussian process regression is used to represent human
features of online learning and future prediction of motion dynamics, is
combined with a conventional model of motion sickness based on an observer
theory. A simulation experiment was conducted in which the proposed model
predicted motion sickness caused by a 900 s horizontal movement. The movement
was composed of a 9 m repetitive back-and-forth movement pattern with a pause.
Regarding the motion condition, the direction and timing of the motion were
varied as follows: a) Predictable motion (M_P): the direction of the motion and
duration of the pause were set to 8 s; b) Motion with unpredicted direction
(M_dU): the pause duration was fixed as in (P), but the motion direction was
randomly determined; c) Motion with unpredicted timing (M_tU): the motion
direction was fixed as in (M_P), but the pause duration was randomly selected
from 4 to 12 s. The results obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that
the predicted motion sickness incidence for (M_P) was smaller than those for
(M_dU) and (M_tU). This tendency agrees with the sickness patterns observed in
a previous experimental study in which the human participants were subject to
motion conditions similar to those used in our simulations. Moreover, no
significant differences were found in the predicted motion sickness incidences
at different conditions when the conventional model was used.

because modern neural networks are characterized by a large number of

induced functional prior, which is the distribution of the functions obtained
by sampling the parameters from their prior distribution. We argue that this is
a hugely limiting aspect of Bayesian deep learning, and this work tackles this

Gaussian processes offer a rigorous framework to define prior distributions
over functions, and we propose a novel and robust framework to match their

systematically large performance improvements over alternative choices of

longstanding research topic for electrical and biomedical engineers. However,
few numbers of publications discuss the impacts of external EM-waves on neural
stimulation and communication through the nervous system. In fact, complex
biological neural channels are a main barrier for intact and comprehensive
analyses in this area. One of the everpresent challenges in neural
communication responses is dependency of vesicle release probability on the
input spiking pattern. In this regard, this study sheds light on consequences
of changing the frequency of external EM-wave excitation on the post-synaptic
neuron's spiking rate. It is assumed that the penetration depth of the wave in
brain does not cover the postsynaptic neuron. Consequently, we model
neurotransmission of a bipartite chemical synapse. In addition, the way that
external stimulation affects neurotransmission is examined. Unlike multiple
frequency component EM-waves, the monochromatic incident wave does not face
frequency shift and distortion in dispersive media. In this manner, a single
frequency signal is added as external current in the modified leaky
integrated-andfire (LIF) model. The results demonstrate existence of a node
equilibrium point in the first order dynamical system of LIF model. A fold
bifurcation (for presupposed LIF model values) occurs when the external
excitation frequency is near 200 Hz. The outcomes provided in this paper enable
us to select proper frequency excitation for neural signaling. Correspondingly,
the cut-off frequency reliance on elements' values in LIF circuit is found.

Networks (GANs) has become common in computer vision and graphics due to its
many practical uses, research on 3D attribute manipulation is relatively
undeveloped. Existing 3D attribute manipulation methods are limited because the
same semantic changes are applied to every 3D face. The key challenge for
developing better 3D attribute control methods is the lack of paired training
data in which one attribute is changed while other attributes are held fixed --
e.g., a pair of 3D faces where one is male and the other is female but all
other attributes, such as race and expression, are the same. To overcome this
challenge, we design a novel pipeline for generating paired 3D faces by
harnessing the power of GANs. On top of this pipeline, we then propose an
enhanced non-linear 3D conditional attribute controller that increases the
precision and diversity of 3D attribute control compared to existing methods.
We demonstrate the validity of our dataset creation pipeline and the superior
performance of our conditional attribute controller via quantitative and

multi-centric medical images while preserving patient identity. In our
approach, the client protects the patient identity by applying a pseudo-random
non-linear deformation to the input image. This results into a proxy image
which is sent to the server for processing. The server then returns back the
deformed processed image which the client reverts to a canonical form. Our
system has three components: 1) a flow-field generator which produces a
pseudo-random deformation function, 2) a Siamese discriminator that learns the
patient identity from the processed image, 3) a medical image processing
network that analyzes the content of the proxy images. The system is trained
end-to-end in an adversarial manner. By fooling the discriminator, the
flow-field generator learns to produce a bi-directional non-linear deformation
which allows to remove and recover the identity of the subject from both the
input image and output result. After end-to-end training, the flow-field
generator is deployed on the client side and the segmentation network is
deployed on the server side. The proposed method is validated on the task of
MRI brain segmentation using images from two different datasets. Results show
that the segmentation accuracy of our method is similar to a system trained on

generator to explicitly borrow feature patches from the known region to
complete a missing region. Due to the lack of supervision signals for the
correspondence between missing regions and known regions, it may fail to find
proper reference features, which often leads to artifacts in the results. Also,
it computes pair-wise similarity across the entire feature map during inference
bringing a significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we
propose to teach such patch-borrowing behavior to an attention-free generator
by joint training of an auxiliary contextual reconstruction task, which
encourages the generated output to be plausible even when reconstructed by
surrounding regions. The auxiliary branch can be seen as a learnable loss
function, i.e. named as contextual reconstruction (CR) loss, where
query-reference feature similarity and reference-based reconstructor are
jointly optimized with the inpainting generator. The auxiliary branch (i.e. CR
loss) is required only during training, and only the inpainting generator is
required during the inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed inpainting model compares favourably against the state-of-the-art in

exist for eliciting requirements, such as object-oriented analysis methods
susceptible to inconsistency (e.g., those using multiple diagrams in UML and

conceptualization of ADs in robotics. We apply a new modeling methodology,
namely the Thinging Machine (TM), to describe the architecture in robotic
systems. The focus of such an application is on high-level specification, which
is one important aspect for realizing the design and implementation in such
systems. TM modeling can be utilized in documentation and communication and as
the first step in the system s design phase. Accordingly, sample robot
architectures are re-expressed in terms of TM, thus developing (1) a static

identifies states, and (3) a behavioral model that specifies the chronology of
events in the system. This result shows a viable approach in robot modeling
that determines a robot system s behavior through its static description.

immersion depth, while there is very little variation in lift force with depth
for certain shapes. The lift experienced by the object is a strong function of
its shape at a given velocity. Shape has an effect on the distribution of
contacts around the surface of the intruder which may result in a strong lift
for certain shapes. We also show the force profiles around the intruder

definite is the intrinsic definiteness and irreversibility of human sensory
experience. While QBists deserve credit for their spirited defense of this
position, Niels Bohr urged it nearly a century ago, albeit in such elliptic
ways that the core of his message has been lost or distorted beyond
recognition. Then as now, the objectivity of empirical science was called into
question. It was defended by Bohr along the lines of Kant's (then)
revolutionary theory of science, according to which the possibility of
empirical science hinges on the possibility of thinking of experiences as
experiences of a system of interacting, re-identifiable objects. What Bohr
added to Kant's theory was his insight that empirical knowledge was not
necessarily limited to what is directly accessible to the senses, and that,
therefore, it does not have to be solely a knowledge of objects of sensible
intuition. It can also be a knowledge of phenomena that are not objects of
sensible intuition but instead are constituted by experimental contexts, which
are objects of sensible intuition. Bohr's grounding of objectivity (or the
objectivity consistent with quantum mechanics), however, is weaker than Kant's
(or the objectivity consistent with Newtonian physics). This conclusion is
based on an examination of Bohr's intentions in appealing to irreversible
amplification effects or the sufficient size and weight of the measurement
apparatus.

stochastic quantum hydrodynamics shows that the superposition of states can
relax to different stationary states that, in the small noise limit, are the

learning (FL) recently attracted much attention due to its applications in
health, finance, and the latest innovations such as industry 4.0 and smart
vehicles. FL provides privacy-by-design. It trains a machine learning model
collaboratively over several distributed clients (ranging from two to millions)
such as mobile phones, without sharing their raw data with any other
participant. In practical scenarios, all clients do not have sufficient
computing resources (e.g., Internet of Things), the machine learning model has
millions of parameters, and its privacy between the server and the clients
while training/testing is a prime concern (e.g., rival parties). In this
regard, FL is not sufficient, so split learning (SL) is introduced. SL is
reliable in these scenarios as it splits a model into multiple portions,
distributes them among clients and server, and trains/tests their respective
model portions to accomplish the full model training/testing. In SL, the
participants do not share both data and their model portions to any other
parties, and usually, a smaller network portion is assigned to the clients
where data resides. Recently, a hybrid of FL and SL, called splitfed learning,
is introduced to elevate the benefits of both FL (faster training/testing time)
and SL (model split and training). Following the developments from FL to SL,
and considering the importance of SL, this chapter is designed to provide
extensive coverage in SL and its variants. The coverage includes fundamentals,
existing findings, integration with privacy measures such as differential
privacy, open problems, and code implementation.

  Application to Helicobacter Pylori Segmentation","71 pages, 39 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning from noisy labels is an important concern because of the lack of
accurate ground-truth labels in plenty of real-world scenarios. In practice,
various approaches for this concern first make some corrections corresponding
to potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update predictive model with
information of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as
medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often
difficult or even impossible for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free
ground-truth labels which leads to labels with complex noise. This situation
raises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making
corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has
limitations due to the complex noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate
evaluation strategy for validation/testing is unclear because of the great
difficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels. In this paper, we
focus on alleviating these two problems. For the problem 1), we present
one-step abductive multi-target learning (OSAMTL) that imposes a one-step
logical reasoning upon machine learning via a multi-target learning procedure
to constrain the predictions of the learning model to be subject to our prior
knowledge about the true target. For the problem 2), we propose a logical
assessment formula (LAF) that evaluates the logical rationality of the outputs
of an approach by estimating the consistencies between the predictions of the
learning model and the logical facts narrated from the results of the one-step
logical reasoning of OSAMTL. Applying OSAMTL and LAF to the Helicobacter pylori
(H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL is able to enable
the machine learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which
is beyond various state-of-the-art approaches in handling complex noisy labels.

training samples for the continual learning of neural networks. The ability to
extend the knowledge of a model with new data without forgetting previously
learned samples is a fundamental requirement in continual learning. Existing
solutions address it by either replaying past data from memory, which is
unsustainable with growing training data, or by reconstructing past samples
with generative models that are trained to generalize beyond training data and,
hence, miss important details of individual samples. In this paper, we take the
best of both worlds and introduce a novel generative rehearsal approach called
BinPlay. Its main objective is to find a quality-preserving encoding of past
samples into precomputed binary codes living in the autoencoder's binary latent
space. Since we parametrize the formula for precomputing the codes only on the
chronological indices of the training samples, the autoencoder is able to
compute the binary embeddings of rehearsed samples on the fly without the need
to keep them in memory. Evaluation on three benchmark datasets shows up to a
twofold accuracy improvement of BinPlay versus competing generative replay
methods.

experience difficulty controlling gait during locomotion, ultimately increasing
their risk of falling. To combat these effects, researchers and clinicians have
used metronomes as assistive devices to improve movement timing in hopes of
reducing their risk of falling. Historically, researchers in this area have
relied on metronomes with isochronous interbeat intervals, which may be
problematic because normal healthy gait varies considerably from one step to
the next. More recently, researchers have advocated the use of irregular
metronomes embedded with statistical properties found in healthy populations.
In this paper, we explore the effect of both regular and irregular metronomes
on many statistical properties of interstride intervals. Furthermore, we
investigate how these properties react to mechanical perturbation in the form
of a halted treadmill belt while walking. Our results demonstrate that
metronomes that are either isochronous or random metronome break down the
inherent structure of healthy gait. Metronomes with statistical properties
similar to healthy gait seem to preserve those properties, despite a strong
mechanical perturbation. We discuss the future development of this work in the
context of networked augmented reality metronome devices.

take the board exam. However, preparing for the examination is not easy. It
takes too much time to release the result, given that the College has limited
personnel. Thus, the proponents developed the Dynamic Local Area Network (LAN)
Based Mock Board Examination System that makes the preparation and checking
easy.
  Method-The proponents followed the iterative waterfall model to develop the
system efficiently. Some criteria of ISO 25010 were adopted in the evaluation
instrument. Simultaneously, evaluators are composed of program chairperson,
College of Computer Studies (CCS) faculty, board program students, and alumni.
  Results-The result of 4.91 in Functional Suitability, 4.87 in Performance
Efficiency, 4.91 in Usability, 4.90 in Security, and 4.92 in Maintainability
shows that the system is fully functional and is usable by any board program.
  Conclusion The computer-based examination, implemented through LAN, can
simplify administering personnel of MinSCAT mock board examination. The
development of the ""Dynamic LAN Based Mock Board Examination System"" is a great
help to the MinSCAT and their board program graduates if it is implemented.
  Recommendations-The system has hidden weaknesses that were only identified in
actual operation. Thus, further testing is needed, like beta testing, to
identify and correct it for better performance. After beta-testing, the system
can be improved through iteration of the Waterfall Model phases.
  Research Implications-The developed system can improve the mock board
examination process and ease preparing this significant examination. Moreover,
it immediately provides a result that helps the examinees to identify their
weaknesses and do a further review to master it.

  Grading",,"Nature Communications Medicine (2021)","10.1038/s43856-021-00005-3",,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gleason grading of prostate cancer is an important prognostic factor but
suffers from poor reproducibility, particularly among non-subspecialist
pathologists. Although artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools have demonstrated
Gleason grading on-par with expert pathologists, it remains an open question
whether A.I. grading translates to better prognostication. In this study, we
developed a system to predict prostate-cancer specific mortality via A.I.-based
Gleason grading and subsequently evaluated its ability to risk-stratify
patients on an independent retrospective cohort of 2,807 prostatectomy cases
from a single European center with 5-25 years of follow-up (median: 13,
interquartile range 9-17). The A.I.'s risk scores produced a C-index of 0.84
(95%CI 0.80-0.87) for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Upon discretizing
these risk scores into risk groups analogous to pathologist Grade Groups (GG),
the A.I. had a C-index of 0.82 (95%CI 0.78-0.85). On the subset of cases with a
GG in the original pathology report (n=1,517), the A.I.'s C-indices were 0.87
and 0.85 for continuous and discrete grading, respectively, compared to 0.79
(95%CI 0.71-0.86) for GG obtained from the reports. These represent
improvements of 0.08 (95%CI 0.01-0.15) and 0.07 (95%CI 0.00-0.14) respectively.
Our results suggest that A.I.-based Gleason grading can lead to effective
risk-stratification and warrants further evaluation for improving disease
management.

  Reconstruction","Submitted to ICASSP 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Independent Sign Language Recognition is a complex visual recognition problem
that combines several challenging tasks of Computer Vision due to the necessity
to exploit and fuse information from hand gestures, body features and facial
expressions. While many state-of-the-art works have managed to deeply elaborate
on these features independently, to the best of our knowledge, no work has
adequately combined all three information channels to efficiently recognize
Sign Language. In this work, we employ SMPL-X, a contemporary parametric model
that enables joint extraction of 3D body shape, face and hands information from
a single image. We use this holistic 3D reconstruction for SLR, demonstrating
that it leads to higher accuracy than recognition from raw RGB images and their
optical flow fed into the state-of-the-art I3D-type network for 3D action
recognition and from 2D Openpose skeletons fed into a Recurrent Neural Network.
Finally, a set of experiments on the body, face and hand features showed that
neglecting any of these, significantly reduces the classification accuracy,
proving the importance of jointly modeling body shape, facial expression and
hand pose for Sign Language Recognition.

community for its proper management. An urgent clinical reaction is required in
the face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. These
efforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening,
treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. The
use of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in all
of the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of Deep
Learning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19
management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DL
models are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Ray
images of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims to
detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19,
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal
conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the
affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better
understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either
independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and
AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model
development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope
with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical
applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented
to withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency

accelerator-based nuclear physics experiments; at the same time, many
experiments are performed to validate the Monte-Carlo codes, which can be used
for the design of full-scale nuclear power applications or the design of new
benchmark experiments. Dedicated model benchmark studies investigate a broad
range of nuclear reactions and quantities. Examples of these include isotope
formation or secondary particle fluxes that result from the interactions of
GeV-range hadrons with monoisotopic targets, which can be used to assess the
respective systematic uncertainty of models. Such benchmark studies, as well as
many nuclear application experiments and simulations carried out by various
groups over the last few decades, enable us to draw methodological lessons. In
this work, model uncertainty determined based on available experimental data
allow us to identify the effects of practitioner expertise as well as the
design of codes (user access to micro-scale parameters) on the range of
uncertainties. We found that in cases when simulations are performed by code
developers or users that are very experienced in performing simulations, the
model to experiment quantity ratios generally agree with the limits determined
by dedicated benchmark studies. In other cases, the ratios generally tend to be
either smaller (underestimation of model error) or larger (overestimation of
model error). A plausible explanation of the aforementioned effects is
suggested.

theoretically study the compensation phase of reflectarray. Two prototypes of
microwave reflectarrays are fabricated and experimentally characterized at 12
GHz, one for generation and one for focusing of OAM-carrying beams. Compared
with the OAM-generating reflectarray, the reflectarray for focusing OAM vortex
can significantly reduce the beam diameter, and this can further improve the
transmission efficiency of the OAM vortex beams. We also show that the
numerical and experimental results agree very well. The proposed design method
and reflectarrays may spur the development of new efficient approaches to
generate and focus OAM vortex waves for applications to microwave wireless
communications.

the cavity photon lifetime, resulting in a cavity optical roundtrip length of
about 30 cm on a chip. Simultaneous lasing at two frequencies is enabled by
introducing an external control parameter for balancing the feedback from two
tunable, frequency-selective Vernier mirrors on the Si$_3$N$_4$ chip. Each
frequency can be tuned with a wavelength coverage of about 80 nm, potentially
allowing for the generation of a broad range of frequencies in the microwave
range up to the THz range.

development. As several vaccines have recently been approved for human use or
are in different stages of development, governments across the world are
preparing comprehensive guidelines for vaccine distribution and monitoring. In
this early article, we identify challenges in logistics, health outcomes,
user-centric matters, and communication associated with disease-related,
individual, societal, economic, and privacy consequences. Primary challenges
include difficulty in equitable distribution, vaccine efficacy, duration of
immunity, multi-dose adherence, and privacy-focused record-keeping to be HIPAA
compliant. While many of these challenges have been previously identified and
addressed, some have not been acknowledged from a comprehensive view accounting
for unprecedented interactions between challenges and specific populations. The
logistics of equitable widespread vaccine distribution in disparate populations
and countries of various economic, racial, and cultural constitutions must be
thoroughly examined and accounted for. We also describe unique challenges
regarding the efficacy of vaccines in specialized populations including
children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, we
report the potential for understudied drug-vaccine interactions as well as the
possibility that certain vaccine platforms may increase susceptibility to HIV.
Given these complicated issues, the importance of privacy-focused, user-centric
systems for vaccine education and incentivization along with clear
communication from governments, organizations, and academic institutions is
imperative. These challenges are by no means insurmountable, but require
careful attention to avoid consequences spanning a range of disease-related,
individual, societal, economic, and security domains.

uncertainty of obtaining channel access through load based equipment (LBE) or

In FBE, the transmitters can be prioritized to support data with different
requirements and have lower energy consumption and latency compared to LBE with
a big contention window size. In this paper we analyze the performance of FBE
in an unlicensed controlled environment through a Markov chain. Based on this
analysis, we propose two schemes to improve the URLLC performance in FBE: The
first scheme allows the transmitters to use multiple fixed frame period (FFP)
configurations while the second scheme configures the FFP's starting point of
each transmitter based on its priority. The simulations show the benefits of
these schemes compared to the URLLC transmission of existing schemes.
