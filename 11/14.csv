supervised image classification uses matrix product state (MPS) operations on
grids of transformed image patches. The resulting patch representations are
combined back together into the image space and aggregated hierarchically using
multiple MPS blocks per layer to obtain the final decision rules. In this work,
we propose a non-patch based modification to LoTeNet that performs one MPS
operation per layer, instead of several patch-level operations. The spatial
information in the input images to MPS blocks at each layer is squeezed into
the feature dimension, similar to LoTeNet, to maximise retained spatial
correlation between pixels when images are flattened into 1D vectors. The
proposed multi-layered tensor network (MLTN) is capable of learning linear
decision boundaries in high dimensional spaces in a multi-layered setting,
which results in a reduction in the computation cost compared to LoTeNet
without any degradation in performance.

the Electron Volt Exchange framework with the following characteristics: 1) a
distributed protocol for pricing and scheduling prosumers'
production/consumption while keeping constraints and bids private, and 2) a
distributed algorithm to prevent theft that verifies prosumers' compliance to
scheduled transactions using information from grid sensors (such as smart

and robustness of the approach are demonstrated through simulation and

direct connections from any layer to all consecutive layers, which can
effectively improve the information flow between different layers. With the
fact that RAdam is not easy to fall into a local optimal solution, and it can
converge quickly in model training. The experimental results shows that our
model achieves superior performance over the other classical convolutional

the Auc-Roc score of our DenseNet169 model is 1.77% higher than Vgg19 model,

of the S0 galaxy NGC 3269 in the Antlia cluster in optical images. The images
do not provide any clue as to whether the patch is a local Jupiter mass-scale
cloudlet or a large extragalactic dust complex. We aim to resolve the nature of
this object: is it a small Galactic cloudlet or an extragalactic dust complex?
ALMA and APEX spectroscopy and Gemini GMOS long-slit spectroscopy were used to
measure the velocity of the patch and the NGC 3269 disk radial velocity curve.
A weak 16$\pm$2.5 km/s wide $^{12}$CO (2-1) T$_{MB}$ 19$\pm$2.5 mK line in a
2.0"" by 2.12"" beam associated with the object was detected with ALMA. The
observed heliocentric velocity, V$_r$,hel = 3878$\pm$5.0km/s, immediately
establishes the extragalactic nature of the object. The patch velocity is
consistent with the velocity of the nucleus of NGC 3269, but not with the
radial velocity of the NGC 3269 disk of the galaxy at its position. The
$\sim$4"" angular size of the patch corresponds to a linear size of $\sim$1 kpc
at the galaxy's Hubble distance of (d/50.7 Mpc)$^2$ Msun, while the attenuation
derived from the optical spectrum implies a dust mass of $\sim$2.6x10$^4$
(d/50.7 Mpc)$^2$ Msun. The derived attenuation ratio A'$_B$/(A'$_B$-A'$_R$) of
1.6$\pm$0.11 is substantially lower than the corresponding value for the mean
Milky Way extinction curve for point sources (2.3). We established the
extragalactic nature of the patch, but its origin remains elusive. One
possibility is that the dust patch is left over from the removal of
interstellar matter in NGC 3269 through the interaction with its neighbour, NGC
3268.

Both virtual gate effect in the gate-drain access region and interface traps
under the gate are most plausible explanations for the experimentally observed
pulsed current dispersion and high temperature threshold voltage shift
respectively. Unpassivated devices show significant current dispersion between
DC and pulsed IV response due to gate lag effect characterized by time
constants in the range of 400~$\mu s$ to 600~$\mu s$. An activation energy of
99~$meV$ is estimated from temperature dependent Arrhenius plots. A variable
range hopping based slow transport in conjunction with the observed shallow
trap level is attributed to the observed slow transient response of drain
current with respect to time. Reactive ion etching step during the device
fabrication is most likely responsible for introducing the traps. Effect of
traps can be minimized by using surface passivation layers, in this case,
Silicon Nitride which shows significant improvement in the current dispersion
and RF cutoff frequency. This work demonstrates the detrimental effect the
traps can have on the current dispersion which significantly limits the high
frequency operation of the device.

show how to improve both the query complexity and runtime by using recent
advances in data-dependent near neighbor search.
  We achieve our results by giving a new implementation of the natural
importance sampling scheme. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm first
samples the dataset uniformly (considering a geometric sequence of sampling
rates), and then uses existing approximate near neighbor search techniques on
the resulting smaller dataset to retrieve the sampled points that lie at an
appropriate distance from the query. We show that the resulting sampled dataset
has strong geometric structure, making approximate near neighbor search return
the required samples much more efficiently than for worst case datasets of the
same size. As an example application, we show that this approach yields a data
structure that achieves query time $\mu^{-(1+o(1))/4}$ and space complexity
$\mu^{-(1+o(1))}$ for the Gaussian kernel. Our data dependent approach achieves
query time $\mu^{-0.173-o(1)}$ and space $\mu^{-(1+o(1))}$ for the Gaussian

estimated based on a set of 65 state-of-the-art evolutionary models of star
clusters, as presented in Banerjee (2021). These relativistic direct many-body
computed models incorporate up-to-date stellar mass loss and remnant formation
ingredients. The merger-event rates are obtained by constructing a cluster
population of the Universe, out of the models, taking into account mass
distribution of clusters and cosmic star formation and enrichment histories, as
per observations. The model BBH merger rate density ranges from a pessimistic
to a reference value of $0.5{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm Gpc}^{-3}-37.9{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm
Gpc}^{-3}$, for a LIGO-Virgo-like detector horizon. The reference rate well
accommodates the BBH merger rate densities estimated from GWTC-1 and GWTC-2

rate densities that agree reasonably with those from GWTC-1 and, as well, with
the much more constrained ones from GWTC-2. These results suggest that

inferred from to-date gravitational-wave (GW) events. The cosmic evolution of
merger rate density from the computed models is also studied. The models
predict a rate of $\approx5{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm Gpc}^{-3}$ for eccentric
LIGO-Virgo mergers from YMCs and OCs. The improving constraints on BBH merger
rate density with mounting GW events will help constraining scenarios of star
cluster formation across cosmic time and as well the relative contributions of
the various compact binary merger channels.

from nature or engineering. These patterns can be represented by a class of
parametric-structure graphs, which are defined by templates that generate
structure by way of repeated instantiation. We propose a class of parametric
graph templates that can succinctly represent a wide variety of graphs. Using
parametric graph templates, we develop structurally-parametric algorithm
variants of maximum flow, minimum cut, and tree subgraph isomorphism. Our
algorithms are polynomial time for maximum flow and minimum cut and are
fixed-parameter tractable for tree subgraph isomorphism when parameterized by
the size of the tree subgraph. By reasoning about the structure of the
repeating subgraphs, we avoid explicit construction of the instantiation.
Furthermore, we show how parametric graph templates can be recovered from an
instantiated graph in quasi-polynomial time when certain parameters of the
graph are bounded. Parametric graph templates and the presented algorithmic
techniques thus create opportunities for reasoning about the generating
structure of a graph, rather than an instance of it.

with minimum bias or information loss. From these images, we are able to
recover 95.9% of stars with an average flux error of 2.26%. Furthermore the

synthetic data does not provide a better tradeoff between privacy and utility
than traditional anonymisation techniques.
  Furthermore, in contrast to traditional anonymisation, the privacy-utility
tradeoff of synthetic data publishing is hard to predict. Because it is
impossible to predict what signals a synthetic dataset will preserve and what

gain and unpredictable utility loss. In summary, we find that synthetic data is

evolutions of a predominantly hyperbolic type. MGT models account for a finite
speed propagation due to the appearance of thermal relaxation coefficient
{\tau} {>} {0} in front of the third order time derivative. Since the values of

the asymptotic behavior and characteristics of the model when {\tau} {\to} {0}.
This is a particularly delicate issue since the {\tau}- dynamics is governed by
a generator which is singular as {\tau} {\to} {0}. It turns out that the limit
dynamics corresponds to the linearized Westervelt equation which is of a
parabolic type. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of the
asymptotics which includes strong convergence of the corresponding evolutions

destabilization of a filament channel, explains numerous features of eruptive
solar events, from small-scale jets to global-scale coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). The underlying multipolar topology, pre-eruption activities, and
sequence of magnetic reconnection onsets (first breakout, then flare) of many
observed fast CMEs/eruptive flares are fully consistent with the model.
Recently, we have demonstrated that most observed coronal-hole jets in
fan/spine topologies also are induced by breakout reconnection at the null
point above a filament channel (with or without a filament). For these two
types of eruptions occurring in similar topologies, the key question is, why do
some events generate jets while others form CMEs? We focused on the initiation
of eruptions in large bright points/small active regions that were located in
coronal holes and clearly exhibited null-point (fan/spine) topologies: such
configurations are referred to as pseudostreamers. We analyzed and compared
SDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO, and RHESSI observations of three events. Our analysis of
the events revealed two new observable signatures of breakout reconnection
prior to the explosive jet/CME outflows and flare onset: coronal dimming and
the opening-up of field lines above the breakout current sheet. Most key
properties were similar among the selected erupting structures, thereby
eliminating region size, photospheric field strength, magnetic configuration,
and pre-eruptive evolution as discriminating factors between jets and CMEs. We
consider the factors that contribute to the different types of dynamic
behavior, and conclude that the main determining factor is the ratio of the
magnetic free energy associated with the filament channel compared to the
energy associated with the overlying flux inside and outside the pseudostreamer
dome.

high-order derivative terms which dominate within a radius much larger than the
size of the source, known as the Vainshtein radius.
  In this work, we present the numerical code $\varphi$enics, building on the

the effective field theory. These two examples illustrate the different
challenges experienced when trying to simulate such theories numerically, and
we show how these are addressed within this code. The examples in this paper
assume spherical symmetry, but the techniques may be straightforwardly
generalised to asymmetric configurations. This article therefore also provides
a worked example of how the finite element method can be employed to solve the

massive enough to be held together by gravity. They can grow by accreting
material to become full-size planets. Planetesimals themselves are thought to
form by complex physical processes from small grains in protoplanetary disks.
The streaming instability (SI) model states that mm/cm-size particles (pebbles)
are aerodynamically collected into self-gravitating clouds which then directly
collapse into planetesimals. Here we analyze ATHENA simulations of the SI to
characterize the initial properties (e.g., rotation) of pebble clouds. Their
gravitational collapse is followed with the PKDGRAV N-body code, which has been
modified to realistically account for pebble collisions. We find that pebble
clouds rapidly collapse into short-lived disk structures from which
planetesimals form. The planetesimal properties depend on the cloud's scaled
angular momentum, l=L/(M R_H^2 Omega, where L and M are the angular momentum
and mass, R_H is the Hill radius, and Omega is the orbital frequency. Low-l
pebble clouds produce tight (or contact) binaries and single planetesimals.
Compact high-l clouds give birth to binary planetesimals with attributes that
closely resemble the equal-size binaries found in the Kuiper belt.
Significantly, the SI-triggered gravitational collapse can explain the angular
momentum distribution of known equal-size binaries -- a result pending
verification from studies with improved resolution. About 10% of collapse
simulations produce hierarchical systems with two or more large moons. These
systems should be found in the Kuiper belt when observations reach the

The inhomogeneous state of such systems at low temperatures consists of
magnetic domains separated by quasi-metallic domain-walls where the
charge-order is reduced. By performing large-scale cell dynamics simulations,
we find a two-stage phase-ordering process in which a short period of
independent evolution of the two order parameters is followed by a correlated
coarsening process. The long-time growth and coarsening of magnetic domains is
shown to follow the Allen-Cahn power law. We further show that the
nucleation-and-growth dynamics during phase transformation to the ordered
states is well described by the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory in two
dimensions. On the other hand, the presence of quasi-metallic magnetic domain
walls in the ordered states gives rise to a very different kinetics for phase
transition to the high temperature paramagnetic phase. In this new scenario,
the phase transformation is initiated by the decay of magnetic domain walls

  sources using depth confidence distribution","47 pages, 10 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fusion learning refers to synthesizing inferences from multiple sources or
studies to provide more effective inference and prediction than from any
individual source or study alone. Most existing methods for synthesizing
inferences rely on parametric model assumptions, such as normality, which often
do not hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a general nonparametric
fusion learning framework for synthesizing inferences of the target parameter
from multiple sources. The main tool underlying the proposed framework is the
notion of depth confidence distribution (depth-CD), which is also developed in
this paper. Broadly speaking, a depth-CD is a data-driven nonparametric summary
distribution of inferential information for the target parameter. We show that
a depth-CD is a useful inferential tool and, moreover, is an omnibus form of
confidence regions (or p-values), whose contours of level sets shrink toward
the true parameter value. The proposed fusion learning approach combines
depth-CDs from the individual studies, with each depth-CD constructed by
nonparametric bootstrap and data depth. This approach is shown to be efficient,
general and robust. Specifically, it achieves high-order accuracy and Bahadur
efficiency under suitably chosen combining elements. It allows the model or
inference structure to be different among individual studies. And it readily
adapts to heterogeneous studies with a broad range of complex and irregular
settings. This property enables it to utilize indirect evidence from incomplete
studies to gain efficiency in the overall inference. The advantages of the
proposed approach are demonstrated simulations and in a Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) study of aircraft landing performance.

Majorana zero modes which are among the contenders for the realization of

enables the formation of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators with A1B2C4
stoichiometry. However, the first representative, MnBi2Te4, is
antiferromagnetic with 25 K N\'eel temperature and strongly n-doped. Here, we
show that p-type MnSb2Te4, previously considered topologically trivial, is a
ferromagnetic topological insulator in the case of a few percent of Mn excess.
It shows (i) a ferromagnetic hysteresis with record high Curie temperature of
45-50 K, (ii) out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and (iii) a two-dimensional
Dirac cone with the Dirac point close to the Fermi level which features (iv)
out-of-plane spin polarization as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy and
(v) a magnetically induced band gap that closes at the Curie temperature as
demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Moreover, it displays (vi) a
critical exponent of magnetization beta~1, indicating the vicinity of a quantum

excess of Mn that substitutionally replaces Sb atoms provides the ferromagnetic
interlayer coupling. Remaining deviations from the ferromagnetic order, likely
related to this substitution, open the inverted bulk band gap and render
MnSb2Te4 a robust topological insulator and new benchmark for magnetic

produce copious amounts of neutrinos, but also cascade photons that are created
from charged particle showers stopping in the target. Therefore, ALPs
interacting with photons can be produced (often energetically) with high
intensity via the Primakoff effect and then leave their signatures at the near
detector through the inverse Primakoff scattering or decays to a photon pair.
Moreover, the high-capability near detectors allow for discrimination between
ALP signals and potential backgrounds, improving the signal sensitivity
further. We demonstrate that a DUNE-like detector can explore a wide range of
parameter space in ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ vs ALP mass $m_a$,

where the trace part of the Einstein equations is lost in a different way. We
introduce a constrained variational formulation of these modified Einstein
equations. Then, drawing on analogies with the Henneaux-Teitelboim action for
unimodular gravity, we construct different general-covariant actions resulting
in these dynamics. The inverse of dynamical Newton constant is canonically
conjugated to the Ricci scalar integrated over spacetime. Surprisingly, instead
of the dynamical Newton constant one can formulate an equivalent theory with a
dynamical Planck constant. Finally, we show that an axion-like field can play a
role of the gravitational Newton constant or even of the quantum Planck

are often noisy and contain task-irrelevant edges, which may lead to suboptimal

PTDNet, a parameterized topological denoising network, to improve the
robustness and generalization performance of GNNs by learning to drop
task-irrelevant edges. PTDNet prunes task-irrelevant edges by penalizing the
number of edges in the sparsified graph with parameterized networks. To take
into consideration of the topology of the entire graph, the nuclear norm
regularization is applied to impose the low-rank constraint on the resulting
sparsified graph for better generalization. PTDNet can be used as a key
component in GNN models to improve their performances on various tasks, such as
node classification and link prediction. Experimental studies on both synthetic

significantly and the performance gain becomes larger for more noisy datasets.

The instability is universal in the sense that it applies to systems with any
spin number, spiral wavevector, and spiral amplitude. Unlike the Landau or
modulational instabilities which require impurities or periodic potential
modulation of an optical lattice, quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to
trigger the transverse instability. We analytically find the most unstable mode
and its growth rate, and compare our analysis with phase space methods. By
adding an easy plane exchange coupling that reduces the Hamiltonian symmetry
from SU(2) to U(1), the stability boundary is shown to continuously interpolate
between the modulational instability and the transverse instability. This
suggests that the transverse instability is an important mechanism that hinders
the formation of a spin superfluid, even in the presence of strong exchange
anisotropy.

it difficult to use them to perform useful calculations, even with a large

fault-tolerant quantum computation at large scales, but until then it will be
necessary to use alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of errors. We
propose a near-term friendly strategy to mitigate errors by entangling and
measuring $M$ copies of a noisy state $\rho$. This enables us to estimate
expectation values with respect to a state with dramatically reduced error,
$\rho^M/ \mathrm{Tr}(\rho^M)$, without explicitly preparing it, hence the name
""virtual distillation"". As $M$ increases, this state approaches the closest
pure state to $\rho$, exponentially quickly. We analyze the effectiveness of
virtual distillation and find that it is governed in many regimes by the
behavior of this pure state (corresponding to the dominant eigenvector of
$\rho$). We numerically demonstrate that virtual distillation is capable of
suppressing errors by multiple orders of magnitude and explain how this effect
is enhanced as the system size grows. Finally, we show that this technique can
improve the convergence of randomized quantum algorithms, even in the absence
of device noise.

complex interdependence between words and the manner in which they are spoken.
It is made more difficult by the available datasets; their small size and
incompatible labeling idiosyncrasies make it hard to build generalizable
emotion detection systems. To address these two challenges, we present a
multi-modal approach that first transfers learning from related tasks in speech
and text to produce robust neural embeddings and then uses these embeddings to
train a pLDA classifier that is able to adapt to previously unseen emotions and
domains. We begin by training a multilayer TDNN on the task of speaker
identification with the VoxCeleb corpora and then fine-tune it on the task of
emotion identification with the Crema-D corpus. Using this network, we extract
speech embeddings for Crema-D from each of its layers, generate and concatenate
text embeddings for the accompanying transcripts using a fine-tuned BERT model
and then train an LDA - pLDA classifier on the resulting dense representations.
We exhaustively evaluate the predictive power of every component: the TDNN
alone, speech embeddings from each of its layers alone, text embeddings alone
and every combination thereof. Our best variant, trained on only VoxCeleb and
Crema-D and evaluated on IEMOCAP, achieves an EER of 38.05%. Including a
portion of IEMOCAP during training produces a 5-fold averaged EER of 25.72%
(For comparison, 44.71% of the gold-label annotations include at least one
annotator who disagrees).

taken over a roughly one year time span have two signals of periodic

marginal detection of periodic behavior close to either 5 day or 6 day period.
A BRITE-Constellation nanosatellite optical photometric monitoring, using
near-contemporaneous observations to the Chandra data, confirms a 1.78060 +/-
0.00088 day period for this star. The optical period coincides with the new
Chandra period within their error ranges, demonstrating a link between these
two wavebands and providing a powerful lever for probing the photosphere/wind
connection in this star. The phase lag of the X-ray maximum relative to the
optical maximum is approximately phi=0.45, but consideration of secondary
maxima in both datasets indicates possibly two hot spots on the star with an
X-ray phase lag of phi=0.1 each. The details of this periodic variation of the
X-rays are probed by displaying a phased and trailed X-ray spectrum and by
constructing phased light curves for wavelength bands within the HETG spectral
coverage, ranging down to bands encompassing groups of emission lines. We
propose that the 1.78 day period is the stellar rotation period and explore how
stellar bright spots and associated co-rotating interacting regions or CIRs
could explain the modulation of the optical and X-ray output for this star and
their phase difference.

true cluster members from false positives and determine the fraction of
candidate cluster members viewed in projection. Our main results can be
summarized as follows: first, we show that a simple double-Gaussian model can
be used to describe the distribution of line-of-sight velocities in the
redMaPPer sample; second, the incidence of projection effects is substantial,
accounting for $\sim 16$ per cent of the weighted richness for the lowest
richness objects; third, projection effects are a strong function of richness,
with the contribution in the highest richness bin being several times smaller
than for low-richness objects; fourth, our measurement has a similar amplitude
to state-of-the-art models, but finds a steeper dependence of projection
effects on richness than these models; and fifth, the slope of the observed
velocity dispersion--richness relation, corrected for projection effects,
implies an approximately linear relationship between the true,
three-dimensional halo mass and three-dimensional richness. Our results provide
a robust, empirical description of the impact of projection effects on the SDSS

geometry which is fibered by the transverse spacetime directions. Despite their
clear interest to understanding the entropy of rotating black holes, these

to the non-trivial fibration structure. In this paper we allow for the most
general fibration over AdS$_2$ with a flux configuration permitting rotating
M2-branes. Using G-structure techniques we rewrite the conditions for
supersymmetry in terms of differential equations on an eight-dimensional
balanced space. The 9d compact internal space is a U$(1)$-fibration over this
8d base. The geometry is constrained by a master equation reminiscent of the

(CH$_3$OH). It is important to understand the conditions that produce H$_2$CO

both gas-phase and solid-state formation pathways, involving either UV-produced
radical precursors or CO ice and cold ($\lesssim 20$ K) dust grains. To
understand which pathway dominates, gaseous H$_2$CO's ortho-to-para ratio (OPR)
has been used as a probe, with a value of 3 indicating ""warm"" conditions and
$<3$ linked to cold formation in the solid-state. We present spatially resolved
ALMA observations of multiple ortho- and para-H$_2$CO transitions in the TW Hya
protoplanetary disk to test H$_2$CO formation theories during planet formation.
We find disk-averaged rotational temperatures and column densities of $33\pm2$
K, ($1.1\pm0.1)\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $25\pm2$ K,
$(4.4\pm0.3)\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ for ortho- and para-H$_2$CO, respectively,

observed H$_2$CO emits mostly at rotational temperatures of 30-40 K,
corresponding to a layer with $z/R\ge0.25$. The OPR is consistent with 3 within
60 au, the extent of the pebble disk, and decreases beyond 60 au to
$2.0\pm0.5$. The latter corresponds to a spin temperature of 12 K, well below
the rotational temperature. The combination of relatively uniform emitting
conditions, a radial gradient in the OPR, and recent laboratory experiments and
theory on OPR ratios after sublimation, lead us to speculate that gas-phase
formation is responsible for the observed H$_2$CO across the TW Hya disk.

Herschel infrared luminosity functions of different galaxy populations, in
order to consider in a consistent way different populations of galaxies and
active galactic nuclei. We associated a spectral energy distribution and
physical properties, such as stellar mass, star-formation-rate and AGN

low-resolution IR spectroscopy, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or
the Origin Space Telescope (OST). The derived simulated catalogue contains
galaxies and active galactic nuclei that by construction reproduce the observed
IR galaxy number density, but it is also in agreement with the observed number
counts from UV to far-IR wavelengths, the observed stellar mass function, the
star-formation-rate vs. stellar mass plane and the luminosity function from the
radio to the X-ray. The proposed simulation is therefore ideal to make
predictions for current and future facilities, in particular, but not limited

quasiparticle character of the low-energy degrees of freedom. Therefore,
observables exhibit deviations from Fermi liquid behavior which gives rise to
the term Ising nematic quantum critical metal. To obtain a theoretical
description we use a finite-temperature version of Eliashberg theory which
allows to treat the strong coupling between quantum and thermal fluctuations in
the absence of well-defined quasiparticles. Here, we use this self-consistent,
diagrammatic approach to compute, in particular, the nematic susceptibility and
the non-Fermi liquid correlations. Upon decreasing the temperature, the
susceptibility crosses over from a $(T \log T)^{-1}$ to $T^{-2/3}$ behavior,
which is induced by the absence of quasiparticles and restores the Ising
nematic critical scaling. Correspondingly, the fermions obey a simple
$\omega/T$ scaling law at low enough temperatures. However, this regime is
characterized by strong IR-UV mixing since the proportionality factors exhibit
a dependence on the spectral width of the non-quasiparticle excitations and on
the underlying lattice. Tuning the parameters of the model, therefore, gives
rise to several scenarios for the breakdown of the scaling theory. We discuss
them within the Eliashberg approach and estimate the related crossover scales.
We also show that the leading order vertex corrections do not change the
scaling with temperature or coupling constants.

reshape CDM halos, leaving behind bound remnants whose characteristic densities
are set by the mean density of the host at the pericentre of their respective

after ~5 orbits for nearly circular orbits, while reaching the same remnant
requires ~25 and ~40 orbits for eccentric orbits with 1:5 and 1:20
pericentre-to-apocentre ratios, respectively. The density profile of tidal
remnants is fully specified by the fraction of mass lost, and approaches an
exponentially-truncated Navarro-Frenk-White profile in the case of heavy mass
loss. Resolving tidal remnants requires excellent numerical resolution; poorly
resolved subhalos have systematically lower characteristic densities and are
more easily disrupted. Even simulations with excellent spatial and time
resolution fail when the final remnant is resolved with fewer than 3000

Understanding both of these processes requires detailed characterization of
their disk structures and companion frequencies. We present new 3.7 micron
imaging of the Herbig Be star MWC 297 from non-redundant masking observations
on the phase-controlled, 23-m Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. The
images reveal complex disk structure on the scales of several au, as well as a
companion candidate. We discuss physical interpretations for these features,
and demonstrate that the imaging results are independent of choices such as

stars have been clearly identified as members of this association. In this
paper we reanalyse the membership of the association in light of Gaia DR2 data,
in particular finding that HD 95086 is a potential member (probability of 71%).
This star is noteworthy as one of the few stars that hosts both a detected
debris disc and a directly imaged planet. It has previously only been
considered as a potential member of the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) - part of
the Scorpius-Centaurus association. We also reanalyse the age of the Carina
association. Using a Bayesian inference code applied to infer a solution from
stellar evolution models for the most probable (>99%) members of Carina, we
infer an age for the association of 13.3$^{+1.1}_{-0.6}$ Myr, much younger than
previous studies. Whilst we have revised HD 95086's association membership from
LCC to Carina, the fact that we also find Carina to have a younger age, similar
to that of LCC, means that the estimates of HD 95086b's mass remain unchanged.
However, the younger age of Carina does mean that the companion to another
Carina member, HD 44627 (or AB Pic), has a mass that is more clearly in the
planet rather than brown dwarf range.

attempting to identify the ""true"" specification, the GFIC chooses from a set of
potentially mis-specified moment conditions and parameter restrictions to
minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of a user-specified target parameter. The
intent of the GFIC is to formalize a situation common in applied practice. An
applied researcher begins with a set of fairly weak ""baseline"" assumptions,
assumed to be correct, and must decide whether to impose any of a number of
stronger, more controversial ""suspect"" assumptions that yield parameter
restrictions, additional moment conditions, or both. Provided that the baseline
assumptions identify the model, we show how to construct an asymptotically
unbiased estimator of the asymptotic MSE to select over these suspect
assumptions: the GFIC. We go on to provide results for post-selection inference
and model averaging that can be applied both to the GFIC and various
alternative selection criteria. To illustrate how our criterion can be used in
practice, we specialize the GFIC to the problem of selecting over exogeneity
assumptions and lag lengths in a dynamic panel model, and show that it performs
well in simulations. We conclude by applying the GFIC to a dynamic panel data
model for the price elasticity of cigarette demand.

as an additional probe of the large scale structure. We use a Fisher forecast
to make a prediction for the detectability of this velocity-shape correlation
with a combination of redshifts and shapes from the 4MOST+LSST surveys, and
radial velocity reconstruction from the Simons Observatory. The signal-to-noise
ratio for the velocity-shape (dipole) correlation is 7.4, relative to 44 for
the galaxy density-shape (monopole) correlation and for a maximum wavenumber of
$0.2\: \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$. Encouraged by these predictions, we discuss two
possible applications for the velocity-shape correlation. Measuring the

induced by intrinsic alignments on galaxy clustering. We also find that
velocity-shape measurements could potentially aid in determining the
scale-dependence of intrinsic alignments when multiple shape measurements of
the same galaxies are provided.

so-called pillared layer MOFs, grown in an oriented fashion on a solid

  EXPSPACE-complete","71 pages , 29 figures",,,,"cs.FL cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parametric timed automata (PTA) are an extension of timed automata in which
clocks can be compared against parameters. The reachability problem asks for
the existence of an assignment of the parameters to the non-negative integers
such that reachability holds in the underlying timed automaton. The
reachability problem for PTA is long known to be undecidable, already over
three parametric clocks.
  A few years ago, Bundala and Ouaknine proved that for PTA over two parametric
clocks and one parameter the reachability problem is decidable and also showed
a lower bound for the complexity class PSPACE^NEXP. Our main result is that the
reachability problem for two-parametric timed automata with one parameter is
EXPSPACE-complete. Our contribution is two-fold.
  For the EXPSPACE lower bound we make use of deep results from complexity
theory, namely a serializability characterization of EXPSPACE (based on
Barrington's Theorem) and a logspace translation of numbers in chinese
remainder representation to binary representation.
  For the EXPSPACE upper bound, we give a careful exponential time reduction
from PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter to a slight subclass of
parametric one-counter automata (POCA) over one parameter based on a minor
adjustment of a construction due to Bundala and Ouaknine. We provide a series
of techniques to partition a fictitious run of a POCA into several carefully
chosen subruns that allow us to prove that it is sufficient to consider a
parameter value of exponential magnitude only. This allows us to show a
doubly-exponential upper bound on the value of the only parameter of a PTA over
two parametric clocks and one parameter. We hope that extensions of our
techniques lead to finally establishing decidability of the long-standing open
problem of reachability in parametric timed automata with two parametric clocks
(and arbitrarily many parameters).

decreasing latency only increase parallelism within a layer. This is because
architectures typically capture a single-chain dependency pattern that prevents
efficient distribution with a higher concurrency (i.e., simultaneous execution
of one inference among devices). Such single-chain dependencies are so
widespread that even implicitly biases recent neural architecture search (NAS)
studies. In this visionary paper, we draw attention to an entirely new space of
NAS that relaxes the single-chain dependency to provide higher concurrency and
distribution opportunities. To quantitatively compare these architectures, we
propose a score that encapsulates crucial metrics such as communication,
concurrency, and load balancing. Additionally, we propose a new generator and
transformation block that consistently deliver superior architectures compared
to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, our preliminary results show that
these new architectures reduce the inference latency and deserve more

achieves accuracies comparable to floating-point precision implementations in

the proposed method achieves a 98.34% accuracy for a 5-way, 5-shot

are dynamically stable because of the absence of imaginary phonon modes. The

  The most important new equilibria are those that branch off from the

Unfortunately, the associated cost function is nonsmooth and non-convex. As a
result, existing synthesis methods scale poorly to high-dimensional nonlinear

STL synthesis based on Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). It is well known
that DDP scales well to extremely high-dimensional nonlinear systems like

harnessed for STL synthesis. We prove the soundness of our proposed approach,

exact construction of weighted straight skeletons of 2D general planar polygons
of arbitrary complexity based on the notion of deforming polygon. In the
proposed algorithm, the raw input provided by the polygon itself is enough to
resolve edge collapse and edge split events. Neither the construction of a
kinetic triangulation nor the computation of a motorcycle graph is required.
Due to its incremental nature, there is always a room in the algorithm for the
interactive construction of the straight skeleton. The proposed algorithm is of
predictor-corrector type. In the algorithm, the edge collapse and edge split
events are tackled by a completely different novel original approach which is
first of its kind. In the predictor step, the position of the vertices is
advanced in time by direct integration assuming no event. Then predicted
positions are corrected by using linear interpolation if there are edge
collapse or edge split events within the same increment. In the algorithm edge
collapse and edge split events are detected by, respectively, edge swap and
edge penetration. The proposed algorithm has been used to construct roof
topology starting from a floor plan of various complexity ranging from simple
convex to highly nonconvex with holes. In order to construct, improve and test
the building blocks of the underlying algorithm, a graphical user interface,
Straight Skeleton Development Kit, has also been developed in parallel by the

$d_{x^2-y^2}$, which is a disproportionately large splitting given the small
degree of compressive strain. We interpret this as resulting from the strain
providing a preferential orientation for the MnO$_6$ octahedra, which are
strongly susceptible to such a deformation in the vicinity of the phase

diagonalization to study many electrons in short 1-D atom chains represented by
long-range extended Hubbard-like models. We introduce a novel measure, the
Single-Particle Excitation Content (SPEC) of an eigenstate and show that the
dependence of SPEC on state number reveals the nature of the ground state, and
the onset and saturation of correlation between the electrons as Coulomb
interaction strength increases. We use this SPEC behavior to identify five
regimes as interaction is increased: a non-interacting single-particle regime,
a regime of perturbative Coulomb interaction in which the SPEC is a nearly
universal function of state number, the onset and saturation of correlation, a
regime of fully correlated states in which hopping is a perturbation and SPEC
is a different universal function of state number, and the regime of no
hopping. In particular, the behavior of the SPEC shows that when
electron-electron correlation plays a minor role, all of the lowest energy
states are made up primarily of single-particle excitations of the ground
state, and as the Coulomb interaction increases, the lowest energy states
increasingly contain many-particle excitations. In addition, the SPEC
highlights a fundamental, distinct difference between a non-interacting system
and one with minute, very weak interactions. While SPEC is a quantity that can
be calculated for small exactly diagonalizable systems, it guides our intuition
for larger systems, suggesting the nature of excitations and their distribution
in the spectrum. Thus, this function, like correlation functions or order
parameters, provides us with a window of intuition about the behavior of a

cyber-physical systems (CPS). As the complexity of CPS evolved, the focus has
shifted from traditional control methods to deep reinforcement learning-based
(DRL) methods for control of these systems. This is due to the difficulty of
obtaining accurate models of complex CPS for traditional control. However, to
securely deploy DRL in production, it is essential to examine the weaknesses of
DRL-based controllers (policies) towards malicious attacks from all angles. In
this work, we investigate targeted attacks in the action-space domain, also
commonly known as actuation attacks in CPS literature, which perturbs the
outputs of a controller. We show that a query-based black-box attack model that
generates optimal perturbations with respect to an adversarial goal can be
formulated as another reinforcement learning problem. Thus, such an adversarial
policy can be trained using conventional DRL methods. Experimental results
showed that adversarial policies that only observe the nominal policy's output
generate stronger attacks than adversarial policies that observe the nominal
policy's input and output. Further analysis reveals that nominal policies whose
outputs are frequently at the boundaries of the action space are naturally more
robust towards adversarial policies. Lastly, we propose the use of adversarial
training with transfer learning to induce robust behaviors into the nominal
policy, which decreases the rate of successful targeted attacks by 50%.

different areas, bringing contributions to different types of activities.
Objective: This paper aims to characterize how gamification has been adopted in
non-educational contexts of software engineering (SE) activities. Method: We
performed a Systematic Mapping of the literature obtained from relevant
databases of the area. The searches retrieved 2640 studies (published up to
January 2020), of which 548 were duplicates, 82 were selected after applying
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 21 were included via the backward
snowballing technique, thus reaching a total of 103 studies to be analyzed.
Results: Gamification provided benefits to activities like requirements
specification, development, testing, project management, and support process.
There is evidence of gamified support to some CMMI 2.0 Practice Areas. The most
commonly used gamification elements are points and leaderboards. The main
benefit achieved is the increased engagement and motivation to perform tasks.
Conclusion: The number of publications and new research initiatives have
increased over the years and, from the original authors' reports, many positive
results were achieved in SE activities. Despite this, gamification can still be
explored for many SE tasks; for the addressed ones, empirical evidence is very
limited.

this work, we study stochastic approximation schemes for the hypergradient,
which are important when the lower-level problem is empirical risk minimization
on a large dataset. The method that we propose is a stochastic variant of the
approximate implicit differentiation approach in (Pedregosa, 2016). We provide
bounds for the mean square error of the hypergradient approximation, under the
assumption that the lower-level problem is accessible only through a stochastic
mapping which is a contraction in expectation. In particular, our main bound is

important tool for survey data analysis, while deep learning generative models

We trained two types of neural networks to map images from the Sloan Digital

This map was used to generate false DES representations of SDSS images,
increasing the brightness and S/N while retaining important morphological
information. We substantiate the robustness of our method by generating DES
representations of SDSS images from outside the overlapping region, showing
that the brightness and quality are improved even when the source images are of
lower quality than the training images. Finally, we highlight several images in
which the reconstruction process appears to have removed large artifacts from
SDSS images. While only an initial application, our method shows promise as a
method for robustly expanding and improving the quality of optical survey data

  There is an increasing demand for high quality subnational estimates of
under-five mortality. In low and middle income countries, where the burden of
under-five mortality is concentrated, vital registration is often lacking and
household surveys, which provide full birth history data, are often the most
reliable source. Unfortunately, these data are spatially sparse and so data are
pulled from other sources to increase the available information. Summary birth
histories represent a large fraction of the available data, and provide numbers
of births and deaths aggregated over time, along with the mother's age.
  OBJECTIVE
  Specialized methods are needed to leverage this information, and previously
the Brass method, and variants, have been used. We wish to develop a
model-based approach that can propagate errors, and make the most efficient use
of the data. Further, we strive to provide a method that does not have large
computational overhead.
  CONTRIBUTION
  We describe a computationally efficient model-based approach which allows
summary birth history and full birth history data to be combined into analyses
of under-five mortality in a natural way. The method is based on fertility and
mortality models that allow direct smoothing over time and space, with the
possibility for including relevant covariates that are associated with
fertility and/or mortality. We first examine the behavior of the approach on
simulated data, before applying the model to survey and census data from
Malawi.

extrinsic contacts. The ability to modulate finger friction enhances extrinsic
dexterity for three-dimensional WIHM, and allows us to operate in the
quasi-static level. The region-based planner automatically generates 3D
manipulation sequences with a modified A* formulation that navigates the
contact regions between the fingers and the object surface to reach desired
regions. Central to this method is a set of object-motion primitives (i.e.
within-hand sliding, rotation and pivoting), which can easily be achieved via
changing contact friction. A wide range of goal regions can be achieved via
this approach, which is demonstrated via real robot experiments following a
standardized in-hand manipulation benchmarking protocol.

However, such techniques based on the full matrix of G and W are
computationally demanding. The routinely used single-shot GW-approximation
(G0W0) has an undesirable dependency on the choice of initial
exchange-correlation functional. In the literature, many so-called
self-consistent GW methods are based on diagonal approximation of G and
low-ranking approximation of W. It is thus worth to check how good such
approximations are in comparison with the full matrix method. In this work, we
consider AlAs, AlP, GaP, and ZnS as the prototype systems to perform sc-GW
calculations by expressing the full G matrix using a plane-wave basis set. We
compared our sc-GW results with the diagonal G and subspace W approximated
sc-GW results (sc-GW-diagG and sc-GW-subW methods). In the sc-GW-diagG method,
interacting G is expanded in the eigenvectors of non-interacting G such that
only diagonal elements are retained, whereas, the number of eigenmodes is
truncated in sc-GW-subW calculations. A systematic analysis of the results
obtained from the above techniques is presented. The differences in the
quasiparticle bandgap between the approximated and the full matrix sc-GW
approaches are mostly less than 1.7% that validates such widely adopted
approximations, and also shows how such low-ranking approximation can be used
to include higher-order terms like the vertex correction.

the iteration index in the stochastic setting. Moreover, pseudo-gradients are
needed when gradient estimates for cost are only computable up to some
numerical error, which arise in, e.g., integral approximations. Under constant
step-size and compression budget, we establish tradeoffs between the radius of
convergence of the expected sub-optimality and the projection budget parameter,
as well as non-asymptotic bounds on the model complexity. To refine the
solution's precision, we develop a second-order extension which employs
recursively averaged pseudo-gradient outer-products to approximate the Hessian
inverse, whose convergence in mean is established under an additional
eigenvalue decay condition on the Hessian of the optimal RKHS element, which is
unique to this work. Experiments demonstrate favorable performance on
inhomogeneous Poisson Process intensity estimation in practice.

to determine. The oracle can answer queries of the form ""Is $s$ a substring of
$S$?"". In 1995, Skiena and Sundaram showed that, in the worst case, any
algorithm needs to ask the oracle $\sigma n/4 -O(n)$ queries in order to be
able to reconstruct the hidden string, where $\sigma$ is the size of the
alphabet of $S$ and $n$ its length, and gave an algorithm that spends
$(\sigma-1)n+O(\sigma \sqrt{n})$ queries to reconstruct $S$. The main
contribution of our paper is to improve the above upper-bound in the context
where the string is compressible. We first present a universal algorithm that,
given a (computable) compressor that compresses the string to $\tau$ bits,
performs $q=O(\tau)$ substring queries; this algorithm, however, runs in
exponential time. For this reason, the second part of the paper focuses on more
time-efficient algorithms whose number of queries is bounded by specific
compressibility measures. We first show that any string of length $n$ over an
integer alphabet of size $\sigma$ with $rle$ runs can be reconstructed with
$q=O(rle (\sigma + \log \frac{n}{rle}))$ substring queries in linear time and
space. We then present an algorithm that spends $q \in O(\sigma g\log n)$
substring queries and runs in $O(n(\log n + \log \sigma)+ q)$ time using linear
space, where $g$ is the size of a smallest straight-line program generating the
string.

domain-wall ME coupling were revealed using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD) measurements with in-situ ferroelectric polarization switching. Our
Landau theory analysis suggests that the bulk ME-coupled ferroelectric
switching path has a higher energy barrier than that of the ME-decoupled path;
this extra barrier energy is also too high to be reduced by the magneto-static
energy in the process of breaking single magnetic domains into multi-domains.
In addition, the reduction of magnetization around the ferroelectric domain
walls predicted by the Landau theory may induce the domain-wall ME coupling in

we study general QCQPs and their (projected) SDP relaxations. We present

paper, we study interpersonal influence in small groups of individuals who
collectively execute a sequence of intellective tasks. We observe that along an
issue sequence with feedback, individuals with higher expertise and social
confidence are accorded higher interpersonal influence. We also observe that
low-performing individuals tend to underestimate their high-performing
teammate's expertise. Based on these observations, we introduce three
hypotheses and present empirical and theoretical support for their validity. We
report empirical evidence on longstanding theories of transactive memory
systems, social comparison, and confidence heuristics on the origins of social
influence. We propose a cognitive dynamical model inspired by these theories to
describe the process by which individuals adjust interpersonal influences over
time. We demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting individuals' influence
and provide analytical results on its asymptotic behavior for the case with
identically performing individuals. Lastly, we propose a novel approach using
deep neural networks on a pre-trained text embedding model for predicting the
influence of individuals. Using message contents, message times, and individual
correctness collected during tasks, we are able to accurately predict
individuals' self-reported influence over time. Extensive experiments verify
the accuracy of the proposed models compared to baselines such as structural

most accurate, the dynamical model is the most interpretable for influence

the zero-point offsets exhibit negligible variations with SFD $E(B - V )$, due

a local descriptor (we use local binary patterns for that purpose) and they are
summarized by a simple histogram, yielding in this way the image feature

established benchmark texture databases and on a practical task of plant
species recognition. In both cases, it is compared with several
state-of-the-art methodologies employed for texture recognition. Our proposal
outperforms those methods in terms of classification accuracy, confirming its
competitiveness. The good performance can be justified to a large extent by the
ability of the pseudo-parabolic operator to smooth possibly noisy details
inside homogeneous regions of the image at the same time that it preserves
discontinuities that convey critical information for the object description.
Such results also confirm that model-based approaches like the proposed one can
still be competitive with the omnipresent learning-based approaches, especially

Compared to conventional landmark prediction with fixed landmark times, our
methods allow the landmark times to be subject-specific and triggered by an
intermediate clinical event. Moreover, the nonparametric approach circumvents
the thorny issue of model incompatibility at different landmark times. In our
framework, both the longitudinal predictors and the event time outcome are
subject to right censoring, and thus existing tree-based approaches cannot be
directly applied. To tackle the analytical challenges, we propose a
risk-set-based ensemble procedure by averaging martingale estimating equations

from disks may dominate the overall ejecta from mergers and be a major source
of r-process nuclei in our universe. We explore the parameter space of such
disks, their outflows, and r-process yields by performing three-dimensional
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations with weak
interactions and approximate neutrino transport. We discuss the mapping between
initial binary parameters and the parameter space of resulting disks, chiefly
characterized by their initial accretion rate. We demonstrate the existence of
an ignition threshold for weak interactions at around $\sim 10^{-3}
M_\odot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for typical parameters by means of analytic
calculations and numerical simulations. We find a degenerate, self-regulated,
neutrino-cooled regime above the threshold and an advection dominated regime
below the threshold. Excess heating in the absence of neutrino cooling below
the threshold leads to $\gtrsim 60\%$ of the initial disk mass being ejected in
outflows, with typical velocities $\sim (0.1-0.2)c$, compared to $\lesssim
40\%$ at $\sim (0.1-0.15)c$ above the threshold. While disks below the
threshold show suppressed production of light r-process elements, disks above
the threshold can produce the entire range of r-process elements in good
agreement with the observed solar system abundances. Disks below the ignition
threshold may produce an overabundance of actinides seen in actinide-boost

using a training set of problem instances from their domain to determine a

most of this work comes with no performance guarantees. The challenge is that
for many combinatorial problems of significant importance including
partitioning, subset selection, and alignment problems, a small tweak to the

(CLF)-based stabilizing controller for a control-affine system with uncertain
dynamics using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. In order to estimate both
state and input-dependent model uncertainty, we propose a novel compound kernel
that captures the control-affine nature of the problem. Furthermore, by the use
of GP Upper Confidence Bound analysis, we provide probabilistic bounds of the
regression error, leading to the formulation of a CLF-based stability chance
constraint which can be incorporated in a min-norm optimization problem. We
show that this resulting optimization problem is convex, and we call it
Gaussian Process-based Control Lyapunov Function Second-Order Cone Program
(GP-CLF-SOCP). The data-collection process and the training of the GP
regression model are carried out in an episodic learning fashion. We validate
the proposed algorithm and controller in numerical simulations of an inverted
pendulum and a kinematic bicycle model, resulting in stable trajectories which
are very similar to the ones obtained if we actually knew the true plant
dynamics.

lossless phase-only metasurfaces separated by a distance. We first demonstrate
a combined beam-former and splitter optical component using this approach.

infrared data have strong complementary advantages, which could make trackers
all-day and all-weather work. However, how to effectively represent RGBT data
for visual tracking remains unstudied well. Existing works usually focus on
extracting modality-shared or modality-specific information, but the potentials
of these two cues are not well explored and exploited in RGBT tracking. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-adapter network to jointly perform
modality-shared, modality-specific and instance-aware target representation
learning for RGBT tracking. To this end, we design three kinds of adapters
within an end-to-end deep learning framework. In specific, we use the modified
VGG-M as the generality adapter to extract the modality-shared target
representations.To extract the modality-specific features while reducing the
computational complexity, we design a modality adapter, which adds a small
block to the generality adapter in each layer and each modality in a parallel
manner. Such a design could learn multilevel modality-specific representations
with a modest number of parameters as the vast majority of parameters are
shared with the generality adapter. We also design instance adapter to capture
the appearance properties and temporal variations of a certain target.
Moreover, to enhance the shared and specific features, we employ the loss of
multiple kernel maximum mean discrepancy to measure the distribution divergence
of different modal features and integrate it into each layer for more robust
representation learning. Extensive experiments on two RGBT tracking benchmark
datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed tracker
against the state-of-the-art methods.

a task for navigating a marble to the center of a circular maze. While this

Learning consists of initializing a physics engine with parameters estimated

corrected using Gaussian process regression, which is used to model the
residual between real observations and physics engine simulations. The physics
engine augmented with the residual model is then used to control the marble in

attention in the computer vision community. In this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised cross-domain detection model that exploits the annotated data in a
source domain to train an object detector for a different target domain. The
proposed model mitigates the cross-domain representation divergence for object
detection by performing cross-domain feature alignment in two dimensions, the
depth dimension and the spatial dimension. In the depth dimension of channel
layers, it uses inter-channel information to bridge the domain divergence with
respect to image style alignment. In the dimension of spatial layers, it
deploys spatial attention modules to enhance detection relevant regions and
suppress irrelevant regions with respect to cross-domain feature alignment.
Experiments are conducted on a number of benchmark cross-domain detection
datasets. The empirical results show the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art comparison methods.

communication and radar sensing system on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)
based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. UAV simultaneously communicates
with multiple users and probes signals to targets of interest to exploit
cooperative sensing ability and achieve substantial gains in size, cost and
power consumption. By virtue of using linearly precoded rate splitting at the
transmitter and successive interference cancellation at the receivers, RSMA is
introduced as a promising paradigm to manage interference as well as enhance
spectrum and energy efficiency. To maximize the energy efficiency of UAV
networks, the deployment location and the beamforming matrix are jointly
optimized under the constraints of power budget, transmission rate and
approximation error. To solve the formulated non-convex problem efficiently, we
decompose it into the UAV deployment subproblem and the beamforming
optimization subproblem. Then, we invoke the successive convex approximation
and difference-of-convex programming as well as Dinkelbach methods to transform
the intractable subproblems into convex ones at each iteration. Next, an
alternating algorithm is designed to solve the non-linear and non-convex
problem in an efficient manner, while the corresponding complexity is analyzed
as well. Finally, simulation results reveal that proposed algorithm with RSMA
is superior to orthogonal multiple access and power-domain non-orthogonal
multiple access in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency.

traditional investigations of this correlation have treated elliptical galaxies

galaxies have undergone significant late-time ($z \lesssim 2$) dissipationless
assembly since their initially dense ""red nugget"" phase strongly suggests that
black holes in present-day ellipticals should be associated only with their
cores and not with their extended envelopes. We perform two-dimensional image
decomposition of Two Micron All Sky Survey $K_s$-band images to derive the
stellar mass of the cores of 35 nearby ellipticals with reliably measured black
hole masses. We revisit the relation between black hole mass and bulge stellar
mass by combining classical bulges with the cores of ellipticals. The new
relation exhibits nearly identical slope ($M_{\bullet} \propto
M_{\text{core}}^{1.2}$) as the conventional relation but a factor of $\sim2$
higher normalization and moderately larger intrinsic scatter (0.4 dex). At a
core mass of $10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{\bullet}/M_{\text{core}} = 0.9\%$, but
it rises to $M_{\bullet}/M_{\text{core}}=1.5\%$ for the most massive cores with

propose novel regularization terms, which enable the model to seek both
non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while discouraging unbalanced
segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a criterion to localize
non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier decision, and describe
it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses evaluating the
deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform distribution. Our KL terms
encourage high uncertainty of the model when the latter inputs the latent
non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a cross-entropy seeking a
foreground, where model confidence about class prediction is high; (ii) a KL
regularizer seeking a background, where model uncertainty is high; and (iii)
log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced segmentations. Comprehensive
experiments and ablation studies over the public GlaS colon cancer data and a
Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer show substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm the effect of our
new regularizers.

associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the
appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent
on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D
point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this
point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a
convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all

and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal

from such data to improve efficiency of inference in the clinical trial. Under
an exchangeability assumption about the potential outcome mean, we show that
the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating the average treatment effect
can be reduced by incorporating both the clinical trial data and external

improvement in efficiency is prominent especially when the external control
dataset has a large sample size and small variability. Our method allows for a
relaxed overlap assumption, and we illustrate with the case where the clinical
trial only contains a treated group. We also develop doubly robust and locally
efficient approaches that extrapolate the causal effect in the clinical trial
to the external population and the overall population. Our results also offer a
meaningful implication for trial design and data collection. We evaluate the

their even-parity counterparts exhibit regular hexagonal or rectangular

flamingo pattern becomes favorable, regardless of parity. Notably, the

Specifically, PCRP iteratively runs (1) E-step as determining the distribution
of prototypes by clustering action encoding from the encoder, and (2) M-step as
optimizing the encoder by minimizing the proposed ProtoMAE loss, which helps
simultaneously pull the action encoding closer to its assigned prototype and

current patterns. The detection occurred in the absence of any reported seismic
event but coincided with a strong atmospheric perturbation, which qualified the
event as meteo-tsunami. We re-analyze this case in the light of a new radar
signal processing method which was designed recently for inverting fast-varying
sea surface currents from the complex voltage time series received on the
antennas. This method, based on an Auto-regressive modeling combined with a
Maximum Entropy Method, yields a dramatic improvement in both the
Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the quality of the surface current estimation for
very short integration time. This makes it possible to evidence the propagation
of a sharp wave front of surface current during the event and to map its
magnitude and arrival time over the radar coverage. We show that the amplitude
and speed of the inferred residual current do not comply with a Proudman
resonance mechanism but are consistent with the propagation of a low-pressure
atmospheric front and wind vectors as revealed by satellite imagery. This
indicates that the event that triggered a tsunami alert is more likely a storm
surge than a true meteo-tsunami. Beyond this specific case, another outcome of
the analysis is the promising use of oceanographic radars as proxy's for the

typical values exceeding 30,000 km~s$^{-1}$ at 2 $-$ 3 days. We further analyze
the relation between %velocities of Si~II~$\lambda$6355 at maximum, $v_{\rm
Si,max}$, the velocity shift of late-time [Fe~II] lines ($v_{\rm [Fe~II]}$) and
host galaxy mass. We find that all HV objects have redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe~II]}$
while NV objects have both blue- and redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe~II]}$. It is
interesting to point out that the objects with redshifted $v_{\rm [Fe~II]}$ are
all located in massive galaxies, implying that HV and a portion of NV objects
may have similar progenitor metallicities and explosion mechanisms. We propose
that, with a geometric/projected effect, the He-detonation model may account
for the similarity in birthplace environment and the differences seen in some
SNe Ia, including $B-V$ colors, C~II feature, CaIR3 HVFs at early time and
$v_{\rm [Fe~II]}$ in the nebular phase. Nevertheless, some features predicted
by He-detonation simulation, such as the rapidly decreasing light curve,
deviate from the observations, and some NV objects with blueshifted nebular
$v_{\rm [Fe~II]}$ may involve other explosion mechanisms.

multi-Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) technique to obtain a single trained
channel estimation subnet that works well with different SNRs and employs a
deep residual network to reconstruct the channels, while the implicit network
directly compresses pilots and sends them back to reduce network parameters.

important for characterizing a wide range of phenomena, including combustor
ignition, sonar communication, and cloud formation. The physical mechanisms
driving the background flow also drive the time evolution of these
distributions. Accurate and robust identification and tracking algorithms for
the dispersed phase are necessary to reliably measure this evolution and
thereby quantify the underlying mechanisms in interface-resolving flow
simulations. The identification of individual bubbles and drops traditionally
relies on an algorithm used to identify connected regions. This traditional
algorithm can be sensitive to the presence of spurious structures. A
cost-effective refinement is proposed to maximize volume accuracy while
minimizing the identification of spurious bubbles and drops. An accurate
identification scheme is crucial for distinguishing bubble and drop pairs with
large size ratios. The identified bubbles and drops need to be tracked in time
to obtain breakup and coalescence statistics that characterize the evolution of
the size distribution, including breakup and coalescence frequencies, and the
probability distributions of parent and child bubble and drop sizes. An
algorithm based on mass conservation is proposed to construct bubble and drop
lineages using simulation snapshots that are not necessarily from consecutive
time-steps. These lineages are then used to detect breakup and coalescence
events, and obtain the desired statistics. Accurate identification of
large-size-ratio bubble and drop pairs enables accurate detection of breakup
and coalescence events over a large size range. Together, these algorithms
enable insights into the mechanisms behind bubble and drop formation and
evolution in flows of practical importance.

exploit, and what threats they expose. Another concerning issue in this domain
is the recent advancement in the quantum computing field, which imposes a
significant threat to the security aspects of many existing secure systems,

the existence of closure domain structures and, by increasing, supports the

coverage and energy efficiency by intelligently controlling the propagation

requires accurate channel estimation. Recent attempts to solve this problem
have considered the least-squares (LS) approach, which is simple but also
sub-optimal. The optimal channel estimator, based on the minimum
mean-squared-error (MMSE) criterion, is challenging to obtain and is non-linear
due to the non-Gaussianity of the effective channel seen at the receiver. Here
we present approaches to approximate the optimal MMSE channel estimator. As a
first approach, we analytically develop the best linear estimator, the LMMSE,
together with a corresponding majorization-minimization based algorithm
designed to optimize the LIS phase shift matrix during the training phase. This
estimator is shown to yield improved accuracy over the LS approach by
exploiting second-order statistical properties of the wireless channel and the
noise. To further improve performance and better approximate the
globally-optimal MMSE channel estimator, we propose data-driven non-linear
solutions based on deep learning. Specifically, by posing the MMSE channel
estimation problem as an image denoising problem, we propose two convolutional
neural network (CNN) based methods to perform the denoising and approximate the
optimal MMSE channel estimation solution. Our numerical results show that these
CNN-based estimators give superior performance compared with linear estimation
approaches. They also have low computational complexity requirements, thereby
motivating their potential use in future LIS-aided wireless communication

We introduce a linear derivative ratio family of models, $\mathrm{LDR}_1$, of
which the ratio of the first and the second derivatives of the expected SAC is
a linear function. A D1/D2 plot is proposed to detect this linear pattern in
the data. By extrapolation of the curve in the D1/D2 plot, a species richness

the SAC encompasses several popular parametric forms including the power law.

species with zero detection probability, and $\mathrm{RDR}_1$ where the
derivative ratio is a rational function. Real data are analyzed to demonstrate
the proposed methods. We also consider the scenario where we record only a few

the evolution of primordial electric fields, the electric and particle

the primordial electric fields dissipate by Landau damping effect on both large

differentiability. Those notions are adapted to the context of semiparametric
models by applying the inference theory of statistical functionals to the
functional that associates the value of the interest parameter to the

an optimality theory for estimation under semiparametric models. We present a

it is of central importance to quantitatively predict the dynamic magnetic
response of ferrofluids. Traditional dynamic theories, however, are often
restricted to the near-equilibrium regime and/or only apply to nearly ideal
ferrofluids that are monodisperse, dilute enough, and weakly interacting. In
this paper I develop a self-consistent and nonperturbative dynamical mean field
theory for typical ferrofluids which are often polydisperse, concentrated, and
strongly interacting, possibly driven far from equilibrium. I obtain a general
nonperturbative expression for the dynamic magnetic susceptibility,
quantitatively agreeing with the spectra obtained from Brownian Dynamics
simulations on both mono- and bidisperse samples. Furthermore, I derive a
generic magnetization relaxation equation (MRE) for both mono- and polydisperse
ferrofluids by employing the projection operator technique in nonequlibrium
statistical mechanics. This MRE is in simple closed form and independent of
which model is employed to approximate the equilibrium magnetization curve.
Existing models can be recovered as low-order approximations of my generic and
nonperturbative MRE. My theory can play a key role in studying the dynamics of

be essential in seeking true answer to the question. The final answer is
expected to appear in the era of multimessenger astronomy. It is emphasized too
that, besides the differences of global properties (e.g., mass-radius relation,
maximum mass, tidal deformability), the strong-bound surface of strange star
(rather than the gravity-bound one for conventional neutron star) could play an
important role in identifying a strange star by astronomical observations.

  Derivations for homogeneous, inhomogeneous, and polydisperse cases","28 pages, no figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Quite recently I have proposed a nonperturbative dynamical effective field
model (DEFM) to quantitatively describe the dynamics of interacting
ferrofluids. Its predictions compare very well with the results from
simulations. In this paper I put the DEFM on firm theoretical ground by
deriving it within the framework of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT),
in which the relevant part of correlation-induced free energy is approximated
by a function of the instantaneous magnetization. The DEFM is generalized to
inhomogeneous finite-size samples for which the macroscopic and mesoscopic
scale separation is nontrivial due to the presence of long-range dipole-dipole
interactions. The demagnetizing field naturally emerges from microscopic
considerations and is consistently accounted for. The resulting particle
dynamics on the mesoscopic scale only involves macroscopically local quantities
such as local magnetization and Maxwell field. Nevertheless, the local
demagnetizing field essentially couples to magnetization at distant macroscopic
locations. Thus, a two-scale parallel algorithm, involving information transfer
between different macroscopic locations, can be applied to fully resolve
particle rotational dynamics in an inhomogeneous sample. I also derive the DEFM
for polydisperse ferrofluids, in which the dynamics of particles belonging to
different species can be strongly coupled to each other. I discuss the
underlying assumptions in obtaining a thermodynamically consistent polydisperse
magnetization relaxation equation, which is of the same generic form as that
for monodisperse ferrofluids. The theoretical advances presented in this paper
are important for both qualitative understanding and quantitative modeling of
ferrofluid dynamics.

multi-objective normal form games with non-linear utility functions under the

actor-critic and policy gradient formulations to allow reinforcement learning
of mixed strategies in this setting, along with extensions that incorporate
opponent policy reconstruction and learning with opponent learning awareness
(i.e., learning while considering the impact of one's policy when anticipating
the opponent's learning step). Empirical results in five different MONFGs
demonstrate that opponent learning awareness and modelling can drastically
alter the learning dynamics in this setting. When equilibria are present,
opponent modelling can confer significant benefits on agents that implement it.
When there are no Nash equilibria, opponent learning awareness and modelling
allows agents to still converge to meaningful solutions that approximate

Ekman friction, stable stratification, magnetohydrodynamics, and solution with

  proper relaxation time and effects of dynamic correlations","28 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The recently proposed dynamical effective field model (DEFM) is
quantitatively accurate for describing dynamical magnetic response of
ferrofluids. In paper I it is derived under the framework of dynamical density
functional theory, via which the original ensemble of bare Brownian particles
is mapped to an ensemble of dressed particles. However, it remains to clarify
how the characteristic rotational relaxation time of a dressed particle,
denoted by $\tau_r$, is quantitatively related to that of a bare particle,
denoted by $\tau^0_r$. By building macro-micro connections via two different
routes, I reveal that under some gentle assumptions $\tau_r$ can be identified
with the long-time rotational self-diffusion time. I further introduce two
simple but useful integrated correlation factors, describing the effects of
quasi-static (adiabatic) and dynamic (nonadiabatic) inter-particle
correlations, respectively. In terms of both correlation factors I reformulate
the dynamic magnetic susceptibility in an illuminating and elegant form.
Remarkably, it shows that the macro-micro connection is established via two
successive steps: a dynamical coarse-graining with nonadiabatic effects
accounted for by the dynamic factor, followed by equilibrium statistical
mechanical averaging captured by the static factor. Surprisingly,
$\tau_r/\tau^0_r$ is found insensitive to changes of particle volume fraction.
I provide a physical picture to explain it. Furthermore, an empirical formula
is proposed to characterize the dependence of $\tau_r/\tau^0_r$ on
dipole-dipole interaction strength. The DEFM supplemented with this formula
leads to parameter-free predictions in good agreement with results from
Brownian dynamics simulations. The theoretical developments presented in this
paper may have important consequences to studies of ferrofluid dynamics in
particular and other systems modelled by DDFTs in general.

neural network is trained once to detect a set of anatomical landmarks on
simulated X-rays. A domain randomization scheme is proposed to enable the
network to overcome the challenge of being trained purely on simulated data and
run inference on real Xrays. Then, for each patient CT, a patient-specific
landmark extraction scheme is used. It is based on backprojecting and
clustering the previously trained networks predictions on a set of simulated
X-rays. Next, the network is retrained to detect the new landmarks. Finally the
combination of network and 3D landmark locations is used to compute the
initialization using a perspective-n-point algorithm. During the computation of
the pose, a weighting scheme is introduced to incorporate the confidence of the
network in detecting the landmarks. The algorithm is evaluated on the pelvis
using both real and simulated x-rays. The mean (+-standard deviation) target
registration error in millimetres is 4.1 +- 4.3 for simulated X-rays with a

number of colors is to start from any arbitrary proper coloring and then repeat
some local re-coloring techniques to reduce the number of color classes. The
Grundy (First-Fit) coloring and color-dominating colorings of graphs are two
well-known such techniques. The color-dominating colorings are also known and
commonly referred as {\rm b}-colorings. But these two topics have been studied
separately in graph theory. We introduce a new coloring procedure which
combines the strategies of these two techniques and satisfies an additional
property. We first prove that the vertices of every graph $G$ can be
effectively colored using color classes say $C_1, \ldots, C_k$ such that $(i)$
for any two colors $i$ and $j$ with $1\leq i< j \leq k$, any vertex of color
$j$ is adjacent to a vertex of color $i$, $(ii)$ there exists a set $\{u_1,
\ldots, u_k\}$ of vertices of $G$ such that $u_j\in C_j$ for any $j\in \{1,
\ldots, k\}$ and $u_k$ is adjacent to $u_j$ for each $1\leq j \leq k$ with
$j\not= k$, and $(iii)$ for each $i$ and $j$ with $i\not= j$, the vertex $u_j$
has a neighbor in $C_i$. This provides a new vertex coloring heuristic which
improves both Grundy and color-dominating colorings. Denote by $z(G)$ the
maximum number of colors used in any proper vertex coloring satisfying the
above properties. The $z(G)$ quantifies the worst-case behavior of the
heuristic. We prove the existence of $\{G_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ such that $\min
\{\Gamma(G_n), b(G_n)\} \rightarrow \infty$ but $z(G_n)\leq 3$ for each $n$.
For each positive integer $t$ we construct a family of finitely many colored
graphs ${\mathcal{D}}_t$ satisfying the property that if $z(G)\geq t$ for a
graph $G$ then $G$ contains an element from ${\mathcal{D}}_t$ as a colored
subgraph. This provides an algorithmic method for proving numeric upper bounds
for $z(G)$.

compact bodies is typically challenging. The Newman-Janis algorithm provides a
procedure to obtain rotating spacetimes from a static, spherically symmetric,
seed metric. It is not guaranteed, however, that the resulting rotating
spacetime solves the same field equations as the seed. Moreover, the former may
not be circular, and thus expressible in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates.
Amongst the variations of the original procedure, a modified Newman-Janis
algorithm (MNJA) has been proposed that, by construction, originates a
circular, spinning spacetime, expressible in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates.
As a down side, the procedure introduces an ambiguity, that requires extra
assumptions on the matter content of the model. In this paper we observe that
the rotating spacetimes obtained through the MNJA always admit separability of
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the case of null geodesics, in which case,
moreover, the aforementioned ambiguity has no impact, since it amounts to an
overall metric conformal factor. We also show that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
for light rays propagating in a plasma admits separability if the plasma
frequency obeys a certain constraint. As an illustration, we compute the shadow
and lensing of some spinning black holes obtained by the MNJA.

thermal equilibrium, their behavior in nonequilibrium is still elusive. By
measuring the ac susceptibility of a graphene-superconductor junction under

Josephson effect as irradiation frequency is larger than relaxation rate.
Notably, when irradiation frequency further increases above the minigap, the
dissipation is enhanced at phase 0 where the minigap is largest and dissipation
is minimum in equilibrium. We argue that this is evidence of the nonequilibrium

continue to suffer from restrictions such as the limited pairs of qubits that

and moving qubits to suitable positions for the interaction (known as quantum
circuit mapping). However, this movement requires additional gates to be
incorporated into the circuit, whose number should be kept as small as possible
since each gate increases the likelihood of errors and decoherence.
State-of-the-art mapping methods utilize swapping and bridging to move the
qubits along the static paths of the coupling map---solving this problem
without exploiting all means the quantum domain has to offer. In this paper, we
propose to additionally exploit quantum teleportation as a possible
complementary method. Quantum teleportation conceptually allows to move the
state of a qubit over arbitrary long distances with constant

Aims. Using the data of the WINGS database and those of the Illustris

of the $\log(L)$-$\log(\sigma)$ relation Methods. We simulate the distribution

The artificial distribution obtained assuming that beta spans either positive

superposed to the observational data, once it is postulated that the Zone of

We have demonstrated that the distribution of galaxies in the $\log(\langle

the galaxies of different luminosity, but originate from the mass assembly

methodology - Frequency Compensated Memory Packing (FCMP) - which improves the
OCM utilization efficiency of dataflow accelerators with minimal reduction in

validate our methodology, we apply it to several realizations of medium-sized
CIFAR-10 inference accelerators and demonstrate up to 30% reduction in OCM
utilization without loss of inference throughput, allowing us to port the
accelerators from Xilinx Zynq 7020 to 7012S, reducing application cost. We also
implement a custom dataflow FPGA inference accelerator for a quantized
ResNet-50 CNN, utilizing on-chip weights, the largest topology ever implemented
with this accelerator architecture. We demonstrate that by applying FCMP to the
ResNet accelerator, the OCM bottleneck is alleviated which enables the
accelerator to be ported from Alveo U250 to the smaller Alveo U280 board with
less throughput loss compared to alternative techniques. By providing a
finer-grained trade off between throughput and OCM requirements, FCMP increases

stochastic co-optimisation model is proposed. The model is accurately
approximated by sequential mixed integer second-order cone programming, which
can then be solved in parallel and decentralised manners by leveraging
generalised Benders decomposition. Since the price formation and settlement
issues have rarely been investigated for integrated electricity-gas systems in
an uncertainty setting, a novel concept of expected locational marginal value
is proposed to credit the flexibility of PtGs that helps hedging uncertainties.
By comparing with a deterministic model and a distributionally robust model,
the advantage of the proposed stochastic model and the efficiency of the

settlement for PtGs are presented, showing that the expected locational
marginal value can fairly credit the contribution of PtGs and reflect the

enhancement of the security of the beyond fifth generation (B5G) access network
becomes of critical importance. Despite the strengthening of 5G security
protocols with respect to LTE, there are still open issues that have not yet
been fully addressed. In parallel as we move gradually away from the standard
client-server networking paradigm and enter a new era of truly E2E quality of
service (QoS), service level agreements (SLAs) in the near future will be
expected to include guarantees about the quality of security (QoSec) as well.
Incorporating context awareness in QoSec is projected to allow handle more
efficiently aspects related to identifying the risk or threat level and the
required security level. Finally, as novel sensing and intelligence
capabilities are envisioned in 6G, security solutions from the palette of
physical layer security can emerge, particularly for massive machine type
communications involving large scale low-end IoT devices.

used to solve the corresponding full order models (FOMs). The efficiency is
achieved by developing a hyper-reduction technique in the context of the

appear to be isolated. Taken at face value, this suggests that most massive
binaries break apart due to strong natal kicks received in supernova
explosions. However, the observed binary fraction can still be subject to
strong selection effects, as monitoring of newly discovered pulsars is rarely
carried out for long enough to conclusively rule out multiplicity. Here, we use
the second Gaia Data Release (DR2) to search for companions to 1534
rotation-powered pulsars with positions known to better than 0.5 arcseconds. We
find 22 matches to known pulsars, including one not reported elsewhere, and 8
new possible companions to young pulsars. We examine the photometric and
kinematic properties of these systems and provide empirical relations for
identifying Gaia sources with potential millisecond pulsar companions. Our
results confirm that the observed multiplicity fraction is small. However, we
show that the number of binaries below the sensitivity of Gaia and radio timing
in our sample could still be significantly higher. We constrain the binary
fraction of young pulsars to be $f_{\rm young}^{\rm true}\leq 5.3(8.3)\%$ under
realistic(conservative) assumptions for the binary properties and current
sensitivity thresholds. For massive stars ($\geq 10$ M$_{\odot}$) in
particular, we find $f_{\rm OB}^{\rm true}\leq 3.7\%$ which sets a firm
independent upper limit on the galactic neutron-star merger rate, $\leq
7.2\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$. Ongoing and future projects such as the
CHIME/pulsar program, MeerTime, HIRAX and ultimately the SKA, will
significantly improve these constraints in the future.

one-spin as an open quantum system, the rest of the spins play the role of its
environment. By choosing different initial states, we studied the dynamics of
the entanglement between the open quantum system and its environment. In the
initial state, the state of the open quantum system is a superposition of up

entanglement is observed in the whole range of interactions as an indicator of
non-Markovian dynamics. Our exact results revealed that non-Markovian behavior
is independent of the initial state. By tuning the initial state, the open
quantum system will be completely entangled with the environment at a special

knowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces has recently attracted
increasing interest in knowledge base completion. However, in most existing
embedding methods, only fact triplets are utilized, and logical rules have not
been thoroughly studied for the knowledge base completion task. To overcome the
problem, we propose an association rules enhanced knowledge graph attention
network (AR-KGAT). The AR-KGAT captures both entity and relation features for
high-order neighborhoods of any given entity in an end-to-end manner under the
graph attention network framework. The major component of AR-KGAT is an encoder
of an effective neighborhood aggregator, which addresses the problems by
aggregating neighbors with both association-rules-based and graph-based
attention weights. Additionally, the proposed model also encapsulates the
representations from multi-hop neighbors of nodes to refine their embeddings.
The decoder enables AR-KGAT to be translational between entities and relations
while keeping the superior link prediction performance. A logic-like inference
pattern is utilized as constraints for knowledge graph embedding. Then, the
global loss is minimized over both atomic and complex formulas to achieve the
embedding task. In this manner, we learn embeddings compatible with triplets
and rules, which are certainly more predictive for knowledge acquisition and
inference. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: WN18RR
and FB15k-237, for two knowledge graph completion tasks: the link prediction
and triplet classification to evaluate the proposed AR-KGAT model. The results
show that the proposed AR-KGAT model achieves significant and consistent

transmission. This problem is challenging to be solved due to the requirement
of analytically tractable channel models and the non-convex characteristic as
well. To address the challenges, we propose a novel power control algorithm,
which constructs analytically tractable channel models based on DNN estimation
results and explores a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) scheme to tackle the
non-convexity. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the DNN
estimation and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

prediction of compound-protein affinity and contact (CPAC) could help
accelerate drug discovery. In this study we consider proteins as multi-modal
data including 1D amino-acid sequences and (sequence-predicted) 2D residue-pair
contact maps. We empirically evaluate the embeddings of the two single
modalities in their accuracy and generalizability of CPAC prediction (i.e.
structure-free interpretable compound-protein affinity prediction). And we
rationalize their performances in both challenges of embedding individual
modalities and learning generalizable embedding-label relationship. We further
propose two models involving cross-modality protein embedding and establish
that the one with cross interaction (thus capturing correlations among
modalities) outperforms SOTAs and our single modality models in affinity,
contact, and binding-site predictions for proteins never seen in the training
set.

system based on the (2+1)-dimensional fractional Schr\""odinger equation,
characterized by its L\'evy index (LI). By means of numerical methods, we
explore propagation dynamics of the beams with vorticities from 0 to 4. The
propagation leads to abrupt autofocusing, followed by its reversal (rebound
from the center). It is shown that LI, the relative width of the Airy and
Gaussian factors, and the vorticity determine properties of the autofocusing
dynamics, including the focusing distance, radius of the focal light spot, and
peak intensity at the focus. A maximum of the peak intensity is attained at
intermediate values of LI, close to LI=1.4 . Dynamics of the abrupt
autofocusing of Airy-Gaussian beams carrying vortex pairs (split double
vortices) is considered too.

optimisation problems. In this paper a quadratic problem in finance is taken,
the Portfolio Optimisation problem. Here, a set of assets is chosen for
investment, such that the total risk is minimised, a minimum return is realised
and a budget constraint is met. This problem is solved for several instances in
two main indices, the Nikkei225 and the S\&P500 index, using the
state-of-the-art implementation of D-Wave's quantum annealer and its hybrid
solvers. The results are benchmarked against conventional, state-of-the-art,
commercially available tooling. Results show that for problems of the size of
the used instances, the D-Wave solution, in its current, still limited size,
comes already close to the performance of commercial solvers.

  for Object Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-task learning is widely used in computer vision. Currently, object
detection models utilize shared feature map to complete classification and
localization tasks simultaneously. By comparing the performance between the
original Faster R-CNN and that with partially separated feature maps, we show
that: (1) Sharing high-level features for the classification and localization
tasks is sub-optimal; (2) Large stride is beneficial for classification but
harmful for localization; (3) Global context information could improve the
performance of classification. Based on these findings, we proposed a paradigm
called Gap-optimized region based convolutional network (G-RCN), which aims to
separating these two tasks and optimizing the gap between them. The paradigm
was firstly applied to correct the current ResNet protocol by simply reducing
the stride and moving the Conv5 block from the head to the feature extraction
network, which brings 3.6 improvement of AP70 on the PASCAL VOC dataset and 1.5
improvement of AP on the COCO dataset for ResNet50. Next, the new method is
applied on the Faster R-CNN with backbone of VGG16,ResNet50 and ResNet101,
which brings above 2.0 improvement of AP70 on the PASCAL VOC dataset and above
1.9 improvement of AP on the COCO dataset. Noticeably, the implementation of
G-RCN only involves a few structural modifications, with no extra module added.

vortex beams (CAGVBs) in a (2+1)-dimesional optical system discribed by
fractional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (FNSE). By combining fractional
diffraction with nonlinear effects, the abruptly autofocusing effect becomes
weaker, the radius of the focusing beams becomes bigger and the autofocusing
length will be shorter with increase of fractional diffraction L\'evy index. It
has been found that the abruptly autofocusing effect becomes weaker and the
abruptly autofocusing length becomes longer if distribution factor of CAGVBs
increases for fixing the L\'evy index. The roles of the input power and the
topological charge in determining the autofocusing properties are also
discussed. Then, we have found the CAGVBs with outward acceleration and shown
the autodefocusing properties. Finally, the off-axis CAGVBs with positive
vortex pairs in the FNSE optical system have shown interesting features during
propagation.
