type holographic dark energy. However, for specific choice of free parameters
$(\omega = -\frac{3}{2}\;\; \&\;\; n = -1)$ which are differ from its values
fixed in Ghaffari et al \textcolor{blue}{[Ghaffari et al. Euro. Phys. J. C

Universe in derived model, the power law variation of $\phi$ with $a$ leads to
consistent results. Further, we notice that the energy conservation law for
Tsallis holographic dark energy in Brans-Dicke gravity does not hold.

  Transferring from GANs","NeurIPS2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image-to-image translation has recently achieved remarkable results. But
despite current success, it suffers from inferior performance when translations
between classes require large shape changes. We attribute this to the
high-resolution bottlenecks which are used by current state-of-the-art
image-to-image methods. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel deep
hierarchical Image-to-Image Translation method, called DeepI2I. We learn a
model by leveraging hierarchical features: (a) structural information contained
in the shallow layers and (b) semantic information extracted from the deep
layers. To enable the training of deep I2I models on small datasets, we propose
a novel transfer learning method, that transfers knowledge from pre-trained
GANs. Specifically, we leverage the discriminator of a pre-trained GANs (i.e.
BigGAN or StyleGAN) to initialize both the encoder and the discriminator and
the pre-trained generator to initialize the generator of our model. Applying
knowledge transfer leads to an alignment problem between the encoder and
generator. We introduce an adaptor network to address this. On many-class
image-to-image translation on three datasets (Animal faces, Birds, and Foods)
we decrease mFID by at least 35% when compared to the state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that transfer
learning significantly improves the performance of I2I systems, especially for
small datasets. Finally, we are the first to perform I2I translations for
domains with over 100 classes.

  Guarantee","Published in ICML 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In safe reinforcement learning (SRL) problems, an agent explores the
environment to maximize an expected total reward and meanwhile avoids violation
of certain constraints on a number of expected total costs. In general, such
SRL problems have nonconvex objective functions subject to multiple nonconvex
constraints, and hence are very challenging to solve, particularly to provide a
globally optimal policy. Many popular SRL algorithms adopt a primal-dual
structure which utilizes the updating of dual variables for satisfying the
constraints. In contrast, we propose a primal approach, called
constraint-rectified policy optimization (CRPO), which updates the policy
alternatingly between objective improvement and constraint satisfaction. CRPO
provides a primal-type algorithmic framework to solve SRL problems, where each
policy update can take any variant of policy optimization step. To demonstrate
the theoretical performance of CRPO, we adopt natural policy gradient (NPG) for
each policy update step and show that CRPO achieves an
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate to the global optimal policy in the
constrained policy set and an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ error bound on
constraint satisfaction. This is the first finite-time analysis of primal SRL
algorithms with global optimality guarantee. Our empirical results demonstrate
that CRPO can outperform the existing primal-dual baseline algorithms
significantly.

applications, spanning from image classification to speech recognition. While
providing excellent accuracy, they often have enormous compute and memory
requirements. As a result of this, quantized neural networks (QNNs) are
increasingly being adopted and deployed especially on embedded devices, thanks
to their high accuracy, but also since they have significantly lower compute
and memory requirements compared to their floating point equivalents. QNN
deployment is also being evaluated for safety-critical applications, such as
automotive, avionics, medical or industrial. These systems require functional
safety, guaranteeing failure-free behaviour even in the presence of hardware
faults. In general fault tolerance can be achieved by adding redundancy to the
system, which further exacerbates the overall computational demands and makes
it difficult to meet the power and performance requirements. In order to
decrease the hardware cost for achieving functional safety, it is vital to
explore domain-specific solutions which can exploit the inherent features of
DNNs. In this work we present a novel methodology called fault-aware training
(FAT), which includes error modeling during neural network (NN) training, to
make QNNs resilient to specific fault models on the device. Our experiments
show that by injecting faults in the convolutional layers during training,
highly accurate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained which
exhibits much better error tolerance compared to the original. Furthermore, we
show that redundant systems which are built from QNNs trained with FAT achieve
higher worse-case accuracy at lower hardware cost. This has been validated for
numerous classification tasks including CIFAR10, GTSRB, SVHN and ImageNet.

However, the validity of the equivalence principle has only been established on

dynamics on cosmological scales. Here we show how the equivalence principle may

use of the imprint on the galaxy cross-power spectrum and bispectrum by the
parity-violating general relativistic deformations of the past-light cone, and
assumes that galaxies can be treated as test particles that are made of baryons
and cold dark matter. This assumption leads to a non-zero galaxy-baryon
relative velocity if the equivalence principle does not hold between baryons
and dark matter. We show that the relative velocity can be constrained to be
less than 28% of the galaxy velocity using the cross-power spectrum of the HI

However, a key challenge is that no data is available about the effect of such
a prospective intervention since it has not been deployed yet. In this work, we
propose a split-treatment analysis that ranks the individuals most likely to be
positively affected by a prospective intervention using past observational
data. Unlike standard causal inference methods, the split-treatment method does
not need any observations of the target treatments themselves. Instead it
relies on observations of a proxy treatment that is caused by the target
treatment. Under reasonable assumptions, we show that the ranking of
heterogeneous causal effect based on the proxy treatment is the same as the
ranking based on the target treatment's effect. In the absence of any
interventional data for cross-validation, Split-Treatment uses sensitivity
analyses for unobserved confounding to select model parameters. We apply
Split-Treatment to both a simulated data and a large-scale, real-world
targeting task and validate our discovered rankings via a randomized experiment
for the latter.

that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$-fraction of errors with list

both encoding and list decoding can be performed in fully polynomial-time

Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield

be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a BTT evasive

medium for satisfying ever-increasing data storage needs. However, the
diversity of errors that occur in DNA sequences makes efficient
error-correction a challenging task. This paper aims to address simultaneously
correcting two types of errors, namely, short tandem duplication and
substitution errors. We focus on tandem repeats of length at most 3 and design
codes for correcting an arbitrary number of duplication errors and one
substitution error. Because a substituted symbol can be duplicated many times
(as part of substrings of various lengths), a single substitution can affect an
unbounded substring of the retrieved word. However, we show that with
appropriate preprocessing, the effect may be limited to a substring of finite
length, thus making efficient error-correction possible. We construct a code
for correcting the aforementioned errors and provide lower bounds for its rate.
Compared to optimal codes correcting only duplication errors, numerical results
show that the asymptotic cost of protecting against an additional substitution
is only 0.003 bits/symbol when the alphabet has size 4, an important case
corresponding to data storage in DNA.

govern dust formation in the extended envelope of these stars. The results
obtained from the comparative study are also compared with the predictions of a
model for silicate dust condensation solely based on laboratory data and basic
stellar properties. The infrared emission in the wavelength range between 6 and

iron-bearing silicates, alumina, and metallic iron dust particles for all nine
objects. The observed spectra obtained from three objects, mu Cep, RW Cyg, and
RS Per, can be reproduced by a stationary and (essentially) spherically
symmetric outflow which enables a direct comparison with predictions from a
theoretical dust growth model. The temperature at the onset of massive silicate
dust growth is of the order of 920 K and the corresponding outflow velocity of
the order of the sound velocity for these objects. The condensation temperature
suggests that the silicate dust grows on the corundum dust grains that are
formed well in the interior of the silicate dust shell at a much higher
temperature. Our results propose that regarding the two major problems of dust
formation in stellar outflows: (i) formation of seed nuclei; (ii) their growth

with a variety of parton-shower models. Herwig and PYTHIA 8 based models
describe the data well for the higher $j_{\rm T}$ region, while they
underestimate the lower $j_{\rm T}$ region. The $j_{\rm T}$ distributions are
further characterised by fitting them with a function composed of an inverse
gamma function for higher $j_{\rm T}$ values (called the ""wide component""),
related to the perturbative component of the fragmentation process, and with a
Gaussian for lower $j_{\rm T}$ values (called the ""narrow component""),
predominantly connected to the hadronisation process. The width of the Gaussian
has only a weak dependence on jet transverse momentum, while that of the
inverse gamma function increases with increasing jet transverse momentum. For
the narrow component, the measured trends are successfully described by all
models except for Herwig. For the wide component, Herwig and PYTHIA 8 based
models slightly underestimate the data for the higher jet transverse momentum
region. These measurements set constraints on models of jet fragmentation and
hadronisation.

raises serious security concerns about model privacy. However, protecting model
privacy without losing access to the untrusted AI accelerators is a challenging

ShadowNet. ShadowNet protects the model privacy with Trusted Execution

model to the untrusted hardware accelerators. ShadowNet achieves this by
transforming the weights of the linear layers before outsourcing them and
restoring the results inside the TEE. The non-linear layers are also kept
secure inside the TEE. ShadowNet's design ensures efficient transformation of
the weights and the subsequent restoration of the results. We build a ShadowNet
prototype based on TensorFlow Lite and evaluate it on five popular CNNs,
namely, MobileNet, ResNet-44, MiniVGG, ResNet-404, and YOLOv4-tiny. Our
evaluation shows that ShadowNet achieves strong security guarantees with
reasonable performance, offering a practical solution for secure on-device

originating in the 1930s and 40s, primarily in the attempts by Werner
Heisenberg and Richard Feynman to find a new theory of relativistic quantum

these attempts formed the conceptual inspiration and the provided the formal

transformation of quantum field theory is interpreted as a paradigm shift in a
weak sense, where the foundations of the theory remain the same, while the
paradigmatic problem to be calculated changes (in this case from energy levels
to scattering amplitudes).

currents are capacitive when the graphene channel is doped by holes and
Faradaic when it is doped by electrons in field-effect measurements. The
Faradaic current is attributed to a reduction of oxygen dissolved in the

helium in the deceleration of crystal motion. The pressure measurements in the

the fall of a crystal. The pressure drop exceeds the difference in the
hydrostatic pressure between the initial and final positions of the crystal.
After the stop, the pressure in the container relaxes to the difference

Dense Basis codes using available optical/IR data. Modeling deep IR photometry
has the potential to constrain the galaxy's Lyman continuum (LyC) escape
fraction (\fesc). We use the modeled nebular emission lines and find that the
implied escape fractions ranges from \textbf{0 to 0.8 with a median of
$\sim$0.35 for Dense Basis and $\sim$0.55 for CIGALE.} Significant
uncertainties in the data exist, so that fitting results in a large range of
\fesc\ for individual objects. The implied median \fesc-values may be high
enough for galaxies to finish reionization by $z\sim6$. Furthermore, we find no
strong trends between the UV-slope $\beta$ or \EBminV with model \fesc. If
true, the lack of trends suggest that other factors besides nebular emission or
dust extinction could have led to LyC escaping, such as the presence of holes
in the ISM with sufficiently wide opening angles from outflows of supernovae
and/or weak AGN, resulting in a range of implied \fesc-values depending on the

  Edge Computing","14 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, edge computing has become a popular choice for
latency-sensitive applications like facial recognition and augmented reality
because it is closer to the end users compared to the cloud. Although
infrastructure providers are working toward creating managed edge networks,
personal devices such as laptops and tablets, which are widely available and
are underutilized, can also be used as potential edge devices. We call such
devices Unmanaged Edge Devices (UEDs). Scheduling application tasks on such an
unmanaged edge system is not straightforward because of three fundamental
reasons-heterogeneity in the computational capacity of the UEDs, uncertainty in
the availability of the UEDs (due to devices leaving the system), and
interference among multiple tasks sharing a UED. In this paper, we present
I-BOT, an interference-based orchestration scheme for latency-sensitive tasks
on an Unmanaged Edge Platform (UEP). It minimizes the completion time of
applications and is bandwidth efficient. I-BOT brings forth three innovations.
First, it profiles and predicts the interference patterns of the tasks to make
scheduling decisions. Second, it uses a feedback mechanism to adjust for
changes in the computational capacity of the UEDs and a prediction mechanism to
handle their sporadic exits. Third, it accounts for input dependence of tasks
in its scheduling decision (such as, two tasks requiring the same input data).
To evaluate I-BOT, we run end-to-end simulations with applications representing
autonomous driving, composed of multiple tasks. We compare to two basic
baselines (random and round-robin) and two state-of-the-arts, Lavea [SEC-2017]
and Petrel [MSN-2018]. Compared to these baselines, I-BOT significantly reduces
the average service time of application tasks. This reduction is more
pronounced in dynamic heterogeneous environments, which would be the case in a
UEP.

$Q$-learning, learn optimal policies from datasets of actions, rewards, and
state transitions. However, when the underlying state transition dynamics are
stochastic and evolve on a high-dimensional space, generating independent and
identically distributed (IID) data samples for creating these datasets poses a
significant challenge due to the intractability of the associated normalizing
integral. In these scenarios, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling offers a
computationally tractable way to generate data for training RL algorithms. In
this paper, we introduce a framework, called \textit{Hamiltonian $Q$-Learning},
that demonstrates, both theoretically and empirically, that $Q$ values can be
learned from a dataset generated by HMC samples of actions, rewards, and state
transitions. Furthermore, to exploit the underlying low-rank structure of the
$Q$ function, Hamiltonian $Q$-Learning uses a matrix completion algorithm for
reconstructing the updated $Q$ function from $Q$ value updates over a much
smaller subset of state-action pairs. Thus, by providing an efficient way to
apply $Q$-learning in stochastic, high-dimensional settings, the proposed
approach broadens the scope of RL algorithms for real-world applications.

services, including e-commerce and video streaming, where items to buy, watch,

why a user might like the recommended item, has been shown to improve user
satisfaction and persuasiveness of the recommendation. In this paper, we
develop a method for generating post-hoc justifications that can be applied to
the output of any recommendation algorithm. Existing post-hoc methods are often
limited in providing diverse justifications, as they either use only one of
many available types of input data, or rely on the predefined templates. We
address these limitations of earlier approaches by developing J-Recs, a method
for producing concise and diverse justifications. J-Recs is a recommendation
model-agnostic method that generates diverse justifications based on various
types of product and user data (e.g., purchase history and product attributes).
The challenge of jointly processing multiple types of data is addressed by
designing a principled graph-based approach for justification generation. In
addition to theoretical analysis, we present an extensive evaluation on
synthetic and real-world data. Our results show that J-Recs satisfies desirable
properties of justifications, and efficiently produces effective
justifications, matching user preferences up to 20% more accurately than

practical communication systems. In the common randomness framework, both
sender and receiver aim to generate a common random variable observable to
both, ideally with low error probability. The knowledge of this CR allows us to
implement correlated random protocols that can lead to faster and more
efficient algorithms. Previous work on CR focused on Single-Input Single-Output
(SISO) channels with finite input and output alphabets. As far as we know, no
results on continuous and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels have
yet been established. We characterize CR over Gaussian channels for their
practical relevance in many communication situations. We first derive the CR
capacity for Gaussian SISO channels. This result is then used for the
derivation of the CR capacity in the MIMO case. CR plays a key role in the
identification scheme. In contrast to the classical transmission, the decoder
is now interested in knowing \emph{whether} a specific message was sent or not,
rather than knowing \emph{what} the received message is. In many new
applications such as several machine-to-machine and human-to-machine systems
and the tactile internet, the identification, also called the post-Shannon
scheme, is more efficient than the classical transmission. It has been proved
that through CR generation, the post-Shannon communication task allows us to
achieve an enormous performance gain that we can take advantage of in several
applications.

to achieve error $\alpha$, needs to be exponentially depending on the
dimensionality $p$ for general loss functions. In this paper, we make two
attempts to resolve this issue by investigating conditions on the loss
functions that allow us to remove such a limit. In our first attempt, we show
that if the loss function is $(\infty, T)$-smooth, by using the Bernstein
polynomial approximation we can avoid the exponential dependency in the term of
$\alpha$. We then propose player-efficient algorithms with $1$-bit
communication complexity and $O(1)$ computation cost for each player. The error
bound of these algorithms is asymptotically the same as the original one. With
some additional assumptions, we also give an algorithm which is more efficient
for the server. In our second attempt, we show that for any $1$-Lipschitz
generalized linear convex loss function, there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-LDP
algorithm whose sample complexity for achieving error $\alpha$ is only linear
in the dimensionality $p$. Our results use a polynomial of inner product
approximation technique. Finally, motivated by the idea of using polynomial
approximation and based on different types of polynomial approximations, we
propose (efficient) non-interactive locally differentially private algorithms
for learning the set of k-way marginal queries and the set of smooth queries.

populations of clumps and young stellar objects (YSOs) in this region whose
rich YSO population has shown evidence of sequential star formation. We
separated the Herschel column density map of NGC 2264 in three subregions and
compared their cloud power spectra using a multiscale segmentation technique.
We identified in the whole NGC 2264 cloud a population of 256 clumps with
typical sizes of ~0.1 pc and masses ranging from 0.08 Msun to 53 Msun. Although
clumps have been detected all over the cloud, the central subregion of NGC 2264
concentrates most of the massive, bound clumps. The local surface density and
the mass segregation ratio indeed indicate a strong degree of mass segregation
for the 15 most massive clumps, with a median $\Sigma_6$ three time that of the
whole clumps population and $\Lambda_{MSR}$ about 8. We showed that this
cluster of massive clumps is forming within a high-density cloud ridge, itself
formed and probably still fed by the high concentration of gas observed on
larger scales in the central subregion. The time sequence obtained from the
combined study of the clump and YSO populations in NGC 2264 suggests that the
star formation started in the northern subregion, that it is now actively
developing at the center and will soon start in the southern subregion. Taken
together, the cloud structure and the clump and YSO populations in NGC 2264

adopted in order to suppress errors to any desired level $E$ at a cost in
qubit-count $n$ that is merely poly-logarithmic in $1/E$. However in the NISQ
era, the complexity and scale required to adopt even the smallest QEC is
prohibitive. Instead, error mitigation techniques have been employed; typically
these do not require an increase in qubit-count but cannot provide exponential
error suppression. Here we show that, for the crucial case of estimating
expectation values of observables (key to almost all NISQ algorithms) one can
indeed achieve an effective exponential suppression. We introduce the Error
Suppression by Derangement (ESD) approach: by increasing the qubit count by a
factor of $n\geq 2$, the error is suppressed exponentially as $Q^n$ where $Q<1$
is a suppression factor that depends on the entropy of the errors. The ESD
approach takes $n$ independently-prepared circuit outputs and applies a
controlled derangement operator to create a state whose symmetries prevent
erroneous states from contributing to expected values. The approach is
therefore `NISQ-friendly' as it is modular in the main computation and requires
only a shallow circuit that bridges the $n$ copies immediately prior to
measurement. Imperfections in our derangement circuit do degrade performance
and therefore we propose an approach to mitigate this effect to arbitrary
precision due to the remarkable properties of derangements. a) they decompose
into a linear number of elementary gates -- limiting the impact of noise b)
they are highly resilient to noise and the effect of imperfections on them is
(almost) trivial. In numerical simulations validating our approach we confirm
error suppression below $10^{-6}$ for circuits consisting of several hundred

spread the fluctuation maxima in such a way that its low temperature part
effectively reaches the zero temperature, where the fluctuations inevitably
become quantum. The behavior of low temperature branches of the heat capacity
of the samples suggests that a gradual transition from classical to quantum
fluctuations can be described by a simple power function of temperature with
the exponent less than one. The $d\rho/dT$ data generally support this
suggestion. The values of the heat capacity exponents immediately lead to the
diverging ratio $C_p/T$ and hence to the diverging effective electron mass. We
found out that at large concentration of the dopant there are no distinct phase
transition points. What we observe is a cloud of the helical fluctuations
spreading over a significant range of concentrations and temperatures, which
become quantum close to 0~K.

the sky at constant declination. We describe the design, calibration, noise
level, and stability of this instrument based on the analysis of about $\sim 5
\%$ of 6,200 hours of on-sky observations through October, 2019. Beam pattern
determinations using drones and the transit of bright sources are in good
agreement, and compatible with electromagnetic simulations. Combining all the
baselines, we make maps around bright sources and show that the array behaves
as expected. A few hundred hours of observations at different declinations have
been used to study the array geometry and pointing imperfections, as well as
the instrument noise behaviour. We show that the system temperature is below
80~K for most feed antennas, and that noise fluctuations decrease as expected
with integration time, at least up to a few hundred seconds. Analysis of long
integrations, from 10 nights of observations of the North Celestial Pole,
yielded visibilities with amplitudes of 20-30~mK, consistent with the expected

packet-processing systems. It is based on an elegant design with high-level
abstractions like parsers and match-action pipelines that can be compiled to
efficient implementations in software or hardware. Unfortunately, like many
industrial languages, P4 has developed without a formal foundation. The P4
Language Specification is a 160-page document with a mixture of informal prose,
graphical diagrams, and pseudocode. The P4 reference implementation is a
complex system, running to over 40KLoC of C++ code. Clearly neither of these
artifacts is suitable for formal reasoning.
  This paper presents a new framework, called Petr4, that puts P4 on a solid
foundation. Petr4 consists of a clean-slate definitional interpreter and a
calculus that models the semantics of a core fragment of P4. Throughout the
specification, some aspects of program behavior are left up to targets. Our
interpreter is parameterized over a target interface which collects all the
target-specific behavior in the specification in a single interface.
  The specification makes ad-hoc restrictions on the nesting of certain program
constructs in order to simplify compilation and avoid the possibility of
nonterminating programs. We captured the latter intention in our core calculus
by stratifying its type system, rather than imposing unnatural syntactic
restrictions, and we proved that all programs in this core calculus terminate.
  We have validated the interpreter against a suite of over 750 tests from the
P4 reference implementation, exercising our target interface with tests for
different targets. We established termination for the core calculus by
induction on the stratified type system. While developing Petr4, we reported
dozens of bugs in the language specification and the reference implementation,
many of which have been fixed.

it justifies the operational interpretation of most entropic quantities. In
this work, we revisit the notion of contraction coefficients of quantum
channels, which provide sharper and specialized versions of the data processing
inequality. A concept closely related to data processing is partial orders on
quantum channels. First, we discuss several quantum extensions of the
well-known less noisy ordering and relate them to contraction coefficients. We
further define approximate versions of the partial orders and show how they can
give strengthened and conceptually simple proofs of several results on
approximating capacities. Moreover, we investigate the relation to other
partial orders in the literature and their properties, particularly with regard
to tensorization. We then examine the relation between contraction coefficients
with other properties of quantum channels such as hypercontractivity. Next, we
extend the framework of contraction coefficients to general f-divergences and
prove several structural results. Finally, we consider two important classes of
quantum channels, namely Weyl-covariant and bosonic Gaussian channels. For
those, we determine new contraction coefficients and relations for various
partial orders.

However, the problem of efficiently and fairly manage the system resources

and an efficient smoothing proximal gradient algorithm are developed to
facilitate feature aggregation and dimension reduction in regression. As a
result, the framework can automatically identify clinically relevant microbes

research area with the increasing popularity and complexity of the networks.
Most of the existing solutions are either centralized or parallel algorithms,
which are computationally intensive - require complete knowledge of the entire
networks. But it isn't easy to collect entire network data because the size of
the actual networks may be prohibitively large. This may be a result of either
privacy concerns or technological impediments. Performing in-network
computation solves both problems utilizing the computational capability of the
individual nodes of the network. Simultaneously, nodes communicate and share
data with their neighbors via message passing, which may go a long way toward
mitigating individual nodes' privacy concerns in the network. All the
aforementioned concerns motivated us to design a decentralized or distributed
technique to detect overlapped communities in a large-scale network. It is
desirable because this technique does not offer a single point of failure, and
the system as a whole can continue to function even when many of the nodes
fail. In this paper, we address the overlapped community detection problem for
large-scale networks. We present an efficient distributed algorithm, named
DOCD, to identify the overlapped communities in the network. The DOCD
algorithm's efficiency is verified with extensive simulation study on real
network data such as Dolphin, Zachary karate club, Football club, and Facebook
ego networks. We show that DOCD algorithm is capable of keeping the
asymptotically same results with the existing classical centralized algorithms
in terms of community modularity and the number of identified communities. The
DOCD algorithm can also efficiently identify the overlapped nodes and
overlapped communities with a small number of rounds of communication and
computation.

properties of the system by spatially resolving the circumstellar environment
of the inner gaseous disc. We used the second-generation VLTI/GRAVITY to
spatially resolve the continuum and the CO overtone emission. We obtained data
over 12 baselines with the auxiliary telescopes and derive visibilities, and
the differential and closure phases as a function of wavelength. We used a
simple LTE ring model of the CO emission to reproduce the spectrum and CO line
displacements. Our interferometric data show that the star is marginally
resolved at our spatial resolution, with a radius of 10.58+-2.65 Rsun.The
K-band continuum emission from the disc is inclined by 63+-1 deg, with a
position angle of 116+-1 deg, and 4+-0.8 mas (0.5+-0.1 au) across. The
visibilities increase within the CO line emission, indicating that the CO is
emitted within the dust-sublimation radius.By modelling the CO bandhead
spectrum, we derive that the CO is emitted from a hot (T=1900-2800 K) and dense
(NCO=(0.9-9)x10^21 cm^-2) gas. The analysis of the CO line displacement with
respect to the continuum allows us to infer that the CO is emitted from a
region 0.10+-0.02 au across, well within the dust-sublimation radius. The
inclination and position angle of the CO line emitting region is consistent
with that of the dusty disc. Our spatially resolved interferometric
observations confirm the CO ro-vibrational emission within the dust-free region
of the inner disc. Conventional disc models exclude the presence of CO in the
dust-depleted regions of Herbig AeBe stars. Ad hoc models of the innermost disc
regions, that can compute the properties of the dust-free inner disc, are
therefore required.

numerous young, fissure-fed flood lavas with ages ranging from approximately
500 to 2.5 million years (Ma). We present evidence for what may be the youngest
volcanic deposit yet documented on Mars: a low albedo, high thermal inertia,
high-calcium pyroxene-rich deposit distributed symmetrically around a segment
of the Cerberus Fossae fissure system in Elysium Planitia. This deposit is
similar to features interpreted as pyroclastic deposits on the Moon and
Mercury. However, unlike previously documented lava flows in Elysium Planitia,
this feature is morphologically consistent with a fissure-fed pyroclastic
deposit, mantling the surrounding lava flows with a thickness on the order of
tens of cm over most of the deposit and a volume of 1.1-2.8E7 cubic meters.
Thickness and volume estimates are consistent with tephra fall deposits on
Earth. Stratigraphic relationships indicate a relative age younger than the
surrounding volcanic plains and the Zunil impact crater (~0.1-1 Ma), with
crater counting suggesting an absolute model age of 53 to 210 ka. This young
age implies that if this deposit is of volcanic origin then the Cerberus Fossae
region may not be extinct and Mars may still be volcanically active today. This
interpretation is consistent with the identification of seismicity in this
region by the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and

computationally demanding problem, it is natural to try and design fast
algorithms for restricted families of graphs. One such family that has been
extensively studied is that of graphs of bounded degeneracy (e.g., planar
graphs). This line of work, which started in the early 80's, culminated in a
recent work of Gishboliner et al., which highlighted the importance of the task
of counting homomorphic copies of cycles (i.e., cyclic walks) in graphs of
bounded degeneracy.
  Our main result in this paper is a surprisingly tight relation between the
above task and the well-studied problem of detecting (standard) copies of
directed cycles in general directed graphs. More precisely, we prove the
following:
  1. One can compute the number of homomorphic copies of $C_{2k}$ and
$C_{2k+1}$ in $n$-vertex graphs of bounded degeneracy in time
$\tilde{O}(n^{d_{k}})$, where the fastest known algorithm for detecting
directed copies of $C_k$ in general $m$-edge digraphs runs in time
$\tilde{O}(m^{d_{k}})$.
  2. Conversely, one can transform any $O(n^{b_{k}})$ algorithm for computing
the number of homomorphic copies of $C_{2k}$ or of $C_{2k+1}$ in $n$-vertex
graphs of bounded degeneracy, into an $\tilde{O}(m^{b_{k}})$ time algorithm for
detecting directed copies of $C_k$ in general $m$-edge digraphs.
  We emphasize that our first result does not use a black-box reduction (as
opposed to the second result which does). Instead, we design an algorithm for
computing the number of $C_k$-homomorphisms in degenerate graphs and show that
one part of its analysis can be reduced to the analysis of the fastest known

separation in reverberant environments. A fully-convolutional neural network
structure has been used to directly separate speech from multiple microphone
recordings, with no need of conventional spatial feature extraction. To reduce
the influence of reverberation on spatial feature extraction, a dereverberation
pre-processing method has been applied to further improve the separation
performance. A spatialized version of wsj0-2mix dataset has been simulated to
evaluate the proposed system. Both source separation and speech recognition
performance of the separated signals have been evaluated objectively.
Experiments show that the proposed fully-convolutional network improves the
source separation metric and the word error rate (WER) by more than 13% and 50%
relative, respectively, over a reference system with conventional features.
Applying dereverberation as pre-processing to the proposed system can further
reduce the WER by 29% relative using an acoustic model trained on clean and
reverberated data.

introduce a nontrivial dependence on the momentum transfer due to their
relatively light masses. These same loops, and those mediated by tau leptons,
break the flavor universality because of mass-dependent electromagnetic
radiative corrections. Nuclear physics uncertainties significantly cancel in
flavor asymmetries resulting in subpercent relative errors. We find that for
low neutrino energies, the cross section can be predicted with a relative
precision that is competitive with neutrino-electron scattering. We highlight
potentially useful applications of such a precise cross section prediction

Supercriticality sets the minimum extent of a large-scale circulation based on
the angular momentum and absolute vorticity distributions of the hypothetical

latitude-by-latitude radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) state. Its
depth-averaged temperature profile is suitably captured by a simple analytical

latitude, from the winter to the summer pole. This, in turn, yields a one-third

performed with a wide range of planetary rotation rates, the ascending edge

cubic chiral magnets has been overlooked for long, partly because a
semi-quantitative description of the thermodynamically stable SkL phase pocket
forming near the Curie temperature could be achieved without invoking
anisotropy effects. However, there has been a range of phenomena reported
recently in these materials, such as the formation of low-temperature tilted
conical and SkL states as well as temperature-induced transformations of
lattice geometry in metastable SkL states, where anisotropy was suspected to
play a key role. To settle this issue on experimental basis, we quantified the
cubic anisotropy in a series of CoZnMn-type cubic chiral magnets. We found that
the strength of anisotropy is highly enhanced towards low temperatures in all
the compounds, moreover, not only the magnitude but also the character of cubic
anisotropy drastically varies upon changing the Co/Mn ratio. We correlate these
changes with temperature- and composition-induced variations of the helical
modulation vectors, the anharmonicity and structural rearrangements of the
metastable SkLs and the spin relaxation rates. Similar systematic studies on
magnetic anisotropy may not only pave the way for a quantitative and unified
description of the stable and metastable modulated spin textures in cubic
chiral magnets but would also help exploring further topological spin textures
in this large class of skyrmion hosts.

can, therefore, play a key role in improving our understanding of astrophysical
models. Skymaps have been produced for all the data-taking runs of the advanced
ground-based interferometric detectors. While these maps are being produced in
pixel and SpH bases, to probe, respectively, localized and diffuse
astrophysical and cosmological sources, with algorithms that employ
cross-correlation as the common strategy, the underlying algebra and numerical
implementation remain different. As a consequence, there was a need for
producing skymaps in both bases in those analyses. We show that these
manifestly redundant methods could indeed be unified to a single analysis that
can probe very different scales and demonstrate it by applying them on real
data. We first develop the algebra to show that the results in two different
bases are easily transformable. We then incorporate both the schemes in the
now-standard analysis pipeline for anisotropic SGWB, PyStoch. This will enable
SGWB anisotropy searches in SpH basis also to take full advantage of integrated
\hpx tools and makes it computationally feasible to perform the search in every
frequency bin. We, however, follow a different approach for direct estimation
of the SpH moments. We show that the results obtained from these different
methods match very well; the differences are less than $0.1$\% for the SpH
moments and less than $0.01$\% for the Fisher information matrices. Thus we
conclude that a single skymap will be sufficient to describe the anisotropies
in a stochastic background. The multiple capabilities of PyStoch will be useful
for estimating and constraining various measures that characterize an

which can acquire diverse skills from expert human operators. However,
expanding these techniques to work with a single positive example during test
time is still an open challenge. Apart from control, the difficulty stems from
mismatches between the demonstrator and robot domains. For example, objects may
be placed in different locations (e.g. kitchen layouts are different in every
house). Additionally, the demonstration may come from an agent with different
morphology and physical appearance (e.g. human), so one-to-one action

allow robots to partially bridge these domain gaps, using their past

given context video from another agent, and must generalize to unseen task
instances when prompted with new videos during test time. We hypothesize that
our policy representations must be both context driven and dynamics aware in

formation is still not fully understood: Does the accretion rate smoothly
decline with the age of the protostar or are there short, intermittent
accretion bursts? Aims. We aim to explore whether or not the observed C$^{18}$O
and N$_2$H$^+$ emission pattern towards the VeLLO IRAM 04191+1522 can be
understood in the framework of a scenario where the emission is chemically
tracing a past accretion burst. Methods.We used high-angular-resolution Plateau
de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) observations of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ towards
IRAM 04191+1522 that were obtained as part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program.
We model these observations using a chemical code with a time-dependent
physical structure coupled with a radiative transfer module, where we allow for
variations in the source luminosity. Results. We find that the N$_2$H$^+$ line
emission shows a central hole, while the C$^{18}$O emission is compact. The
morphology of these two lines cannot be reproduced with a constant luminosity
model based on the present-day internal luminosity (0.08 L$_{sun}$). However,
the N$_2$H$^+$ peaks are consistent with a constant-luminosity model of 12
L$_{sun}$. Using a model with time-dependent temperature and density profiles,
we show that the observed N$_2$H$^+$ peak emission could indeed be caused by a
past accretion burst. Such a burst should have occurred a couple of hundred
years ago. Conclusions. We suggest that an accretion burst occurred in IRAM
04191+1522 in the recent past. If such bursts are common and sufficiently long
in VeLLOs, they could lead to higher accretion onto the central object than
their luminosity suggests. For IRAM 04191 in particular, our results yield an
estimated final mass of 0.2 - 0.25 M$_{sun}$ by the end of the Class 0 phase,
which would make this object a low-mass star rather than a brown dwarf.

heat their chromospheres, create molecular reservoirs, drive mass loss, and
create dust remain poorly understood. Betelgeuse's V-band ""Great Dimming"" event
of 2019 September /2020 February and its subsequent rapid brightening provides
a rare opportunity to study these phenomena. Two different explanations have
emerged to explain the dimming; new dust appeared in our line of sight
attenuating the photospheric light, or a large portion of the photosphere had
cooled. Here we present five years of Wing three-filter (A, B, and C band) TiO
and near-IR photometry obtained at the Wasatonic Observatory. These reveal that
parts of the photosphere had a mean effective temperature $(T_{\rm eff}$)
significantly lower than that found by (Levesque & Massey 2020). Synthetic
photometry from MARCS -model photospheres and spectra reveal that the V band,
TiO index, and C-band photometry, and previously reported 4000-6800 Angstrom
spectra can be quantitatively reproduced if there are multiple photospheric
components, as hinted at by VLT-SPHERE images (Montarges et al. 2020). If the
cooler component has $\Delta T_{\rm eff} \ge 250$ K cooler than 3650 K, then no
new dust is required to explain the available empirical constraints. A
coincidence of the dominant short- ($\sim 430$ day) and long-period ($\sim 5.8$
yr) V-band variations occurred near the time of deep minimum (Guinan et al.
2019). This is in tandem with the strong correlation of V mag and photospheric
radial velocities, recently reported by Dupree et al. (2020b). These suggest
that the cooling of a large fraction of the visible star has a dynamic origin
related to the photospheric motions, perhaps arising from pulsation or
large-scale convective motions.

redshifts are unavailable or difficult to obtain. We selected a sample of 54

in the Chandra deep field ($\sim$479 ks, 335 arcmin$^2$) around the $z=6.3$ QSO

0.5-7 keV energy band. We estimate reliable X-ray redshift solutions taking
advantage of the main features in obscured AGN spectra, like the Fe 6.4 keV
K$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emission line, the 7.1 keV Fe absorption edge and the
photoelectric absorption cut-off. The significance of such features is
investigated through spectral simulations, and the derived X-ray redshift
solutions are then compared with photometric redshifts. Both photometric and
X-ray redshifts are derived for 33 sources. When multiple solutions are derived
by any method, we find that combining the redshift solutions of the two
techniques improves the rms by a factor of two. Using our redshift estimates
($0.1\lesssim z \lesssim 4$), we derived absorbing column densities in the
range $\sim 10^{22}-10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ and absorption-corrected, 2-10 keV
rest-frame luminosities between $\sim 10^{42}$ and $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with

the adopted procedure can be applied to current and future X-ray surveys, for
sources detected only in the X-rays or that have uncertain photometric or

wave, are described by the well known Blandford-McKee solutions in spherical
geometry. These solutions, however, become inaccurate at a distance $\sim R/2$
behind the shock wave, where $R$ is the shock radius, as the flow approaches
Newtonian velocities. In this work we find a new self-similar solution which is
an extension to the Blandford-McKee solutions, and which describes the interior
part of the blast wave, where the flow reaches mildly relativistic to Newtonian
velocities. We find that the velocity profile of the internal part of the flow
does not depend on the value of the shock Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, and is
accurate from $r=0$ down to a distance of $R/\Gamma^2$ behind the shock.
Despite the fact that the shock wave is in causal contact with the entire flow
behind it, a singular point appears in the equations. Nevertheless, the
solution is not required to pass through the singular point: for ambient
density that decreases slowly enough, $\rho \propto r^{-k}$ with
$k<\frac{1}{2}(5-\sqrt{10})\cong0.92$, a secondary shock wave forms with an

overcome to utilize that information. First, we do not know the optimal

baryonic effects impact that regime significantly and in a poorly understood

cosmological information while marginalizing over baryonic effects. In this
work we show that neural networks can achieve that. We made use of data where
the maximum amount of cosmological information is known: power spectra and 2D
Gaussian density fields. We also contaminate the data with simplified baryonic
effects and train neural networks to predict the value of the cosmological
parameters. For this data, we show that neural networks can 1) extract the
maximum available cosmological information, 2) marginalize over baryonic
effects, and 3) extract cosmological information that is buried in the regime
dominated by baryonic physics. We also show that neural networks learn the
priors of the data they are trained on. We conclude that a promising strategy
to maximize the scientific return of cosmological experiments is to train
neural networks on state-of-the-art numerical simulations with different
strengths and implementations of baryonic effects.

presence of magnetic fields in the Universe. This conversion could impact
various cosmic distance measurements, such as luminosity distances to type Ia
supernovae and angular distances to galaxy clusters, in different ways. In this
paper we consider different combinations of the most up-to-date distance
measurements to constrain the axion-photon coupling. Employing the conservative
cell magnetic field model for the magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) and ignoring the conversion in the intracluster medium (ICM), we find the
upper bounds on axion-photon couplings to be around $5 \times 10^{-12}$
(nG/$B$) $\sqrt{\mathrm{Mpc/s}}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for axion masses $m_a$ below
$10^{-13}$ eV, where $B$ is the strength of the IGM magnetic field, and $s$ is
the comoving size of the magnetic domains. When including the conversion in the
ICM, the upper bound is lowered and could reach $5 \times 10^{-13}\,
$GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a < 5 \times 10^{-12}$ eV. While this stronger bound depends
on the ICM modeling, it is independent of the strength of the IGM magnetic
field, for which there is no direct evidence yet. These constraints could be
placed on firmer footing with an enhanced understanding and control of the
astrophysical uncertainties associated with the IGM and ICM. All the bounds are
determined by the shape of the Hubble rate as a function of redshift
reconstructable from various distance measurements, and insensitive to today's
Hubble rate, of which there is a tension between early and late cosmological
measurements. As an appendix, we discuss the model building challenges of the
use of photon-axion conversion to make type Ia supernovae brighter to alleviate
the Hubble problem/crisis.

distribution in agreement with the observationally determined stellar initial
mass function.
  We find that protoplanetary discs are very massive early in their lives. When
averaged over the entire stellar population, the discs have masses of $\sim
0.3$ and $0.1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for systems based on hydrodynamic or MHD
initial conditions, respectively. In systems with final stellar mass $\sim
1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, we find disc masses of $\sim 0.7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for

$\approx 5-7\,\mathrm{Myr}$ on average, despite our choice of a high value of
$10^{-2}$ for the background viscosity $\alpha$-parameter. In addition,
fragmentation is common in systems that are simulated using hydrodynamic cloud
collapse, with more fragments of larger mass formed in more massive systems. In

first data release, which is only $\sim$2 percent of the final LoTSS survey. We
made use of \textsc{PINK}, a code which extends the SOM algorithm with rotation
and flipping invariance, increasing its suitability and effectiveness for
training on astronomical sources. After training, the SOMs can be used for a
wide range of science exploitation and we present an illustration of their
potential by finding an arbitrary number of morphologically rare sources in our
training data (424 square degrees) and subsequently in an area of the sky
($\sim$5300 square degrees) outside the training data. Objects found in this
way span a wide range of morphological and physical categories: extended jets
of radio active galactic nuclei, diffuse cluster haloes and relics, and nearby
spiral galaxies. Finally, to enable accessible, interactive, and intuitive data
exploration, we showcase the LOFAR-PyBDSF Visualisation Tool, which allows
users to explore the LoTSS dataset through the trained SOMs.

role in anchoring the absolute distance scale and hence measuring the Hubble
constant, $H_{0}$, independent of traditional distance ladder methodology. A
current potential limitation of time delay distance measurements is the
""mass-sheet transformation"" (MST) which leaves the lensed imaging unchanged but
changes the distance measurements and the derived value of $H_0$. In this work
we show that the standard method of addressing the MST in time delay
cosmography, through a combination of high-resolution imaging and the
measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, depends
on the assumption that the ratio, $D_{\rm s}/D_{\rm ds}$, of angular diameter
distances to the background quasar and between the lensing galaxy and the
quasar can be constrained. This is typically achieved through the assumption of
a particular cosmological model. Previous work (TDCOSMO IV) addressed the
mass-sheet degeneracy and derived $H_{0}$ under the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM
model. In this paper we show that the mass sheet degeneracy can be broken
without relying on a specific cosmological model by combining lensing with
relative distance indicators such as supernovae type Ia and baryon acoustic
oscillations, which constrain the shape of the expansion history and hence
$D_{\rm s}/D_{\rm ds}$. With this approach, we demonstrate that the mass-sheet
degeneracy can be constrained in a cosmological-model-independent way, and
hence model-independent distance measurements in time-delay cosmography under
mass-sheet transformations can be obtained.

mass-loaded, such flows become radiative within the wind-driving region,
reducing the overall mass outflow rate from the host galaxy. We show that this
sets a maximum on the total outflow momentum for hot energy-driven winds. For a
spherical wind of Solar metallicity driven by continuous star formation, $\dot
p_\rm{max} \simeq 1.9\times10^4\ M_\odot/\rm{yr\ km/s}\
(\alpha/0.9)^{0.86}(R_\star/300\ \rm{pc})^{0.14}(\dot M_\star/20\

that thermalizes the wind, and $\dot M_\star$ and $R_\star$ are the star

hot winds can also apply to cool, ionized outflows that are typically observed
in starburst galaxies, if the hot wind undergoes bulk radiative cooling or if
the hot wind transfers mass and momentum to cool clouds within the flow. We
show that requiring the hot wind to undergo single-phase cooling on large
scales sets a minimum on the total outflow momentum rate. These maximum and
minimum outflow momenta have similar values, setting a characteristic momentum
rate of hot galactic winds that can become radiative on large scales. We find
that most observations of photoionized outflow wind momentum fall below the
theoretical maximum and thus may be signatures of cooling hot flows. On the
other hand, many systems fall below the minimum momentum required for bulk
cooling, indicating that perhaps the cool material observed has instead been
entrained in or mixed with the hot flow.

spinning black hole, if the black hole radius is comparable to the bosons'
wavelength. The cloud rapidly extracts angular momentum from the black hole,
and reduces it to a characteristic value that depends on the boson's mass as
well as on the black hole mass and spin. Therefore, a measurement of a black
hole mass and spin can be used to reveal or exclude the existence of such
bosons. Using the black holes released by LIGO and Virgo in their GWTC-2, we
perform a simultaneous measurement of the black hole spin distribution at

namely the Haar average of a $k$-fold unitary channel. We show that such
measures can then be always cast in the form of an expectation value of the
isospectral twirling. In literature, quantum chaos is investigated sometimes
through the spectrum and some other times through the eigenvectors of the
Hamiltonian generating the dynamics. We show that, by exploiting random matrix
theory, these measures of quantum chaos clearly distinguish the finite time
profiles of probes to quantum chaos corresponding to chaotic spectra given by
the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) from the integrable spectra given by
Poisson distribution and the Gaussian Diagonal Ensemble (GDE). On the other
hand, we show that the asymptotic values do depend on the eigenvectors of the
Hamiltonian. We see that the isospectral twirling of Hamiltonians with
eigenvectors stabilizer states does not possess chaotic features, unlike those
Hamiltonians whose eigenvectors are taken from the Haar measure. As an example,
OTOCs obtained with Clifford resources decay to higher values compared with
universal resources. Finally, we show a crossover in the OTOC behavior between

consistent with ionization by galactic HII regions exhibit a narrow range of

ionization by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and low-ionization emission-line

systems properties significantly and therefore has emerged as a promising way
to engineer exotic quantum phases, such as topological insulators and discrete
time crystals. A major limitation in such setups, is that generally
interacting, driven systems will heat up over time and lose the desired
properties. Understanding the relevant time scales is thus an important topic
in the field and so far, there have only been few approaches to determine
heating times for a concrete system quantitatively, and in a computationally
efficient way. In this article we propose a new approach, based on building the
heating rate from microscopic processes, encoded in avoided level crossings of
the Floquet propagator. We develop a method able to resolve individual
crossings and show how to construct the heating rate based on these. The method
is closely related to the Fermi Golden Rule approach for weak drives, but can
go beyond it, since it captures non-perturbative effects by construction. This
enables our method to be applicable in scenarios such as the heating time of
discrete time crystals or frequency dependent couplings, which are very
relevant for Floquet engineering, where previously no efficient methods for
estimating heating times were available.

Perseverance rover, sorts a list of candidate paths for the rover to traverse,
then uses the Approximate Clearance Evaluation (ACE) algorithm to evaluate
whether the most highly ranked paths are safe. ACE is crucial for maintaining
the safety of the rover, but is computationally expensive. If the most
promising candidates in the list of paths are all found to be infeasible, ENav
must continue to search the list and run time-consuming ACE evaluations until a
feasible path is found. In this paper, we present two heuristics that, given a
terrain heightmap around the rover, produce cost estimates that more
effectively rank the candidate paths before ACE evaluation. The first heuristic
uses Sobel operators and convolution to incorporate the cost of traversing
high-gradient terrain. The second heuristic uses a machine learning (ML) model
to predict areas that will be deemed untraversable by ACE. We used physics
simulations to collect training data for the ML model and to run Monte Carlo
trials to quantify navigation performance across a variety of terrains with
various slopes and rock distributions. Compared to ENav's baseline performance,
integrating the heuristics can lead to a significant reduction in ACE
evaluations and average computation time per planning cycle, increase path
efficiency, and maintain or improve the rate of successful traverses. This
strategy of targeting specific bottlenecks with ML while maintaining the
original ACE safety checks provides an example of how ML can be infused into

measurements, building on existing destriping methodology. Gibbs sampling
breaks the computationally heavy destriping problem into two separate steps;
noise filtering and map binning. Considered as two separate steps, both are
computationally much cheaper than solving the combined problem. This provides a
huge performance benefit as compared to traditional methods, and allows us for
the first time to bring the destriping baseline length to a single sample. We
apply the Gibbs procedure to simulated Planck 30 GHz data. We find that gaps in
the time-ordered data are handled efficiently by filling them with simulated
noise as part of the Gibbs process. The Gibbs procedure yields a chain of map
samples, from which we may compute the posterior mean as a best-estimate map.
The variation in the chain provides information on the correlated residual
noise, without need to construct a full noise covariance matrix. However, if
only a single maximum-likelihood frequency map estimate is required, we find
that traditional conjugate gradient solvers converge much faster than a Gibbs
sampler in terms of total number of iterations. The conceptual advantages of
the Gibbs sampling approach lies in statistically well-defined error
propagation and systematic error correction, and this methodology forms the
conceptual basis for the map-making algorithm employed in the BeyondPlanck
framework, which implements the first end-to-end Bayesian analysis pipeline for
CMB observations.

the model details, an initial illustration of the general behavior, and a study

of both the cross section and central axis of the CME so that their radial

study design increasingly used for public health intervention evaluations. Most
previous literature focuses on power calculations for this particular type of
cluster randomized trials for continuous outcomes, along with an approximation
to this approach for binary outcomes. Although not accurate for binary
outcomes, it has been widely used. To improve the approximation for binary
outcomes, two new methods for stepped wedge designs (SWDs) of binary outcomes
have recently been published. However, these new methods have not been
implemented in publicly available software. The objective of this paper is to
present power calculation software for SWDs in various settings for both
continuous and binary outcomes.
  Methods: We have developed a SAS macro %swdpwr and an R package swdpwr for
power calculation in SWDs. Different scenarios including cross-sectional and
cohort designs, binary and continuous outcomes, marginal and conditional
models, three link functions, with and without time effects are accommodated in
this software.
  Results: swdpwr provides an efficient tool to support investigators in the

addresses the implementation gap between newly proposed methodology and their
application to obtain more accurate power calculations in SWDs.
  Conclusions: This user-friendly software makes the new methods more

tests by tying the test's predictive value to the disease prevalence. The
aforementioned limitation is independent of the adequacy and make-up of the
test and thus implies inherent Bayesian limitations to the screening process
itself. As per the WHO's $Wilson-Jungner$ criteria, one of the prerequisite
steps before undertaking screening is to ensure that a treatment for the
condition screened exists. However, in so doing, a paradox, henceforth termed
the screening paradox, ensues. If a disease process is screened for and
subsequently treated, its prevalence would drop in the population, which as per
Bayes' theorem, would make the tests' predictive value drop in return. Put
another way, a very powerful screening test would, by performing and succeeding
at the very task it was developed to do, paradoxically reduce its ability to
correctly identify individuals with the disease it screens for in the future.
Where $J$ is Youden's statistic (sensitivity [$a$] + specificity [$b$] - 1),
and $\phi$ is the prevalence, the ratio of positive predictive values at
subsequent time $k$, $\rho(\phi_{k})$, over the original $\rho(\phi_{0})$ at
$t_0$ is given by:
  $\zeta(\phi_{0},k) = \frac{\rho(\phi_{k})}{\rho(\phi_{0})}
=\frac{\phi_k(1-b)+J\phi_0\phi_k}{\phi_0(1-b)+J\phi_0\phi_k}$
  In this manuscript, we explore the mathematical model which formalizes said
screening paradox and explore its implications for population level screening
programs. In particular, we define the number of positive test iterations (PTI)
needed to reverse the effects of the paradox as follows:
  $n_{i\phi_e}=\left\lceil\frac{ln\left[\frac{\omega\phi_e\phi_k-\omega\phi_e}{\omega\phi_e\phi_k-\phi_k}\right]}{2ln\omega}\right\rceil$

electron motion is strongly correlated. Though microscopically these systems

to an excellent approximation. Here we reconsider this question for magic angle
twisted bilayer graphene that is nearly aligned with a hexagonal boron
nitride(h-BN) substrate. We carefully study the effect of the periodic
potential induced by h-BN on the low energy physics. The combination of this
potential and the moir\'e lattice produced by the twisted graphene generates a
quasi-periodic term that depends on the alignment angle between h-BN and the
moir\'e graphene. We find that the alignment angle has a significant impact on
both the band gap near charge neutrality and the behavior of electrical
transport. We also introduce and study toy models to illustrate how a
quasi-periodic potential can give rise to localization and change in transport
properties of topological bands.

quantum mechanically and equivalent to the electrons of a chemical system. In
such methods, it is well known that due to the neglect of electron-proton
correlation, a Hartree-Fock (HF) description of the electron-proton interaction
catastrophically fails leading to qualitatively incorrect protonic properties.
In single-component quantum chemistry, the qualitative failure of HF is
normally indicative of the need for multireference methods such as complete
active space self-consistent field (CASSCF). While a multicomponent CASSCF
method was implemented nearly twenty years ago, it is only able to perform
calculations with very small active spaces (~105 multicomponent
configurations). Therefore, in order to extend the realm of applicability of
the multicomponent CASSCF method, this study derives and implements a new
two-step multicomponent CASSCF method that uses multicomponent heat-bath
configuration interaction for the configuration interaction step, enabling
calculations with very large active spaces (up to 16 electrons in 48 orbitals).
We find that large electronic active spaces are needed to obtain qualitatively
accurate protonic densities for the HCN and FHF- molecules. Additionally, the
multicomponent CASSCF method implemented here should have further applications
for double-well protonic potentials and systems that are inherently
electronically multireference.

  Distributions","Written in October 2019",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Methods of performing anomaly detection on high-dimensional data sets are
needed, since algorithms which are trained on data are only expected to perform
well on data that is similar to the training data. There are theoretical
results on the ability to detect if a population of data is likely to come from
a known base distribution, which is known as the goodness-of-fit problem.
One-sample approaches to this problem offer significant computational
advantages for online testing, but require knowing a model of the base
distribution. The ability to correctly reject anomalous data in this setting
hinges on the accuracy of the model of the base distribution. For high
dimensional data, learning an accurate-enough model of the base distribution
such that anomaly detection works reliably is very challenging, as many
researchers have noted in recent years. Existing methods for the one-sample
goodness-of-fit problem do not account for the fact that a model of the base
distribution is learned. To address that gap, we offer a theoretically
motivated approach to account for the density learning procedure. In
particular, we propose training an ensemble of density models, considering data
to be anomalous if the data is anomalous with respect to any member of the
ensemble. We provide a theoretical justification for this approach, proving
first that a test on typicality is a valid approach to the goodness-of-fit
problem, and then proving that for a correctly constructed ensemble of models,
the intersection of typical sets of the models lies in the interior of the
typical set of the base distribution. We present our method in the context of
an example on synthetic data in which the effects we consider can easily be

results are Theorems 4.2 and 5.1. In the Riemannian case the nilpotent isometry
group for a geodesic orbit nilmanifold is abelian or $2$-step nilpotent.
Examples show that this fails dramatically in the pseudo-Riemannian case. Here
we concentrate on the geodesic orbit property for Lorentz nilmanifolds $G/H$
with $G = N \rtimes H$ and $N$ nilpotent. When the metric is nondegenerate on
$[\mathfrak{n},\mathfrak{n}]$, Theorem 4.2 shows that $N$ either is at most
$2$-step nilpotent as in the Riemannian situation, or is $4$-step nilpotent,
but cannot be $3$-step nilpotent. Examples show that these bounds are the best
possible. Surprisingly, Theorem 5.1 shows that $N$ is at most $2$-step
nilpotent when the metric is degenerate on $[\mathfrak{n},\mathfrak{n}]$. Both
theorems give additional structural information and specialize to naturally
reductive and to weakly symmetric Lorentz nilmanifolds.

feedback interactions with their environment. A prominent model for studying
such interactions is reservoir computing, where learning acts on
low-dimensional bottlenecks. Despite the simplicity of this learning scheme,
the factors contributing to or hindering the success of training in reservoir
networks are in general not well understood. In this work, we study non-linear
feedback networks trained to generate a sinusoidal signal, and analyze how
learning performance is shaped by the interplay between internal network
dynamics and target properties. By performing exact mathematical analysis of
linearized networks, we predict that learning performance is maximized when the
target is characterized by an optimal, intermediate frequency which
monotonically decreases with the strength of the internal reservoir
connectivity. At the optimal frequency, the reservoir representation of the
target signal is high-dimensional, de-synchronized, and thus maximally robust
to noise. We show that our predictions successfully capture the qualitative
behaviour of performance in non-linear networks. Moreover, we find that the
relationship between internal representations and performance can be further
exploited in trained non-linear networks to explain behaviours which do not
have a linear counterpart. Our results indicate that a major determinant of
learning success is the quality of the internal representation of the target,
which in turn is shaped by an interplay between parameters controlling the
internal network and those defining the task.

disentangle the origins of these multi-phase structures and present a detailed
analysis of the quasar field Q0122-003 field using Keck/KCWI galaxy

discovered a dwarf galaxy, G_27kpc ($M_{\star}=10^{8.7}$ M$_{\odot}$), at
z=0.39863 that is 27 kpc from the quasar sightline. G_27kpc is only +21 km/s
from a more massive ($M_{\star}=10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxy,
G_163kpc, at an impact parameter of 163 kpc. While G_163kpc is actively forming
stars (SFR=6.9 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), G_27kpc has a low star-formation rate
(SFR=$0.08\pm0.03$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and star formation surface density
($\Sigma_{SFR}=0.006$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$), implying no active
outflows. By comparing galaxy SFRs, kinematics, masses and distances from the

metallicities, we have inferred the following: (1) Part of the low-ionization

G_27kpc. (2) The remainder of the low ionization phase has metallicities and
kinematics consistent with being intragroup gas being transferred from G_27kpc

comparison with observations of the CME in white light from the LASCO(C2)

problems. The exact fine-grid spatial problems typically require some reduction
in degrees of freedom. Multiscale algorithms are designed to represent the
fine-scale details on a coarse grid and, thus, reduce the problems' size. When
solving time-dependent problems, one can take advantage of the multiscale
decomposition of the solution and perform temporal splitting by solving
smaller-dimensional problems, which is studied in the paper. In the proposed
approach, we consider the temporal splitting based on various low dimensional
spatial approximations. Because a multiscale spatial splitting gives a ""good""
decomposition of the solution space, one can achieve an efficient
implicit-explicit temporal discretization. We present a recently developed
theoretical result in our earlier work and adopt it in this paper for
multiscale problems. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed splitting algorithm.

virus (HCV) model, under therapy, that considers both extracellular and
intracellular levels of infection. At present most mathematical modeling of
viral kinetics after treatment only addresses the process of infection of a
cell by the virus and the release of virions by the cell, while the processes
taking place inside the cell are not included. We prove that the solutions of
the new model with positive initial values are positive, exist globally in time
and are bounded. The model has two virus-free steady states. They are
distinguished by the fact that viral RNA is absent inside the cells in the
first state and present inside the cells in the second. There are basic
reproduction numbers associated to each of these steady states. If the basic
reproduction number of the first steady state is less than one then that state
is asymptotically stable. If the basic reproduction number of the first steady
state is greater than one and that of the second less than one then the second
steady state is asymptotically stable. If both basic reproduction numbers are
greater than one then we obtain various conclusions which depend on different
restrictions on the parameters of the model. Under increasingly strong
assumptions we prove that there is at least one positive steady state (infected
equilibrium), that there is a unique positive steady state and that the
positive steady state is stable. We also give a condition under which every
positive solution converges to a positive steady state. This is proved by
methods of Li and Muldowney. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results by
numerical simulations.

networks not only can provide uncertainty of the prediction but also can
provide the discrepancy between committee members. Both the uncertainty and the
discrepancy are large in the regions where the target function varies rapidly,
and therefore, both quantities can be used to guide sampling data to such
regions. In this way, we can learn a function accurately with the number of
queried data points much less than uniform sampling. Here we test our method
with two examples. One example is to find a rare phase in a phase diagram,
which is separated from other phases by a second-order phase transition. In
this example, the target function is the susceptibility function, and since the
divergence of the susceptibility function locates the phase diagram, the task
of searching such a phase perfectly matches the advantage of our method.
Another example is to learn the distribution function for Monte Carlo
integration of a high-dimensional function. In both examples, we show that our
method performs significantly efficiently than uniform sampling. Our method can
find broad applications in computational scientific problems.

on the available instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the base
station (BS). Therefore, the user in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) systems
has to keep on feeding back the CSI to the BS, thereby occupying large uplink
transmission resources. Recently, deep learning (DL) has achieved great success
in the CSI feedback. However, the existing works just focus on improving the
feedback accuracy and ignore the effects on the following modules, e.g.,
beamforming (BF). In this paper, we propose a DL-based CSI feedback framework
for BF design, called CsiFBnet. The key idea of the CsiFBnet is to maximize the
BF performance gain rather than the feedback accuracy. We apply it to two
representative scenarios: single- and multi-cell systems. The CsiFBnet-s in the
single-cell system is based on the autoencoder architecture, where the encoder
at the user compresses the CSI and the decoder at the BS generates the BF
vector. The CsiFBnet-m in the multicell system has to feed back two kinds of
CSI: the desired and the interfering CSI. The entire neural networks are
trained by an unsupervised learning strategy. Simulation results show the great
performance improvement and complexity reduction of the CsiFBnet compared with
the conventional DL-based CSI feedback methods.

In both fairness analyses, the diagnostic process favors men over women,

the excited states located at 217 and 335 keV, respectively. The spectroscopic
factors deduced for these states exhibit a marked single-particle character, in
agreement with shell model and particle-core model calculations, and combined
with their near degeneracy in energy provide clear evidence for the absence of
the N = 14 sub-shell closure. The very small spectroscopic factor found for the
3/2+ ground state is consistent with theoretical predictions and indicates that
the {\nu}1d3/2 strength is carried by unbound states. With a dominant l = 0
valence neutron configuration and a very low separation energy, the 1/2+
excited state is a one-neutron halo candidate.

to realize high-performance controllers for prosthetic. However, although DNNs
have shown superior accuracy than conventional methods when large amounts of

the FS-HGR, to address this need. Few-shot learning is a variant of domain
adaptation with the goal of inferring the required output based on just one or

generalizes after seeing very few examples from each class. The proposed
approach led to 85.94% classification accuracy on new repetitions with few-shot

that dynamical interactions alone produced too few low-mass binaries compared

the coupled MHD and direct N-body star cluster formation code Torch. We compare
simulations with, and without, initial binary populations and follow the
dynamical evolution of the binary population in both sets of simulations,
finding that both dynamical formation and destruction of binaries take place.
Even in the first few million years of star formation, we find that an initial
population of binaries is needed at all masses to reproduce observed binary
fractions for binaries with mass ratios above the $q \geq 0.1$ detection limit.
Our simulations also indicate that dynamical interactions in the presence of
gas during cluster formation modify the initial distributions towards binaries
with smaller primary masses, larger mass ratios, smaller semi-major axes and
larger eccentricities. Systems formed dynamically do not have the same
properties as the initial systems, and systems formed dynamically in the
presence of an initial population of binaries differ from those formed in
simulations with single stars only. Dynamical interactions during the earliest

the validity of the approximations, especially in the presence of

addition, we study signatures of the well-known Mollow triplet and observe its
meltdown owing to dissipation in an experimentally feasible parameter regime of

The coronagraph and WASP were mounted on a gondola provided by WFF and launched
from the Fort Sumner, New Mexico station of Columbia Scientific Balloon
Facility (CSBF) on September 18, 2019. BITSE obtained 17,060 coronal images at
a float altitude of about 128,000 feet (39 km) over a period of about 4 hrs.

designed to help develop flight quality software. We used EVTM (Ethernet Via

onboard using flash storage. At the end of the mission, all data were recovered
and analyzed. Preliminary analysis shows that BITSE imaged the solar minimum
corona with the equatorial streamers on the east and west limbs. The narrow
streamers observed by BITSE are in good agreement with the geometric properties

However, these robots first need to learn what it is their user wants them to
do. Teaching assistive robots is hard for inexperienced users, elderly users,
and users living with physical disabilities, since often these individuals are
unable to show the robot their desired behavior. We know that inclusive
learners should give human teachers credit for what they cannot demonstrate.
But today's robots do the opposite: they assume every user is capable of
providing any demonstration. As a result, these robots learn to mimic the
demonstrated behavior, even when that behavior is not what the human really
meant! Here we propose a different approach to reward learning: robots that
reason about the user's demonstrations in the context of similar or simpler
alternatives. Unlike prior works -- which err towards overestimating the
human's capabilities -- here we err towards underestimating what the human can
input (i.e., their choice set). Our theoretical analysis proves that
underestimating the human's choice set is risk-averse, with better worst-case
performance than overestimating. We formalize three properties to generate
similar and simpler alternatives. Across simulations and a user study, our
resulting algorithm better extrapolates the human's objective. See the user

uncertainty from the data collection process, speed control is one of the most
important factors to optimize the energy usage efficiency and performance for

show that our proposed solution can achieve up to 40% greater performance

under the $\ell_\infty$ norm with two simple reductions. Our first reduction
shows that hardness of a special case of the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP),
which captures many provably hard instances of SVP, implies a lower bound for
ANN with polynomial preprocessing time under the same norm. Combined with a
recent quantitative hardness result on SVP under $\ell_\infty$ (Bennett et al.,
FOCS 2017), our reduction implies that finding a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate
nearest neighbor under $\ell_\infty$ with polynomial preprocessing requires
near-linear query time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is
false. This complements the results of Rubinstein (STOC 2018), who showed
hardness of ANN under $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and edit distance.
  Further improving the approximation factor for hardness, we show that,
assuming SETH, near-linear query time is required for any approximation factor
less than $3$ under $\ell_\infty$. This shows a conditional separation between
ANN under the $\ell_1/ \ell_2$ norm and the $\ell_\infty$ norm since there are
sublinear time algorithms achieving better than $3$-approximation for the
$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm. Lastly, we show that the approximation factor of

Hilbert space splits into sectors, between which correlators of boundary
observables factorize, and that the corresponding sectors of the boundary
theory have dimensions independently chosen from different Poisson
distributions. As a special case, we study in detail the gravity model built
from the bulk action of 2d Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, with or without
end-of-the-world branes, and for arbitrary finite group $G$. The dual of this
Dijkgraaf-Witten gravity model can be interpreted as a 1d topological theory
whose Hilbert space is a random representation of $G$ and whose aforementioned
sectors are labeled by the irreducible representations of $G$. These
holographic interpretations of our gravity models require projecting out
negative-norm states from the baby universe Hilbert space, which Marolf and
Maxfield achieved by the (only seemingly) ad hoc solution of adding a nonlocal
boundary term to the bulk action. In order to place their solution in the
completely local framework of a TQFT with defects, we couple the boundaries of
the gravity model to an auxiliary 2d TQFT in a non-gravitational (i.e. fixed
topology) region. In this framework, the difficulty of negative-norm states can
be remedied in a local way by the introduction of a defect line between the
gravitational and non-gravitational regions. The gravity model is then
holographically dual to an ensemble of boundary conditions in an open/closed

fast in recent years, and becoming an important imaging tool for both
preclinical and clinical studies. With enough ultrasound transducers placed
around the biological tissue, PAT can provide both deep penetration and high
image contrast by hybrid usage of light and sound. However, considering space
and measurement environmental limitations, transducers are always placed in a
limited-angle way, which means that the other side without transducer coverage
suffers severe information loss. With conventional image reconstruction
algorithms, the limited-view tissue induces artifacts and information loss,
which may cause doctors misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. In order to solve
limited-view PA imaging reconstruction problem, we propose to use both time
domain and frequency domain reconstruction algorithms to get delay-and-sum
(DAS) image inputs and k-space image inputs. These dual domain images share
nearly same texture information but different artifact information, which can
teach network how to distinguish these two kinds of information at input level.
In this paper, we propose Dual Domain Unet (DuDoUnet) with specially designed
Information Sharing Block (ISB), which can further share two domains'
information and distinguish artifacts. Besides, we use mutual information (MI)
with an auxiliary network, whose inputs and outputs are both ground truth, to
compensate prior knowledge of limited-view PA inputs. The proposed method is
verified with a public clinical database, and shows superior results with SSIM

magnetic dipole disappears at the values exceeding the calculated upper value

the increase of both the dark matter and magnetic charge parameters. Finally,

between jobs. The jobs form a graph and no two jobs connected by an edge are
allowed to be assigned to the same machine. In particular, we study the case
where the graph is a collection of disjoint cliques. Scheduling with
incompatibilities between jobs represents a well-established line of research
in scheduling theory and the case of disjoint cliques has received increasing
attention in recent years. While the research up to this point has been focused
on the makespan objective, we broaden the scope and study the classical total
completion time criterion. In the setting without incompatibilities, this
objective is well known to admit polynomial time algorithms even for unrelated
machines via matching techniques. We show that the introduction of
incompatibility cliques results in a richer, more interesting picture.
Scheduling on identical machines remains solvable in polynomial time, while
scheduling on unrelated machines becomes APX-hard. Furthermore, we study the
problem under the paradigm of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms (FPT). In
particular, we consider a problem variant with assignment restrictions for the
cliques rather than the jobs. We prove that it is NP-hard and can be solved in
FPT time with respect to the number of cliques. Moreover, we show that the
problem on unrelated machines can be solved in FPT time for reasonable
parameters, e.g., the parameter pair: number of machines and maximum processing
time. The latter result is a natural extension of known results for the case
without incompatibilities and can even be extended to the case of total
weighted completion time. All of the FPT results make use of n-fold Integer
Programs that recently have received great attention by proving their

However, the relation between computation performance and physical

regarding the role of current-dependent magnetic damping in the computational
performance of reservoir computing. The current-dependent relaxation dynamics
of a magnetic vortex core results in an asymmetric memory function with respect
to binary inputs. A fast relaxation caused by a large input leads to a fast
fading of the input memory, whereas a slow relaxation by a small input enables
the reservoir to keep the input memory for a relatively long time. As a result,
a step-like dependence is found for the short-term memory and parity-check
capacities on the pulse width of input data, where the capacities remain at 1.5
for a certain range of the pulse width, and drop to 1.0 for a long pulse-width
limit. Both analytical and numerical analyses clarify that the step-like
behavior can be attributed to the current-dependent relaxation time of the
vortex core to a limit-cycle state. }

problem, we compare them with the conventional constraints (CCs) and list their
extra challenges over CCs. In the construction of AI machines, we basically
encounter more often GCs for modeling, rather than CCs with well-defined forms.
Furthermore, we discuss the ultimate goals of AI and redefine transparent,
interpretable, and explainable AI in terms of comprehension levels about
machines. We review the studies in relation to the GC problems although most of
them do not take the notion of GCs. We demonstrate that if AI machines are
simplified by a coupling with both knowledge-driven submodel and data-driven
submodel, GCs will play a critical role in a knowledge-driven submodel as well
as in the coupling form between the two submodels. Examples are given to show
that the studies in view of a generalized constraint problem will help us

the creation of nanoscale field-emission electronics and optoelectronics
applications that require operation at high peak current densities and optical
intensities. Recent results have demonstrated that the optical properties of
titanium nitride, a refractory and CMOS-compatible plasmonic material, can be
tuned by adding silicon and oxygen dopants. However, to fully leverage the
potential of titanium (silicon oxy)nitride, a reliable and scalable fabrication
process with few-nm precision is needed. In this work, we developed a
fabrication process for producing engineered nanostructures with gaps between
10 and 15 nm, aspect ratios larger than 5 with almost 90{\deg} steep sidewalls.
Using this process, we fabricated large-scale arrays of electrically-connected
bow-tie nanoantennas with few-nm free-space gaps. We measured a typical
variation of 4 nm in the average gap size. Using applied DC voltages and
optical illumination, we tested the electronic and optoelectronic response of
the devices, demonstrating sub-10-V tunneling operation across the free-space
gaps, and quantum efficiency of up to 1E-3 at 1.2 {\mu}m, which is comparable
to a bulk silicon photodiode at the same wavelength. Tests demonstrated that
the titanium silicon oxynitride nanostructures did not significantly degrade,
exhibiting less than 5 nm of shrinking of the average gap dimensions over
few-{\mu}m^2 areas after roughly 6 hours of operation. Our results will be
useful for developing the next generation of robust and CMOS-compatible
nanoscale devices for high-speed and low-power field-emission electronics and
optoelectronics applications.

  IV Models","NeurIPS 2020 Workshop on Machine Learning for Economic Policy",,,,"econ.EM cs.LG stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We offer straightforward theoretical results that justify incorporating
machine learning in the standard linear instrumental variable setting. The key
idea is to use machine learning, combined with sample-splitting, to predict the
treatment variable from the instrument and any exogenous covariates, and then
use this predicted treatment and the covariates as technical instruments to
recover the coefficients in the second-stage. This allows the researcher to
extract non-linear co-variation between the treatment and instrument that may
dramatically improve estimation precision and robustness by boosting instrument
strength. Importantly, we constrain the machine-learned predictions to be
linear in the exogenous covariates, thus avoiding spurious identification
arising from non-linear relationships between the treatment and the covariates.
We show that this approach delivers consistent and asymptotically normal
estimates under weak conditions and that it may be adapted to be
semiparametrically efficient (Chamberlain, 1992). Our method preserves standard
intuitions and interpretations of linear instrumental variable methods,
including under weak identification, and provides a simple, user-friendly
upgrade to the applied economics toolbox. We illustrate our method with an
example in law and criminal justice, examining the causal effect of appellate
court reversals on district court sentencing decisions.

advanced signal processing techniques for enabling the radar to sense the
environment via the communication signals. Since the technologies of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) are widely used in the legacy cellular systems, this paper proposes a
two-stage signal processing approach for radar sensing in an MIMO-OFDM system,
where the scattered channels caused by various targets are estimated in the
first stage, and the location information of the targets is then extracted from
their scattered channels in the second stage. Specifically, based on the
observations that radar sensing is similar to multi-path communication in the
sense that different targets scatter the signal sent by the radar transmitter
to the radar receiver with various delay, and that the number of scatters is
limited, we show that the OFDM-based channel training approach together with
the compressed sensing technique can be utilized to estimate the scattered
channels efficiently in Stage I. Moreover, to tackle the challenge arising from
range resolution for sensing the location of closely spaced targets, we show
that the MIMO radar technique can be leveraged in Stage II such that the radar
has sufficient spatial samples to even detect the targets in close proximity
based on their scattered channels. Last, numerical examples are provided to
show the effectiveness of our proposed sensing approach which merely relies on
the existing MIMO-OFDM communication techniques.

surgical instruments must often be changed during an operation. In this work,
we propose a framework for automation of high-precision surgical tasks by
learning sample efficient, accurate, closed-loop policies that operate directly
on visual feedback instead of robot encoder estimates. This framework, which we
call intermittent visual servoing (IVS), intermittently switches to a learned
visual servo policy for high-precision segments of repetitive surgical tasks
while relying on a coarse open-loop policy for the segments where precision is
not necessary. To compensate for cable-related effects, we apply imitation
learning to rapidly train a policy that maps images of the workspace and
instrument from a top-down RGB camera to small corrective motions. We train the
policy using only 180 human demonstrations that are roughly 2 seconds each.
Results on a da Vinci Research Kit suggest that combining the coarse policy
with half a second of corrections from the learned policy during each
high-precision segment improves the success rate on the Fundamentals of
Laparoscopic Surgery peg transfer task from 72.9% to 99.2%, 31.3% to 99.2%, and

In this work, we carry out user studies to systematically assess how people
respond to different types of predictive uncertainty i.e., posterior predictive

assisted decision making. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks one of
the first attempts at studying this question. Our results demonstrate that
people are more likely to agree with a model prediction when they observe the
corresponding uncertainty associated with the prediction. This finding holds
regardless of the properties (shape or variance) of predictive uncertainty
(posterior predictive distribution), suggesting that uncertainty is an
effective tool for persuading humans to agree with model predictions.
Furthermore, we also find that other factors such as domain expertise and
familiarity with ML also play a role in determining how someone interprets and

have been applied to energy-efficient temporal and spatiotemporal processing
tasks. Thanks to the bio-plausible neuronal dynamics and simplicity, LIF-SNN
benefits from event-driven processing, however, usually faces the embarrassment
of reduced performance. This may because in LIF-SNN the neurons transmit
information via spikes. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a Leaky
Integrate and Analog Fire (LIAF) neuron model, so that analog values can be
transmitted among neurons, and a deep network termed as LIAF-Net is built on it
for efficient spatiotemporal processing. In the temporal domain, LIAF follows
the traditional LIF dynamics to maintain its temporal processing capability. In
the spatial domain, LIAF is able to integrate spatial information through
convolutional integration or fully-connected integration. As a spatiotemporal
layer, LIAF can also be used with traditional artificial neural network (ANN)
layers jointly. Experiment results indicate that LIAF-Net achieves comparable
performance to Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) on
bAbI Question Answering (QA) tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance
on spatiotemporal Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) datasets, including MNIST-DVS,
CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128 Gesture, with much less number of synaptic weights and
computational overhead compared with traditional networks built by LSTM, GRU,
Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) or 3D convolution (Conv3D). Compared with
traditional LIF-SNN, LIAF-Net also shows dramatic accuracy gain on all these
experiments. In conclusion, LIAF-Net provides a framework combining the
advantages of both ANNs and SNNs for lightweight and efficient spatiotemporal
information processing.

coal fines are released during the production and development stages,
especially during hydraulic fracturing stimulation. These coal fines inevitably
cause mechanical pump failure and permeability damage due to aggregation and
subsequent pore throat blockage. This aggregation behavior is thus of key
importance in CSG production and needs to be minimized. Consequently, such coal
fines dispersions need to be stabilized, which can be achieved by the
formulation of improved fracturing fluids. Here, we thus systematically
investigated the effectiveness of two additives; ethanol, 0.5 wt percent and
SDBS, 0.001 and 0.01 wt percent, on dispersion stability for a wide range of
conditions: pH 6 to 11, salinity of 0.1 to 0.6 M NaCl brine. Technically, the
coal suspension flowed through a glass bead proppant pack, and fines retention
was measured. We found that even trace amounts of sodium dodecylbenzene
sulfonate SDBS i.e. 0.001 wt per cent drastically improved dispersion stability
and reduced fines retention. The retention was further quantified by fractal
dimensional analysis, which showed lower values for suspensions containing
SDBS. This research advances current CSG applications and thus contributes to
improved energy security.

the MRS team coordinates to maintain a connected topology while equipped with
limited field of view sensors. Applying the potential-based control framework
and assuming robot interaction is encoded by a triangular geometry, we derive a
distributed control law in order to achieve the topology control objective. A
typical shortcoming of potential-based control in distributed networks is that
the overall system behavior is highly sensitive to gain-tuning. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a distributed and adaptive gain controller that
preserves a designed pairwise interaction strength, independent of the network
size. Over that, we implement a control scheme that enables the MRS to be
resilient against exogenous attacks on on-board sensors or actuator of the
robots in MRS. In this regard, we model additive sensor and actuator faults
which are induced externally to render the MRS unstable. However, applying
$H_{\infty}$ control protocols by employing a static output-feedback design
technique guarantees bounded $L_2$ gains of the error induced by the sensor and
actuator fault signals. Finally, we apply policy iteration based Q-Learning to
solve for adaptive gains for the discrete-time MRS. Simulation results are
provided to support the theoretical findings.

neural network from a large-scale dataset and then fine-tune the pre-trained
model to a specific downstream task. Recently, both supervised and unsupervised
pre-training approaches to learning representations have achieved remarkable
advances, which exploit the discriminative knowledge of labels and the
intrinsic structure of data, respectively. It follows natural intuition that
both discriminative knowledge and intrinsic structure of the downstream task
can be useful for fine-tuning, however, existing fine-tuning methods mainly
leverage the former and discard the latter. A question arises: How to fully
explore the intrinsic structure of data for boosting fine-tuning? In this
paper, we propose Bi-tuning, a general learning framework to fine-tuning both

Bi-tuning generalizes the vanilla fine-tuning by integrating two heads upon the
backbone of pre-trained representations: a classifier head with an improved
contrastive cross-entropy loss to better leverage the label information in an
instance-contrast way, and a projector head with a newly-designed categorical
contrastive learning loss to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of data in a

exploit the rotational dynamics of a microfluidic device to develop a new

show that this modality normally measures the volume of the particle while
being insensitive to its density. Paradoxically, particle density only emerges
when fluid viscosity becomes dominant over inertia. We explain this paradox via
a viscosity-driven, hydrodynamic coupling between the fluid and the particle

standard perturbation theory and effective field theory to deal with non-linear
physics. We compare these formalisms and conclude that the unequal-time power
spectrum using effective field theory breaks for larger scales. As an
alternative, we introduce the midpoint approximation. We also provide, for the

We use DES Y1 and LSST-like redshift distributions for our analysis. We find
that the use of the Limber's approximation in weak lensing diverges from the
exact calculation of the angular power spectrum on large-angle separations,
$\ell < 10$. Even though this deviation is of order $2\%$ maximum for cosmic
lensing, we find the biggest effect for galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
lensing. We show that not only is this true for upcoming galaxy surveys, but

implement autoregressive learning, this method may not generate desirable
long-term behavior. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of

alternating link has a maximum braid index proportional to its minimum crossing
number, such as the $T(2,2n)$ torus link, then the ropelength of the link is
bounded below by a constant multiple of its minimum crossing number. However if
the maximum braid index of a link is small compared to its crossing number,
then there are no known results about whether its ropelength is bounded below
by a constant multiple of its crossing number. For example, the $T(2,2n+1)$
torus knot has a minimum knot diagram that looks almost identical to that of
the $T(2,2n)$ torus link, yet whether its ropelength is bounded below by a

training data and evaluation data are sampled from the same distribution.
However, this assumption is violated when the model is evaluated on another
unseen but similar database, even if that database contains the same classes.
This problem is caused by domain-shift and can be solved using two approaches:
domain adaptation and domain generalization. Simply, domain adaptation methods
can access data from unseen domains during training; whereas in domain
generalization, the unseen data is not available during training. Hence, domain
generalization concerns models that perform well on inaccessible,
domain-shifted data. Method: Our proposed domain generalization method
represents an unseen domain using a set of known basis domains, afterwhich we
classify the unseen domain using classifier fusion. To demonstrate our system,
we employ a collection of heart sound databases that contain normal and
abnormal sounds (classes). Results: Our proposed classifier fusion method
achieves accuracy gains of up to 16% for four completely unseen domains.
Conclusion: Recognizing the complexity induced by the inherent temporal nature
of biosignal data, the two-stage method proposed in this study is able to
effectively simplify the whole process of domain generalization while
demonstrating good results on unseen domains and the adopted basis domains.
Significance: To our best knowledge, this is the first study that investigates
domain generalization for biosignal data. Our proposed learning strategy can be
used to effectively learn domain-relevant features while being aware of the
class differences in the data.

natural nervous systems: overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. It can even
memorize randomly labelled data, which has little knowledge behind the
instance-label pairs. When a deep network continually learns over time by
accommodating new tasks, it usually quickly overwrites the knowledge learned
from previous tasks. Referred to as the {\it neural variability}, it is
well-known in neuroscience that human brain reactions exhibit substantial
variability even in response to the same stimulus. This mechanism balances
accuracy and plasticity/flexibility in the motor learning of natural nervous
systems. Thus it motivates us to design a similar mechanism named {\it
artificial neural variability} (ANV), which helps artificial neural networks
learn some advantages from ``natural'' neural networks. We rigorously prove
that ANV plays as an implicit regularizer of the mutual information between the
training data and the learned model. This result theoretically guarantees ANV a
strictly improved generalizability, robustness to label noise, and robustness
to catastrophic forgetting. We then devise a {\it neural variable risk
minimization} (NVRM) framework and {\it neural variable optimizers} to achieve
ANV for conventional network architectures in practice. The empirical studies

transition in spiral elastic valley metamaterials by parameter modulations. We
show the evolution of Berry curvature and valley Chern number as a function of
inherent parameters of spiral, which further results in a general scheme to
achieve topological valley edge states. Our strategy leverages multiple degrees

characterized by a linear relationship between the fiber elongation rate and
the monomer concentration. However, in high concentration regions, a sub-linear
dependence was often observed, which could be explained by a universal
saturation mechanism. In this paper, we modeled the saturated elongation
process through a Michaelis-Menten like mechanism, which is constituted by two
sub-steps -- unspecific association and dissociation of a monomer with the
fibril end, and subsequent conformational change of the associated monomer to
fit itself to the fibrillar structure. Typical saturation concentrations were
found to be $7-70\mu M$ for A$\beta$40, $\alpha$-synuclein and etc.
Furthermore, by using a novel Hamiltonian formulation, analytical solutions
valid for both weak and strong saturated conditions were constructed and
applied to the fibrillation kinetics of $\alpha$-synuclein and silk fibroin.

We propose a novel coded computing framework, CodedFedL, that injects
structured coding redundancy into federated learning for mitigating stragglers
and speeding up the training procedure. CodedFedL enables coded computing for
non-linear federated learning by efficiently exploiting distributed kernel
embedding via random Fourier features that transforms the training task into
computationally favourable distributed linear regression. Furthermore, clients
generate local parity datasets by coding over their local datasets, while the
server combines them to obtain the global parity dataset. Gradient from the
global parity dataset compensates for straggling gradients during training, and
thereby speeds up convergence. For minimizing the epoch deadline time at the
MEC server, we provide a tractable approach for finding the amount of coding
redundancy and the number of local data points that a client processes during
training, by exploiting the statistical properties of compute as well as
communication delays. We also characterize the leakage in data privacy when
clients share their local parity datasets with the server. We analyze the
convergence rate and iteration complexity of CodedFedL under simplifying
assumptions, by treating CodedFedL as a stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments using practical network
parameters and benchmark datasets, where CodedFedL speeds up the overall
training time by up to $15\times$ in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

associated with a family of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This
topological gravity is of the cohomological type, and it exhibits an ${\cal
N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed this theory
in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$
superspace, first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric
$g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace versions of the lapse and shift
variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving
spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci
flow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse.
Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step
BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and
whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$,
and (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The
supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction plays the role of the BRST
charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly
""shifted"" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum
gravity outside of the present topological context. In contrast to the
foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms, the gauge symmetries identified
in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this theory has
no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual
interpretation of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of
ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with the role of ghosts and antighosts
interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal N}=2$

pruning and quantization can reduce the model size and computation cost to meet
the deployment requirements. However, such a step-wise application of pruning
and quantization may lead to suboptimal solutions and unnecessary time
consumption. In this paper, we tackle this issue by integrating network pruning
and quantization as a unified joint compression problem and then use AutoML to
automatically solve it. We find the pruning process can be regarded as the
channel-wise quantization with 0 bit. Thus, the separate two-step pruning and
quantization can be simplified as the one-step quantization with mixed
precision. This unification not only simplifies the compression pipeline but
also avoids the compression divergence. To implement this idea, we propose the
automated model compression by jointly applied pruning and quantization (AJPQ).
AJPQ is designed with a hierarchical architecture: the layer controller
controls the layer sparsity, and the channel controller decides the bit-width
for each kernel. Following the same importance criterion, the layer controller
and the channel controller collaboratively decide the compression strategy.
With the help of reinforcement learning, our one-step compression is
automatically achieved. Compared with the state-of-the-art automated
compression methods, our method obtains a better accuracy while reducing the
storage considerably. For fixed precision quantization, AJPQ can reduce more
than five times model size and two times computation with a slight performance
increase for Skynet in remote sensing object detection. When mixed-precision is
allowed, AJPQ can reduce five times model size with only 1.06% top-5 accuracy
decline for MobileNet in the classification task.

characterize the simulation costs of two major schemes, stabilizer-state
sampling of magic states and Heisenberg propagation, for quantum circuits being
subject to stochastic Pauli noise, such as depolarizing and dephasing noise. To
this end, we introduce several techniques for the stabilizer-state sampling to
reduce the simulation costs under such noise. It revealed that in the low noise
regime, stabilizer-state sampling results in a smaller sampling cost, while
Heisenberg propagation is better in the high noise regime. Furthermore, for a
high depolarizing noise rate $\sim 10\%$, these methods provide better scaling
compared to that given by the low-rank stabilizer decomposition. We believe
that these knowledge of classical simulation costs is useful to squeeze
possible quantum advantage on near-term noisy quantum devices as well as
efficient classical simulation methods.

Mach^(-1/p_sup), where Mach is the three-dimensional Mach number, and L is
either the driving scale of turbulence or the diameter of a molecular cloud. If
L is the driving scale, we measure phi_s = 0.42 (+0.12) (-0.09), primarily
because of the separation between the driving scale and the start of the
supersonic cascade. For a supersonic cascade extending beyond the cloud scale,
we get phi_s = 0.91 (+0.25) (-0.20). In both cases, phi_s < 1, because we find

stability of the gravitational sector. The investigation deals mainly with the
construction of a first order framework capable of using a single scalar field
to simulate warp functions that appear in two-field models. In particular, we
find specific symmetric and asymmetric brane configurations that engender
asymptotic profiles with symmetric and asymmetric five-dimensional anti-de
Sitter geometries. Thus, including a Lagrange multiplier unveils an alternative
approach to induce brane structure using a single scalar field, tracing out new
avenues of research in braneworld scenarios, naturally leading to interesting
results for the localization of matter fields in the brane.

well when the number of covariates p increases as the number of subjects n

with the true correlation structure, especially when the data are contaminated.
Moreover, the proposed method is robust against outliers in the response
variables and/or covariates. Furthermore, the oracle properties for robust
smooth-threshold estimating equations under ""large n, diverging p"" are
established under some regularity conditions. Extensive simulation studies and
a yeast cell cycle data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed

concerns at once. For researchers interested in bugs, tangled commits mean that
they actually study not only bugs, but also other concerns irrelevant for the
study of bugs.
  Objective: We want to improve our understanding of the prevalence of tangling
and the types of changes that are tangled within bug fixing commits.
  Methods: We use a crowd sourcing approach for manual labeling to validate
which changes contribute to bug fixes for each line in bug fixing commits. Each
line is labeled by four participants. If at least three participants agree on
the same label, we have consensus.
  Results: We estimate that between 17% and 32% of all changes in bug fixing
commits modify the source code to fix the underlying problem. However, when we
only consider changes to the production code files this ratio increases to 66%
to 87%. We find that about 11% of lines are hard to label leading to active
disagreements between participants. Due to confirmed tangling and the
uncertainty in our data, we estimate that 3% to 47% of data is noisy without
manual untangling, depending on the use case.
  Conclusion: Tangled commits have a high prevalence in bug fixes and can lead
to a large amount of noise in the data. Prior research indicates that this
noise may alter results. As researchers, we should be skeptics and assume that
unvalidated data is likely very noisy, until proven otherwise.

by optimal bilateral collateral contracts between capital raisers and their

We show that bilateral contracting will not suffice to resolve systemic risk,

scheme for all capital raisers. Furthermore, the minimum total collateral that

arbitrarily higher, even in simple cyclic investment networks, compared with
its corresponding non-network environment. Additionally, we prove

this growth there is a significant increase in demand for compute resources.
Demand is manifested in the form of Virtual Machine (VM) requests, which need
to be assigned to physical machines in a way that minimizes resource
fragmentation and efficiently utilizes the available machines. This problem can
be modeled as a dynamic version of the bin packing problem with the objective
of minimizing the total usage time of the bins (physical machines). Earlier
works on dynamic bin packing assumed that no knowledge is available to the
scheduler and later works studied models in which lifetime/duration of each
""item"" (VM in our context) is available to the scheduler. This extra
information was shown to improve exponentially the achievable competitive
ratio.
  Motivated by advances in Machine Learning that provide good estimates of
workload characteristics, this paper studies the effect of having extra
information regarding future (total) demand. In the cloud context, since demand
is an aggregate over many VM requests, it can be predicted with high accuracy
(e.g., using historical data). We show that the competitive factor can be
dramatically improved by using this additional information; in some cases, we
achieve constant competitiveness, or even a competitive factor that approaches
1. Along the way, we design new offline algorithms with improved approximation

remove features on dynamic objects, making the SLAM unaffected by them. We also
propose a new stereo dataset and new metrics to evaluate SLAM robustness. Our

more features on dynamic objects that on the static background. Consensus
inversions are challenging for SLAM as they may cause major SLAM failures. Our

websites and data leaks. Past research has proposed and evaluated sending
automated security notifications to the operators of misconfigured websites,
but encountered issues with reachability, mistrust, and a perceived lack of
importance. In this paper, we seek to understand the determinants of effective
notifications. We identify a data protection misconfiguration that affects 12.7
% of the 1.3 million websites we scanned and opens them up to legal liability.
Using a subset of 4754 websites, we conduct a multivariate randomized
controlled notification experiment, evaluating contact medium, sender, and
framing of the message. We also include a link to a public web-based
self-service tool that is run by us in disguise and conduct an anonymous survey
of the notified website owners (N=477) to understand their perspective.
  We find that framing a misconfiguration as a problem of legal compliance can
increase remediation rates, especially when the notification is sent as a
letter from a legal research group, achieving remediation rates of 76.3 %
compared to 33.9 % for emails sent by computer science researchers warning
about a privacy issue. Across all groups, 56.6 % of notified owners remediated
the issue, compared to 9.2 % in the control group. In conclusion, we present
factors that lead website owners to trust a notification, show what framing of
the notification brings them into action, and how they can be supported in
remediating the issue.

vector-like top partners, dubbed as ""softons"", to restore the shift symmetry of
DM in top Yukawa sector, which however is only broken by the softon masses. The
portal coupling would automatically vanish as the shift-symmetry-breaking

Recently, the multi-party quantum fingerprinting is studied on whether the

just to know whether these messages are the same, we usually need to know the
relationship among them. We provide a general model of quantum fingerprinting
network, defining the relationship function $f^R$ and giving the corresponding

the protocol based on the two-party quantum fingerprinting and find that the

communication time. Finally, the method of encoding more than one bit on each

presumes linear representativity of matroids, we consider the general oracle
model. For the special case where the coverage function is linear, we give a
deterministic fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized by $\ell$ and $k$. This
result, combined with the lower bounds of Lovasz, and Jensen and Korte
demonstrates a separation between the $\ell$-matchoid and the matroid
$\ell$-parity problems in the setting of fixed-parameter tractability. For a
general coverage function, we give both deterministic and randomized
fixed-parameter algorithms, parameterized by $\ell$ and $z$, where $z$ is the
number of points covered in an optimal solution. The resulting algorithms can
be directly translated into streaming algorithms. For unweighted coverage
functions, we show that we can find an exact solution even when the function is
given in the form of a value oracle (and so we do not have access to an
explicit representation of the set system). Our result can be implemented in
the streaming setting and stores a number of elements depending only on $\ell$
and $z$, but completely indpendent of the total size $n$ of the ground set.
This shows that it is possible to circumvent the recent space lower bound of
Feldman et al, by parameterizing the solution value. This result, combined with
existing lower bounds, also provides a new separation between the space and
time complexity of maximizing an arbitrary submodular function and a coverage
function in the value oracle model.

orthorhombic, and rhombohedral), compounds (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3), and
external conditions (photoexcitation, strain, and temperature). In particular,
in the tetragonal phase of these compounds, all types of topological phonons
can simultaneously emerge when stabilized by photoexcitation, whereas the
tetragonal phase stabilized by thermal fluctuations only hosts a more limited
set of topological phonon states. Additionally, we find that the photoexcited
carrier concentration can be used to tune the topological phonon states and
induce topological transitions even without associated structural phase
changes. Overall, we propose oxide perovskites as a versatile platform in which

produce accurate anisotropic exchange coupling energies and unambiguously
determine a crossover temperature ($\sim$25 K in the case of $NaYbSe2$), below

further validated the effective picture by successfully explaining the

avoid, whether it happens via direct means (e.g. own code modification) or
indirectly (e.g. influencing the operator, exploiting bugs or the environment).
It has been argued that intelligent agents have an incentive to avoid modifying
their utility function so that their future instances work towards the same
goals.
  Everitt et al. (2016) formally show that providing an option to self-modify
is harmless for perfectly rational agents. We show that this result is no
longer true for agents with bounded rationality. In such agents,
self-modification may cause exponential deterioration in performance and
gradual misalignment of a previously aligned agent. We investigate how the size
of this effect depends on the type and magnitude of imperfections in the
agent's rationality (1-4 below). We also discuss model assumptions and the
wider problem and framing space.
  We examine four ways in which an agent can be bounded-rational: it either (1)
doesn't always choose the optimal action, (2) is not perfectly aligned with
human values, (3) has an inaccurate model of the environment, or (4) uses the
wrong temporal discounting factor. We show that while in the cases (2)-(4) the
misalignment caused by the agent's imperfection does not increase over time,
with (1) the misalignment may grow exponentially.

different in dissipative and non-dissipative universes, even if the background
evolution of the two universes is the same. To clarify the difference between
the two universes, first-order density perturbations are studied, using two
types of holographic cosmological models. The first type is a ""$\Lambda(t)$
model"" similar to a time-varying $\Lambda(t)$ cosmology for the non-dissipative
universe. The second type is a ""BV model"" similar to a bulk viscous cosmology
for the dissipative universe. To systematically examine the two different
universes, a power-law term proportional to $H^{\alpha}$ is applied to the
$\Lambda(t)$ and BV (bulk-viscous-cosmology-like) models, assuming a flat
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker model for the late universe. Here, $H$ is the
Hubble parameter and $\alpha$ is a free parameter whose value is a real number.
The $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ and BV-$H^{\alpha}$ models are used to examine
first-order density perturbations for matter, in which the background evolution
of the two models is equivalent. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the
two models are discussed, with a focus on the maximization of entropy on the
horizon of the universe, extending previous analyses [Phys. Rev. D 100, 123545
(2019) (arXiv:1911.08306); 102, 063512 (2020) (arXiv:2006.09650)].
Consequently, the $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ model for small $|\alpha|$ values
is found to be consistent with observations and satisfies the thermodynamic
constraints, compared with the BV-$H^{\alpha}$ model. The results show that the
non-dissipative universe described by the $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ model

threshold of the stochastic epidemic system which determines the extinction or

This threshold is denoted by $\xi$ which depends on the white and jump noises.
The effects of these noises on the dynamics of the model are studied. The
numerical experiments show that the random perturbation introduced in the
stochastic model suppresses disease outbreaks as compared to its deterministic
counterpart. In other words, the impact of the noises on the extinction and
persistence is high. When the noise is large or small, our numerical findings
show that the COVID-19 vanishes from the population if $\xi <1;$ whereas the
epidemic can't go out of control if $\xi >1.$ From this, we observe that white

infection, i.e., we can conclude that the stochastic model is more realistic

consisting of electrons and ions starting from a completely general, ideal
two-fluid dispersion relation. The plasma is characterised by five variables:
the electron and ion magnetisations, the squared electron and ion sound speeds,
and a parameter describing the angle between the propagation vector and the
magnetic field. The dispersion relation describes 6 pairs of waves which we
label S, A, F, M, O, and X. Varying the angle, it is argued that parallel and
perpendicular propagation (with respect to the magnetic field) exhibit unique
behaviour. This behaviour is characterised by the crossing of wave modes which
is prohibited at oblique angles. We identify up to 6 different parameter
regimes where a varying number of exact mode crossings in the special parallel
or perpendicular orientations can occur. We point out how any ion-electron
plasma has a critical magnetisation (or electron cyclotron frequency) at which
the cutoff ordering changes, leading to different crossing behaviour. These are
relevant for exotic plasma conditions found in pulsar and magnetar
environments. Our discussion is fully consistent with ideal relativistic MHD
and contains light waves. Additionally, exploiting the general nature of the
dispersion relation, phase and group speed diagrams can be computed at
arbitrary wavelengths for any parameter regime. Finally, we recover earlier
approximate dispersion relations that focus on low-frequency limits and make
direct correspondences with some selected kinetic theory results.

catalogue of the Coma cluster to search for substructure. With so few of the
Coma galaxies directly detected in HI, we use the HI stacking technique to
probe average HI content below what can be directly detected. Using the
Dressler-Shectman test, we find 15 substructures within the footprint of the

find that the Coma galaxies (for which are not detected in HI) are more than

the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic under varying policy scenarios. Agents
differ with regard to their profession, family status and age and interact with
other agents at home, work or during leisure activities. The model allows to
implement and test actually used or counterfactual policies such as closing
schools or the leisure industry explicitly in the model in order to explore
their impact on the spread of the virus, and their economic consequences. The
model is calibrated with German statistical data on time use, demography,
households, firm demography, employment, company profits and wages. I set up a
baseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit the
epidemiological parameters of the simulation to the observed German death curve
and an estimated infection curve of the first COVID-19 wave. My model suggests
that by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in Germany
would have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if the
policies had been enacted a week earlier. I finally discuss two stylized fiscal
policy scenarios: procyclical (zero-deficit) and anticyclical fiscal policy. In
the zero-deficit scenario a vicious circle emerges, in which the economic
recession spreads from the high-interaction leisure industry to the rest of the
economy. Even after eliminating the virus and lifting the restrictions, the
economic recovery is incomplete. Anticyclical fiscal policy on the other hand
limits the economic losses and allows for a V-shaped recovery, but does not
increase the number of deaths. These results suggest that an optimal response
to the pandemic aiming at containment or holding out for a vaccine combines
early introduction of containment measures to keep the number of infected low
with expansionary fiscal policy to keep output in lower risk sectors high.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) layers on graphic processing units (GPU).
The Nvidia deep neural network (cuDnn) library provides the most effective
implementation of deep learning (DL) algorithms for GPUs. GPUs are one of the
most efficient and commonly used accelerators for deep learning computations.
The modern CNN models need megabytes of coefficients and needed millions MAC
operations to perform convolution. One of the most common techniques for
compressing CNN models is weight pruning. There are two main types of pruning:
structural (based on removing whole weight channels) and non-structural
(removing individual weights). The first enables much easier acceleration, but
with this type it is difficult to achieve a sparsity level and accuracy as high
as that obtained with the second type. Non-structural pruning with retraining

generate a training dataset which simulates the normal operation of the

real machinery. In particular, we introduce a clustering-based approach, called
Cluster Centers (CC), and a neural architecture based on the Siamese
Autoencoders (SAE), which are tailored for weakly-supervised settings with very
few labeled data samples. The performance of the proposed methods is compared
against various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on an application
to a real-world dataset from a facility monitoring system, by using a multitude
of performance measures. Also, the influence of hyper-parameters related to
feature extraction and network architecture is investigated. We find that the
proposed SAE based solutions outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection
approaches very robustly for many different hyper-parameter settings on all

largest catalogue of serendipitous X-ray sources, with the 3XMM being the third
version of this catalogue. This is because of the combination of a large
effective area (5000 $\rm cm^2$ at 1 keV) and a wide field of view (30 arcmin).
The 3XMM-DR6 catalogue contains about 470,000 unique X-ray sources over an area
of 982 $\rm deg^2$. A significant fraction of these (100,178 sources) have
reliable optical, near/mid-IR counterparts in the SDSS, PANSTARRS, VIDEO,
UKIDSS and WISE surveys. In a previous paper we have presented photometric
redshifts for these sources using the TPZ machine learning algorithm. About one
fourth of these (22,677) have adequate photon statistics so that a reliable
X-ray spectrum can be extracted. Obviously, owing to both the X-ray counts
selection and the optical counterpart constraint, the sample above is biased
towards the bright sources. Here, we present XMMFITCAT-Z: a spectral fit
catalogue for these sources using the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA) technique.
As a science demonstration of the potential of the present catalogue, we
comment on the optical and mid-IR colours of the 765 X-ray absorbed sources
with $N_\mathrm{H} > 10^{22}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. We show that a considerable
fraction of X-ray selected AGN would not be classified as AGN following the
mid-IR W1-W2 vs. W2 selection criterion. These are AGN with lower luminosities,
where the contribution of the host galaxy to the MIR emission is
non-negligible. Only one third of obscured AGN in X-rays present red colours or
r-W2 > 6. Then it appears that the r-W2 criterion, often used in the literature
for the selection of obscured AGN, produces very different X-ray absorbed AGN
samples compared to the standard X-ray selection criteria.

automatically discover phenotypes from the electronic health records (EHR) with
minimal human supervision. Such methods generally require an input tensor
describing the inter-modal interactions to be pre-established; however, the
correspondence between different modalities (e.g., correspondence between
medications and diagnoses) can often be missing in practice. Although heuristic
methods can be applied to estimate them, they inevitably introduce errors, and
leads to sub-optimal phenotype quality. This is particularly important for
patients with complex health conditions (e.g., in critical care) as multiple
diagnoses and medications are simultaneously present in the records. To
alleviate this problem and discover phenotypes from EHR with unobserved
inter-modal correspondence, we propose the collective hidden interaction tensor
factorization (cHITF) to infer the correspondence between multiple modalities
jointly with the phenotype discovery. We assume that the observed matrix for
each modality is marginalization of the unobserved inter-modal correspondence,
which are reconstructed by maximizing the likelihood of the observed matrices.
Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate
that cHITF effectively infers clinically meaningful inter-modal correspondence,
discovers phenotypes that are more clinically relevant and diverse, and
achieves better predictive performance compared with a number of
state-of-the-art computational phenotyping models.

algebraic models for the rational homotopy theory of parametrised spectra. This
simplifies and complements the results of arXiv:1910.14608, which are based on
Quillen's rational homotopy theory.
  According to Sullivan, the rational homotopy type of a nilpotent space $X$
with finite Betti numbers is completely determined by a commutative
differential graded algebra $A$ modelling the cup product on rational
cohomology. In this article we extend this correspondence between topology and
algebra to parametrised stable homotopy theory: for a space $X$ corresponding
to the cdga $A$, we prove an equivalence between specific rational homotopy
categories for parametrised spectra over $X$ and for differential graded
$A$-modules. While not full, the rational homotopy categories we consider
contain a large class of parametrised spectra. The simplicity of the approach
that we develop enables direct calculations in parametrised stable homotopy
theory using differential graded modules.
  To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we build a comprehensive
dictionary of algebraic translations of topological constructions; providing
algebraic models for base change functors, fibrewise stabilisations,
parametrised Postnikov sections, fibrewise smash products, and complexes of
fibrewise stable maps.

leveraging the knowledge in a relevant source domain. While remarkable advances
have been made, almost all existing domain adaptation methods heavily require
large amounts of unlabeled target domain data for learning domain invariant
representations to achieve good generalizability on the target domain. In fact,
in many real-world applications, target domain data may not always be
available. In this paper, we study the cases where at the training phase the
target domain data is unavailable and only well-labeled source domain data is
available, called robust domain adaptation. To tackle this problem, under the
assumption that causal relationships between features and the class variable
are robust across domains, we propose a novel Causal AutoEncoder (CAE), which
integrates deep autoencoder and causal structure learning into a unified model
to learn causal representations only using data from a single source domain.
Specifically, a deep autoencoder model is adopted to learn low-dimensional
representations, and a causal structure learning model is designed to separate
the low-dimensional representations into two groups: causal representations and
task-irrelevant representations. Using three real-world datasets the extensive
experiments have validated the effectiveness of CAE compared to eleven
state-of-the-art methods.

early-stage disease indications whose recording constitutes a rare event, and
yet, whose precise detection at that stage is critical. In this type of highly
imbalanced classification problems, which encompass complex features, deep
learning (DL) is much needed because of its strong detection capabilities. At
the same time, DL is observed in practice to favor majority over minority
classes and consequently suffer from inaccurate detection of the targeted
early-stage indications. To simulate such scenarios, we artificially generate
skewness (99% vs. 1%) for certain plant types out of the PlantVillage dataset
as a basis for classification of scarce visual cues through transfer learning.
By randomly and unevenly picking healthy and unhealthy samples from certain
plant types to form a training set, we consider a base experiment as
fine-tuning ResNet34 and VGG19 architectures and then testing the model
performance on a balanced dataset of healthy and unhealthy images. We
empirically observe that the initial F1 test score jumps from 0.29 to 0.95 for
the minority class upon adding a final Batch Normalization (BN) layer just
before the output layer in VGG19. We demonstrate that utilizing an additional
BN layer before the output layer in modern CNN architectures has a considerable
impact in terms of minimizing the training time and testing error for minority
classes in highly imbalanced data sets. Moreover, when the final BN is
employed, minimizing the loss function may not be the best way to assure a high
F1 test score for minority classes in such problems. That is, the network might
perform better even if it is not confident enough while making a prediction;
leading to another discussion about why softmax output is not a good
uncertainty measure for DL models.

class of Little String Theories of A-type, which are engineered by $N$ parallel
M5-branes on a circle. To leading instanton order (from the perspective of the
low energy $U(N)$ gauge theory) and partially also to higher order, a
decomposition was observed, which resembles a Feynman diagrammatic expansion:
external states are given by expansion coefficients of the $N=1$ BPS free
energy and a quasi-Jacobi form that governs the BPS-counting of an M5-brane
coupling to two M2-branes. The effective coupling functions were written as
infinite series and similarities to modular graph functions were remarked. In
the current work we continue and extend this study: Working with the full
non-perturbative BPS free energy, we analyse in detail the cases $N=2,3$ and
$4$. We argue that in these cases to leading instanton order all coupling
functions can be written as a simple combination of two-point functions of a
single free scalar field on the torus. We provide closed form expressions,
which we conjecture to hold for generic $N$. To higher instanton order, we
observe that a decomposition of the free energy in terms of higher point
functions with the same external states is still possible but a priori not
unique. We nevertheless provide evidence that tentative coupling functions are
still combinations of scalar Greens functions, which are decorated with
derivatives or multiplied with holomorphic Eisenstein series. We interpret
these decorations as corrections of the leading order effective couplings and
in particular link the latter to dihedral graph functions with bivalent
vertices, which suggests an interpretation in terms of disconnected graphs.

in the context of incomplete databases, i.e., relational databases that can

that the domains of these unknown values are finite and, for a Boolean query
$q$, we consider the following two problems: given as input an incomplete
database $D$, (a) return the number of completions of $D$ that satisfy $q$; or
(b) return the number of valuations of the nulls of $D$ yielding a completion
that satisfies $q$. We obtain dichotomies between \#P-hardness and
polynomial-time computability for these problems when $q$ is a self-join-free
conjunctive query, and study the impact on the complexity of the following two
restrictions: (1) every null occurs at most once in $D$ (what is called Codd
tables); and (2) the domain of each null is the same. Roughly speaking, we show
that counting completions is much harder than counting valuations: for
instance, while the latter is always in \#P, we prove that the former is not in
\#P under some widely believed theoretical complexity assumption. Moreover, we
find that both (1) and (2) can reduce the complexity of our problems. We also
study the approximability of these problems and show that, while counting
valuations always has a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme
(FPRAS), in most cases counting completions does not. Finally, we consider more
expressive query languages and situate our problems with respect to known
complexity classes.

lie in two aspects. First, it is capable of more effectively exploring the
search space, due to its novel initialization procedure, crossover and
large-step-size operators. Second, it is also more efficient in local
exploitation, due to its sophisticated constant-time-complexity move evaluation
mechanism. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that MATE outperforms
all the state-of-the-art algorithms, and notably, finds new best-known

ablation study is also conducted to show the effectiveness of the novel

been extensively studied. Although these approaches have shown high performance
and reduced computational complexity compared to classical methods, most of
them require supervised training using paired artifact-free and
artifact-corrupted images, which may prohibit its use in many important
clinical applications. For example, transient severe motion (TSM) due to acute
transient dyspnea in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR is difficult to control and model
for paired data generation. To address this issue, here we propose a novel
unsupervised deep learning scheme through outlier-rejecting bootstrap
subsampling and aggregation. This is inspired by the observation that motions
usually cause sparse k-space outliers in the phase encoding direction, so
k-space subsampling along the phase encoding direction can remove some outliers
and the aggregation step can further improve the results from the
reconstruction network. Our method does not require any paired data because the
training step only requires artifact-free images. Furthermore, to address the
smoothing from potential bias to the artifact-free images, the network is
trained in an unsupervised manner using optimal transport driven cycleGAN. We
verify that our method can be applied for artifact correction from simulated
motion as well as real motion from TSM successfully, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

originates from non-zero scalar spin chirality, is an important feature for
mesoscopic topological structures, such as skyrmions. However, the THE might
also arise from other microscopic non-coplanar spin structures in the lattice.
Thus, the origin of the THE inevitably needs to be determined to fully
understand skyrmions and find new host materials. Here, we examine the Hall
effect in both bulk- and micron-sized lamellar samples of MnBi. The sample size
affects the temperature and field range in which the THE is detectable.
Although bulk sample exhibits the THE only upon exposure to weak fields in the
easy-cone state, in thin lamella the THE exists across a wide temperature range
and occurs at fields near saturation. Our results show that both the
non-coplanar spin structure in the lattice and topologically non-trivial
skyrmion bubbles are responsible for the THE, and that the dominant mechanism
depends on the sample size. Hence, the magnetic phase diagram for MnBi is
strongly size-dependent. Our study provides an example in which the THE is
simultaneously induced by two mechanisms, and builds a bridge between
mesoscopic and microscopic magnetic structures.

have the aspect of sudden mechanical morphings. Frequently, the driving force
of the instability mechanisms has a chemo-mechanical nature which makes these
kind of instabilities very different from standard elastic instabilities. In
this paper, we describe and study the active-elastic instability occurring in a
swollen spherical closed shell, bounding a water filled cavity, during a
de-hydration process. The description is given through the outcomes of a few
numerical experiments based on a stress-diffusion model which allows to glance
at the phenomenon. The study is carried on from a chemo-mechanical perspective
through a few simplifying assumptions which allow to derive a semi-analytical
model which takes into account both the stress state and the water
concentration into the walls of the shell at the onset of the instability.
Moreover, also the invariance of the cavity volume at the onset of instability,
which is due to the impossibility to instantaneously change the cavity volume
filled with water, is considered. It is shown as the semi-analytic model
matches very well the outcome of the numerical experiments. It is also shown as
a wider range of mechanical instabilities can be produced when inhomogeneous
shells are considered, even when the inhomogeneities can be described by a
small number of parameters.

directly applied in heterogeneous environment. To tackle above challenges, we
propose a novel framework for incorporating temporal information into HIN
embedding, denoted as Multi-View Dynamic HIN Embedding (MDHNE), which can
efficiently preserve evolution patterns of implicit relationships from
different views in updating node representations over time. We first transform
HIN to a series of homogeneous networks corresponding to different views. Then
our proposed MDHNE applies Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to incorporate
evolving pattern of complex network structure and semantic relationships
between nodes into latent embedding spaces, and thus the node representations
from multiple views can be learned and updated when HIN evolves over time.
Moreover, we come up with an attention based fusion mechanism, which can
automatically infer weights of latent representations corresponding to
different views by minimizing the objective function specific for different
mining tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our MDHNE model
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world dynamic datasets for

exciting growth due to its applications across various disciplines like disease
controlling, community finding, data mining, network system controlling, just
to name a few. Many measures have thus been proposed to date, and these
measures are either based on the locality of nodes or the global nature of the
network. These measures typically use distance based on the concept of
traditional Euclidean Distance, which only focus on the local static geographic
distance between nodes but ignore the interaction between nodes in real-world
networks. However, a variety of factors should be considered for the purpose of
identifying influential nodes, such as degree, edge, direction and weight. Some
methods based on evidence theory have also been proposed. In this paper, we
have proposed an original and novel gravity model with effective distance for
identifying influential nodes based on information fusion and multi-level
processing. Our method is able to comprehensively consider the global and local
information of the complex network, and also utilize the effective distance to
replace the Euclidean Distance. This allows us to fully consider the complex
topological structure of the real network, as well as the dynamic interaction
information between nodes. In order to validate the effectiveness of our

bilayer graphene subjected to terahertz radiation and a magnetic field. The
resonantly excited edge photocurrent is observed for both inter-band (at low
carrier densities) and intra-band (at high densities) transitions between
Landau levels (LL). While the intra-band LL transitions can be traced to the
classical cyclotron resonance (CR) and produce strong resonant features, the
inter-band-LL resonances have quantum nature and lead to the weaker features in
the measured photocurrent spectra. The magnitude and polarization properties of
the observed features agree with the semiclassical theory of the intra-band
edge photogalvanic effect, including its Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations at low
temperatures.

shifted into the focus of scientific research. In this context, systems with
efficient through-space charge transport pathways resulting from pi-stacked
conjugated linkers are of particular interest. In the current manuscript, we
use density functional theory based simulations to provide a detailed
understanding of such MOFs, which in the present case are derived from the
prototypical Zn2(TTFTB) system. In particular we show that factors like the
relative arrangement of neighboring linkers and the details of the structural
conformations of the individual building blocks have a profound impact on band
widths and charge transfer. Considering the helical stacking of individual
tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) molecules around a screw axis as the dominant symmetry
element in Zn2(TTFTB)-derived materials, the focus here is primarily on the
impact of the relative rotation of neighboring molecules. Not unexpectedly,
also changing the stacking distance in the helix plays a distinct role,
especially for structures, which display large electronic couplings to start
with. The presented results provide guidelines for achieving structures with
improved electronic couplings. It is, however, also shown that structural
defects (especially missing linkers) provide major obstacles to charge
transport in the studied, essentially one-dimensional systems. This suggests
that especially the sample quality is a decisive factor for ensuring efficient
through-space charge transport in MOFs comprising stacked pi-systems.

  for Tile-Based 360 Degree Wireless Video Streaming",,,,,"cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Wirelessly streaming high quality 360 degree videos is still a challenging
problem. When there are many users watching different 360 degree videos and
competing for the computing and communication resources, the streaming
algorithm at hand should maximize the average quality of experience (QoE) while
guaranteeing a minimum rate for each user. In this paper, we propose a
\emph{cross layer} optimization approach that maximizes the available rate to
each user and efficiently uses it to maximize users' QoE. Particularly, we
consider a tile based 360 degree video streaming, and we optimize a QoE metric
that balances the tradeoff between maximizing each user's QoE and ensuring
fairness among users. We show that the problem can be decoupled into two
interrelated subproblems: (i) a physical layer subproblem whose objective is to
find the download rate for each user, and (ii) an application layer subproblem
whose objective is to use that rate to find a quality decision per tile such
that the user's QoE is maximized. We prove that the physical layer subproblem
can be solved optimally with low complexity and an actor-critic deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to leverage the parallel training of
multiple independent agents and solve the application layer subproblem.
Extensive experiments reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its
significant performance improvement compared to several baseline algorithms.

planetary nebulae (CSPNe) with good quality astrometric measurements, that we
refer to as GAPN, Golden Astrometry Planetary Nebulae. Gaia astrometric and
photometric measurements allowed us to derive accurate distances and radii, and
to calculate luminosities with the addition of self-consistent literature
values. Such information was used to plot the position of these stars in a
Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram and to study their evolutionary status in
comparison with CSPNe evolutionary tracks.
  The extremely precise measurement of parallaxes and proper motions in Gaia
DR2 has allowed us to search for wide binary companions in a region close to
each of the central stars in the GAPN sample. We limited our search to a region
around 20,000 AU of each CSPN to minimise accidental detections, and only
considered stars with good parallax and proper motions data, i.e. with errors
below 30% in DR2. We determined that the hypothetical binary pairs should show
a statistically significant agreement for the three astrometric quantities,
i.e. parallax and both components of proper motions.
  We found 8 wide binary systems among our GAPN sample. One of them is in a
triple system. We compiled the astrometric and photometric measurements of
these binary systems and discussed them in comparison with previously published
searches for binaries in PNe. By analysing the position in the HR diagram of
the companion stars using Gaia photometry, we are able to estimatetheir
temperatures, luminosities, masses and, for one star, the evolutionary age. The
derived quantities yield a consistent scenario when compared with the
corresponding values as obtained for the central stars using stellar

to the possibility of phase transitions in quantum chromodynamics, stars could
be hybrid and have quark cores. We investigate some imprints of elastic quark
phases (only when perturbed) on the dynamical stability of hybrid stars. We
show that they increase the dynamical stability window of hybrid stars in the
sense that the onset of instabilities happen at larger central densities than
the ones for maximum masses. In particular, when the shear modulus of a
crystalline quark phase is taken at face value, the relative radius differences
between elastic and perfect-fluid hybrid stars with null radial frequencies
(onset of instability) would be up to $1-2\%$. Roughly, this would imply a
maximum relative radius dispersion (on top of the perfect-fluid predictions) of
$2-4\%$ for stars in a given mass range exclusively due to the elasticity of
the quark phase. In the more agnostic approach where the estimates for the
quark shear modulus only suggest its possible order of magnitude (due to the
many approximations taken in its calculation), the relative radius dispersion
uniquely due to a quark phase elasticity might be as large as $5-10\%$.
Finally, we discuss possible implications of the above dispersion of radii for
the constraint of the elasticity of a quark phase with electromagnetic missions
such as NICER, eXTP and ATHENA.

lines from nucleosynthesis was one of the prominent science goals of the
INTEGRAL mission and in particular its spectrometer SPI. Emission from 26Al and
from 60Fe decay lines originates from accumulated ejecta of nucleosynthesis
sources, and appears diffuse in nature. 26Al and 60Fe are believed to originate
mostly from massive star clusters. Gamma-ray observations open an interesting
window to trace the fate and flow of nucleosynthesis ejecta, after they have
left the immediate sources and their birth sites, and on their path to mix with
ambient interstellar gas. The INTEGRAL 26Al emission image confirms earlier
findings of clumpiness and an extent along the entire plane of the Galaxy,
supporting its origin from massive-star groups. INTEGRAL spectroscopy resolved
the line and found Doppler broadenings and systematic shifts from large-scale
galactic rotation. But an excess velocity of ~200 km/s suggests that 26Al
decays preferentially within large superbubbles that extend in forward
directions between spiral arms. The detection of 26Al line emission from nearby
Orion and the Eridanus superbubble supports this interpretation. Positrons from
beta+ decays of 26Al and other nucleosynthesis ejecta have been found to not
explain the morphology of positron annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV that have
been measured by INTEGRAL. The 60Fe signal measured by INTEGRAL is diffuse but
too weak for an imaging interpretation, an origin from point-like/concentrated
sources is excluded. The 60Fe/26Al ratio is constrained to a range 0.2-0.4.
Beyond improving precision of these results, diffuse nucleosynthesis
contributions from novae (through 22Na radioactivity) and from past neutron
star mergers in our Galaxy (from r-process radioactivity) are exciting new
prospects for the remaining mission extensions.

for detecting clusters in networks. In this paper, we propose an improved
spectral clustering (ISC) approach under the degree corrected stochastic block
model (DCSBM). ISC is designed based on the k-means clustering algorithm on the
weighted leading K + 1 eigenvectors of a regularized Laplacian matrix where the
weights are their corresponding eigenvalues. Theoretical analysis of ISC shows
that under mild conditions the ISC yields stable consistent community
detection. Numerical results show that ISC outperforms classical spectral
clustering methods for community detection on both simulated and eight
empirical networks. Especially, ISC provides a significant improvement on two
weak signal networks Simmons and Caltech, with error rates of 121/1137 and
96/590, respectively.

approximated by a plane, which is defined by measured points on the surface.
The method relies on linear Kalman filters, estimating the height of each point
on a 2D grid. Therefore, the approximation covariance for each grid point is
determined using a radial basis function to consider the measured point
positions. We propose different update strategies for the grid points
exploiting the locality of the planar approximation in combination with a
projection method. The approach is experimentally validated by tracking the
surface with a robotic manipulator. Three laser distance sensors mounted on the
end-effector continuously measure points on the surface during the motion to
determine the approximation plane. It is shown that the surface geometry can be
mapped reasonably accurate with a mean absolute error below 1 mm. The mapping
error mainly depends on the size of the approximation area and the curvature of
the surface.

to learn influence propagation model parameters and maximize the influence

linear threshold (LT) model. Because node activations in the LT model are due
to the aggregated effect of all active neighbors, it is more natural to model
OIM with the node-level feedback. And this brings new challenge in online
learning since we only observe aggregated effect from groups of nodes and the
groups are also random. Based on the linear structure in node activations, we
incorporate ideas from linear bandits and design an algorithm LT-LinUCB that is
consistent with the observed feedback. By proving group observation modulated

$\tilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(m)\sqrt{T})$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $T$

signal-input-signaloutput (SISO) linear finite-dimensional systems corrupted by
general input disturbances. A new observer, referred to as Extended Dynamics
Observer (EDO), is proposed to estimate both the state and disturbance
simultaneously. The working mechanism of EDO consists of two parts: The
disturbance with known dynamics is canceled completely by its dynamics and the
disturbance with unknown dynamics is absorbed by high-gain. It is found that
the high-gain is always working as long as the control plant with unknown input
disturbance is observable which is the only assumption for the observer design.
When the disturbance dynamics are completely unknown except some boundedness,
the EDO is reduced to an extension of the well-known extended state observer or
high-gain observer. The main advantage of the developed method is that the
prior information about both the control plant and the disturbance can be
utilized as much as possible. The more the prior information we have, the
better performance the observer would be. An EDO based stabilizing output
feedback is also developed in the spirit of estimation/cancellation strategy.
The stability of the resulting closed-loop system is established and some of
the theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations.

store information, but are nevertheless capable of solving complex tasks with
apparent ease. Intelligent behavior is related to these limitations, since
resource constraints drive the need to generalize and assign importance
differentially to features in the environment or memories of past experiences.
Recently, there have been parallel efforts in reinforcement learning and
neuroscience to understand strategies adopted by artificial and biological
agents to circumvent limitations in information storage. However, the two
threads have been largely separate. In this article, we propose a dynamical
framework to maximize expected reward under constraints of limited resources,
which we implement with a cost function that penalizes precise representations
of action-values in memory, each of which may vary in its precision. We derive
from first principles an algorithm, Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), which we
apply to two standard tasks in reinforcement learning and a model-based
planning task, and find that it allocates more resources to items in memory
that have a higher impact on cumulative rewards. Moreover, DRA learns faster
when starting with a higher resource budget than what it eventually allocates
for performing well on tasks, which may explain why frontal cortical areas in
biological brains appear more engaged in early stages of learning before
settling to lower asymptotic levels of activity. Our work provides a normative
solution to the problem of learning how to allocate costly resources to a
collection of uncertain memories in a manner that is capable of adapting to
changes in the environment.

contribution of small-scale flares, the so-called nanoflares, to the heating up
of the solar corona. To date, several studies have tried to derive the
occurrence frequency distribution of flares as a function of energy to reveal
the contribution of small-scale flares. However, there are no studies that
derive the distribution with considering the following conditions: (1)
evolution of the coronal loop plasma heated by small-scale flares, (2) loops
smaller than the spatial resolution of the observed image, and (3)
multiwavelength observation. To take into account these conditions, we
introduce a new method to analyze small-scale flares statistically based on a
one-dimensional loop simulation and a machine learning technique, that is,
genetic algorithm. First, we obtain six channels of SDO/AIA light curves of the
active-region coronal loops. Second, we carry out many coronal loop simulations
and obtain the SDO/AIA light curves for each simulation in a pseudo-manner.
Third, using the genetic algorithm, we estimate the best combination of
simulated light curves that reproduce the observation. Consequently, the
observed coronal loops are heated by small-scale flares with energy flux larger
than that typically required to heat up an active region intermittently.
Moreover, we derive the occurrence frequency distribution which have various
power-law indices in the range from 1 to 3, which partially supports the
nanoflare heating model. In contrast, we find that $90\%$ of the coronal
heating is done by flares that have energy larger than $10^{25}~\mathrm{erg}$.

be deformed into a minimal surface by exploiting lateral displacements only. We
analyze in detail pairs of motifs of the similar and of opposite handedness and
also an infinite chain of identical motifs with similar or alternating

unit sphere in $\mathbb{E}^n$ by at most $2^n$ congruent spherical caps with
radius not exceeding $\arccos\sqrt{\frac{n-1}{2n}}$ implies the $X$-ray
conjecture and the illumination conjecture for convex bodies of constant width
in $\mathbb{E}^n$, and constructed such coverings for $4\le n\le 6$. Here we
give such constructions with fewer than $2^n$ caps for $5\le n\le 15$.
  For the illumination number of any convex body of constant width in
$\mathbb{E}^n$, O.~Schramm proved an upper estimate with exponential growth of
order $(3/2)^{n/2}$. In particular, that estimate is less than $3\cdot 2^{n-2}$
for $n\ge 16$, confirming the above mentioned conjectures for the class of
convex bodies of constant width. Thus, our result settles the outstanding cases
$7\le n\le 15$.
  We also show how to calculate the covering radius of a given discrete point
set on the sphere efficiently on a computer.

homogeneous spaces. The Dirac equation with an invariant metric is shown to be
equivalent to a system of equations on a Lie group of transformations of a
homogeneous space. This allows us to effectively apply the noncommutative
integration method of linear partial differential equations on Lie groups. This
method differs from the well-known method of separation of variables and to
some extent can often supplement it. The general structure of the method
developed is illustrated with an example of a homogeneous space which does not
admit separation of variables in the Dirac equation. However, the basis of
exact solutions to the Dirac equation is constructed explicitly by the
noncommutative integration method. Also, we construct a complete set of new
exact solutions to the Dirac equation in the three-dimensional de Sitter
space-time $\mathrm{AdS_{3}}$ using the method developed. The solutions
obtained are found in terms of elementary functions, which is characteristic of
the noncommutative integration method.

random walk on a graph depends on the offspring distribution. Here, we say that
a space-time set $A$ is recurrent if it is visited infinitely often almost
surely on the event that the branching random walk survives forever, and say
that $A$ is transient if it is visited at most finitely often almost surely. We
prove that if $\mu$ and $\nu$ are supercritical offspring distributions with
means $\bar \mu < \bar \nu$ then every space-time set that is recurrent with
respect to the offspring distribution $\mu$ is also recurrent with respect to
the offspring distribution $\nu$ and similarly that every space-time set that
is transient with respect to the offspring distribution $\nu$ is also transient
with respect to the offspring distribution $\mu$. To prove this, we introduce a
new order on probability measures that we call the germ order and prove more
generally that the same result holds whenever $\mu$ is smaller than $\nu$ in
the germ order. Our work is inspired by the work of Johnson and Junge (AIHP

computations with provable guarantees of privacy and accuracy. In contrast to
the privacy component of differential privacy, which has a clear mathematical
and intuitive meaning, the accuracy component of differential privacy does not
have a generally accepted definition; accuracy claims of differential privacy
algorithms vary from algorithm to algorithm and are not instantiations of a
general definition. We identify program discontinuity as a common theme in
existing \emph{ad hoc} definitions and introduce an alternative notion of
accuracy parametrized by, what we call, {\distance} -- the {\distance} of an
input $x$ w.r.t., a deterministic computation $f$ and a distance $d$, is the
minimal distance $d(x,y)$ over all $y$ such that $f(y)\neq f(x)$. We show that
our notion of accuracy subsumes the definition used in theoretical computer
science, and captures known accuracy claims for differential privacy
algorithms. In fact, our general notion of accuracy helps us prove better
claims in some cases. Next, we study the decidability of accuracy. We first
show that accuracy is in general undecidable. Then, we define a non-trivial
class of probabilistic computations for which accuracy is decidable
(unconditionally, or assuming Schanuel's conjecture). We implement our decision
procedure and experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for
generating proofs or counterexamples of accuracy for common algorithms from the
literature.

determines the exposed crystal facets, profoundly affects its reactivity. The
vibrational frequency of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO) can be used as a
sensitive probe to identify the exposed surface facets, provided reference data
on well-defined single crystal surfaces together with a definitive theoretical
assignment exist. We investigate the adsorption of CO on the CeO2(110 and (111)
surfaces and show that the commonly applied DFT(PBE)+U method does not provide
reliable CO vibrational frequencies by comparing with state-of-the-art infrared
spectroscopy experiments for monocrystalline CeO2 surfaces. Good agreement
requires the hybrid DFT approach with the HSE06 functional. The failure of
conventional DFT is explained in terms of its inability to accurately describe
the facet- and configuration-specific donation and backdonation effects that
control the changes in the C-O bond length upon CO adsorption and the CO force
constant. Our findings thus provide a theoretical basis for the detailed
interpretation of experiments and open up the path to characterize more complex
scenarios, including oxygen vacancies and metal adatoms.

is small (0.11-0.14 dex), although the best-fit values for the Chandra sample
have large error bars. Therefore, we argue that at least one of these cluster

best-fit parameters are discrepant with each other as well as the previous

  Criminal Sentencing Algorithms","26 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables",,,,"stat.AP cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Currently, there is uncertainty surrounding the merits of open-source versus
proprietary algorithm development. Though justification in favor of each
exists, we argue that open-source algorithm development should be the standard
in highly consequential contexts that affect people's lives for reasons of
transparency and collaboration, which contribute to greater predictive accuracy
and enjoy the additional advantage of cost-effectiveness. To make this case, we
focus on criminal sentencing algorithms, as criminal sentencing is highly
consequential, and impacts society and individual people. Further, the
popularity of this topic has surged in the wake of recent studies uncovering
racial bias in proprietary sentencing algorithms among other issues of
over-fitting and model complexity. We suggest these issues are exacerbated by
the proprietary and expensive nature of virtually all widely used criminal
sentencing algorithms. Upon replicating a major algorithm using real criminal
profiles, we fit three penalized regressions and demonstrate an increase in
predictive power of these open-source and relatively computationally
inexpensive options. The result is a data-driven suggestion that if judges who
are making sentencing decisions want to craft appropriate sentences based on a
high degree of accuracy and at low costs, then they should be pursuing
open-source options.

to its geometrical richness. Rolling shutter LiDARs are particularly common, in
which an array of lasers scans the scene from a rotating base. Points are
emitted as a stream of packets, each covering a sector of the 360{\deg}
coverage. Modern perception algorithms wait for the full sweep to be built
before processing the data, which introduces an additional latency. For typical
10Hz LiDARs this will be 100ms. As a consequence, by the time an output is
produced, it no longer accurately reflects the state of the world. This poses a
challenge, as robotics applications require minimal reaction times, such that
maneuvers can be quickly planned in the event of a safety-critical situation.
In this paper we propose StrObe, a novel approach that minimizes latency by
ingesting LiDAR packets and emitting a stream of detections without waiting for
the full sweep to be built. StrObe reuses computations from previous packets
and iteratively updates a latent spatial representation of the scene, which
acts as a memory, as new evidence comes in, resulting in accurate low-latency
perception. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale
real-world dataset, showing that StrObe far outperforms the state-of-the-art
when latency is taken into account, and matches the performance in the
traditional setting.

logarithmic temperature. We analyse time-series of sixteen solar active regions
and a statistically significant sample of 9454 point-in-time observations
corresponding to hundreds of regions observed during solar cycle 24. The
time-series analysis shows that the temporal derivatives of the Emission
Measure dEM/dt and the maximum DEM temperature dTmax/dt frequently exhibit high
positive values a few hours before M- and X-class flares, indicating that
flaring regions become brighter and hotter as the flare onset approaches. From
the point-in-time observations we compute the conditional probabilities of
flare occurrences using the distributions of positive values of the dEM/dt, and
dTmax/dt and compare them with corresponding flaring probabilities of the total
unsigned magnetic flux, a conventionally used, standard flare predictor. For
C-class flares, conditional probabilities have lower or similar values with the
ones derived for the unsigned magnetic flux, for 24 and 12 hours forecast
windows. For M- and X-class flares, these probabilities are higher than those
of the unsigned flux for higher parameter values. Shorter forecast windows
improve the conditional probabilities of dEM/dt, and dTmax/dt in comparison to
those of the unsigned magnetic flux. We conclude that flare forerunner events
such as preflare heating or small flare activity prior to major flares reflect
on the temporal evolution of EM and Tmax. Of these two, the temporal derivative
of the EM could conceivably be used as a credible precursor, or short-term
predictor, of an imminent flare.

spectral energy distribution of blazars. Although the one-zone leptonic models
are generally successful in explaining the multi-wave band emission, they are
problematic in reproducing the radio spectrum. In the study of Mrk 421,
one-zone models suggest that in order to avoid overproducing the radio flux,
the minimum electron Lorentz factor should be larger than a few hundred at
least, even considering the synchrotron self-absorption effect. This result
suggests that the model predicted spectral index in the radio band of Mrk 421
should be -1/3. On the basis of this result, by assuming there is a neglected
region that will also contribute the radio emission and its electron energy
index is naturally originate from the simplest first-order Fermi acceleration
mechanism, we can get a superimposed flat radio spectrum. In this paper, a
two-zone model is proposed to reproduce the quiescent state spectral energy
distribution of Mrk 421. In addition to taking into account the emission from a
conventional radiation zone, we further consider the emission from the
acceleration zone in which particles are accelerated at a shock front. With the
present model, our fitting result suggests that the low frequency flat radio
spectrum of Mrk 421 might be explained as a superposition of the synchrotron
emission from acceleration zone and radiation zone.

Existence of stars with high mass brings the possibility of existence of exotic

work, we investigate the (anti)kaon ($K^-, \bar{K}^0$) condensation in
$\beta-$equilibrated nuclear matter within the framework of covariant density

experimental studies on $K^-$ atomic, kaon-nucleon scattering data fits. We
find that the equation of state softens with the inclusion of (anti)kaon
condensates, which lowers the maximum mass of neutron star. In one of the
density-independent coupling cases, the $K^-$ condensation is through a
first-order phase transition type, which produces a $2$ M$_\odot$ neutron star.
The first-order phase transition results in mixed phase region in the inner

robust against jamming attacks have been considered. However, no results for
continuous channels have yet been established. That is why we focus on the
continuous case: the Gaussian channel for its known practical relevance. We
deal with secure identification over Gaussian channels. Provable secure
communication is of a high interest for future communication systems. A key
technique for implementing secure communication is the physical layer security
based on information theoretic security. We model this with the wiretap
channel. In particular, we provide a suitable coding scheme for the Gaussian
wiretap channel (GWC) and determine the corresponding secure identification
capacity. We also consider Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Gaussian
channels and provide an efficient signal-processing scheme. This scheme allows
a separation of signal-processing and Gaussian coding.

  processes",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Repulsive mixture models have recently gained popularity for Bayesian cluster
detection. Compared to more traditional mixture models, repulsive mixture
models produce a smaller number of well separated clusters. The most commonly
used methods for posterior inference either require to fix a priori the number
of components or are based on reversible jump MCMC computation. We present a
general framework for mixture models, when the prior of the `cluster centres'
is a finite repulsive point process depending on a hyperparameter, specified by
a density which may depend on an intractable normalizing constant. By
investigating the posterior characterization of this class of mixture models,
we derive a MCMC algorithm which avoids the well-known difficulties associated
to reversible jump MCMC computation. In particular, we use an ancillary
variable method, which eliminates the problem of having intractable normalizing
constants in the Hastings ratio. The ancillary variable method relies on a
perfect simulation algorithm, and we demonstrate this is fast because the
number of components is typically small. In several simulation studies and an
application on sociological data, we illustrate the advantage of our new
methodology over existing methods, and we compare the use of a determinantal or
a repulsive Gibbs point process prior model.

women among occupations in both the source and the target language countries,
as well as (2) the results of a Hungarian survey that examined if certain jobs
are generally perceived as feminine or masculine. We also studied how expanding
sentences with adjectives referring to occupations effect the gender of the

biased results against women are much more frequent. Translations are closer to
our perception of occupations than to objective occupational statistics.
Finally, occupations have a greater effect on translation than adjectives.

towards fault-tolerant universal quantum computing. A central challenge in this
effort is the huge overhead in the resources required for the construction of
large photonic clusters using probabilistic linear-optics gates. Although
strong single-photon nonlinearity ideally enables deterministic construction of
such clusters, it is challenging to realise in a scalable way. Here we explore
the prospects of using moderate nonlinearity (with conditional phase shifts
smaller than $\pi$) to boost photonic quantum computing and significantly
reduce its resources overhead. The key element in our scheme is a nonlinear
router that preferentially directs photonic wavepackets to different output
ports depending on their intensity. As a relevant example, we analyze the
nonlinearity provided by Rydberg blockade in atomic ensembles, in which the
trade-off between the nonlinearity and the accompanying loss is well
understood. We present protocols for efficient Bell measurement and GHZ-state
preparation -- both key elements in the construction of cluster states, as well
as for the CNOT gate and quantum factorization. Given the large number of
entangling operations involved in fault-tolerant MBQC, the increase in success
probability provided by our protocols already at moderate nonlinearity can
result in a dramatic reduction in the required resources.

interventions against human papillomavirus (HPV). For this, we consider a
two-sex epidemic model for the transmission dynamics of HPV which includes
screening, vaccination of adolescent boys and girls, and vaccination of
sexually active adults. We first propose public health policies using constant
control parameters and develop a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to identify
which intervention delivers the best effectiveness for the money invested.
Secondly, we consider time-dependent control parameters and formulate an
optimal control problem to obtain time-dependent versions of the interventions.
As in the case of constant control parameters, we perform a CEA to investigate
the cost-effectiveness of the time-dependent control interventions. Our
findings suggest that females' vaccination, including adolescent girls and
adult women, is the most cost-effective strategy. We also compare constant
against the time-dependent healthcare interventions which are optimal in the
sense that they minimize the objective functional of the optimal control
problem. The results indicate that time-dependent controls are not always more
cost-effective than constant controls.

algorithms on actual quantum devices faces unique challenges. One such
challenge is that quantum devices in this era have restricted connectivity:
quantum gates are allowed to act only on specific pairs of physical qubits. For
this reason, a quantum circuit needs to go through a compiling process called
qubit routing before it can be executed on a quantum computer. In this study,
we propose a CNOT synthesis method called the token reduction method to solve
this problem. The token reduction method works for all quantum computers whose
architecture is represented by connected graphs. A major difference between our
method and the existing ones is that our method synthesizes a circuit to an
output qubit mapping that might be different from the input qubit mapping. The
final mapping for the synthesis is determined dynamically during the synthesis
process. Results showed that our algorithm consistently outperforms the best
publicly accessible algorithm for all of the tested quantum architectures.

by a long tail in the data (i.e., some labels/symptoms occur more frequently
than others for e.g ""fever"" vs ""hematochezia""). In this paper, we introduce an
active learning method that leverages underlying structure of a continually
refined, learned latent space to select the most informative examples to label.
This enables the selection of the most informative examples that progressively
increases the coverage on the universe of symptoms via the learned model,

function $\psi_H$ describes the action of the maximal torus $T$ on different

quotient of $G/P$ by a certain action of a finite abelian group. Besides, it is
presented a criterion when two WHS with possibly different weight systems are
isomorphic. The criteria give a simple method to understand the regular maps

also explain invariant K\""ahler differentials on WHS by using certain potential

Such entities, from human cognition to evolution, must first encode and then
replicate those networks under marked resource constraints. Networks that
survive are those that are amenable to constrained encoding, or, in other
words, are compressible. But how compressible is a network? And what features
make one network more compressible than another? Here we answer these questions
by modeling networks as information sources before compressing them using
rate-distortion theory. Each network yields a unique rate-distortion curve,
which specifies the minimal amount of information that remains at a given scale
of description. A natural definition then emerges for the compressibility of a
network: the amount of information that can be removed via compression,
averaged across all scales. Analyzing an array of real and model networks, we
demonstrate that compressibility increases with two common network properties:
transitivity (or clustering) and degree heterogeneity. These results indicate
that hierarchical organization -- which is characterized by modular structure
and heterogeneous degrees -- facilitates compression in complex networks.
Generally, our framework sheds light on the interplay between a network's
structure and its capacity to be compressed, enabling investigations into the
role of compression in shaping real-world networks.

  Hughes",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Prehistoric rock art is often analyzed predominantly as the product of
artists intentions to create public representations of their perceptual
experiences and mental imagery. However, this representation-centered approach
tends to overlook the performative role of much material engagement. Many forms
of rock art are better conceived of as traces from artists repeated engagement
with a surface, including with previous traces. For these artists, a
potentially more relevant intention was ritualized interaction, such as
communion and petition, which were realized as materially mediated transactions
with the agencies that were believed to animate specific areas of the
environment. If so, we can expect the motifs to be strongly clustered on
ritually attractive areas, rather than to be evenly distributed on canvas-like
surfaces that would maximize their visibility as public representations. Here
we propose a novel way of testing the interaction-centered approach in terms of
preferential attachment, which is a concept from network science that describe
the well-known social phenomenon that popular agents tend to attract more
followers. We applied this approach to a case study of an archaic site in
Chihuahua, Mexico, and found that its petroglyph distribution has the form of a
power law, which is consistent with preferential attachment. We conclude that
this approach could be developed into a measure of the entanglement between
ritual processes and products in prehistoric material engagement.

walking in the crosswalk. This study offers an in-depth investigation of
pedestrian exposure to PM pollution at an urban traffic intersection.
Fixed-site measurements near an urban intersection were conducted to examine
the variations in particles of various sizes through traffic signal cycles.
This process aids in the identification of major PM dispersion patterns on the
roadside. In addition, mobile measurements of pedestrian exposure to PM were
conducted across six time intervals that correspond to different segments of a
pedestrian's journey when passing through the intersection. Measurement results
are used to estimate and compare the cumulative deposited doses of PM by size
categories and journey segments for pedestrians at an intersection.
Furthermore, comparisons of pedestrian exposure to PM on a sunny day and a
cloudy day were analyzed. The results indicate the importance of reducing PM
pollution at intersections and provide policymakers with a foundation for
possible measures to reduce pedestrian PM exposure at urban traffic
intersections.

still suffers from the lack of a consolidated formal theory. In this paper, a
theory for the energy consumption of computing is structured as an axiomatic
system. The work is pure theoretical, involving theorem proving and
mathematical reasoning. It is also interdisciplinary, so that while it targets
computing, it involves theoretical physics (thermodynamics and statistical
mechanics) and information theory. The theory does not contradict existing
theories in theoretical physics and conforms to them as indeed it adopts its
axioms from them. Nevertheless, the theory leads to interesting and important
conclusions that have not been discussed in previous work. Some of them are:
(i) Landauer's principle is shown to be a provable theorem provided that a
precondition, named macroscopic determinism, holds. (ii) It is proved that real
randomness (not pseudo randomness) can be used in computing in conjunction with
or as an alternative to reversibility to achieve more energy saving. (iii) The
theory propounds the concept that computers that use real randomness may
apparently challenge the second law of thermodynamics. These are computational
counterpart to Maxwell's daemon in thermodynamics and hence are named daemon
computers. (iv) It is proved that if we do not accept the existence of daemon
computers (to conform to the second law of thermodynamics), another type of
computers, named clairvoyant computers, must exist that can gain information
about other physical systems through real randomness. This theorem probably
provides a theoretical explanation for strange observations about real
randomness made in the global consciousness project at Princeton University.

arts and in nature. This quest for mathematical beauty has led to the discovery
of recurrent mathematical structures, such as the golden ratio, Fibonacci, and
Lucas numbers, whose ubiquitous presences have been tantalizing the minds of
artists and scientists alike. The captivation for this quest comes with high
stakes. In fact, art is the definitive expression of human creativity, and its
mathematical understanding would deliver us the keys for decoding human culture
and its evolution (2). However, it was not until fairly recently that the scope
and the scale of the human quest for mathematical beauty was radically expanded
by the simultaneous confluence of three separate innovations. The mass
digitization of large art archives, the surge in computational power, and the
development of robust statistical methods to capture hidden patterns in vast
amounts of data have made it possible to reveal the---otherwise unnoticeable to
the human eye---mathematics concealed in large artistic corpora. Starting from
its inception, marked by the foundational work by Birkhoff (3), progress in the
broad field of computational aesthetics has reached a scale that would have
been unimaginable just a decade ago. The recent expansion is not limited to the
visual arts (2) but includes music (4), stories (5), language phonology (6),
humor in jokes (7), and even equations (8); for a comprehensive review, see
