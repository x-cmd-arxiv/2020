study their population dynamics and inform effective management. Acoustic
recording units are a promising technology for efficiently monitoring bird
populations and communities. We present an integrated modeling framework that
combines high-quality but temporally sparse bird point count survey data with
acoustic recordings. Using simulations, we compare the accuracy and precision
of abundance estimates using differing amounts of acoustic vocalizations
obtained from a clustering algorithm, point count data, and a subset of
manually validated acoustic vocalizations. We also use our modeling framework
in a case study to estimate abundance of the Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus
virens) in Vermont, U.S.A. The simulation study reveals that combining acoustic
and point count data via an integrated model improves accuracy and precision of
abundance estimates compared with models informed by either acoustic or point
count data alone. Combining acoustic data with only a small number of point
count surveys yields estimates of abundance without the need for validating any
of the identified vocalizations from the acoustic data. Within our case study,
the integrated models provided moderate support for a decline of the Eastern
Wood-Pewee in this region. Our integrated modeling approach combines dense
acoustic data with few point count surveys to deliver reliable estimates of
species abundance without the need for manual identification of acoustic
vocalizations or a prohibitively expensive large number of repeated point count
surveys. Our proposed approach offers an efficient monitoring alternative for
large spatio-temporal regions when point count data are difficult to obtain or
when monitoring is focused on rare species with low detection probability.

  Graph Neural Networks","17 pages",,,,"cs.HC cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to extend deep learning techniques to graph
data and have achieved significant progress in graph analysis tasks (e.g., node
classification) in recent years. However, similar to other deep neural networks
like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
GNNs behave like a black box with their details hidden from model developers
and users. It is therefore difficult to diagnose possible errors of GNNs.
Despite many visual analytics studies being done on CNNs and RNNs, little
research has addressed the challenges for GNNs. This paper fills the research
gap with an interactive visual analysis tool, GNNLens, to assist model
developers and users in understanding and analyzing GNNs. Specifically,
Parallel Sets View and Projection View enable users to quickly identify and
validate error patterns in the set of wrong predictions; Graph View and Feature
Matrix View offer a detailed analysis of individual nodes to assist users in
forming hypotheses about the error patterns. Since GNNs jointly model the graph
structure and the node features, we reveal the relative influences of the two
types of information by comparing the predictions of three models: GNN,
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GNN Without Using Features (GNNWUF). Two case
studies and interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of
GNNLens in facilitating the understanding of GNN models and their errors.

this behavior? In this study, we investigate if DNNs can learn implicit
associations in stimuli, particularly, an emotion-color association between
image stimuli. Our study was conducted in two parts. First, we collected human
responses on a forced-choice decision task in which subjects were asked to
select a color for a specified emotion-inducing image. Next, we modeled this
decision task on neural networks using the similarity between deep
representation (extracted using DNNs trained on object classification tasks) of
the images and images of colors used in the task. We found that our model
showed a fuzzy linear relationship between the two decision probabilities. This
results in two interesting findings, 1. The representations learned by deep
neural networks can indeed show an emotion-color association 2. The
emotion-color association is not just random but involves some cognitive
phenomena. Finally, we also show that this method can help us in the emotion
classification task, specifically when there are very few examples to train the

associations and artificial intelligence researchers modeling emotional

during which the system evolves. After each of these time steps, the system
interacts with ancilla qubits representing the bath in thermal equilibrium. We
have specifically studied spin baths leading to both, unital and non-unital

$^{113}$Cd fourfold forbidden non-unique $\beta$-decay transition in order to
address the quenching of the weak axial-vector coupling $g_{\rm A}$ in
low-momentum exchange nuclear processes. The experimental data were collected
in a dedicated low-threshold run with the COBRA demonstrator at the LNGS and
resulted in 44 individual $^{113}$Cd spectra. These data are evaluated in the
context of three nuclear model frameworks based on a revised version of the
spectrum-shape method and the conserved vector current hypothesis. The novel
idea devised in the present work is to fit the value of the small relativistic
nuclear matrix element (s-NME) driving the nuclear model calculations, which
remained essentially as a free parameter in previous studies. This is done by
tuning the nuclear structure calculations and making use of the interplay of
$g_{\rm A}$ and the s-NME such that the experimentally known $^{113}$Cd
half-life gets reproducible by the different frameworks. In this way, a best
fit s-NME value can be derived for each of the considered nuclear models, which
finally enters the template calculations used to perform the spectrum-shape
analysis for each of the obtained $^{113}$Cd spectra. The primary analysis
strategy results in significantly quenched values of the axial-vector coupling
for all three nuclear models: $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{ISM}) = 0.907 \pm
0.064$, $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{MQPM}) = 0.993 \pm 0.063$ and
$\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{IBFM-2}) = 0.828 \pm 0.140$. Moreover, with our
data-driven approach one of the main shortcomings of the spectrum-shape method
has been resolved. This achievement is a milestone in the description of
strongly forbidden $\beta$-decays and adds to the indications for the existence
of a quenching of $g_{\rm A}$ in low-momentum exchange nuclear processes.

Compared with the existing PDWG methods proposed in \cite{wwnondiv}, the system
of equations resulting from the M-PDWG scheme could be equivalently simplified
into one equation involving only the primal variable by eliminating the dual
variable (Lagrange multiplier). The resulting simplified system thus has
significantly fewer degrees of freedom than the one resulting from existing

be greatly reduced when a newly introduced bilinear term in the M-PDWG scheme
is appropriately chosen. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the
numerical approximations in the discrete $H^2$-norm, $H^1$-norm and $L^2$-norm

arise in models that rely on additive linear combinations. In particular, they
are at the core of most nonnegative matrix factorization algorithms and have
many applications. The nonnegativity constraint is known to naturally favor
sparsity, that is, solutions with few non-zero entries. However, it is often
useful to further enhance this sparsity, as it improves the interpretability of
the results and helps reducing noise, which leads to the sparse MNNLS problem.
In this paper, as opposed to most previous works that enforce sparsity column-
or row-wise, we first introduce a novel formulation for sparse MNNLS, with a
matrix-wise sparsity constraint. Then, we present a two-step algorithm to
tackle this problem. The first step divides sparse MNNLS in subproblems, one
per column of the original problem. It then uses different algorithms to
produce, either exactly or approximately, a Pareto front for each subproblem,
that is, to produce a set of solutions representing different tradeoffs between
reconstruction error and sparsity. The second step selects solutions among
these Pareto fronts in order to build a sparsity-constrained matrix that
minimizes the reconstruction error. We perform experiments on facial and
hyperspectral images, and we show that our proposed two-step approach provides
more accurate results than state-of-the-art sparse coding heuristics applied

potentials for nucleon-nucleus scattering and its incidence on their nonlocal
structure in coordinate space. The study covers closed-shell nuclei with mass
number in the range $4\leq A\leq 208$, for nucleon energies from tens of MeV up
to 1 GeV. To this purpose microscopic optical potentials are calculated using
density-dependent off-shell $g$ matrices in Brueckner-Hartree-Fock
approximation and based on Argonne $v_{18}$ as well as chiral 2$N$ force up to
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. We confirm that the gradual suppression
of high-momentum contributions of the optical potential results in quite
different coordinate-space counterparts, all of them accounting for the same
scattering observables. We infer a minimum cutoff momentum $Q$, function of the
target mass number and energy of the process, that filters out irrelevant
ultraviolet components of the potential. We find that when ultraviolet
suppression is applied to Perey-Buck nonlocal potential or local Woods-Saxon
potentials, they also result nonlocal with similar appearance to those obtained
from microscopic models in momentum space. We examine the transversal
nonlocality, quantity that makes comparable the intrinsic nonlocality of any
potential regardless of its representation. We conclude that meaningful
comparisons of nonlocal features of alternative potentials require the
suppression of their ultraviolet components.

frequently straight-forward, the determination of the presence or absence of
basal cell carcinoma on the tissue sections can sometimes be challenging. We
explore if a deep learning model trained on mobile phone-acquired frozen
section images can have adequate performance for future deployment. Materials
and Methods: One thousand two hundred and forty-one (1241) images of frozen
sections performed for basal cell carcinoma margin status were acquired using
mobile phones. The photos were taken at 100x magnification (10x objective). The
images were downscaled from a 4032 x 3024 pixel resolution to 576 x 432 pixel
resolution. Semantic segmentation algorithm Deeplab V3 with Xception backbone
was used for model training. Results: The model uses an image as input and
produces a 2-dimensional black and white output of prediction of the same
dimension; the areas determined to be basal cell carcinoma were displayed with
white color, in a black background. Any output with the number of white pixels
exceeding 0.5% of the total number of pixels is deemed positive for basal cell
carcinoma. On the test set, the model achieves area under curve of 0.99 for
receiver operator curve and 0.97 for precision-recall curve at the pixel level.
The accuracy of classification at the slide level is 96%. Conclusions: The deep

characteristics, and thus demonstrates the potential for deploying as a mobile

solving decision problems often related to customer matching, pricing and
vehicle routing. These problems have been frequently represented using
aggregated mathematical models and solved via algorithmic approaches designed
by researchers. The increasing complexity of ride-sourcing environments
compromises the accuracy of aggregated methods. It, therefore, signals the need
for alternative practices such as agent-based models which capture the level of
complex dynamics in ride-sourcing systems. The use of these agent-based models
to simulate ride-sourcing fleets has been a focal point of many studies;
however, this occurred in the absence of a prescribed approach on how to build
the models to mimic fleet operations realistically. To bridge this research
gap, we provide a framework for building bespoke agent-based models for
ride-sourcing fleets, derived from the fundamentals of agent-based modelling
theory. We also introduce a model building sequence of the different modules
necessary to structure a simulator based on our framework. To showcase the
strength of our framework, we use it to tackle the highly non-linear problem of
minimum fleet size estimation for autonomous ride-sourcing fleets. We do so by
investigating the relationship of system parameters based on queuing theory
principles and by deriving and validating a novel model for pickup wait times.
By modelling the ride-sourcing fleet function in the urban areas of Manhattan,
San Francisco, Paris and Barcelona, we find that ride-sourcing fleets operate
queues with zero assignment times above the critical fleet size. We also show
that pickup wait times have a pivotal role in the estimation of the minimum
fleet size in ride-sourcing operations, with agent-based modelling to be a more
reliable route for their identification given the system parameters.

distortions of the luminosity distances of SNe Ia, explaining the acceleration

supervised data in a domain is time-consuming and expensive, and our ability to
leverage annotations across domains is minimal. In this work, we leverage
neural representations and study nearest neighbors for cross-domain
generalization in DQD. We first encode question pairs of the source and target
domain in a rich representation space and then using a k-nearest neighbour
retrieval-based method, we aggregate the neighbors' labels and distances to
rank pairs. We observe robust performance of this method in different
cross-domain scenarios of StackExchange, Spring and Quora datasets,
outperforming cross-entropy classification in multiple cases.

problems, when the running target is a steady control-state pair of the
underlying system. Our strategy combines the construction of quasi-turnpike
controls via controllability, and a bootstrap argument, and does not rely on
analyzing the optimality system or linearization techniques. This in turn
allows us to address several optimal control problems for finite-dimensional,
control-affine systems with globally Lipschitz (possibly nonsmooth)
nonlinearities, without any smallness conditions on the initial data or the
running target. These results are motivated by applications in machine learning
through deep residual neural networks, which may be fit within our setting. We
show that our methodology is applicable to controlled PDEs as well, such as the
semilinear wave and heat equation with a globally Lipschitz nonlinearity, once
again without any smallness assumptions.

quasiprimary states and its global descendants. Different from the usual
conformal field theory, the quasi-primary states in a GCFT constitute
multiplets, which are block-diagonized under the Galilean boost operator. More
importantly the multiplets include the states of negative norms, indicating the
theory is not unitary. We compute global blocks of the multiplets, and discuss
the expansion of four-point functions in terms of the global blocks of the
multiplets. Furthermore we do the harmonic analysis for the Galilean conformal
symmetry and obtain an inversion formula. As the first step to apply the
Galilean conformal bootstrap, we construct generalized Galilean free theory
(GGFT) explicitly. We read the data of GGFT by using Taylor series expansion of
four-point function and the inversion formula independently, and find exact
agreement. We discuss some novel features in the Galilean conformal bootstrap,
due to the non-semisimpleness of the Galilean conformal algebra and the
non-unitarity of the GCFTs.

first dynamically available PoW protocol which has almost deterministic

previous hybrid approaches which use a single longest chain to sample

agricultural industry has enabled the development and creation of smart farms
and precision agriculture. The growth in the number of smart farms and
potential cooperation between these farms has given rise to the Cooperative
Smart Farming (CSF) where different connected farms collaborate with each other
and share data for their mutual benefit. This data sharing through CSF has
various advantages where individual data from separate farms can be aggregated
by ML models and be used to produce actionable outputs which then can be
utilized by all the farms in CSFs. This enables farms to gain better insights
for enhancing desired outputs, such as crop yield, managing water resources and
irrigation schedules, as well as better seed applications. However,
complications may arise in CSF when some of the farms do not transfer
high-quality data and rather rely on other farms to feed ML models. Another
possibility is the presence of rogue farms in CSFs that want to snoop on other
farms without actually contributing any data. In this paper, we analyze the
behavior of farms participating in CSFs using game theory approach, where each
farm is motivated to maximize its profit. We first present the problem of
defective farms in CSFs due to lack of better data, and then propose a ML
framework that segregates farms and automatically assign them to an appropriate
CSF cluster based on the quality of data they provide. Our proposed model
rewards the farms supplying better data and penalize the ones that do not

uncovering fundamental mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and for translating
results of model systems between species. One of the most famous interspecific
considerations of cancer is Peto's paradox, which asserts that organisms with
vastly different body mass are expected to have a vastly different degree of
cancer risk, a pattern that is not observed empirically. Here we show that this
observation is not a paradox at all but follows naturally from the
interspecific scaling of metabolic rates across mammalian body size. We connect
metabolic allometry to evolutionary models of cancer development in tissues to
show that waiting time to cancer scales with body mass in a similar way as
normal organism lifespan does. Thus, the expectation across mammals is that
lifetime cancer risk is invariant with body mass. Peto's observation is
therefore not a paradox, but the natural expectation from interspecific scaling
of metabolism and physiology. These allometric patterns have theoretical
implications for understanding life span evolution, and practical implications
for using smaller animals as model systems for human cancer.

codes and those having size as small as possible are of particular interest. We
observe that from a cutting blocking set obtained by Fancsali and Sziklai, by

whose length grows linearly with respect to its dimension. We also provide two
distinct constructions: a cutting blocking set of PG$(3, q^3)$ of size
$3(q+1)(q^2+1)$ as a union of three pairwise disjoint $q$-order subgeometries
and a cutting blocking set of PG$(5, q)$ of size $7(q+1)$ from seven lines of a
Desarguesian line spread of PG$(5, q)$. In both cases the cutting blocking sets
obtained are smaller than the known ones. As a byproduct we further improve on
the upper bound of the smallest size of certain saturating sets and on the
minimum length of a minimal $q$-ary linear code having dimension $4$ and $6$.

front passes through the TATB, X-ray diffraction indicates a portion of the
TATB exhibits a compression up to 30+ GPa, followed subsequently by a pressure
release and continued decomposition over a few hundred nanoseconds. Likewise,
for colliding detonation-driven shock compression of single crystals of TATB, a
significant portion of the triclinic crystal structure appears to be stable up
to 60+ GPa. Conversely, in similar detonations of a LLM-105 PBX, X-ray
diffraction is simply indicative of decomposition without the apparent

anomaly detection/localization in images. The challenges to learn such a
representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough
to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques.
Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned
features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we
propose to use the ""distillation"" of features at various layers of an expert
network, pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both
issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the
expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given the input
data. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation
leads to better exploiting the expert's knowledge and more distinctive
discrepancy compared to solely utilizing the last layer activation values.
Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need
expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or
intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our
novel framework for the localization of anomalous regions. Despite the striking
contrast between some test datasets and ImageNet, we achieve competitive or

promising candidate for quantum optic experiments that require single photon

photo-stability, even at room temperature. Engineering the emission properties
of NV centers with optical resonators is a widely followed approach to meet the
requirements for quantum technological applications, but the effect on
non-radiative decay paths is yet to be understood. Here we report on modifying
the internal quantum efficiency of a single NV center in a nanodiamond coupled
to a 1D photonic crystal cavity. We assess the Purcell enhancement via three
independent measurement techniques and perform autocorrelation measurements at
elevated excitation powers in confocal microscopy. Employing a three-level
model allows us to extract the setup efficiency, individual transition rates
and thus the internal quantum efficiency of our system. Combining our results,
we find that the enhancement of the radiative decay rate via the Purcell effect
results in an internal quantum efficiency of 90 % for cavity-coupled NV
centers. Our findings will facilitate the realization of nano-scale single
photon sources with near-unity internal quantum efficiencies operating at high
repetition rates.

balanced copy of $G$ if we can find a copy of $G$ such that half of its edges
is in each color class. If there exists an integer $k$ such that, for $n$
sufficiently large, every 2-coloring of $K_n$ with more than $k$ edges in each
color contains a balanced copy of $G$, then we say that $G$ is balanceable. The
smallest integer $k$ such that this holds is called the balancing number of
$G$.
  In this paper, we define a more general variant of the balancing number, the
list balancing number, by considering 2-list edge colorings of $K_n$, where
every edge $e$ has an associated list $L(e)$ which is a nonempty subset of the
color set $\{r,b\}$. In this case, edges $e$ with $L(e) = \{r,b\}$ act as
jokers in the sense that their color can be chosen $r$ or $b$ as needed. In
contrast to the balancing number, every graph has a list balancing number.
Moreover, if the balancing number exists, then it coincides with the list
balancing number.
  We give the exact value of the list balancing number for all cycles except
for $4k$-cycles for which we give tight bounds. In addition, we give general
bounds for the list balancing number of non-balanceable graphs based on the
extremal number of its subgraphs, and study the list balancing number of $K_5$,
which turns out to be surprisingly large.

wave-equation-based methods for processing and imaging of seismic data. As
several of these methods require the solution of an inverse problem, multiple
forward and adjoint passes of the modelling operator must be performed to
converge to a satisfactory solution. This work highlights the challenges that
arise when implementing such operators on 3D seismic datasets and it provides
insights into their usage for solving large systems of integral equations. A
Python framework is presented that leverages libraries for distributed storage
and computing, and provides an high-level symbolic representation of linear
operators. To validate its effectiveness, the forward and adjoint
implementations of a multi-dimensional convolution operator are evaluated with
respect to increasing size of the kernel and number of computational resources.
Our computational framework is further shown to be suitable for both classic
on-premise High-Performance Computing and cloud computing architectures. An
example of target-oriented imaging of a 3D synthetic dataset which comprises of
two subsequent steps of seismic redatuming is finally presented. In both cases,
the redatumed fields are estimated by means of least-squares inversion using
the full dataset as well as spatially decimated versions of the dataset as a
way to investigate the robustness of both inverse problems to spatial aliasing
in the input dataset. We observe that less strict sampling requirements apply
in three dimensions for these algorithms compared to their two dimensions
counterparts. Whilst aliasing introduces noise in the redatumed fields, they
are however deprived of the well-known spurious artefacts arising from
incorrect handling of the overburden propagation in cheaper, adjoint-based
redatuming techniques.

applications, and we have seen better learning performance by existing
multi-view learning methods than by conventional single-view learning methods

methods are built on the assumption that at each instance no view is missing
and all data points from all views must be perfectly paired. Hence they cannot
handle unpaired data but ignore them completely from their learning process.
However, unpaired data can be more abundant in reality than paired ones and
simply ignoring all unpaired data incur tremendous waste in resources. In this
paper, we focus on learning uncorrelated features by semi-paired subspace
learning, motivated by many existing works that show great successes of
learning uncorrelated features. Specifically, we propose a generalized
uncorrelated multi-view subspace learning framework, which can naturally
integrate many proven learning criteria on the semi-paired data. To showcase
the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate five new semi-paired models
for both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We also design a successive
alternating approximation (SAA) method to solve the resulting optimization
problem and the method can be combined with the powerful Krylov subspace
projection technique if needed. Extensive experimental results on multi-view

military operations, etc. Area coverage is a broad family of applications where
a group of connected drones collaboratively visit the whole or parts of an area
to fulfill a specific objective and is widely being researched. Accordingly,
different mobility models have been designed to define the rules of movements
of the participating drones. However, most of them do not consider the network
connectivity which is crucial, plus many models lack the priorities and
optimization strategies that are important for drone networks. Therefore within
this study, three known connectivity-aware mobility models have been analyzed
comparatively. Two non-connectivity-aware mobility models have further been
implemented to catch the placebo effect if any. Per the detailed experiments on

which the pros and cons of deep learning are presented and future directions

  approach: DynaMITE",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a novel statistical measure for MCMC-mean estimation, the
inter-trace variance ${\rm trv}^{(\tau_{rel})}({\cal M},f)$, which depends on a
Markov chain ${\cal M}$ and a function $f:S\to [a,b]$. The inter-trace variance
can be efficiently estimated from observed data and leads to a more efficient
MCMC-mean estimator. Prior MCMC mean-estimators receive, as input, upper-bounds
on $\tau_{mix}$ or $\tau_{rel}$, and often also the stationary variance, and
their performance is highly dependent to the sharpness of these bounds. In
contrast, we introduce DynaMITE, which dynamically adjusts the sample size, it
is less sensitive to the looseness of input upper-bounds on $\tau_{rel}$, and
requires no bound on $v_{\pi}$.
  Receiving only an upper-bound ${\cal T}_{rel}$ on $\tau_{rel}$, DynaMITE
estimates the mean of $f$ in $\tilde{\cal{O}}\bigl(\smash{\frac{{\cal T}_{rel}
R}{\varepsilon}}+\frac{\tau_{rel}\cdot {\rm
trv}^{(\tau{{rel}})}}{\varepsilon^{2}}\bigr)$ steps, without a priori bounds on
the stationary variance $v_{\pi}$ or the inter-trace variance ${\rm trv}^{(\tau
rel)}$. Thus we depend minimally on the tightness of ${\cal T}_{mix}$, as the
complexity is dominated by $\tau_{rel}\rm{trv}^{(\tau{rel})}$ as $\varepsilon
\to 0$. Note that bounding $\tau_{\rm rel}$ is known to be prohibitively
difficult, however, DynaMITE is able to reduce its principal dependence on
${\cal T}_{rel}$ to $\tau_{rel}$, simply by exploiting properties of the
inter-trace variance. To compare our method to known variance-aware bounds, we
show ${\rm trv}^{(\tau{rel})}({\cal M},f) \leq v_{\pi}$. Furthermore, we show
when $f$'s image is distributed (semi)symmetrically on ${\cal M}$'s traces, we
have ${\rm trv}^{({\tau{rel}})}({\cal M},f)=o(v_{\pi}(f))$, thus DynaMITE
outperforms prior methods in these cases.

problem in few-mode optical waveguides. The most uncomplicated modification of

between core modes of any few-mode waveguide e.g. few-mode fiber, possibly due
to lacking knowledge of critical parameter control: (a) phase shift value at

our design of a single-phase-shifted grating increases the bandwidth at 99 %

silicon solar cells contain grain boundaries (GBs) which are preferential
segregation sites for atomic impurities such as oxygen atoms. GBs can induce
charge carriers recombination significantly reducing carrier lifetimes and
therefore they can be detrimental for Si device performance. We studied the
correlation between structural, energetic and electronic properties of
{\Sigma}3{111} Si GB in the presence of vacancies, strain and multiple O
segregation. The study of the structural and energetic properties of GBs in the
presence of strain and vacancies gives an accurate description of the complex
mechanisms that control the segregation of oxygen atoms. We analysed tensile
and compressive strain and we obtained that local tensile strain around O
impurities is very effective for segregation. We also studied the role of
multiple O impurities in the presence of Si vacancies finding that the
segregation is favorite for those structures which have restored tetrahedral
covalent bonds. The presence of vacancies attract atomic impurities in order to
restore the electronic stability: the interstitial impurity becomes
substitutional. This analysis was the starting point to correlate the change of
the electronic properties in {\Sigma}3{111}Si GBs with O impurities in the
presence of strain and vacancies. For each structure we analysed the density of
states and its projection on atoms and states, the band gaps, the segregation
energy and their correlation in order to characterise the nature of new energy
levels. Actually, knowing the origin of defined electronic states would allow
the optimization of materials in order to reduce non-radiative electron-hole

scheduling that attends to each device becomes necessary, given stringent
quality of service (QoS) requirements and diversified service types, but
prohibitively complex for a large number of devices. To address this challenge,
we propose a scheduling solution in two steps. First, we develop algorithms for
device assignment based on the analytical results from Part I, when parameters
of the proposed protocol are given. Then, we train a deep neural network for
assisting in the determination of the protocol parameters. The two-step
approach ensures the accuracy and granularity necessary for satisfying the QoS
requirements and avoids excessive complexity from handling a large number of
devices. Integrating the distributed coordination in the protocol design from
Part I and the centralized scheduling from this part, the proposed MAC protocol
achieves high performance, demonstrated through extensive simulations. For
example, the results show that the proposed MAC can support 1000 devices under
an aggregated traffic load of 3000 packets per second with a single channel and
achieve <0.5ms average delay and <1% average collision probability among 50
high priority devices.

(quasi-linear) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model introduced to describe
a nonlinear propagation of sound in an acoustic medium. The important feature
is that the model avoids the infinite speed of propagation paradox associated
with a classical second order in time equation referred to as Westervelt
equation. Replacing Fourier's law by Maxwell-Cattaneo's law gives rise to the
third order in time derivative scaled by a small parameter $\tau >0$, the
latter represents the thermal relaxation time parameter and is intrinsic to the
medium where the dynamics occur. In this paper we provide an asymptotic
analysis of the third order model when $\tau \rightarrow 0 $. It is shown that
the corresponding solutions converge {\it in a strong topology of the phase
space } to a limit which is the solution of Westervelt equation. In addition,
rate of convergence is provided for solutions displaying higher order
regularity. This addresses an open question raised in \cite{kaltev2}, where a
related JMGT equation has been studied and {\it weak star } convergence of the
solutions when $\tau \rightarrow 0$ has been established. Thus, our main
contribution is showing {\it strong convergence on infinite time horizon,}
along with related rates of convergence valid on a finite time horizon. The key
to unlocking the difficulty owns to a tight control and propagation of the
""smallness"" of the initial data in carrying the estimates at three different
topological levels. The rate of convergence allows one then to estimate the
relaxation time needed for the signal to reach the target. The interest in
studying this type of problems is motivated by a large array of applications

relation. Additionally, we show that under certain circumstances,
unidirectional propagation of spin waves can be achieved which is essential for
the design of magnonic circuits. Our results become more relevant in light of
recent experimental works in which a suitable thermal landscape is used to
dynamically modulate the saturation magnetization.

formulated as a continuous optimization problem by leveraging an algebraic
characterization of acyclicity. The constrained problem is solved using the
augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) which is often preferred to the quadratic
penalty method (QPM) by virtue of its standard convergence result that does not
require the penalty coefficient to go to infinity, hence avoiding
ill-conditioning. However, the convergence properties of these methods for
structure learning, including whether they are guaranteed to return a DAG
solution, remain unclear, which might limit their practical applications. In
this work, we examine the convergence of ALM and QPM for structure learning in
the linear, nonlinear, and confounded cases. We show that the standard
convergence result of ALM does not hold in these settings, and demonstrate
empirically that its behavior is akin to that of the QPM which is prone to
ill-conditioning. We further establish the convergence guarantee of QPM to a
DAG solution, under mild conditions. Lastly, we connect our theoretical results
with existing approaches to help resolve the convergence issue, and verify our
findings in light of an empirical comparison of them.

to be zero given long enough training time. Moreover, existing work typically
failed to recognize the importance of scheduling weight decay during training.
Our work aims at theoretically understanding novel behaviors of weight decay
and designing schedulers for weight decay in deep learning. This paper mainly
has three contributions. First, we propose a novel theoretical interpretation
of weight decay from the perspective of learning dynamics. Second, we propose a
novel weight-decay linear scaling rule for large-batch training that
proportionally increases weight decay rather than the learning rate as the
batch size increases. Third, we provide an effective learning-rate-aware
scheduler for weight decay, called the Stable Weight Decay (SWD) method, which,
to the best of our knowledge, is the first practical design for weight decay
scheduling. In our various experiments, the SWD method often makes improvements

Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment

factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with

ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an effect for ventilation
rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including
temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the effect of the

Imbalance-Robust Softmax (IR-Softmax), which can simultaneously solve the

generalise to any softmax and its variants (which are discriminative for

from the quantum effect of molecular orbital theory: the optimal local chemical
composition results in the formation of TTB without dangling bonds (DB) in GST
but with DB in GT, where DB destabilizes boundary due to its distorted local
environment mismatching Oh symmetry of p orbitals. Moreover, the inner vacancy
concentration in GST is alterable and controlled by TTB, manifested by the
absence of cubic-to-hexagonal transition in carbon-doped GST of small grains
and minimized inner vacancy. Finally, the charge transport property (CTP) is
controlled by boundary via changing the density of charge or hole nearby as
well as vacancy. These findings open the door to tune CTP by CM, which is
necessary for achieving low-power and ultrafast devices.

processing framework, which performs learning tasks on data sets distributed
over multi-node networks. That kind of network can be represented by a graph.
Recently, some decentralized methods have been proposed to compute linear
transformations by leveraging the notion of graph shift operator, which
captures the local structure of the graph. However, existing approaches have
some drawbacks such as considering some special instances of linear
transformations, or reducing the family of transformations by assuming that a
shift matrix is given such that a subset of its eigenvectors spans the subspace
of interest. In contrast, this paper develops a framework for computing a wide
class of linear transformations in a decentralized fashion by relying on the
notion of graph shift operator. The main goal of the proposed method is to
compute the desired linear transformation in a small number of iterations. To
this end, a set of successive graph shift operators is employed, then, a new
optimization problem is proposed whose goal is to compute the desired
transformation as fast as possible. In addition, usually, the topology of the
networks, especially the wireless sensor networks, change randomly because of
node failures or random links. In this paper, the effect of edge fluctuations
on the performance of the proposed method is studied. To deal with the negative
effect of edge fluctuations, an online kernel-based method is proposed which
enables nodes to estimate the missed values with their at hand information. The
proposed method can also be employed to sparsify the network graph or reduce
the number of local exchanges between nodes, which saves sensors power in the
wireless sensor networks.

radioactive isotopes. Recent estimates suggest that they contribute to 33\% of
the heat released at the surface of the Earth, while occupying less than 1\% of
the mantle. This distinctive feature has profound implications for the
underlying mantle by impacting its thermal structure and heat transfer.
However, the effects of a continental crust enriched in heat-producing elements
on the underlying mantle have not yet been systematically investigated. Here,
we conduct a preliminary investigation by considering a simplified convective
system consisting in a mixed heated fluid where all the internal heating is
concentrated in a top layer of thickness $d_{HL}$ (referred to as
""heat-blanketed convection""). We perform 24 numerical simulations in 3D
Cartesian geometry for four specific set-ups and various values of $d_{HL}$.
Our results suggest that the effects of the heated layer strongly depend on its
thickness relative to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer
($\delta_{TBL}$) in the homogeneous heating case ($d_{HL} = 1.0$). More
specifically, for $d_{HL} > \delta_{TBL}$, the effects induced by the heated
layer are quite modest, while, for $d_{HL} < \delta_{TBL}$, the properties of
the convective system are strongly altered as $d_{HL}$ decreases. In
particular, the surface heat flux and convective vigour are significantly
enhanced for very thin heated layers compared to the case $d_{HL} = 1.0$. The
vertical distribution of heat producing elements may therefore play a key role
on mantle dynamics. For Earth, the presence of continents should however not
affect significantly the surface heat flux, and thus the Earth's cooling rate.

stellar mass decreases with increasing vertical filament distance. The galaxies
were divided into higher-mass (log h^2M_* > 8) and lower-mass (log h^2M_* < 8)

width (EW(Halpha)), near-ultraviolet (NUV) - r color, and HI fraction
distributions of the two subsamples against the vertical distance. The
lower-mass galaxies exhibit a negative g - r color gradient, whereas
higher-mass galaxies have a flat g - r color distribution. We observe a
negative EW(Halpha) gradient for higher-mass galaxies, whereas lower-mass
galaxies show no distinct EW(Halpha) variation. In contrast, the NUV - r color
distribution of higher-mass galaxies shows no strong trend, whereas the
lower-mass galaxies show a negative NUV - r color gradient. We do not witness
clear gradients of HI fraction in either the higher- or lower-mass subsamples.
We propose that the negative color and stellar mass gradients of galaxies can
be explained by mass assembly from past galaxy mergers at different vertical
filament distances. In addition, galaxy interactions might be responsible for
the contrasting features of EW(Halpha) and NUV - r color distributions between
the higher- and lower-mass subsamples. The HI fraction distributions of the two

algorithm provides the melting profile at steady-state as well as the long-term

in reaction to the decision variables. This is the case for example when
members of the population respond to a deployed classifier by manipulating
their features so as to improve the likelihood of being positively labeled.
Recent works on performative prediction have identified an intriguing solution
concept for such problems: find the decision that is optimal with respect to
the static distribution that the decision induces. Continuing this line of
work, we show that typical stochastic algorithms -- originally designed for
static problems -- can be applied directly for finding such equilibria with
little loss in efficiency. The reason is simple to explain: the main
consequence of the distributional shift is that it corrupts algorithms with a
bias that decays linearly with the distance to the solution. Using this
perspective, we obtain sharp convergence guarantees for popular algorithms,
such as stochastic gradient, clipped gradient, proximal point, and dual
averaging methods, along with their accelerated and proximal variants. In
realistic applications, deployment of a decision rule is often much more
expensive than sampling. We show how to modify the aforementioned algorithms so
as to maintain their sample efficiency while performing only logarithmically
many deployments.

designed to preprocess the dirty data before conducting applications. The idea
of most data cleaning methods is to identify or correct dirty data, referring
to the values of their neighbors which share the same information.
Unfortunately, owing to data sparsity and heterogeneity, the number of
neighbors based on equality relationship is rather limited, especially in the
presence of data values with variances. To tackle this problem, distance-based
data cleaning approaches propose to consider similarity neighbors based on
value distance. By tolerance of small variants, the enriched similarity
neighbors can be identified and used for data cleaning tasks. At the same time,
distance relationship between tuples is also helpful to guide the data
cleaning, which contains more information and includes the equality
relationship. Therefore, distance-based technology plays an important role in
the data cleaning area, and we also have reason to believe that distance-based
data cleaning technology will attract more attention in data preprocessing
research in the future. Hence this survey provides a classification of four
main data cleaning tasks, i.e., rule profiling, error detection, data repair

systems, the steady shockwave and the unsteady rarefaction wave. We eliminate
the need for boundary potentials by simulating the collisions of pairs of

Shockwaves resulting from compression have a steady structure while the
rarefaction fans resulting from free expansions continually broaden. We model
these processes using classical molecular dynamics and Eulerian fluid mechanics
in two dimensions. Although molecular dynamics is time-reversible the reversed
simulation of a steady shockwave compression soon results in an unsteady
rarefaction fan, violating the microscopic time symmetry of the motion
equations but in agreement with the predictions of macroscopic Navier-Stokes
fluid mechanics. The explanations for these results are an interesting

musculature at the base of the fin. In this work we numerically investigate the
effects of such leading-edge curvature actuation on the hydrodynamic
performance of a heaving and pitching fin. We present a geometric and numerical
framework for constructing the shape of ray-membrane type fins with imposed
leading-edge curvatures, under the constraint of membrane inextensibility. This
algorithm is coupled with a 3D Navier-Stokes solver, enabling us to assess the
hydrodynamic performance of such fins. To determine the space of possible
shapes, we present a simple model for leading-edge curvature actuation through
two coefficients that determine chordwise and spanwise curvature, respectively.
We systematically vary these two parameters through regimes that mimic both
passive elastic deformations and active curvatures against the hydrodynamic
loading, and compute thrust and power coefficients, as well as hydrodynamic
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that both thrust and efficiency are
predominantly affected by chordwise curvature, with some small additional
benefits of spanwise curvature on efficiency. The main improvements in
performance are explained by the altered trailing-edge kinematics arising from
leading-edge curvature actuation, which can largely be reproduced by a rigid
fin whose trailing-edge kinematics follow that of the curving fin. Changes in
fin camber, for fixed trailing-edge kinematics, mostly benefit efficiency.
Based on our results, we discuss the use of leading-edge curvature actuation as
a robust and versatile way to improve flapping fin performance.

datasets that assume complete observability of the crowd using an aerial view.
These are generally not representative of real-world usage from a vehicle

of implicit interaction between pedestrians in a crowd by assigning attention

of the adjustable low-rank representation based on the heredity matrix, V3H
recovers the underlying true data structure to reduce the influence of the
large incompleteness. More importantly, V3H presents possibly the first work to
introduce genetics to clustering algorithms for learning simultaneously the

either reserving much adverse background information or missing a great deal of
foreground information. Moreover, the global matching between the target and

  In this paper, to solve the above issues, we propose a simple target-aware
Siamese graph attention network for general object tracking. We propose to
establish part-to-part correspondence between the target and the search region
with a complete bipartite graph, and apply the graph attention mechanism to
propagate target information from the template feature to the search feature.
Further, instead of using the pre-fixed region cropping for

photo-mechanics, we aim to also unify the variational approach to dissipative
dynamical systems. Taken together, the variational setting of a geometrically
exact continuum framework of photo-mechanics paves the way for forthcoming
theoretical and numerical analyses.

widely used for urban reconstruction. However, the photogrammetric meshes also
suffer from severe texture problems, especially on the road areas due to
occlusion. This paper proposes a structure-aware completion approach to improve
the quality of meshes by removing undesired vehicles on the road seamlessly.
Specifically, the discontinuous texture atlas is first integrated to a
continuous screen space through rendering by the graphics pipeline; the
rendering also records necessary mapping for deintegration to the original
texture atlas after editing. Vehicle regions are masked by a standard object
detection approach, e.g. Faster RCNN. Then, the masked regions are completed
guided by the linear structures and regularities in the road region, which is
implemented based on Patch Match. Finally, the completed rendered image is
deintegrated to the original texture atlas and the triangles for the vehicles
are also flattened for improved meshes. Experimental evaluations and analyses
are conducted against three datasets, which are captured with different sensors
and ground sample distances. The results reveal that the proposed method can
quite realistic meshes after removing the vehicles. The structure-aware
completion approach for road regions outperforms popular image completion
methods and ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the linear
guidance. It should be noted that the proposed method is also capable to handle
tiled mesh models for large-scale scenes. Dataset and code are available at

systematically the performance of a class of universal variational
wave-functions based on artificial neural networks, by considering the
frustrated spin-$1/2$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice.
Focusing on neural network architectures without physics-informed input, we
argue in favor of using an ansatz consisting of two decoupled real-valued
networks, one for the amplitude and the other for the phase of the variational
wavefunction. By introducing concrete mitigation strategies against inherent
numerical instabilities in the stochastic reconfiguration algorithm we obtain a
variational energy comparable to that reported recently with neural networks
that incorporate knowledge about the physical system. Through a detailed
analysis of the individual components of the algorithm, we conclude that the
rugged nature of the energy landscape constitutes the major obstacle in finding
a satisfactory approximation to the ground state wavefunction, and prevents
learning the correct sign structure. In particular, we show that in the present
setup the neural network expressivity and Monte Carlo sampling are not primary
limiting factors.

multiple problems and serious damages in many civil infrastructures which

demanding to design surfaces with well ice-repellent properties. Here in this
study, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate ice
shearing mechanism on atomistically smooth and nanotexture graphite substrates.
We find that ice shearing strength strongly depends on ice temperature, the
lattice structure of the surface substrate, the size of the surface nanotexture
structure, and the depth of interdigitated water molecules. Our results
indicate nanoscale surface roughness and depth of interdigitated water
molecules tend to increase ice shear failure stress and for corrugated
substrates, this is further raised with increasing the depth of interdigitated
water molecules which is a result of strain being distributed well into the ice
cube away from the interface. These results supply an in-depth understanding of
the effect of surface nanotexture on ice shearing mechanism that provides
useful information in designing anti-icing surfaces and provide for the
first-time theoretical references in understanding the effect of surface

galaxy cluster Abell 2319 to investigate the prominent cold front in its core.
The main sharp arc of the front shows wiggles, or variations of the radius of
the density jump along the arc. At the southern end of the arc is a feature
that resembles a Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) eddy, beyond which the sharp front
dissolves. These features suggest that KH instabilities develop at the front.
Under this assumption, we can place an upper limit on the ICM viscosity that is
several times below the isotropic Spitzer value. Other features include a split
of the cold front at its northern edge, which may be another KH eddy. There is
a small pocket of hot, less-dense gas inside the cold front, which may indicate
a `hole' in the front's magnetic insulation layer that lets the heat from the
outer gas to penetrate inside the front. Finally, a large concave brightness
feature southwest of the cluster core can be caused by the gasdynamic
instabilities. We speculate that it can also be an inner boundary of a giant
AGN bubble, similar to that in Ophiuchus. If the latter interpretation is
supported by better radio data, this could be a remnant of another extremely
powerful AGN outburst.

or semantics. Code clone detection plays an important role in software
maintenance, code refactoring, and reuse. A substantial amount of research has
been conducted in the past to detect clones. A majority of these approaches use
lexical and syntactic information to detect clones. However, only a few of them
target semantic clones. Recently, motivated by the success of deep learning
models in other fields, including natural language processing and computer
vision, researchers have attempted to adopt deep learning techniques to detect
code clones. These approaches use lexical information (tokens) and(or)
syntactic structures like abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to detect code clones.
However, they do not make sufficient use of the available structural and
semantic information hence, limiting their capabilities.
  This paper addresses the problem of semantic code clone detection using
program dependency graphs and geometric neural networks, leveraging the
structured syntactic and semantic information. We have developed a prototype
tool HOLMES, based on our novel approach, and empirically evaluated it on
popular code clone benchmarks. Our results show that HOLMES performs
considerably better than the other state-of-the-art tool, TBCCD. We also
evaluated HOLMES on unseen projects and performed cross dataset experiments to
assess the generalizability of HOLMES. Our results affirm that HOLMES
outperforms TBCCD since most of the pairs that HOLMES detected were either
undetected or suboptimally reported by TBCCD.

using two complementary methods: by organizing the evolution as a Taylor series
in elapsed time and by perturbative expansion in coupling within the
interaction-picture formalism. One of the important aspects of our analysis
consists in utilizing the operators and the vacuum of interacting theory in
constructing the states, without invoking asymptotic particles. Focusing on a
coherent state describing a spatially homogeneous field configuration, it is
demonstrated that both adopted methods successfully account for nonlinear
classical dynamics, giving distinguishable quantum effects. In particular,
according to the time-expansion analysis the initial field-acceleration, with
which the field departs from its initial expectation value, is governed by the
tree-level potential with renormalized mass and bare coupling constant. The
interaction-picture computation, instead, can be manipulated to give the
nonlinear dynamics, determined in terms of renormalized coupling and mass.
However, it results in a logarithmic initial-time singularity in the
field-acceleration, reminiscent of the similar behaviour encountered within
semi-classical formalism, for certain choices of the initial state for
fluctuations. Within our coherent-state analysis, the above mentioned
peculiarities are artefacts of an expansion: in the first case over
infinitesimal time, while in the second case in the coupling constant. Despite
this, we show that the evolution obtained within the interaction-picture
analysis is valid for extended period of time. Moreover, on top of the desired
classical dynamics, it serves us with interesting quantum corrections,
previously proposed by Dvali-Gomez-Zell.

PbSe NCs with diameters of 6.5nm and 5.1nm. We used our Hierarchical
Nanoparticle Transport Simulator HINTS to model the transport in these BNSs.
The mobility exhibits a minimum at a Large-NC-fraction f_LNC=0.25. The mobility
minimum is deep at T=80K and partially smoothed at T=300K. We explain this
minimum as follows. As the LNC fraction f_LNC starts growing from zero, the few
LNCs act as traps for the electrons traversing the BNS because their relevant
energy level is lower. Therefore, increasing the f_LNC concentration of these
traps decreases the mobility. As increasing f_LNC reaches the percolation
threshold f_LNC=f_p, the LNCs form sample-spanning networks that enable
electrons to traverse the entire BNS via these percolating LNC networks.
Transport through the growing percolating LNC networks drives the rapid growth
of the mobility as f_LNC grows past f_p. Therefore, the electron mobility
exhibits a pronounced minimum as a function of f_LNC, centered at f_LNC=f_p.
The position of the mobility minimum shifts to larger LNC fractions as the
electron density increases. We have studied the trends of this mobility minimum
with temperature, electron density, charging energy, ligand length, and
disorder. We account for the trends by a ""renormalized trap model"", in which
capturing an electron renormalizes a deep LNC trap into a shallow trap or a
kinetic obstacle, depending on the charging energy. We verified this physical
picture by constructing and analyzing heat maps of the mobile electrons in the
BNS.

prominent sets of phase space regimes of quasi-periodic orbits of charged
particles trapped in a dipole magnetic field. Besides the low energy regime
that has been studied extensively and covers more than 10% in each dimension of
the phase space of trapped orbits, there are two sets of high energy regimes,
the largest of which covers more than 4% in each dimension of the phase space
of trapped orbits. Particles in these high energy orbits may be observed in
space and be realized in plasma experiments on the Earth. It is well-known that
there are quasi-periodic orbits around stable periodic orbits in Hamiltonian
systems with 2 degrees of freedom and these quasi-periodic orbits are stable as
well. Since periodic orbits appear to have a negligible measure in the phase
space, they are difficult to realize in nature. Quasi-periodic orbits, on the
other hand, may occupy a finite volume in the 4 dimensional (4D) phase space
and be readily detectable. A chaotic orbit has at least one positive Lyapunov
exponent. The Lyapunov exponents of quasi-periodic orbits, on the other hand,
should be zero. Via calculation of the Lyapunov exponent of orbits of trapped
charged particles in a dipole magnetic field, we scanned the corresponding
phase space and found several prominent regimes of quasi-periodic orbits
associated with stable periodic orbits in the equatorial plane. These regimes
appear to be connected to some small regimes of quasi-periodic orbits
associated with stable periodic orbits in the Meridian plane. Our numerical
results also show a continuous spectrum of these orbits from stable periodic,
to quasi-periodic with vanishing Lyapunov exponents, and eventually to chaotic
ones with at least one positive Lyapunov exponent and there are unstable
periodic orbits with a positive maximum Lyapunov exponent.

vertical phase mixing across the Galactic disk. Our results confirm the
existence of the phase space snail shells (or phase spirals) from 6 to 12 kpc.
We find that grouping stars by the guiding radius ($R_{g}$), instead of the
present radius ($R$) further enhances the snail shell signal in the following
aspects: (1) clarity of the snail shell shape is increased; (2) more wraps of
the snail shell can be seen; (3) the phase spaces are less affected by the lack
of stars closer to the disk mid-plane due to extinction; (4) the phase space
snail shell is amplified in greater radial ranges. Compared to the $R$-based
snail shell, the quantitatively measured shapes are similar, except that the
$R_{g}$-based snail shells show more wraps with better contrast. These lines of
evidence lead to the conclusion that the guiding radius (angular momentum) is a
fundamental parameter tracing the phase space snail shell across the Galactic
disk. Results of our test particle simulations with impulse approximation
verify that particles grouped according to $R_{g}$ reveal well-defined and
sharper snail shell features. By comparing the radial profiles of the pitch
angle between observation and simulation, the external perturbation can be
constrained to $\sim$500$-$700 Myr ago. For future vertical phase mixing study,
it is recommended to use the guiding radius with additional constraints on
orbital hotness (ellipticity) to improve the clarity of the phase snail.

replacing the a.e. zero derivatives of quantized (i.e., stair-case) ReLU

performance guarantees for the proposed STEs by showing that the corresponding

perfect classification. Lastly, we present experimental results on synthetic

specifically, the paper focuses on solving the supervised classification
problem of taking images of people as input and classifying the person in the

and training a neural network called WoodNet from scratch and (2) leveraging
transfer learning by utilizing a network pre-trained on the ImageNet database
and adapting it to this project's data and classes. In order to train the
models to recognize the authors, a dataset containing more than 150 000 images
has been created, balanced over the authors and others. Image extraction from
videos and image augmentation techniques were instrumental for dataset
creation. The results are two models classifying the individuals in the dataset
with high accuracy, achieving over 99% accuracy on held-out test data. The
pre-trained model fitted significantly faster than WoodNet, and seems to
generalize better. However, these results come with a few caveats. Because of
the way the dataset was compiled, as well as the high accuracy, one has reason
to believe the models over-fitted to the data to some degree. An added
consequence of the data compilation method is that the test dataset may not be
sufficiently different from the training data, limiting its ability to validate
generalization of the models. However, utilizing the models in a web-cam based

For example,
pairwise Potts models (PM), which are instances of the BM class, provide
accurate statistical models of families of evolutionarily related protein
sequences. Their parameters are the local fields, which describe site-specific
patterns of amino-acid conservation, and the two-site couplings, which mirror
the coevolution between pairs of sites. This coevolution reflects structural
and functional constraints acting on protein sequences during evolution. The
most conservative choice to describe the coevolution signal is to include all
possible two-site couplings into the PM. This choice, typical of what is known
as Direct Coupling Analysis, has been successful for predicting residue
contacts in the three-dimensional structure, mutational effects, and in
generating new functional sequences. However, the resulting PM suffers from
important over-fitting effects: many couplings are small, noisy and hardly
interpretable; the PM is close to a critical point, meaning that it is highly
sensitive to small parameter perturbations. In this work, we introduce a
general parameter-reduction procedure for BMs, via a controlled iterative
decimation of the less statistically significant couplings, identified by an
information-based criterion that selects either weak or statistically
unsupported couplings. For several protein families, our procedure allows one
to remove more than $90\%$ of the PM couplings, while preserving the predictive
and generative properties of the original dense PM, and the resulting model is
far away from criticality, hence more robust to noise.

heterogeneous, and anisotropic diffusivities, as well as advection-dominated
diffusion problems. The general stabilized finite element framework was
described and analyzed in arXiv:1907.12605v3 for linear problems in general,
and tested for pure advection problems. The method seeks for the discrete
solution through a residual minimization process on a proper stable
discontinuous Galerkin (dG) dual norm. This technique leads to a saddle-point
problem that delivers a stable discrete solution and a robust error estimate
that can drive mesh adaptivity. In this work, we demonstrate the efficiency of
the method in extreme scenarios, delivering stable solutions. The quality and
performance of the solutions are comparable to classical discontinuous Galerkin
formulations in the respective discrete space norm on each mesh. Meanwhile,
this technique allows us to solve on coarse meshes and adapt the solution to
achieve a user-specified solution quality.

large (~0.3 eV) and momentum-dependent, which naturally explains the robust CDW

Using a toy model based on a Hawkes process, we are able to achieve simulation

exoplanetary science due to their ability to model highly non-linear relations
and solve interesting problems in a data-driven manner. Several works have
attempted to perform fast retrievals of atmospheric parameters with the use of
machine learning algorithms like deep neural networks (DNNs). Yet, despite
their high predictive power, DNNs are also infamous for being 'black boxes'. It
is their apparent lack of explainability that makes the astrophysics community
reluctant to adopt them. What are their predictions based on? How confident
should we be in them? When are they wrong and how wrong can they be? In this
work, we present a number of general evaluation methodologies that can be
applied to any trained model and answer questions like these. In particular, we
train three different popular DNN architectures to retrieve atmospheric
parameters from exoplanet spectra and show that all three achieve good
predictive performance. We then present an extensive analysis of the
predictions of DNNs, which can inform us - among other things - of the
credibility limits for atmospheric parameters for a given instrument and model.
Finally, we perform a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis to identify to
which features of the spectrum the outcome of the retrieval is most sensitive.
We conclude that for different molecules, the wavelength ranges to which the
DNN's predictions are most sensitive, indeed coincide with their characteristic
absorption regions. The methodologies presented in this work help to improve
the evaluation of DNNs and to grant interpretability to their predictions.

multimedia package. The problem setup requires algorithms to perform multimodal
semantic forensics to authenticate a query multimedia package using a reference
dataset of potentially related packages as evidences. Existing methods are
limited to using a single evidence (retrieved package), which ignores potential
performance improvement from the use of multiple evidences. In this work, we
introduce a novel graph neural network based model for multimodal semantic

that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms with

we examine the use of Voronoi tessellation for defining the necessary

nonmagnetic spacer can be used to control the depinning of domain walls and
induce unidirectional domain wall propagation. We investigated CoFeB/Ti/CoFeB
trilayers where the easy axis of the magnetization of the top CoFeB layer is
out-of-plane and that of the bottom layer is in-plane. Using Magneto-optic Kerr
effect microscopy, we find that the depinning of a domain wall in the
perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB layer is influenced by the orientation of the
magnetization of the in-plane layer, which gives rise to a field-driven
asymmetric domain expansion. This effect occurs due to the magnetic coupling
between the internal magnetization of the domain wall and the magnetization of
the in-plane CoFeB layer, which breaks the symmetry of up-down and down-up
homochiral N\'eel domain walls in the perpendicular CoFeB layer. Micromagnetic
simulations support these findings by showing that the interlayer coupling
either opposes or favors the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the domain
wall, thereby generating an imbalance in the depinning fields. This effect also
allows for artificially controlling the chirality and dynamics of domain walls
in magnetic layers lacking a strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

statistical mechanics analysis of inhomogeneous molecular liquids. The key
defining feature of these systems is the presence of two very distinct
interactions scales (intra- and inter-molecular), and as such proper
description of both effects is critical to the accuracy of the calculations.
Current SDFT applications utilize the same approximation scheme for both
interaction motifs, which negatively impacts the results. Dual space
methodology, used in this work, alleviates this issue by providing the
flexibility of evaluating part of the interactions in traditional field
representation. For molecular liquid this translates into retaining density
representation for inter-molecular interactions but describing stiff
intra-molecular remainder by more appropriate conventional field based methods.
This opens the way to decouple analysis of the two interactions scales - the
idea which is developed further in this work for the case of homogeneous
reference approximation of inter-molecular interactions. We demonstrate that by
defining new collective variables, the behavior of the original molecular
liquid system at the inter-molecular level can be transformed to resemble that
of an effective simple fluid mixture. The latter is linked to intra-molecular
scale through renormalized interaction parameters. We illustrate this
renormalization procedure for several types of diatomic liquids, showing that
this approach cures many of the shortcomings of existing SDFT methods.

for probing fluid properties at the microscale. In particular, microrheology
exploits the manipulation and rotation of micron-scale particles to probe local
viscosity, especially where these properties may be perturbed as a function of
their local environment, for example in the vicinity of cells. To this end,
birefringent particles are useful as they can be readily controlled using
optically induced forces and torques, and thereby used to probe their local
environment. However the magnitude of optical torques that can be induced in
birefringent particles is small, and a function of the particle diameter,
meaning that rotational flow cannot readily be probed on length scales much
small than the micron level. Here we show modelling that demonstrates that
eccentric spherical core-shell nanoparticles can be used to generate
considerable optical torques. The eccentricity is a result of the displacement
of the centre of the core from the shell. Our results show that, for particles
ranging from 90~nm to 180~nm in diameter, we may achieve rotation rates
exceeding 800~Hz. This fills a missing size gap in the rotation of
microparticles with optical forces. The diameter of particle we may rotate is
almost an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest birefringent particles

$\ominus$, and no node has the same label as its right child. The di-sk trees
are in natural bijection with separable permutations. We construct a
combinatorial bijection on di-sk trees proving the two quintuples
$(\LMAX,\LMIN,\DESB,\iar,\comp)$ and $(\LMAX,\LMIN,\DESB,\comp,\iar)$ have the
same distribution over separable permutations. Here for a permutation $\pi$,
$\LMAX(\pi)/\LMIN(\pi)$ is the set of values of the left-to-right maxima/minima
of $\pi$ and $\DESB(\pi)$ is the set of descent bottoms of $\pi$, while
$\comp(\pi)$ and $\iar(\pi)$ are respectively the number of components of $\pi$
and the length of initial ascending run of $\pi$.
  Interestingly, our bijection specializes to a bijection on $312$-avoiding
permutations, which provides (up to the classical {\em Knuth--Richards
bijection}) an alternative approach to a result of Rubey (2016) that asserts
the two triples $(\LMAX,\iar,\comp)$ and $(\LMAX,\comp,\iar)$ are
equidistributed on $321$-avoiding permutations. Rubey's result is a symmetric
extension of an equidistribution due to Adin--Bagno--Roichman, which implies
the class of $321$-avoiding permutations with a prescribed number of components
is Schur positive.
  Some equidistribution results for various statistics concerning tree
traversal are presented in the end.

validate the climate model forecast or monitor rainfall at the micro-regional
level operationally. Dynamical and statistical downscaling models are often
used to get information at high-resolution gridded data over larger domains. As
rainfall variability is dependent on the complex Spatio-temporal process
leading to non-linear or chaotic Spatio-temporal variations, no single
downscaling method can be considered efficient enough. In data with complex
topographies, quasi-periodicities, and non-linearities, deep Learning (DL)
based methods provide an efficient solution in downscaling rainfall data for
regional climate forecasting and real-time rainfall observation data at high
spatial resolutions. In this work, we employed three deep learning-based
algorithms derived from the super-resolution convolutional neural network
(SRCNN) methods, to precipitation data, in particular, IMD and TRMM data to
produce 4x-times high-resolution downscaled rainfall data during the summer
monsoon season. Among the three algorithms, namely SRCNN, stacked SRCNN, and
DeepSD, employed here, the best spatial distribution of rainfall amplitude and
minimum root-mean-square error is produced by DeepSD based downscaling. Hence,
the use of the DeepSD algorithm is advocated for future use. We found that
spatial discontinuity in amplitude and intensity rainfall patterns is the main
obstacle in the downscaling of precipitation. Furthermore, we applied these
methods for model data postprocessing, in particular, ERA5 data. Downscaled
ERA5 rainfall data show a much better distribution of spatial covariance and
temporal variance when compared with observation.

scattering caused by the high density of crystal defects inside the sample,
which were created by the severe plastic deformation during the sample
preparation. The corresponding magnetic correlation length, which characterizes
the spatial magnetization fluctuations in real space, indicates an average
defect size of 11 nm, which is smaller than the average crystallite size of 60

disorder in the surrounding ferromagnetic bulk, with a penetration depth of

suppressed by an increasing external magnetic field. Our findings are supported
and illustrated by micromagnetic simulations, which, for the particular case of

and of the neutron lifetime, along with the reevaluation of the cosmological
baryon abundance from cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis, call for an
update of abundance predictions for light elements produced during the big-bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). While considered as a pillar of the hot big-bang model
in its early days, BBN constraining power mostly rests on deuterium abundance.
We point out a new $\simeq1.8\sigma$-tension on the baryonic density, or
equivalently on the D/H abundance, between the value inferred on one hand from
the analysis of the primordial abundances of light elements and, on the other
hand, from the combination of CMB and baryonic oscillation data. This draws the
attention on this sector of the theory and gives us the opportunity to
reevaluate the status of BBN in the context of precision cosmology. Finally,
this paper presents an upgrade of the BBN code PRIMAT.

variables, it states that the integrals of a solution over certain pairs of
conjugate circles are the same. In this paper we extend this result to
non-degenerate conjugate conics, which include the original case of conjugate
circles and adds the new case of conjugate hyperbolae.
  The broader context of this result is the geometrization of Fritz John's 1938
analysis of the ultra-hyperbolic equation. Solutions of the equation arise as
the compatibility for functions on line space to come from line integrals of
functions in Euclidean 3-space. The introduction of the canonical neutral
Kaehler metric on the space of oriented lines clarifies the relationship and
broadens the paradigm to allow new insights.
  In particular, it is proven that a solution of the ultra-hyperbolic equation
has the mean value property over any pair of curves that arise as the image of
John's conjugate circles under a conformal map. These pairs of curves are then
shown to be conjugate conics, which include circles and hyperbolae.
  John identified conjugate circles with the two rulings of a hyperboloid of
1-sheet. Conjugate hyperbolae are identified with the two rulings of either a
piece of a hyperboloid of 1-sheet or a hyperbolic paraboloid.

Electronic transport shows unexpected memristive properties in the MoS2

of the membrane is measured concurrently and may only be related to the phase
2H-1T phase transition which imposes a 3percent directional elongation of the
topological 1T phase with respect to the semiconducting 2H. We note that only a
few percent 2H- 1T phase switching is sufficient to observe measurable
memristive effects. Our experimental results combined with First-principles
total energy calculations indicate that sulfur vacancy diffusion plays a key
role in the initial nucleation of the phase transition. Our study clearly shows
that nanomechanics represents an ultrasensitive technique to probe the crystal
phase transition in 2D materials or thin membranes. Finally, a better control
of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the observed memristive effect in

Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperads, which consists of collections of $ E_\infty

corresponding to tree morphisms, together with facet operators, corresponding
to subtree inclusions. The coproduct operators model coproducts of operations
inside a tree. The facet operators are assumed to satisfy a Segal condition.
The homotopy Segal cooperads that we aim to define are formed by integrating
homotopies in the composition schemes of the coproduct operators. For this
purpose, we replace the functorial structure that governs the composition of
the coproduct operators by the structure of a homotopy functor which we shape
on a cubical enrichment of the category of $ E_\infty $-algebras. We prove that
every homotopy Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperad in our sense is
weakly-equivalent to a strict Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperad. We also define
a notion of homotopy morphism of homotopy Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperads. We
prove that every homotopy Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperad admits a cobar
construction and that every homotopy morphism of homotopy Segal $ E_\infty
$-Hopf cooperads induces a morphism on this cobar construction, so that our
approach provides a lifting to the context of $ E_\infty $-algebras of
classical homotopy cooperad structures that are modeled on the bar duality of

adaptive dynamics intrinsic to neuromorphic NWNs can be harnessed to achieve
transfer learning. We demonstrate this through simulations of a reservoir
computing implementation in which NWNs perform the well-known benchmarking task
of Mackey-Glass (MG) signal forecasting. First we show how NWNs can predict MG
signals with arbitrary degrees of unpredictability (i.e. chaos). We then show
that NWNs pre-exposed to a MG signal perform better in forecasting than NWNs
without prior experience of an MG signal. This type of transfer learning is
enabled by the network's collective memory of previous states. Overall, their

  Optical Fiber","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The capacity of a discrete-time model of optical fiber described by the
split-step Fourier method (SSFM) as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio
$\text{SNR}$ and the number of segments in distance $K$ is considered. It is
shown that if $K\geq \text{SNR}^{2/3}$ and $\text{SNR} \rightarrow \infty$, the
capacity of the resulting continuous-space lossless model is lower bounded by
$\frac{1}{2}\log_2(1+\text{SNR}) - \frac{1}{2}+ o(1)$, where $o(1)$ tends to
zero with $\text{SNR}$. As $K\rightarrow \infty$, the inter-symbol interference
(ISI) averages out to zero due to the law of large numbers and the SSFM model
tends to a diagonal phase noise model. It follows that, in contrast to the
discrete-space model where there is only one signal degree-of-freedom (DoF) at
high powers, the number of DoFs in the continuous-space model is at least half
of the input dimension $n$. Intensity-modulation and direct detection achieves
this rate. The pre-log in the lower bound when $K= \sqrt[\delta]{\text{SNR}}$
is generally characterized in terms of $\delta$.
  It is shown that if the nonlinearity parameter $\gamma\rightarrow \infty$,
the capacity of the continuous-space model is $\frac{1}{2}\log_2(1+\text{SNR})+
o(1)$.
  The SSFM model when the dispersion matrix does not depend on $K$ is
considered. It is shown that the capacity of this model when $K=
\sqrt[\delta]{\text{SNR}}$, $\delta>3$, and $\text{SNR} \rightarrow \infty$ is
$\frac{1}{2n}\log_2(1+\text{SNR})+ O(1)$. Thus, there is only one DoF in this
model.
  Finally, it is found that the maximum achievable information rates (AIRs) of
the SSFM model with back-propagation equalization obtained using numerical
simulation follows a double-ascent curve.

correctly ignores natural clouds and focuses on those imaging channels that are
related to the spectral absorption from aerosols and water vapor, enabling the
localization of smoke. We exploit this localization ability and train a U-Net
segmentation model on a labeled sub-sample of our data, resulting in an
Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 0.608 and an overall accuracy for the
detection of any smoke plume of 94.0%; on average, our model can reproduce the
area covered by smoke in an image to within 5.6%. The performance of our model
is mostly limited by occasional confusion with surface objects, the inability
to identify semi-transparent smoke, and human limitations to properly identify
smoke based on RGB-only images. Nevertheless, our results enable us to reliably

NIHAO project to investigate the response of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes to
baryonic processes. Previous work has shown that the halo response is primarily
a function of the ratio between galaxy stellar mass and total virial mass, and
the density threshold above which gas is eligible to form stars, $n [{\rm
cm}^{-3}]$. At low $n$ all simulations in the literature agree that dwarf
galaxy haloes are cuspy, but at high $n\ge 100$ there is no consensus. We trace
halo contraction in dwarf galaxies with $n\ge 100$ reported in some previous
simulations to insufficient spatial resolution. Provided the adopted star
formation threshold is appropriate for the resolution of the simulation, we
show that the halo response is remarkably stable for $n\ge 5$, up to the
highest star formation threshold that we test, $n=500$. This free parameter can
be calibrated using the observed clustering of young stars. Simulations with
low thresholds $n\le 1$ predict clustering that is too weak, while simulations
with high star formation thresholds $n\ge 5$, are consistent with the observed
clustering. Finally, we test the CDM predictions against the circular
velocities of nearby dwarf galaxies. Low thresholds predict velocities that are
too high, while simulations with $n\sim 10$ provide a good match to the
observations. We thus conclude that the CDM model provides a good description
of the structure of galaxies on kpc scales provided the effects of baryons are
properly captured.

correlations of a driven dissipative Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) at and near a
dissipative phase transition (DPT). We compute Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) type
two-particle temporal correlation function $g^2(\tau)$ which, as a function of
time delay $\tau$, exhibits oscillations with frequencies determined by the
imaginary part of Liouvillian gap. As the gap closes near a transition point,
the oscillations at that point dies down. For parameters slightly away from the
transition point, the HBT correlations show oscillations from super-bunching to
anti-bunching regimes. We show that the Fourier transform of HBT correlations
into frequency domain provide information about DPT and Liouvillian dynamics.
We numerically solve the many-body Lindblad master equation and calculate
Wigner distribution of the system in steady state to ascertain DPT.Below
certain drive strength, the Fourier transform shows a two-peak structure while
above that strength it exhibits either a Lorenzian-like single-peak structure
or a structure with two-dips. The width of the single-peak structure is minimum
at the phase transition point and the peak of this structure always lies at
zero frequency. The positions of the two symmetrical peaks in case of two-peak
structure are given by the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian gap while their
half width at half maximum (HWHM) is given by the real part of the gap. The
positions and the widths of the two dips are also related to low lying
eigenvalues of the Liouvillian operator. We discuss quantum statistical
properties of the model in terms of the HBT correlation function and its
Fourier transform.

algorithms can hardly reconcile the contradiction of simultaneous rapid
convergence and the global optimization. In this paper, a novel learning-based

is trained by a 3D tensor (9x9x9), which consists of similar metric values. The
elements of the 3D tensor correspond to the 9x9x9 neighbors of the initial
parameters in the search space. Then, the tensor's label is a vector that
points to the global optimal parameters from the initial parameters. Because of
the special architecture, the IRON could predict the global optimum directly
for any initialization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm performs better than other classical optimization algorithms as it
has higher accuracy, lower root of mean square error (RMSE), and more
efficiency. Our IRON codes are available for further

charge $-e$ ($e$ being the elementary charge) are coined as ``counterions'';
the system as a whole is electroneutral. Such a geometry is well defined also
for finite numbers of counterions $N$. Our task is to derive an effective
interaction between the end-circles mediated by the counterions in thermal
equilibrium at the inverse temperature $\beta$. The exact solution of the
system at the free-fermion coupling $\Gamma \equiv \beta e^2/\varepsilon =2$ is
used to test the convergence of the pressure as the (even) number of particles
increases from $N=2$ to $\infty$. The pressure as a function of distance $d$ is
always positive (effective repulsion between the like-charged circles),
decaying monotonously; the numerical results for $N=8$ counterions are very
close to those in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$. For the couplings
$\Gamma=2\gamma$ with $\gamma=1,2,\ldots$, there exists a mapping of the
continuous two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb system with $N$ particles onto the
one-dimensional (1D) lattice model of $N$ sites with interacting sets of
anticommuting variables. This allows one to treat exactly the density profile,
two-body density and the pressure for the couplings $\Gamma=4$ and $6$, up to
$N=8$ particles. Our main finding is that the pressure becomes negative at
large enough distances $d$ if and only if both like-charged walls carry a
nonzero charge density. This indicates a like-attraction in the thermodynamic

$\Gamma$ in between 2 and 4.

undergoes attenuation and distortion caused by fading. We use the sensor to
observe system states and transmit its local state estimates to the remote
center. Meanwhile, the attacker injects a jamming signal to destroy the packet
accepted by the remote center and causes the performance degradation. Most of
the existing works are built on a time-invariant channel state information
(CSI) model in which the channel fading is stationary. However, the wireless
communication channels are more prone to dynamic changes. To capture this
time-variant property in the channel quality of the real-world networks, we
study the fading channel network whose channel model is characterized by a
generalized finite-state Markov chain. With the goals of two players in
infinite-time horizon, we describe the conflicting characteristic between the
attacker and the sensor with a general-sum stochastic game. Moreover, the
Q-learning techniques are applied to obtain an optimal strategy pair at a Nash
equilibrium. Also the monotone structure of the optimal stationary strategy is
constructed under a sufficient condition. Besides, when channel gain is known a
priori, except for the full Channel State Information (CSI), we also
investigate the partial CSI, where Bayesian games are employed. Based on the
player's own channel information and the belief on the channel distribution of
other players, the energy strategy at a Nash equilibrium is obtained.

  Variables to Continuum Problems","40 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predictive Physics has been historically based upon the development of
mathematical models that describe the evolution of a system under certain
external stimuli and constraints. The structure of such mathematical models
relies on a set of hysical hypotheses that are assumed to be fulfilled by the
system within a certain range of environmental conditions. A new perspective is
now raising that uses physical knowledge to inform the data prediction
capability of artificial neural networks. A particular extension of this
data-driven approach is Physically-Guided Neural Networks with Internal
Variables (PGNNIV): universal physical laws are used as constraints in the
neural network, in such a way that some neuron values can be interpreted as
internal state variables of the system. This endows the network with unraveling
capacity, as well as better predictive properties such as faster convergence,
fewer data needs and additional noise filtering. Besides, only observable data
are used to train the network, and the internal state equations may be
extracted as a result of the training processes, so there is no need to make
explicit the particular structure of the internal state model. We extend this
new methodology to continuum physical problems, showing again its predictive
and explanatory capacities when only using measurable values in the training
set. We show that the mathematical operators developed for image analysis in
deep learning approaches can be used and extended to consider standard
functional operators in continuum Physics, thus establishing a common framework

plausible colorful image. Conventional methods often use semantics to colorize
grayscale images. However, in these methods, only classification semantic
information is embedded, resulting in semantic confusion and color bleeding in
the final colorized image. To address these issues, we propose a fully
automatic Saliency Map-guided Colorization with Generative Adversarial Network
(SCGAN) framework. It jointly predicts the colorization and saliency map to
minimize semantic confusion and color bleeding in the colorized image. Since
the global features from pre-trained VGG-16-Gray network are embedded to the
colorization encoder, the proposed SCGAN can be trained with much less data
than state-of-the-art methods to achieve perceptually reasonable colorization.
In addition, we propose a novel saliency map-based guidance method. Branches of
the colorization decoder are used to predict the saliency map as a proxy
target. Moreover, two hierarchical discriminators are utilized for the
generated colorization and saliency map, respectively, in order to strengthen
visual perception performance. The proposed system is evaluated on ImageNet
validation set. Experimental results show that SCGAN can generate more
reasonable colorized images than state-of-the-art techniques.

laborious efforts of humans, who are prone to fatigue and errors. To remedy
this, the paper approaches the grading task with various convolutional neural
networks (CNN), a tried-and-tested deep learning technology in computer vision.
The models involved include Mask R-CNN (for background removal), the numerous
past winners of the ImageNet challenge, namely AlexNet, VGGs, and ResNets; and,
a family of self-defined convolutional autoencoder-classifiers (ConvAE-Clfs)
inspired by the claimed benefit of multi-task learning in classification tasks.
Transfer learning is also adopted in this work via utilizing the ImageNet
pretrained weights. Besides elaborating on the preprocessing techniques,
training details, and the resulting performance, we go one step further to
provide explainable insights into the model's working with the help of saliency
maps and principal component analysis (PCA). These insights provide a succinct,
meaningful glimpse into the intricate deep learning black box, fostering trust,
and can also be presented to humans in real-world use cases for reviewing the

researchers in complex geometry willing to enter the beautiful word of
connections between curvature and Kobayashi hyperbolicity. It is a detailed
account of a recent breakthrough by Wu and Yau, shortly after generalized by
Tosatti and Yang (and others), which sits on the crossroad between complex
differential geometry and Kobayashi hyperbolicity. More specifically, an old
conjecture by Kobayashi, stated at the very beginning of the theory, predicts
that a compact hyperbolic manifold should have ample canonical bundle. Now, on
the one hand it is also known since the beginning of the theory that a compact
complex manifold with a Hermitian metric whose holomorphic sectional curvature
is negative is Kobayashi hyperbolic. On the other hand a compact K\""ahler
manifold with ample canonical bundle is known -- by the celebrated work of
Aubin and Yau -- to admit a K\""ahler metric with (constant) negative Ricci
curvature. Wu and Yau's theorem states that if a smooth projective manifolds
admits a K\""ahler metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then it
also admits a possibly different K\""ahler metric whose Ricci curvature is
negative. It can be therefore seen as a weak confirmation of Kobayashi's
conjecture above, since it gives the same conclusion but with the stronger
hypothesis about the holomorphic sectional curvature. Beside a fully detailed
presentation of the proof of this theorem, we also provide some basic
background on complex differential geometry as well as several (positive or
negative) results about the theme of curvature and hyperbolicity. Some natural
open questions are also discussed. The proof of the Wu-Yau theorem presented
here follows quite closely the original main key ideas by Wu and Yau, but the
conclusion is somehow simplified using the pluripotential approach of the
author and S. Trapani.

sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are
usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in
CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed
into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling
distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships
at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of
the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with
background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Our
approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in

tasks that are too simplistic and too hard. They are too simplistic because
they do not require the perception systems to provide all the information

not include information about the part structure of objects, articulation
mechanisms and other attributes needed for adapting manipulation behavior. On
the other hand, the perception problems stated are also too hard because --
unlike humans -- the perception systems cannot leverage the expectations about
what they will see to their full potential. Therefore, we investigate a
variation of robot perception tasks suitable for robots accomplishing everyday
manipulation tasks, such as household robots or a robot in a retail store. In
such settings it is reasonable to assume that robots know most objects and have
detailed models of them.
  We propose a perception system that maintains its beliefs about its
environment as a scene graph with physics simulation and visual rendering. When
detecting objects, the perception system retrieves the model of the object and
places it at the corresponding place in a VR-based environment model. The
physics simulation ensures that object detections that are physically not
possible are rejected and scenes can be rendered to generate expectations at
the image level. The result is a perception system that can provide useful

visitor? Arguably, the concept of participative experiences is already so
deeply ingrained in our culture that we may not even think about it as
participation. Museum visitors engage in a number of activities, of which
observing the exhibits is only one part. Since most visitors come to the museum
together with someone else, they spend time and attention on the people they
came with, and often the needs of the group are given priority over individual
preferences. How can museums tap into these activities - and make themselves
relevant to visitors? In this chapter we will try to approach this
constructively, as a design opportunity. Could it be productive for the museum
to consider itself not only as a disseminator of knowledge, but also as the
facilitator of participative activities between visitors?
  In what follows, we will outline a range of practical design projects that
serve as examples of this approach. These projects were part of the European
Union funded Horizon2020 project GIFT, a cross-disciplinary collaboration
between researchers, artists, designers and many international museums and
heritage organisations, exploring the concept of interpersonal museum
experiences (see https://gifting.digital/). What the projects have in common is
that they build on visitors co-creating and sharing their own narratives in the
museum context. We suggest that these projects demonstrate a spectrum of
possibilities: From experiences that take place almost without any museum
involvement, to those that give museums a role in curating these narratives.

appearance of $M$ unstable nonlinear modes and their interaction, and they are
expected to play a relevant role in the theory of periodic anomalous (rogue)
waves (AWs) in nature. It is rather well established that they are unstable
with respect to small perturbations of the NLS equation. Concerning
perturbations of these solutions within the NLS dynamics, there is the
following common believe in the literature. Let the NLS background be unstable
with respect to the first $N$ modes; then i) if the $M$ unstable modes of the
$AB_M$ solution are strictly contained in this set ($M<N$), then the $AB_M$ is
unstable; ii) if $M=N$, the so-called ""saturation of the instability"", then the
$AB_M$ solution is neutrally stable. We argue instead that the $AB_M$ solution
is always unstable, even in the saturation case $M=N$, and we prove it in the
simplest case $M=N=1$. We first prove the linear instability, constructing two
examples of $x$-periodic solutions of the linearized theory growing
exponentially in time. Then we investigate the nonlinear instability using our
previous results showing that i) a perturbed AB initial condition evolves into
an exact Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) recurrence of ABs described in terms
of elementary functions of the initial data, to leading order; ii) the AB
solution is more unstable than the background solution, and its instability
increases as $T\to 0$, where $T$ is the AB appearance parameter. Although the
AB solution is linearly and nonlinearly unstable, it is relevant in nature,
since its instability generates a FPUT recurrence of ABs. These results
suitably generalize to the case $M=N>1$.

in nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) in 3-dimensions $(d=3)$ by performing deep
quenches from the isotropic $(T>T_c)$ to the nematic $(T<T_c)$ phase. The
inter-molecular potential between the nematogens, represented by continuous
$O(3)$ spins with inversion symmetry, is accurately mimicked by the {\it
generalised Lebwohl Lasher} (GLL) model. It incorporates second and fourth
order Legendre interactions, and their relative interaction strength is
$\lambda$. For $\lambda <-0.3$, we observe {\it canted} morphologies with a
$\lambda$-dependent angle-of-tilt between the neighbouring rod-like molecules.
For $\lambda \geq-0.3$, the molecules align to yield {\it uniform} states. The
coarsening morphologies obey {\it generalized dynamical scaling} in the two
regimes, but the scaling function is not robust with respect to $\lambda$. The
structure factor tail in the canted regime follows the {\it Porod law}:
$S(k,t)\sim k^{-4}$, implying that the coarsening dynamics is due to the
annihilation of interfacial defects. This is unexpected, as the GLL model is
characterised by a continuous order parameter. The uniform regime on the other
hand, exhibits the expected {\it generalized Porod decay}: $S(k,t)\sim k^{-5}$,
characteristic of scattering from {\it string defects}. Finally, the domain
growth obeys the {\it Lifshitz-Allen-Cahn law}: $L(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ for all
values of $\lambda$. Our results for the novel {\it canted} regime are relevant
for a large class of systems with orientational ordering, e.g. active matter,
membranes, LC elastomers, etc. We hope that our work triggers-off stimulating
investigations in them.

autonomous movement in a fluid medium due to self-generated temperature
gradients. In this work, we theoretically investigate the response of such an
auto-thermophoretic particle near a planar wall which is held isothermal. We
derive an exact solution of the energy equation and employ the Reynolds
reciprocal theorem to obtain the translational and rotational swimming
velocities in the creeping flow limit. Subsequently, we analyse the
trajectories of the micromotor for different thermo-physical and
configurational parameters. Results show that the micromotor trajectories can
be switched either from wall-bound sliding or stationary state to escape from
the near-wall zone by suitably choosing the particle and the surrounding fluid
pair having selective thermal conductivity contrasts. Further, we discuss the
dependency of this swimming-state transition on the launching orientation and
the coverage of the metallic cap. Our results reveal that the scenario
addressed here holds several exclusive distinguishing features from the
otherwise extensively studied self-diffusiophoresis phenomenon near an inert
wall, despite obvious analogies in the respective constitutive laws relating
the fluxes with the gradients of the concerned forcing parameters. The most
contrasting locomotion behaviour here turns out to be the ability of a
self-thermophoretic micromotor to migrate towards the wall with large heated
cap even if it is initially directed away from the wall. Besides, during the
stationary state of swimming, the cold portion on the micromotor surface faces
away from the wall, under all conditions. Such unique aspects of locomotion
hold the potential of being harnessed in practice towards achieving intricate
control over autonomous motion of microparticles in thermally-regulated fluidic
environments.

prediction of the components can theoretically be carried out with notably
higher precision. The EMD method is prone to several issues, including modal
aliasing and boundary effect problems, but the TS decomposition-based load and

performance of different decomposition approaches from the forecast accuracy
standpoint; as a result, these problems have rarely been scrutinized.
Underestimating these issues can lead to poor performance of the forecast model

events, and only moderate restrictions remain necessary. In this equilibrium,
daily cases stabilize around ten new infections per million people or less.
However, stability is endangered if restrictions are relaxed or case numbers
grow too high. The latter destabilization marks a tipping point beyond which
the spread self-accelerates. We show that a lockdown can reestablish control
and that recurring lockdowns are not necessary given sustained, moderate
contact reduction. We illustrate how this strategy profits from vaccination and
helps mitigate variants of concern. This strategy reduces cumulative cases (and
fatalities) 4x more than strategies that only avoid hospital collapse. In the
long term, immunization, large-scale testing, and international coordination
will further facilitate control.

superposing the individual contributions together and ignoring nonlinear

disorder exists, in which some parts of the system still exhibit
quasiperiodicity, while other parts start to be characterized by different
localisation behaviours of the wavefunctions. This is manifested through a

usually follow the methodology of deep learning with complicated networks which

complicated models or use more efficient light-weight models in order to be
able to implement the resulting classifiers on embedded devices. In this paper,
we pick the second approach and propose a network layer to enhance the speech
command recognition capability of a lightweight network and demonstrate the
result via experiments. The employed method borrows the ideas of Taylor
expansion and quadratic forms to construct a better representation of features
in both input and hidden layers. This richer representation results in
recognition accuracy improvement as shown by extensive experiments on Google
speech commands (GSC) and synthetic speech commands (SSC) datasets.

the limit as their widths $l_1$ and $l_2$, and the distance between them $r$
shrinks to zero simultaneously. The problem is investigated in one dimension
and the squeezing potential in the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is given by the
strengths $V_1$ and $V_2$ depending on the layer thickness. A whole class of
functions $V_1(l_1)$ and $V_2(l_2)$ is specified by certain limit
characteristics as $l_1$ and $l_2$ tend to zero. The squeezing limit of the
scattering data $a(k)$ and $b(k)$ derived for the finite system is shown to
exist only if some conditions on the system parameters $V_j$, $l_j$, $j=1,2$,
and $r$ take place. These conditions appear as a result of an appropriate
cancellation of divergences. Two ways of this cancellation are carried out and
the corresponding two resonance sets in the system parameter space are derived.
On one of these sets, the existence of non-trivial bound states is proven in
the squeezing limit, including the particular example of the squeezed potential
in the form of the derivative of Dirac's delta function, contrary to the
widespread opinion on the non-existence of bound states in $\delta'$-like
systems. The scenario how a single bound state survives in the squeezed system
from a finite number of bound states in the finite system is described in
detail.

Especially at low photon energies below $1\,\text{keV}$, detectors with high
sensitivity, and consequently low noise and high quantum efficiency, are
required to enable facility users to fully exploit the scientific potential of
the photon source. A 1-Megapixel pnCCD detector with a $1024\times 1024$ pixel
format has been installed and commissioned for imaging applications at the
Nano-Sized Quantum System (NQS) station of the Small Quantum System (SQS)
instrument at EuXFEL. The instrument is currently operating in the energy range
between $0.5$ and $3\,\text{keV}$ and the NQS station is designed for
investigations of the interaction of intense FEL pulses with clusters,
nano-particles and small bio-molecules, by combining photo-ion and
photo-electron spectroscopy with coherent diffraction imaging techniques. The
core of the imaging detector is a pn-type charge coupled device (pnCCD) with a
pixel pitch of $75\,\mu\text{m}\times 75\,\mu\text{m}$. Depending on the
experimental scenario, the pnCCD enables imaging of single photons thanks to
its very low electronic noise of $3$e$^-$ and high quantum efficiency. Here we
present an overview on the EuXFEL pnCCD detector and the results from the
commissioning and first user operation at the SQS experiment in June 2019. The
detailed descriptions of the detector design and capabilities, its
implementation at EuXFEL both mechanically and from the controls side as well
as important data correction steps aim to provide useful background for users
planning and analyzing experiments at EuXFEL and may serve as a benchmark for
comparing and planning future endstations at other FELs.

determines the degree of fluting the flux tube will undergo - the more curved a
flux tube is, the more fluted it becomes. In addition, sunspots with strong
curvature have strong horizontal fields at the surface and therefore readily
form penumbral filaments. The fluted sunspots eventually break up from below,
with lightbridges appearing at the surface several hours after fluting

describe a mid-infrared pump - terahertz-probe setup based on a CO$\mathrm{_2}$

femtosecond seed laser pulses. Variable pulse lengths from 5 ps to 1.3 ns are
achieved, and used in mid-infrared pump, terahertz-probe experiments with probe

bubble collisions compared to that with $\gamma^1$-scaling friction. We also

contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time.
The model clearly shows the effects of contact reductions, school
closures/vacations, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to
indoors in fall. Sensitivity tests show that all ingredients of the model are
necessary to track the current infection dynamics. One interesting result from
the mobility data is that behavioral changes of the population mostly happened

effect. Similarly, people started drifting back to their normal activity
patterns \emph{before} the government officially reduced the contact ban. Our
work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations

investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from

  using multicolour photometry and phase curve analysis","Accepted to A&A","A&A 645, A16 (2021)","10.1051/0004-6361/202038934",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context: We report the discovery of TOI-519 b (TIC 218795833), a transiting
substellar object (R = 1.07 RJup) orbiting a faint M dwarf (V = 17.35) on a
1.26 d orbit. Brown dwarfs and massive planets orbiting M dwarfs on
short-period orbits are rare, but more have already been discovered than
expected from planet formation models. TOI-519 is a valuable addition into this
group of unlikely systems, and adds towards our understanding of the boundaries
of planet formation.
  Aims: We set out to determine the nature of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS ) object of interest TOI-519 b.
  Methods: Our analysis uses a SPOC-pipeline TESS light curve from Sector 7,
multicolour transit photometry observed with MuSCAT2 and MuSCAT, and transit
photometry observed with the LCOGT telescopes. We estimate the radius of the
transiting object using multicolour transit modelling, and set upper limits for
its mass, effective temperature, and Bond albedo using a phase curve model that
includes Doppler boosting, ellipsoidal variations, thermal emission, and
reflected light components.
  Results: TOI-519 b is a substellar object with a radius posterior median of
1.07 RJup and 5th and 95th percentiles of 0.66 and 1.20 RJup, respectively,
where most of the uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the stellar radius.
The phase curve analysis sets an upper effective temperature limit of 1800 K,
an upper Bond albedo limit of 0.49, and a companion mass upper limit of 14
MJup. The companion radius estimate combined with the Teff and mass limits
suggests that the companion is more likely a planet than a brown dwarf, but a
brown-dwarf scenario is more likely a priori given the lack of known massive
planets in 1 day orbits around M dwarfs with Teff < 3800 K, and the existence
of some (but few) brown dwarfs.

already eclipsed (91.53% of the area covered) while the June eclipse, although
also annular in other places of the Arabian Peninsula, was just partial at
Riyadh (area covered 72.80%). This difference apparently affected the observed
response on the recorded variables of temperature, relative humidity (RH) and
vapor pressure (VP) in the two events. Change in these variables went unnoticed
for the first eclipse since it was within the natural variability of the day;
yet for the other, they showed clearly some trend alterations, which we analyze
and discuss. A decrease in temperature of 3.2 {\deg}C was detected in Riyadh;
however, RH and VP showed an oscillation that we explain in the light of a
similar effect reported in other eclipses. We found a time lag of about 15 min
measured from the eclipse central phase in this city. We made an inspection of
related fluctuations and dynamics from the computed rates of the temporal
variation of temperature and RH. Trying to identify the influence of solar
eclipses in similar environments we have made a broad inter-comparison with
other observations of these variables in the Near East, northern Africa and in

effectively the lower atmosphere can respond to a solar eclipse within a desert

avenues for parameter count reduction, performance improvements, or amortizing
training time when changing architectures between the teacher and student

applied to distill teacher policies to students. Until now, policy distillation
required access to a simulator or real world trajectories.
  In this paper we introduce a simulator-free approach to knowledge
distillation in the context of reinforcement learning. A key challenge is
having the student learn the multiplicity of cases that correspond to a given
action. While prior work has shown that data-free knowledge distillation is
possible with supervised learning models by generating synthetic examples,
these approaches to are vulnerable to only producing a single prototype example
for each class. We propose an extension to explicitly handle multiple
observations per output class that seeks to find as many exemplars as possible
for a given output class by reinitializing our data generator and making use of
an adversarial loss.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of
simulator-free knowledge distillation between a teacher and a student policy.
This new approach improves over the state of the art on data-free learning of
student networks on benchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10), and we
also demonstrate that it specifically tackles issues with multiple input modes.
We also identify open problems when distilling agents trained in high

[Fe/H] show systematic differences between thin and thick disk stars with
enhanced O abundance of thick disk stars with respect to thin disk members and
a monotonic decrement of [O/Fe] with increasing metallicity, even at metal-rich

suggesting that this abundance ratio can be a good proxy of stellar ages within

training data perfectly and yet often generalize well. This realization brought
back the study of linear models for regression, including ordinary least
squares (OLS), which, like deep learning, shows a ""double-descent"" behavior:
(1) The risk (expected out-of-sample prediction error) can grow arbitrarily
when the number of parameters $p$ approaches the number of samples $n$, and (2)
the risk decreases with $p$ for $p>n$, sometimes achieving a lower value than
the lowest risk for $p<n$. The divergence of the risk for OLS can be avoided
with regularization. In this work, we show that for some data models it can
also be avoided with a PCA-based dimensionality reduction (PCA-OLS, also known
as principal component regression). We provide non-asymptotic bounds for the
risk of PCA-OLS by considering the alignments of the population and empirical
principal components. We show that dimensionality reduction improves robustness
while OLS is arbitrarily susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly in
the overparameterized regime. We compare PCA-OLS theoretically and empirically
with a wide range of projection-based methods, including random projections,

networks. These comparisons are made for different data generation models to
assess the sensitivity to signal-to-noise and the alignment of regression
coefficients with the features. We find that methods in which the projection
depends on the training data can outperform methods where the projections are
chosen independently of the training data, even those with oracle knowledge of
population quantities, another seemingly paradoxical phenomenon that has been
identified previously. This suggests that overparameterization may not be
necessary for good generalization.

state-of-the-art video localization methods operate atop precomputed video clip

for trimmed action classification tasks, making such features not necessarily
suitable for temporal localization. In this work, we propose a novel supervised
pretraining paradigm for clip features that not only trains to classify
activities but also considers background clips and global video information to
improve temporal sensitivity. Extensive experiments show that using features
trained with our novel pretraining strategy significantly improves the
performance of recent state-of-the-art methods on three tasks: Temporal Action
Localization, Action Proposal Generation, and Dense Video Captioning. We also
show that our pretraining approach is effective across three encoder

is an important building block for localization algorithms, and extracting
temporally-sensitive features should be of paramount importance in building
more accurate models. The code and pretrained models are available on our

dose (MTD) of a drug under a specific schedule. Evaluating drug-schedules aims
at improving treatment safety while maintaining efficacy. However, while we can
reasonably assume that toxicity increases with the dose for cytotoxic drugs,
the relationship between toxicity and multiple schedules remains elusive. We
proposed a Bayesian dose-regimen assessment method (DRtox) using
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) information to estimate the maximum
tolerated dose-regimen (MTD-regimen), at the end of the dose-escalation stage
of a trial to be recommended for the next phase. We modeled the binary toxicity
via a PD endpoint and estimated the dose-regimen toxicity relationship through
the integration of a dose-regimen PD model and a PD toxicity model. For the
dose-regimen PD model, we considered nonlinear mixed-effects models, and for
the PD toxicity model, we proposed the following two Bayesian approaches: a
logistic model and a hierarchical model. We evaluated the operating
characteristics of the DRtox through simulation studies under various
scenarios. The results showed that our method outperforms traditional
model-based designs demonstrating a higher percentage of correctly selecting
the MTD-regimen. Moreover, the inclusion of PK/PD information in the DRtox
helped provide more precise estimates for the entire dose-regimen toxicity
curve; therefore the DRtox may recommend alternative untested regimens for
expansion cohorts. The DRtox should be applied at the end of the
dose-escalation stage of an ongoing trial for patients with relapsed or
refractory acute myeloid leukemia (NCT03594955) once all toxicity and PK/PD

on a timescale of 13-20 ks. Here, we report the analysis of the light curve in
the quiescent state from two XMM observations spanning 18.5 years, along with
the discovery of a possible quasi-periodic X-ray oscillation (QPO) with a
period of ~1500s. The QPO is detected at the same frequency in the two
independent observations, with a combined significance of >99.89%. The QPO is
in agreement with the relation between frequency and black hole mass (M_BH)
that has been reported in previous works for AGNs and Galactic black hole X-ray
binaries (XRBs). The QPO frequency is stable over almost two decades,
suggesting that it may correspond to the high-frequency type found in XRBs and
originates, perhaps, from a certain disk resonance mode. In the 3:2
twin-frequency resonance model, our best estimate on the M_BH range implies
that a maximal black hole spin can be ruled out. We find that all ultrasoft
AGNs reported so far display quasi-periodicities in the X-ray emission,
suggesting a possible link on the part of the extreme variability phenomenon to
the ultrasoft X-ray component. This indicates that ultrasoft AGNs could be the
most promising candidates in future searches for X-ray periodicities.

fire hazards. Hence, it is indispensable to regulate the temperature profile of
the battery modules/packs properly in the battery energy storage during the

proposed for a microgrid with energy storage. In the first layer, an optimal
control model is formed to derive the optimal control policy that minimizes the
control efforts, consisting of the fan speed and battery current magnitude, in
order to achieve a temperature distribution reference over the battery modules.
In the second layer, the system operator of the microgrid performs an optimal
power flow to search for the optimal temperature distribution reference used in
the first stage and the corresponding operating current of the battery that
minimize the operation cost of the entire microgrid system. This two-layer
scheme offers a great computational benefit that allows for large-scale
integration of batteries. A case study is performed on the proposed two-layer

descriptions. This situation makes it difficult to construct multi-instrument
archives/virtual observatories with anything more than the most basic metadata
available for searching, as well as making it difficult to write generic
software for instrument-agnostic data analysis. This document describes the
metadata recommendations developed under the SOLARNET EU project, which aims
foster more collaboration and data sharing between both ground-based and
space-based Solar observatories. The recommendations will be followed by data
pipelines developed under the SOLARNET project as well as e.g. the Solar
Orbiter SPICE pipeline and the SST CHROMIS/CRISP common pipeline. These
recommendations are meant to function as a common reference to which even
existing diverse data sets may be related, for ingestion into solar virtual
observatories and for analysis by generic software.

elements (Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni-Cu-Zn-Se-Mo-I-W, and possibly Li-B-F-Si-V-As). It

arises from the 1. and states: Because of the Universe ageing, life originated
only once. The dust forming planetary system and stars already contained an
excess of L-type amino acids and D-type sugars, therefore, the emerging life on
any planet had to be chiral. Consequently, the 4. hypothesis has been formed:
Chirality is a sine qua non-condition for the emergence of life. The arguments

graph structured data, such as node classification and link prediction.
However, GNNs are often used as a black-box tool and rarely get in-depth
investigated regarding whether they fit certain applications that may have
various properties. A recently proposed technique distance encoding (DE) (Li et
al. 2020) magically makes GNNs work well in many applications, including node
classification and link prediction. The theory provided in (Li et al. 2020)
supports DE by proving that DE improves the representation power of GNNs.
However, it is not obvious how the theory assists the applications accordingly.
Here, we revisit GNNs and DE from a more practical point of view. We want to
explain how DE makes GNNs fit for node classification and link prediction.
Specifically, for link prediction, DE can be viewed as a way to establish
correlations between a pair of node representations. For node classification,
the problem becomes more complicated as different classification tasks may hold
node labels that indicate different physical meanings. We focus on the most
widely-considered node classification scenarios and categorize the node labels
into two types, community type and structure type, and then analyze different
mechanisms that GNNs adopt to predict these two types of labels. We also run
extensive experiments to compare eight different configurations of GNNs paired
with DE to predict node labels over eight real-world graphs. The results
demonstrate the uniform effectiveness of DE to predict structure-type labels.
Lastly, we reach three pieces of conclusions on how to use GNNs and DE properly
in tasks of node classification.

scattering. {\bf Aim:} Our aim is to determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}$ from the
central values of $\sigma_{\rm R}$ for $p$+$^{48}$Ca scattering by using the
folding model. {\bf Results:} As for $^{48}$Ca, we determine $r_n(E1{\rm

overestimates the central values of $\sigma_{\rm R}$ there. In $23 \leq E_{\rm

densities to the central values of $r_p({\rm EXP})$ and $r_n(E1{\rm pE})$. The
$\sigma_{\rm R}(E1{\rm pE})$ obtained with the scaled densities almost
reproduce the central values of $\sigma_{\rm R}$ when $E_{\rm in}=23-25.3$MeV,
so that the $\sigma_{\rm R}({\rm GHFB+AMP})$ and the $\sigma_{\rm R}(E1{\rm

we determine the $r_{m}({\rm EXP})$ from the central values of $\sigma_{\rm R}$

renormalization group (RG). Here, we show that for general systems, without the
self-similarity symmetry required by the RG construction, the RG flow of model
parameters is replaced by a more general flow of the Fisher Information Metric
on the model manifold. We demonstrate that the systems traditionally studied
with RG comprise special cases where this metric flow can be induced by a
parameter flow, keeping the global geometry of the model-manifold fixed. In
general, however, the geometry may deform, and metric flow cannot be reduced to
a parameter flow -- though this could be achieved at the cost of augmenting the
manifold by one new parameter, as we discuss. We hope that our framework can
clarify how ideas from RG may apply in a broader class of complex systems.

  ketamine injection in adult rats",,,"10.1101/859322",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For almost two decades schizophrenia has been considered to be a functional
disconnection disorder. This functional disconnectivity between several brain
regions could have a neurodevelopmental origin. Various approaches suggest the
ventral subiculum (SUB) is a particular target region for neurodevelopemental
disturbances in schizophrenia. It is also commonly acknowledged that there is a
striatal dopaminergic (DA) dysregulation in schizophrenia which may depend on a
subiculo-striatal disconnection involving glutamatergic NMDA receptors. The
present study was designed to investigate, in adult rats, the effects of the
non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine on DA responses in the
ventral striatum, or, more specifically, the core part of the nucleus accumbens
(Nacc), following postnatal functional inactivation of the SUB. Functional
inactivation of the left SUB was carried out by local tetrodotoxin (TTX)
microinjection at postnatal day 8 (PND8), i.e. at a critical point in the
neurodevelopmental period. DA variations were recorded using in vivo
voltammetry in freely moving adult rats (11 weeks). Locomotor activity was
recorded simultaneously with the extracellular levels of DA in the core part of
the Nacc. Data obtained during the present study showed that after
administration of ketamine, the two indexes were higher in TTX animals than PBS
animals, the suggestion being that animals microinjected with TTX in the left
SUB at PND8 present greater reactivity to ketamine than animals microinjected
with PBS. These findings could provide new information regarding the
involvement of NMDA glutamatergic receptors in the core part of the Nacc in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

on how teaching is being delivered. It seems that traditional in class teaching
is becoming less popular with the young generation, the generation that wants
to choose when, where and at what pace they are learning. As such, many
universities are moving towards taking their courses, at least partially,
online. However, online courses, although very appealing to the younger
generation of learners, come at a cost. For example, the dropout rate of such
courses is higher than that of more traditional ones, and the reduced in person
interaction with the teachers results in less timely guidance and intervention
from the educators. Machine learning (ML) based approaches have shown
phenomenal successes in other domains. The existing stigma that applying ML
based techniques requires a large amount of data seems to be a bottleneck when
dealing with small scale courses with limited amounts of produced data. In this
study, we show not only that the data collected from an online learning
management system could be well utilized in order to predict students overall
performance but also that it could be used to propose timely intervention
strategies to boost the students performance level. The results of this study
indicate that effective intervention strategies could be suggested as early as
the middle of the course to change the course of students progress for the
better. We also present an assistive pedagogical tool based on the outcome of
this study, to assist in identifying challenging students and in suggesting
early intervention strategies.

model used within a real ED simulation model to quantify the effect of
detouring a patient out of the ED on the length of stay (LOS) and
door-to-doctor time (DTDT) as a response to the prediction of patient admission
to the hospital from the ED. The ML model trained using a set of six features
including the patient age, arrival day, arrival hour of the day, and the triage
level. The prediction model used a decision tree (DT) model, which is trained
using historical data achieves a 75% accuracy. The set of rules extracted from
the DT are coded within the simulation model. Given a certain probability of
free inpatient beds, the predicted admitted patient is then pulled out from the
ED to inpatient units to alleviate the crowding within the ED. The used policy
combined with adding specific ED resources achieve 9.39% and 8.18% reduction in
LOS and DTDT, respectively.

known universe. We can understand language of rich descriptive power, and
communicate in the same environment with astonishing clarity. Two of the many
contributors to the interest in natural language - the properties of
Compositionality and Structure Dependence, are well documented, and offer a
vast space to ask interesting modelling questions. The first step to begin
answering these questions is to ground verbal theory in formal terms. Drawing
on linguistics and set theory, a formalisation of these ideas is presented in
the first half of this thesis. We see how cognitive systems that process
language need to have certain functional constraints, viz. time based,
incremental operations that rely on a structurally defined domain. The
observations that result from analysing this formal setup are examined as part
of a modelling exercise. Using the advances of word embedding techniques, a
model of relational learning is simulated with a custom dataset to demonstrate
how a time based role-filler binding mechanism satisfies some of the
constraints described in the first section. The model's ability to map
structure, along with its symbolic-connectionist architecture makes for a
cognitively plausible implementation. The formalisation and simulation are
together an attempt to recognise the constraints imposed by linguistic theory,
and explore the opportunities presented by a cognitive model of relation
learning to realise these constraints.

a tunable-by-design optical bandwidth and we exploit it to compensate the
cavity dispersion of a quantum cascade laser (QCL). Electrostatic gating is
achieved by a metal-grating used as a gate electrode, with an HfO2/AlOx gate
dielectric on top. This is patterned on a polyimide layer, which acts as a
quarter wave resonance cavity, coupled with an Au reflector underneath. We get
90% modulation depth of the intensity, combined with a 20 kHz electrical
bandwidth in the 1.9 _ 2.7 THz range. We then integrate our modulator with a
multimode THz QCL. By adjusting the modulator operational bandwidth, we
demonstrate that the graphene modulator can partially compensates the QCL
cavity dispersion, resulting in an integrated laser behaving as a stable
frequency comb over 35% of the laser operational range, with 98 equidistant
optical modes and with a spectral coverage of ~ 1.2 THz. This has significant
potential for frontier applications in the terahertz, as tunable
transformation-optics devices, active photonic components, adaptive and quantum
optics, and as a metrological tool for spectroscopy at THz frequencies.
