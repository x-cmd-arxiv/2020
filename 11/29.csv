in assisting medical professionals to evaluate disease progresses and make fast
therapeutic schedules. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have
widely applied to this task, the accuracy of these models still need to be
further improved mainly due to their limited ability to 3D context perception.
In this paper, we propose the 3D context residual network (ConResNet) for the
accurate segmentation of 3D medical images. This model consists of an encoder,
a segmentation decoder, and a context residual decoder. We design the context
residual module and use it to bridge both decoders at each scale. Each context
residual module contains both context residual mapping and context attention
mapping, the formal aims to explicitly learn the inter-slice context
information and the latter uses such context as a kind of attention to boost
the segmentation accuracy. We evaluated this model on the MICCAI 2018 Brain
Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset and NIH Pancreas Segmentation (Pancreas-CT)
dataset. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 3D
context residual learning scheme but also indicate that the proposed ConResNet
is more accurate than six top-ranking methods in brain tumor segmentation and
seven top-ranking methods in pancreas segmentation. Code is available at

  high-density phases",,,,,"math-ph math.MP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study dense packings of disks and related Gibbs distributions representing
high-density phases in the hard-core model on unit triangular, honeycomb and
square lattices. The model is characterized by a Euclidean exclusion distance
$D>0$ and a value of fugacity $u>0$. We use the Pirogov-Sinai theory to study
the Gibbs distributions for a general $D$ when $u$ is large: $u>u_0(D)$. For
infinite sequences of values $D$ we describe a complete high-density phase
diagram: it exhibits a multitude of co-existing pure phases, and their number
grows as $O(D^2)$. For the remaining values of $D$, except for those with
sliding, the number of co-existing pure phases is still of the form $E(D)\geq
O(D^2)$; however, the exact identification of the pure phases requires an
additional analysis. Such an analysis is performed for a number of typical
examples, which involves computer-assisted proofs. Consequently, for all values
$D>0$ where sliding does not occur, we establish the existence of a phase
transition.
  The crucial steps in the study are (i) the identification of periodic ground
states and (ii) the verification of the Peierls bound. This is done by using
connections with algebraic number theory. In particular, a complete list of
so-called sliding values of $D$ has been specified. As a by-product, we solve
the disk-packing problem on the lattices under consideration. The number and
structure of maximally-dense packings depend on the disk-diameter $D$, unlike
the case of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

signal contain valuable information about the Epoch of Reionization. We present
3PCF-Fast, an optimised code for estimating the three-point correlation
function of 3D pixelised data such as the outputs from numerical and
semi-numerical simulations. After testing 3PCF-Fast on data with known analytic
three-point correlation function, we use machine learning techniques to recover
the mean bubble size and global ionisation fraction from correlations in the
outputs of the publicly available 21cmFAST code. We assume that foregrounds
have been perfectly removed and negligible instrumental noise. Using ionisation
fraction data, our best MLP model recovers the mean bubble size with a median
prediction error of around 10%, or from the 21cm differential brightness
temperature with median prediction error of around 14%. A further two MLP
models recover the global ionisation fraction with median prediction errors of
around 4% (using ionisation fraction data) or around 16% (using brightness
temperature). Our results indicate that clustering in both the ionisation
fraction field and the brightness temperature field encode useful information
about the progress of the Epoch of Reionization in a complementary way to other
summary statistics. Using clustering would be particularly useful in regimes
where high signal-to-noise ratio prevents direct measurement of bubble size
statistics. We compare the quality of MLP models using the power spectrum, and
find that using the three-point correlation function outperforms the power
spectrum at predicting both global ionisation fraction and mean bubble size.

the defect state density and orbital localization of hydrogenated amorphous Si
(a-Si:H)/crystalline Si (c-Si) heterostructures using density functional theory
(DFT) studies of model interfaces between amorphous silicon (a- Si)/a-Si:H and
c-Si. To model the atomic configuration of a-Si on c-Si, melting and quenching
simulations were performed using classical molecular dynamics (MD). Different
hydrogen contents were inserted into the a-Si in different bonding
configurations followed by DFT relaxation to create the stable structures of
a-Si:H representative of hydrogenated a-Si on crystalline Si surfaces. In
contrast to crystalline heterojunctions (where the interface density is a
maximum at the interface), we find that, in the most energetically stable
configurations of H atoms, the defect state density is relatively low at the
interface and maximum at the middle of a-Si layer. Our structural analysis
shows that in these configurations, H atoms do not necessarily bond to dangling
bonds or to interface atoms. However, they are able to significantly change the
atomic structure of the heterostructure and consequently decrease the density
of defect states and orbital localization at the a-Si layer and more
significantly at the interface of a-Si/c-Si. The general form of the modeled
defect state distribution demonstrates the passivating role of a-Si:H on c-Si
substrates.

requires a large number of pixel-level annotations. However, large-scale and
fully labeled medical datasets are often unavailable for practical tasks.
Recently, partially supervised methods have been proposed to utilize images
with incomplete labels in the medical domain. To bridge the methodological gaps
in partially supervised learning (PSL) under data scarcity, we propose Vicinal
Labels Under Uncertainty (VLUU), a simple yet efficient framework utilizing the
human structure similarity for partially supervised medical image segmentation.
Motivated by multi-task learning and vicinal risk minimization, VLUU transforms
the partially supervised problem into a fully supervised problem by generating
vicinal labels. We systematically evaluate VLUU under the challenges of
small-scale data, dataset shift, and class imbalance on two commonly used
segmentation datasets for the tasks of chest organ segmentation and optic
disc-and-cup segmentation. The experimental results show that VLUU can
consistently outperform previous partially supervised models in these settings.
Our research suggests a new research direction in label-efficient deep learning
with partial supervision.

crypto-assets in trustless environments - have become popular with the spread
of blockchain technologies. A landmark security property of smart contracts is
liquidity: in a non-liquid contract, it may happen that some assets remain
frozen, i.e. not redeemable by anyone. The relevance of this issue is witnessed
by recent liquidity attacks to Ethereum, which have frozen hundreds of USD
millions. We address the problem of verifying liquidity on BitML, a DSL for
smart contracts with a secure compiler to Bitcoin, featuring primitives for
currency transfers, contract renegotiation and consensual recursion. Our main
result is a verification technique for liquidity. We first transform the
infinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on
the behaviour of a chosen set of contracts, abstracting from the moves of the
context. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound, i.e.
if the abstracted contract is liquid, then also the concrete one is such. We
then verify liquidity by model-checking the finite-state abstraction. We
implement a toolchain that automatically verifies liquidity of BitML contracts
and compiles them to Bitcoin, and we assess it through a benchmark of
representative contracts.

micro-stamp, which combines both outstanding adhesion and softness. It permits
the dry pick-up of naked 2D crystals (graphene, MoS$_2$, and hBN) directly from
a SiO$_2$ substrate, and to precisely transfer them on substrates or trenches.
Optical and Raman data show that no significant defect is introduced upon
transfer, even in suspended SLG and BLG. The areas transferred range up $\sim$
1000 $\mu$m$^2$ on substrate. High-yield transfer of suspended ultra-thin 2DM
does not require critical point drying for areas up to 15 $\mu$m$^2$ or
suspension heights down to 160 nm. To demonstrate the method's capabilities, we
assembled on-substrate and suspended optical cavities tuning BLG's Raman
scattering intensity by factors of 19 and 4, respectively. This resilient and

the potential to disentangle the possible effects of strangeness, isospin, or
mass. These results can constrain the twist-3 trigluon collinear correlation

one of the most challenges. The traction-separation relations (TSR)
quantitatively describe the mechanical behavior of a material interface
undergoing openings, which is critical to understand and predict interfacial
failures under complex loadings. However, existing theoretical models have
limitations on enough complexity and flexibility to well learn the real-world
TSR from experimental observations. A neural network can fit well along with
the loading paths but often fails to obey the laws of physics, due to a lack of
experimental data and understanding of the hidden physical mechanism. In this
paper, we propose a thermodynamic consistent neural network (TCNN) approach to
build a data-driven model of the TSR with sparse experimental data. The TCNN
leverages recent advances in physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that
encode prior physical information into the loss function and efficiently train
the neural networks using automatic differentiation. We investigate three
thermodynamic consistent principles, i.e., positive energy dissipation,
steepest energy dissipation gradient, and energy conservative loading path. All
of them are mathematically formulated and embedded into a neural network model
with a novel defined loss function. A real-world experiment demonstrates the
superior performance of TCNN, and we find that TCNN provides an accurate
prediction of the whole TSR surface and significantly reduces the violated
prediction against the laws of physics.

for designing novel structures, materials, and devices. Two computational
challenges have limited the applicability of TO to a variety of industrial
applications. First, a TO problem often involves a large number of design
variables to guarantee sufficient expressive power. Second, many TO problems
require a large number of expensive physical model simulations, and those
simulations cannot be parallelized. To address these issues, we propose a
general scalable deep-learning (DL) based TO framework, referred to as SDL-TO,
which utilizes parallel schemes in high performance computing (HPC) to
accelerate the TO process for designing additively manufactured (AM) materials.
Unlike the existing studies of DL for TO, our framework accelerates TO by
learning the iterative history data and simultaneously training on the mapping
between the given design and its gradient. The surrogate gradient is learned by
utilizing parallel computing on multiple CPUs incorporated with a distributed
DL training on multiple GPUs. The learned TO gradient enables a fast online
update scheme instead of an expensive update based on the physical simulator or
solver. Using a local sampling strategy, we achieve to reduce the intrinsic
high dimensionality of the design space and improve the training accuracy and
the scalability of the SDL-TO framework. The method is demonstrated by
benchmark examples and AM materials design for heat conduction. The proposed
SDL-TO framework shows competitive performance compared to the baseline methods
but significantly reduces the computational cost by a speed up of around 8.6x
over the standard TO implementation.

source, the output spectrum can be continuously tuned up to 1.67 {\mu}m (pump
at 1.04 {\mu}m) or 1.95 {\mu}m (pump at 1.55 {\mu}m) in the same 1.5 m-long

fiber is highly birefringent, which results in an excellent polarization

fundamental in recent development of approximation and computational analysis
on the unit sphere, unit ball and several other regular domains. In this work
we first study homogeneous spaces that are assumed to contain highly localized
kernels and establish a framework for approximation and localized tight frame
in such spaces, which extends recent works on bounded regular domains. We then
show that the framework is applicable to homogeneous spaces defined on bounded
conic domains, which consists of conic surfaces and the solid domains bounded
by such surfaces and hyperplanes.
  The main results provide a construction of semi-discrete localized tight
frame in weighted $L^2$ norm and a characterization of best approximation by
polynomials on conic domains. The latter is achieved by using a $K$-functional,
defined via the differential operator that has orthogonal polynomials as
eigenfunctions, as well as a modulus of smoothness defined via a multiplier
operator that is equivalent to the $K$-functional. Several intermediate results
are of interest in their own right, including the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund
inequalities, positive cubature rules, Christoeffel functions, and several
Bernstein type inequalities. Moreover, although the highly localizable kernels
hold only for special families of weight functions on each domain, many
intermediate results are shown to hold for doubling weights defined via the
intrinsic distance on the domain.

propose a safe semi-supervised estimator. We view it safe, because this
estimator is always at least as good as the supervised estimators. We also

Cauchy's integral formula for the n-th order pole expressing the (n-1)-st

Cauchy-Fueter kernel for n-regular functions in terms of certain basis

polygrain-like meta-crystals fabricated from Ti6Al4V by laser powder bed
fusion. The mechanical behaviour of Ti6Al4V meta-crystals is governed by
lattice structures across length-scales: the crystalline microstructure,
architected crystal-like mesostructures and the quality of lattice struts. Due
to the intricate architecture, significant processing defects were seen in the
printed meta-crystals, in particular notch-like defects due to lack of fusion
at the free surface of struts. Such defects raised stress concentration and
reduced the load-bearing area of struts, hence significantly weakening the
lattice struts. In addition, the as-printed condition was brittle due to the
presence of acicular alpha' martensites. The defects and the as-printed
brittleness led to the premature fracture of struts and compromised the
benefits of the crystal-inspired mesostructures. The study subsequently
conducted multiple measures to resolve this issue: increasing the strut
diameter to reduce the influence of the process defects, and annealing to
relieve internal stresses and regain ductility. The combination of the increase
in strut diameter and annealing successfully enabled the crystal-like

gripper geometry under different grasp poses (i.e., translations and

propose curvature regularization, to enforce flatness for embedding manifolds,
thereby preventing the distortion. We present a novel angle-based sectional

transfer system are investigated. At high coupling, the frequency-splitting
phenomenon occurs, in which the power transferred to the load attains its
maximum at two frequencies away from the resonance frequency. However, this
behavior is not a universal property; there exist certain regions of resonator
intrinsic parameters in which it is not present for any coupling strength.
Therefore, in order to suppress such a phenomenon, there is no need to
constrain the coupling of the transmitter and receiver below a certain level as
widely reported in the literature. For low-power applications, optimizing the
received power is essential. We derive a rigorous asymptotic upper bound for
the power that can be delivered to an arbitrary load from a generic source. Our
results quantitatively reveal the direct impacts of the unloaded $Q-$factors of
the two resonators and the coupling between them on the actual output power. We
discuss that, in contrast to the often employed operating power gain, the
transducer power gain constitutes a more suitable metric to optimize system
efficiency. Once the transferred power reaches its physical bound, the two
gains collapse to a unique global optimal solution.

Specifically, we consider the case where the true regression function is

lie in a Lipschitz smoothness class. Such a monotonicity condition is natural
in many empirical contexts, and the Lipschitz constant has an intuitive
interpretation. We propose a minimax two-sided confidence interval (CI) and an
adaptive one-sided CI. For the two-sided CI, the researcher is required to
choose a Lipschitz constant where she believes the true regression function to
lie in. This is the only tuning parameter, and the resulting CI has uniform
coverage and obtains the minimax optimal length. The one-sided CI can be
constructed to maintain coverage over all monotone functions, providing maximum
credibility in terms of the choice of the Lipschitz constant. Moreover, the
monotonicity makes it possible for the (excess) length of the CI to adapt to
the true Lipschitz constant of the unknown regression function. Overall, the
proposed procedures make it easy to see under what conditions on the underlying
regression function the given estimates are significant, which can add more

that automatically determines the parameters controlling the smoothness of
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method significantly reduces the effort of
parameter tuning, which is time and labor-consuming. To achieve the goal, we
develop a predictive model based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)
that learns the mapping between pairwise images and the regularization
parameter of image registration. In contrast to previous methods that estimate
such parameters in a high-dimensional image space, our model is built in an
efficient bandlimited space with much lower dimensions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model on both 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain images.
Experimental results show that our model not only predicts appropriate
regularization parameters for image registration, but also improving the
network training in terms of time and memory efficiency.

Such tasks include disease diagnosis, clinical trial recruitment, and

propose a supervised contrastive learning framework, CROCS, where
representations of cardiac signals associated with a set of patient-specific

embeddings entitled clinical prototypes. We exploit such prototypes for both
the clustering and retrieval of unlabelled cardiac signals based on multiple
patient attributes. We show that CROCS outperforms the state-of-the-art method,
DTC, when clustering and also retrieves relevant cardiac signals from a large

  Resilience"" Springer (in press)",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains,
as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections.
Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain
publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting
modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that
models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on
individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy
necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency
settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain
resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely
qualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further,
publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific
supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as
transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine
production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major
gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of
real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We
conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that
encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical
networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale
COVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic
underscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a
multi-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into
analysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover,
adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.

allocating new hospital beds over time and across a number of geographical

finite-dimensional real $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded algebras where every nonzero
homogeneous element is invertible. He found that besides $\mathbb{R}$,
$\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{H}$, which give purely even super division algebras,
there are seven more. He also showed that these ten algebras are all real or
complex Clifford algebras. The eight real ones represent all eight Morita
equivalence classes of real Clifford algebras, and the two complex ones do the
same for the complex Clifford algebras. The tenfold way thus unites real and
complex Bott periodicity. In this expository article we give a quick proof that
there are ten real super division algebras, and say a bit about applications of

circumvents the need to re-run computationally costly estimation methods for

conditioning on the variance-covariance parameters, we shift the CV problem
from probability-based sampling to a simple and familiar optimization problem.
In many cases, this produces estimates which are equivalent to full CV. We
provide theoretical results and demonstrate its efficacy on publicly available

Lagrangian-to-Eulerian conversion is indispensable for the GFM finite
difference discretization. In this paper, an Eulerian Solvent Excluded Surface
(ESES) is implemented to replace the MSMS for defining the dielectric
interface. The electrostatic analysis shows that the ESES free energy is more
accurate than that of the MSMS, while being free of instability issues.
Moreover, this work explores, for the first time in the PBE literature,
adaptive time integration techniques for the pseudo-transient simulations. A
major finding is that the time increment $\Delta t$ should become smaller as
the time increases, in order to maintain the temporal accuracy. This is
opposite to the common practice for the steady state convergence, and is
believed to be due to the PBE nonlinearity and its time splitting treatment.
Effective adaptive schemes have been constructed so that the pseudo-time GFM
methods become more efficient than the constant $\Delta t$ ones.

of the tertiary orbiting star. If the tertiary is a pulsar, high precision and
cadence observations of its arrival time enable an unambiguous characterization
of the pulsar -- BBH triples located at several kpc, which are inaccessible

$P_\mathrm{out}=100$ days. If the relativistic time delays are measured as
well, one can determine basically all the orbital parameters of the triple. For
instance, this method is applicable to inner BBHs of down to $\sim 1$ hr
orbital periods if the orbital period of the tertiary pulsar is around several
days. Inner BBHs with $\lesssim 1$ hr orbital period emit the GW detectable by
future space-based GW missions including LISA, DECIGO, and BBO, and very short

such random CSPs, it was verified \cite{ssz16} that its free energy is
well-defined and the explicit value follows the 1RSB prediction. However, for
any model of sparse random CSP, it has been unknown whether the solution space
indeed condensates on O(1) clusters according to the 1RSB prediction. In this
paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question for the random regular

that the overlap between two independently drawn solutions concentrates

maximum/minimum load and average load within each low-resolution sampling
interval of smart meters; a Markov chain model is employed to characterize the
transition probability of known high-resolution load. Next, the trained models
are used as teachers for the transformers with only smart meters to decompose
known low-resolution load data into targeted high-resolution load data. The
enriched data can recover instantaneous load uncertainty and significantly
enhance distribution system observability and situational awareness. We have
verified the proposed approach using real high- and low-resolution load data.

Although several works are proposed to jointly train these two tasks using some
small modifications, like changing the last layer, the result of one task is
not utilized to improve the performance of the other one despite that there are
some similarities between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose multi-task
generative adversarial networks (Multi-task GANs), which are not only competent
in semantic segmentation and depth completion, but also improve the accuracy of
depth completion through generated semantic images. In addition, we improve the
details of generated semantic images based on CycleGAN by introducing
multi-scale spatial pooling blocks and the structural similarity reconstruction
loss. Furthermore, considering the inner consistency between semantic and
geometric structures, we develop a semantic-guided smoothness loss to improve
depth completion results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes dataset and KITTI

achieving competitive performance for both semantic segmentation and depth

recent development in this strand of work: the Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure

BB-SSL turns fast optimization into approximate posterior sampling. Beyond its

represented by adjacency lists as input. Our algorithms make degree and
neighbor queries to the input graph and work with a specified fraction of
adversarial erasures in adjacency entries. We focus on two computational tasks:
testing if a graph is connected or $\varepsilon$-far from connected and
estimating the average degree. For testing connectedness, we discover a
threshold phenomenon: when the fraction of erasures is less than $\varepsilon$,
this property can be tested efficiently (in time independent of the size of the
graph); when the fraction of erasures is at least $\varepsilon,$ then a number
of queries linear in the size of the graph representation is required. Our
erasure-resilient algorithm (for the special case with no erasures) is an
improvement over the previously known algorithm for connectedness in the
standard property testing model and has optimal dependence on the proximity
parameter $\varepsilon$. For estimating the average degree, our results provide
an ""interpolation"" between the query complexity for this computational task in
the model with no erasures in two different settings: with only degree queries,
investigated by Feige (SIAM J. Comput. `06), and with degree queries and
neighbor queries, investigated by Goldreich and Ron (Random Struct. Algorithms
`08) and Eden et al. (ICALP `17). We conclude with a discussion of our model
and open questions raised by our work.

constraints from the neutrino oscillation experiments compared to collider
studies. We then provide a bottom-up study on individual dimension-6 SMEFT
operators and find NSIs in neutrino experiments already sensitive to new
physics at $\sim$20 TeV when the Wilson coefficients are fixed at unity. We
also investigate the correlation among multiple operators at the UV scale and
find it could change the constraints on SMEFT operators by several orders of
magnitude compared with when only one operator is considered. Furthermore, we
find that accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments are sensitive to
different SMEFT operators, which highlights the complementarity of the two

approximate metric space for the manifold of diffeomorphisms $\mathcal{G}$. We
propose a method to break down the large deformation into finite compositions
of small deformations. This results in a broken geodesic path on $\mathcal{G}$
and its length now forms an approximate registration metric. We illustrate the
method using a simple, intensity-based, log-demon implementation. Validation
results of the proposed method show that it can capture large and complex

the NEQ results. The signals are generated from line spread profiles by
progressively removing their lower frequency components and the resulting high
frequency residues (HFRs) form the set of signals to be used in detectability
studies. Detectability indexes for these HFRs are obtained using a
non-prewhitening (NPW) observer and a series of edge images are used to obtain
the HFRs, the covariance matrices required by the NPW model and the MTF and NPS
used in NEQ calculations. The template used in the model is obtained by
simulating the processes of blurring and sampling of the edge images.
Comparison between detectability indexes for the HFRs and NEQ are carried out
for different acquisition techniques using different beam qualities and doses.
The relative sensitivity shown by detectability indexes using HFRs is higher
than that of NEQ, especially at lower doses. Also, the different observers
produce different results at high doses: while the ideal Bayesian observer used
by NEQ distinguishes between beam qualities, the NPW used with the HFRs
produces no differences between them. Delta functions used in HFR are the
opposite of complex exponential functions in terms of their support in the
spatial and frequency domains. Since NEQ can be interpreted as detectability of
these complex exponential functions, detectability of HFRs is presented as a
natural complement to NEQ in the performance assessment of an imaging system.

spatial power dividing platforms such as reflection-only performance, operating
at normal incidence, and small reflection/refraction angles have been totally
relaxed. A modal expansion analysis based on Floquet-Bloch (FB) theorem is
established so that a discrete set of spatial harmonics is considered in both
reflection and transmission sides of a compound metallic grating in which the
unknown coefficients are calculated by applying proper boundary conditions. By
eliminating the unwanted scattering harmonics, the proposed metagrating has the
ability to realize different functionalities from perfect anomalous refraction
to reflection-transmission spatial power dividing, without resorting to
full-wave numerical optimizations. The numerical simulations confirm well the
theoretical predictions. Our findings not only offer possibilities to realize
arbitrary spatial power dividers but also reveal a simple alternative for
beamforming array antennas.

tensor, which captures fundamental information about quantum states and
contains both the quantum metric tensor and the curvature of the Berry

geometric tensor in the framework of the phase space or Wigner function
formalism. This formulation is obtained through the direct application of the
Weyl correspondence to the geometric structure under consideration. In
particular, we show that the quantum metric tensor can be computed using only
the Wigner functions, which opens an alternative way to experimentally measure
the components of this tensor. We also address the non-Abelian generalization
and obtain the phase space formulation of the Wilczek-Zee connection and the
non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor. In this case, the non-Abelian quantum
metric tensor involves only the non-diagonal Wigner functions. Then, we verify
our approach with examples and apply it to a system of $N$ coupled harmonic
oscillators, showing that the associated Berry connection vanishes and
obtaining the analytic expression for the quantum metric tensor. Our results
indicate that the developed approach is well adapted to study the parameter

attention in computer vision. Among the approaches for few-shot learning, due
to the simplicity and effectiveness, metric-based methods are favorably
state-of-the-art on many tasks. Most of the metric-based methods assume a
single similarity measure and thus obtain a single feature space. However, if
samples can simultaneously be well classified via two distinct similarity
measures, the samples within a class can distribute more compactly in a smaller
feature space, producing more discriminative feature maps. Motivated by this,
we propose a so-called \textit{Bi-Similarity Network} (\textit{BSNet}) that
consists of a single embedding module and a bi-similarity module of two
similarity measures. After the support images and the query images pass through
the convolution-based embedding module, the bi-similarity module learns feature
maps according to two similarity measures of diverse characteristics. In this
way, the model is enabled to learn more discriminative and less
similarity-biased features from few shots of fine-grained images, such that the
model generalization ability can be significantly improved. Through extensive
experiments by slightly modifying established metric/similarity based networks,
we show that the proposed approach produces a substantial improvement on
several fine-grained image benchmark datasets. Codes are available at:

employs a more practically checkable stopping condition for solving the

solving the capacity constrained multi-marginal optimal transport (CMOT)
problem (a special case of our LP problem), our iEPPA is able to bypass the
underlying numerical instability issues that often appear in the popular
entropic regularization approach, since our algorithm does not require the
proximal parameter to be very small in order to obtain an accurate approximate

robust for solving large-scale CMOT problems. The experiments on the discrete

Community. They have been shown to have wide ranging implications , like
Constraints on Inflationary Models, Primordial Black Holes etc. to name a few.
A particularly revealing insight on dark energy also shows that one can have
the dark energy equation of state for a quintessence scenario to be
signficantly different than -1 after one takes into account the refined dS
conjecture. Another interesting issue with the swampland conjectures is that
they have been shown to be incompatible with single field inflationary models
in GR based cosmology. In our previous work we have, however, showed that
single field inflationary models are quite compatible with swampland
conjectures in their usual string theoretic form in a large class of modified
cosmological scenarios. Building on that work, we now show that in modified
cosmological scenarios where the early universe expansion was driven by single
field inflation , one can have the dark energy equation of state to be
significantly different from -1 even if we just take into account the original
dS conjecture, let alone the refined form of that. We thereby show that one
does not need to apply a step function approach towards inflation in order to
have an observable distinction between constant and non constant dark energy
models in the context of the swampland conjectures.

RUL-constrained optimal power flow framework to characterize the corresponding
optimal feasible operation space. The targeted service lifespan is achieved if
the battery's working condition is confined within this feasible domain.
Equivalent box constraints are then constructed for better computational
efficiency in solving the optimization problem. In this framework, a Monte
Carlo-based data-driven approach and a health indicator (HI) representing the
battery's current states are introduced. The performance of the proposed method
is illustrated with the IEEE 39-bus system.

charm-baryon-to-meson ratio observed in high-energy $pp$ collisions can be
explained by canonical treatment of quantum charges in the statistical
hadronization model (SHM). Taking the full particle listings of PDG
complemented by additional charm-baryon states from relativistic quark model
predictions, we evaluate the canonical partition function and the charm-hadron
chemical factors that measure the canonical suppression arising from the
requirement of strict conservation of quantum charges. We demonstrate that,
while charm number conservation induces common suppression on the production of
both charm-baryons and -mesons, baryon (strangeness) number conservation causes
further suppression on charm-baryons (charm-strange mesons) relative to
nonstrange charm-mesons, thereby resulting in a decreasing $\Lambda_c/D^0$
($D_s/D^0$) ratio toward smaller multiplicity events. The charm-hadron thermal
densities thus computed are then used as pertinent weights to perform
charm-quark fragmentation simulations yielding $p_T$-dependent $\Lambda_c/D^0$
and $D_s/D^0$ ratios at varying multiplicities in fair agreement with ALICE
measurements.

problem that predicts a class tag for a word or a NE candidate in a sentence.
In shallow structures, categorized features are weighted to support the
prediction. Recent developments in neural networks have adopted deep structures
that map categorized features into continuous representations. This approach
unfolds a dense space saturated with high-order abstract semantic information,
where the prediction is based on distributed feature representations. In this
paper, positions of NEs in a sentence are represented as continuous values.
Then, a regression operation is introduced to regress boundaries of NEs in a
sentence. Based on boundary regression, we design a boundary regression model
to support nested NE recognition. It is a multiobjective learning framework,
which simultaneously predicts the classification score of a NE candidate and
refine its spatial location in a sentence. It has the advantage to resolve
nested NEs and support boundary regression for locating NEs in a sntence. By
sharing parameters for predicting and locating, this model enables more potent
nonlinear function approximators to enhance model discriminability. Experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for nested NE recognition\footnote{Our

  In this paper, we model the author disambiguation as a collaboration network
reconstruction problem, and propose an incremental and unsupervised author
disambiguation method, namely IUAD, which performs in a bottom-up manner.
Initially, we build a stable collaboration network based on stable
collaborative relations. To further improve the recall, we build a
probabilistic generative model to reconstruct the complete collaboration
network. In addition, for newly published papers, we can incrementally judge
who publish them via only computing the posterior probabilities. We have
conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale DBLP dataset to evaluate IUAD.

Hubbard model with a crystalline field splitting in the strong coupling limit.
In this model, the competition between the crystalline field and electron
correlations brings about an excitonic insulating state, where the two orbitals
are spontaneously hybridized. Using the generalized spin-wave theory and
Boltzmann transport equation, we find that a spin current generated by a
thermal gradient is observed in the excitonic insulating state without magnetic
fields. The spin Seebeck effect originates from spin-split collective
excitation modes although the ground state does not exhibit any magnetic
orderings. This peculiar phenomenon is inherent in the excitonic insulating
state, whose order parameter is time-reversal odd and yields a spin splitting
for the collective excitation modes. We also find that the spin current is
strongly enhanced and its direction is inverted in the vicinity of the phase
transition to another magnetically ordered phase. We suggest that the present
phenomenon is possibly observed in perovskite cobaltites with the
GdFeO$_3$-type lattice distortion.

quantum wells is usually considered to be determined by the band profile of a
heterostructure. In the GaAs/AlGaAs type heterosystems, this interaction
consists of the isotropic Bychkov-Rashba term, which is absent in symmetric
wells, and the anisotropic Dresselhaus term, reflecting the lattice symmetry.
It is well-known that the first term can be controlled by electric fields in
the growth direction: external or internal, induced by a charge density of 2D
electrons. In this work we reveal that the 2D electron charge can substantially
affect also the Dresselhaus interaction in symmetric quantum wells. Within the
one-band electron Hamiltonian containing, together with the bulk Dresselhaus
interaction, the two contributions to the Dresselhaus term from the quantum
well interfaces, we show that the internal electric field from the 2D electron

interaction of 2D electrons. This effect may be important in quantitative
studies of spin-dependent phenomena in quantum wells.

motion, arising from the coupling of a rotation and a harmonic vibration.
Recently, a number of wobbling bands were reported at low spin, which violate
the wobbling approximation that can be valid only at high spin. Here we explore
the nature of the reported low-spin wobbling bands. Via a new experiment, we
demonstrate that one such band in $^{187}$Au is generated by dominant
single-particle excitation rather than by the excitation of a wobbling phonon.
We point out that the imperfect research paradigm used previously would lead to
unreliable identification of low-spin wobbling bands. Consequently, new

filter pruning and weight pruning, the compact model obtained by layer pruning
has less inference time and run-time memory usage when the same FLOPs and
number of parameters are pruned because of less data moving in memory. In this
paper, we propose a simple layer pruning method using fusible residual
convolutional block (ResConv), which is implemented by inserting shortcut
connection with a trainable information control parameter into a single
convolutional layer. Using ResConv structures in training can improve network
accuracy and train deep plain networks, and adds no additional computation
during inference process because ResConv is fused to be an ordinary
convolutional layer after training. For layer pruning, we convert convolutional
layers of network into ResConv with a layer scaling factor. In the training
process, the L1 regularization is adopted to make the scaling factors sparse,
so that unimportant layers are automatically identified and then removed,
resulting in a model of layer reduction. Our pruning method achieves excellent
performance of compression and acceleration over the state-of-the-arts on
different datasets, and needs no retraining in the case of low pruning rate.
For example, with ResNet-110, we achieve a 65.5%-FLOPs reduction by removing
55.5% of the parameters, with only a small loss of 0.13% in top-1 accuracy on
CIFAR-10.

approaches have been proposed to address this task, but almost all of them
emphasized on using the latent (global) feature representations from
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), resulting in severe loss of
spatial information, thus failing to model the geometry of the underlying 3D
objects, that plays an important role in remote sensing 3D scenes. In this
letter, we have proposed an alternative approach to overcome the limitations of
CNN based approaches by encoding the spatial features of raw 3D point clouds
into undirected symmetrical graph models. These encodings are then combined
with a high-dimensional feature vector extracted from a traditional CNN into a
localized graph convolution operator that outputs the required 3D segmentation
map. We have performed experiments on two standard benchmark datasets
(including an outdoor aerial remote sensing dataset and an indoor synthetic
dataset). The proposed method achieves on par state-of-the-art accuracy with
improved training time and model stability thus indicating strong potential for
further research towards a generalized state-of-the-art method for 3D scene

the direction of studying such enumerative questions for other consecutive
patterns (descents being the consecutive pattern $21$). Zhu studied this
question for the consecutive pattern $321$. We continue this line of work by
studying the case of any consecutive pattern of the form $k,k-1,\ldots,1$,

determining the asymptotic number of permutations with a certain $k$-descent
set to computing an explicit integral. We also prove an equidistribution
theorem, showing that any two sparse $k$-descent sets are equally likely.
  Counting the number of $k$-descent-avoiding permutations while conditioning
on the length $n$ and first element $m$ simultaneously, one obtains a number
triangle $f_k(m,n)$ with some useful properties. For $k=3$, the $m=1$ and $m=n$

numerical simulations on the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for $\sim
20-40~M_\odot$ progenitor stars with differently initial explosion energies. As
a result, the lower explosion energy naturally causes more efficient fallback
accretion for low-metallicity progenitors, and then the newborn black holes
(BHs) in the center of the CCSNe can escape from the gap, but neutron stars
cannot easily collapse into BHs in the gap; nevertheless, the final remnants of
the solar-metallicity progenitors stick to the gap. If we consider that only
drastic CCSNe can be observed and that those with lower explosion energies are
universal, the lower mass gap can be reasonably built. The width and depth of
the gap are mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and
metallicity. One can expect that the future multi-messenger observations of
compact objects delineate the shape of the gap, which might constrain the

study reported that GCNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which
means that GCN models may suffer malicious attacks with unnoticeable
modifications of the data. Among all the adversarial attacks on GCNs, there is
a special kind of attack method called the universal adversarial attack, which
generates a perturbation that can be applied to any sample and causes GCN
models to output incorrect results. Although universal adversarial attacks in
computer vision have been extensively researched, there are few research works
on universal adversarial attacks on graph structured data. In this paper, we
propose a targeted universal adversarial attack against GCNs. Our method
employs a few nodes as the attack nodes. The attack capability of the attack
nodes is enhanced through a small number of fake nodes connected to them.
During an attack, any victim node will be misclassified by the GCN as the
attack node class as long as it is linked to them. The experiments on three
popular datasets show that the average attack success rate of the proposed
attack on any victim node in the graph reaches 83% when using only 3 attack
nodes and 6 fake nodes. We hope that our work will make the community aware of

enhancing the performance of wireless networks at a low and affordable cost,
complexity, and power consumption. We introduce an algorithm for optimizing a
single-input single-output RIS-assisted system in which the RIS is modeled by
using an electromagnetic-compliant framework based on mutual impedances. More
precisely, we provide the following new contributions: (i) in the absence of
mutual coupling among the scattering elements of the RIS, we derive a
closed-form expression for the optimal tunable impedances, which inherently
accounts for the interplay between the amplitude and phase of the lumped loads
of the RIS; and (ii) in the presence of mutual coupling, we introduce an
iterative algorithm for optimizing the tunable impedances of the RIS. The
algorithm is proved to be convergent by showing that the objective function is
non-decreasing and upper bounded. Numerical results reveal that the mutual
coupling among the scattering elements of the RIS significantly affects the
end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) if the inter-distance is less than half
of the wavelength. If the RIS is optimized by explicitly taking into account
the impact of mutual coupling, a better end-to-end SNR is obtained.

DeGrand-Toussaint, are shown to have the continuum limit with respect to the

Abelian-like monopole is not gauge invariant, we have introduced various
partial gauge fixing for the purpose of reducing lattice artifact monopoles in
the thermalized vacuum. Here we investigate Abelian and monopole dominances and
the Abelian dual Meissner effects adopting the same gauges like the maximal
center gauge (MCG) in comparison with the maximal Abelian gauge (MAG). Abelian
and monopole contributions to the string tension in these gauges are observed
to be a little smaller than the non-Abelian string tension. However, we find
that the monopole dominance is improved well when use is made of the block-spin
transformations with respect to Abelian-like monopoles. We find each electric
field is squeezed by the corresponding colored Abelian-like monopole in such
gauges and the Abelian dual Meissner effect is observed independently for each
color. Moreover, we confirm the dual Amp\`{e}re's law in these new gauges as
well as in MAG. The SU(2) vacuum is shown to be near the border between the
type 1 and type 2 dual superconductors. The penetration length is almost equal

detectability of an imaging system on a large number of signals. An appropriate
transformation will produce a set of signals with different contrast and
different frequency contents. In this work both strategies are explored to
present a task-based test for the detectability of an x-ray imaging system.
Methods: Images of a new star-bar phantom are acquired with different entrance
air KERMA and with different beam qualities. Then, after a wavelet packet is
applied to both input and output of the system, conventional statistical
decision theory is applied to determine detectability on the different images
or nodes resulting from the transformation. A non-prewhitening matching filter
is applied to the data in the spatial domain, and ROC analysis is carried out
in each of the nodes. Results: AUC maps resulting from the analysis present the
area under the ROC curve over the whole 2D frequency space for the different
doses and beam qualities. Also, AUC curves, obtained by radially averaging the
AUC maps allows comparing detectability of the different techniques as a
function of the frequency in one only figure. The results obtained show
differences between images acquired with different doses for each of the beam
qualities analyzed. Conclusions: Combining a star-bar as test object, a wavelet
packet as linear transformation, and ROC analysis results in an appropriate
task-based test for detectability performance of an imaging system. The test
presented in this work allows quantification of system detectability as a
function of the 2D frequency interval of the signal to detect. It also allows
calculation of detectability differences between different acquisition
techniques and beam qualities.

In a sequential setting, however, no policy can guarantee these desiderata
simultaneously for all possible utility realizations. A natural online fair

simultaneous guarantees for both Pareto-efficiency and envy-freeness. However,

  Problems: Applications in Medical Imaging","Accepted for publication at ICASSP 2021",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV eess.SP math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The remarkable performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) currently makes
them the method of choice for solving linear inverse problems. They have been
applied to super-resolve and restore images, as well as to reconstruct MR and
CT images. In these applications, DNNs invert a forward operator by finding,
via training data, a map between the measurements and the input images. It is
then expected that the map is still valid for the test data. This framework,
however, introduces measurement inconsistency during testing. We show that such
inconsistency, which can be critical in domains like medical imaging or
defense, is intimately related to the generalization error. We then propose a
framework that post-processes the output of DNNs with an optimization algorithm
that enforces measurement consistency. Experiments on MR images show that
enforcing measurement consistency via our method can lead to large gains in
reconstruction performance.

for the total intensity profiles. But they require large observation times to
improve the SNR effectively. New approaches to de-noise the pulsar total
intensity data have sprung up over the years, powered by Machine learning and
Deep learning algorithms. In the current work, efforts are made to implement
the currently proposed supervised machine learning models, such as ensembling
techniques like Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Adaboost
Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), and
Support Vector Regressor (SVR) to find out the best possible algorithm which
can work over a variety of pulsars from the EPN database of pulsars. All the
data used in this work is extracted from the European Pulsar Network (EPN)
database of pulsar profiles. The training dataset is obtained by
post-processing the pulsar profile data from the EPN database hand testing is
performed on a preselected portion of the original data. The results are
obtained by testing the above algorithms for 10 different pulsars, including
some historically significant ones, and the predicted profiles are plotted. We
find that Gradient boosting regressor works the best in denoising pulsar data,
followed closely by KNN regressor. This work also emphasizes that there is a
reduction in the number of periods of folding by 35-40\% when a combination of
machine learning models with the existing pulsar folding techniques like Fast
Folding Algorithm(FFA) is employed, which in turn can further reduce the pulsar
observation times for the telescopes hunting for pulsars today.

the development of data-driven approaches to radar processing. However, it is
fraught with difficulty due to the notoriously complex image formation process.
Here we propose to learn a radar sensor model capable of synthesising faithful
radar observations based on simulated elevation maps. In particular, we adopt
an adversarial approach to learning a forward sensor model from unaligned radar
examples. In addition, modelling the backward model encourages the output to
remain aligned to the world state through a cyclical consistency criterion. The
backward model is further constrained to predict elevation maps from real radar
data that are grounded by partial measurements obtained from corresponding
lidar scans. Both models are trained in a joint optimisation. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach by evaluating a down-stream segmentation model
trained purely on simulated data in a real-world deployment. This achieves
performance within four percentage points of the same model trained entirely on
real data.

nonzero-sum stochastic dynamic games called linear quadratic (LQ) deep
structured games. In such games, players interact with each other through a set
of weighted averages (linear regressions) of the states and actions. In this
paper, we focus our attention to homogeneous weights; however, for the special
case of infinite population, the obtained results extend to asymptotically
vanishing weights wherein the players learn the sequential weighted mean-field
equilibrium. Despite the non-convexity of the optimization in policy space and
the fact that policy optimization does not generally converge in game setting,
we prove that the proposed model-based and model-free policy gradient descent
and natural policy gradient descent algorithms globally converge to the
sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first result that provides a global convergence proof of policy optimization in
a nonzero-sum LQ game. One of the salient features of the proposed algorithms
is that their parameter space is independent of the number of players, and when
the dimension of state space is significantly larger than that of the action
space, they provide a more efficient way of computation compared to those
algorithms that plan and learn in the action space. Finally, some simulations
are provided to numerically verify the obtained theoretical results.

(AD) is of great interest to clinical researchers. This phenomenon also serves
as a valuable data source for quantitative methodological researchers
developing new approaches for classification. However, the growth of machine
learning (ML) approaches for classification may falsely lead many clinical
researchers to underestimate the value of logistic regression (LR), yielding
equivalent or superior classification accuracy over other ML methods. Further,
in applications with many features that could be used for classifying the
transition, clinical researchers are often unaware of the relative value of
different selection procedures. In the present study, we sought to investigate
the use of automated and theoretically-guided feature selection techniques, and
as well as the L-1 norm when applying different classification techniques for
predicting conversion from MCI to AD in a highly characterized and studied
sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We propose
an alternative pre-selection technique that utilizes an efficient feature
selection based on clinical knowledge of brain regions involved in AD. The
present findings demonstrate how similar performance can be achieved using
user-guided pre-selection versus algorithmic feature selection techniques.
Finally, we compare the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) with that
of logistic regression on multi-modal data from ADNI. The present findings show
that although SVM and other ML techniques are capable of relatively accurate
classification, similar or higher accuracy can often be achieved by LR,
mitigating SVM's necessity or value for many clinical researchers.

we can point our black-box DLNN system at trader T and successfully have it
learn from T's trading activity, such that it trades at least as well as T. Our
system, called DeepTrader, takes inputs derived from Level-2 market data, i.e.
the market's Limit Order Book (LOB) or Ladder for a tradeable asset. Unusually,
DeepTrader makes no explicit prediction of future prices. Instead, we train it
purely on input-output pairs where in each pair the input is a snapshot S of
Level-2 LOB data taken at the time when T issued a quote Q (i.e. a bid or an
ask order) to the market; and DeepTrader's desired output is to produce Q when
it is shown S. That is, we train our DLNN by showing it the LOB data S that T
saw at the time when T issued quote Q, and in doing so our system comes to
behave like T, acting as an algorithmic trader issuing specific quotes in
response to specific LOB conditions. We train DeepTrader on large numbers of
these S/Q snapshot/quote pairs, and then test it in a variety of market
scenarios, evaluating it against other algorithmic trading systems in the
public-domain literature, including two that have repeatedly been shown to
outperform human traders. Our results demonstrate that DeepTrader learns to
match or outperform such existing algorithmic trading systems. We analyse the
successful DeepTrader network to identify what features it is relying on, and
which features can be ignored. We propose that our methods can in principle

similarities between classes that directly affect the model's training. As a
consequence, the model tends to overfit the input set. In this research, we
suggest the D-vine Copula Auto-Encoder (VCAE) as a tool to estimate the latent

  Comprehensive Evaluation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Privacy concerns around sharing personally identifiable information are a
major practical barrier to data sharing in medical research. However, in many
cases, researchers have no interest in a particular individual's information
but rather aim to derive insights at the level of cohorts. Here, we utilize
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create derived medical imaging
datasets consisting entirely of synthetic patient data. The synthetic images
ideally have, in aggregate, similar statistical properties to those of a source
dataset but do not contain sensitive personal information. We assess the
quality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs
with 14 different radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans
with six types of intracranial hemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image
quality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either
the synthetic or the real dataset. We find that synthetic data performance
disproportionately benefits from a reduced number of unique label combinations.
Our open-source benchmark also indicates that at low number of samples per
class, label overfitting effects start to dominate GAN training. We
additionally conducted a reader study in which trained radiologists do not
perform better than random on discriminating between synthetic and real medical
images for intermediate levels of resolutions. In accordance with our benchmark
results, the classification accuracy of radiologists increases at higher
spatial resolution levels. Our study offers valuable guidelines and outlines
practical conditions under which insights derived from synthetic medical images
are similar to those that would have been derived from real imaging data. Our
results indicate that synthetic data sharing may be an attractive and
privacy-preserving alternative to sharing real patient-level data in the right
settings.

In addition to stationary states, the evolution of such jets admits transverse
pulsations. The theory predicts that the period for warm jets pulsations is
longer than the period of inertial oscillations caused by the Earth's rotation,
while for cold jets pulsations, it is shorter. Thus, only warm jets can have a
noticeable effect on the synoptic range of the wind-speed spectrum, generating
into it additional spectral peaks. Within such an approach, every a single jet
is described by a self-similar compactly localized solution that can be
considered as a constant-shear band.

inherent heterogeneity and lack of in-situ measurements. To complete
uncertainty analysis in a multi-scale manner, it is a prerequisite to provide
sufficient rock samples. Even though the advent of digital rock technology
offers opportunities to reproduce rocks, it still cannot be utilized to provide
massive samples due to its high cost, thus leading to the development of
diversified mathematical methods. Among them, two-point statistics (TPS) and
multi-point statistics (MPS) are commonly utilized, which feature incorporating
low-order and high-order statistical information, respectively. Recently,
generative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly popular since
they can reproduce training images with excellent visual and consequent
geologic realism. However, standard GANs can only incorporate information from
data, while leaving no interface for user-defined properties, and thus may
limit the representativeness of reconstructed samples. In this study, we
propose conditional GANs for digital rock reconstruction, aiming to reproduce
samples not only similar to the real training data, but also satisfying
user-specified properties. In fact, the proposed framework can realize the
targets of MPS and TPS simultaneously by incorporating high-order information
directly from rock images with the GANs scheme, while preserving low-order
counterparts through conditioning. We conduct three reconstruction experiments,
and the results demonstrate that rock type, rock porosity, and correlation
length can be successfully conditioned to affect the reconstructed rock images.
Furthermore, in contrast to existing GANs, the proposed conditioning enables
learning of multiple rock types simultaneously, and thus invisibly saves
computational cost.
