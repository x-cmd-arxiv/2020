opportunity to constrain cosmology in the post-reionization Universe, provided
a good accuracy is achieved in the separation between the strong foregrounds
and the cosmological signal. Cleaning methods rely on the frequency smoothness
of the foregrounds and are often applied under the assumption of a simplistic
Gaussian primary beam. In this work, we test the cleaning in the presence of a
realistic primary beam model with a non trivial frequency dependence. We focus
on the Square Kilometre Array precursor MeerKAT telescope and simulate a
single-dish wide area survey. We consider the main foreground components,
including an accurate full sky point source catalogue. We find that the
coupling between beam sidelobes and the foreground structure can complicate the
cleaning. However, when the beam frequency dependence is smooth, we show that
the cleaning is only problematic if the far sidelobes are unexpectedly large.
Even in that case, a proper reconstruction is possible if the strongest point
sources are removed and the cleaning is more aggressive. We then consider a
non-trivial frequency dependence: a sinusoidal type feature in the beam width
that is present in the MeerKAT beam and is expected in most dishes, including
SKA1-MID. Such a feature, coupling with the foreground emission, biases the
reconstruction of the signal across frequency, potentially impacting the
cosmological analysis. Interestingly, such contamination is present at a lower
level even when no point sources are included and the beam is Gaussian, showing
that this frequency ripple can be problematic even within the main lobe. We
show that this effect is constrained to a narrow region in $k_\parallel$ space
and can be reduced if the maps are carefully re-smoothed to a common lower
resolution.

provides a very powerful tool for formulating thermodynamically consistent
models. It can also be employed to find approximate solutions, especially in
the study of soft matter dynamics. In this work, OVP is extended and applied to
the dynamic modeling of active soft matter such as suspensions of bacteria and
aggregates of animal cells. We first extend the general formulation of OVP to
active matter dynamics where active forces are included as external
non-conservative forces. We then use OVP to analyze the directional motion of
individual active units: a molecular motor walking on a stiff biofilament and a
toy two-sphere microswimmer. Next, we use OVP to formulate a diffuse-interface
model for an active polar droplet on a solid substrate. In addition to the
generalized hydrodynamic equations for active polar fluids in the bulk region,
we have also derived thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions. Finally,
we consider the dynamics of a thin active polar droplet under the lubrication
approximation. We use OVP to derive a generalized thin film equation and then
employ OVP as an approximation tool to find the spreading laws for the thin
active polar droplet. By incorporating the activity of biological systems into
OVP, we develop a general approach to construct thermodynamically consistent
models for better understanding the emergent behaviors of individual animal
cells and cell aggregates or tissues.

boundary types. This enables the learning of video representations that are
much more transferable to downstream temporal localization tasks. Extensive

literary studies have long established that human language is, at its essence,
ambiguous and that this quality, although challenging to communication,
enriches language and points to the complexity of human thought. On the other
hand, in the NLP field there have been ongoing efforts aimed at disambiguation
for various downstream tasks. This work brings together computational text
analysis and literary analysis to demonstrate the extent to which ambiguity in
certain texts plays a key role in shaping meaning and thus requires analysis
rather than elimination. We revisit the discussion, well known in the
humanities, about the role ambiguity plays in Henry James' 19th century
novella, The Turn of the Screw. We model each of the novella's two competing
interpretations as a topic and computationally demonstrate that the duality
between them exists consistently throughout the work and shapes, rather than
obscures, its meaning. We also demonstrate that cosine similarity and word
mover's distance are sensitive enough to detect ambiguity in its most subtle
literary form, despite doubts to the contrary raised by literary scholars. Our
analysis is built on topic word lists and word embeddings from various sources.
We first claim, and then empirically show, the interdependence between

potential of such a system is an example of a fold catastrophe. In fact, the
existence of a local minimum and saddle point, corresponding to tidally-locked
circular orbits, is regulated by a single dimensionless control parameter which
depends on the properties of the two bodies and on the total angular momentum
of the system. The method described in this work results in compact expressions
for the radius of the circular orbit and the tidally-locked spin/orbital
frequency. The limiting case in which one of the two orbiting objects is

in this limit depends on only two parameters, allows one to clearly visualize
the properties of the system. The notorious case of the Mars' moon Phobos is

cold-start problem by exploring the potential of various deep learning features
to provide video recommendations. The deep learning features investigated
include features that capture the visual-appearance, audio and motion
information from video content. We also explore different fusion methods to
evaluate how well these feature modalities can be combined to fully exploit the
complementary information captured by them. Experiments on a real-world video
dataset for movie recommendations show that deep learning features outperform
hand-crafted features. In particular, recommendations generated with deep
learning audio features and action-centric deep learning features are superior
to MFCC and state-of-the-art iDT features. In addition, the combination of
various deep learning features with hand-crafted features and textual metadata
yields significant improvement in recommendations compared to combining only
the former.

Fourier transformed to obtain the Faraday dispersion function (FDF), providing
us a tomographic distribution of the magnetoionic media along the line of

of the instrument's limited wavelength coverage. The current Faraday tomography

popular model-independent techniques. The dependence of observational frequency
coverage on the various techniques' reconstruction performance is also
demonstrated for a simpler FDF. CRAFT exhibits improvements even over

resolved, i.e. at spectral resolving power larger than about 10000, and it is
sufficient to facilitate the detection of spectral features at lower

Doppler-shift dependent errors of the restored flux may arise, which can amount
to more than 50% in extreme cases, depending on the line shapes of the target

involve estimating the ""channel"" or relationship between signal transmitted and
received. In this work, we focus on a certain channel model known as the
delay-doppler channel. This model begins to be useful in the high frequency
carrier setting, which is increasingly common with developments in
millimeter-wave technology. Moreover, the delay-doppler model then continues to
be applicable even when using signals of large bandwidth, which is a standard
approach to achieving high resolution channel estimation. However, when high
resolution is desirable, this standard approach results in a tension with the
desire for efficiency because, in particular, it immediately implies that the
signals in play live in a space of very high dimension $N$ (e.g., ~$10^6$ in
some applications), as per the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.
  To address this difficulty, we propose a novel randomized estimation scheme
called Sparse Channel Estimation, or SCE for short, for channel estimation in
the $k$-sparse setting (e.g., $k$ objects in radar detection). This scheme
involves an estimation procedure with sampling and space complexity both on the
order of $k(logN)^3$, and arithmetic complexity on the order of $k(log N)^3 +
k^2$, for $N$ sufficiently large.
  To the best of our knowledge, Sparse Channel Estimation (SCE) is the first of
its kind to achieve these complexities simultaneously -- it seems to be
extremely efficient! As an added advantage, it is a simple combination of three
ingredients, two of which are well-known and widely used, namely digital chirp
signals and discrete Gaussian filter functions, and the third being recent
developments in sparse fast fourier transform algorithms.

Recently, with the tremendous successes gained by deep neural networks in
various fields, the research on data hiding with deep learning models has
attracted an increasing amount of attentions. In deep data hiding models, to
maximize the encoding capacity, each pixel of the cover image ought to be
treated differently since they have different sensitivities w.r.t. visual

affects the model's robustness for information hiding. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient Attention (IGA),
combining the idea of attention mechanism to endow different attention weights

spotlight pixels with more robustness for data hiding. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the mainstream deep learning

applications in healthcare, agriculture and industry. They can lead to splash
and generation of secondary droplets important for a range of coating,
dispersal or contaminant problems. The physics of splash, despite being more
than a century old problem, still has a number of unanswered questions. We
study the sequence of events occurring upon drop impact on a deep, inviscid
liquid pool. We particularly focus on the air cavity formed below the liquid
surface and the liquid sheet of the crown, which forms and rises above the
surface. Using combined momentum and energy analyses, we derive the prediction
of the temporal evolution of the air cavity and the maximum depth it reaches.
We derive and an expression for the sheet velocity profile of the crown. We
also derive the expression for the unsteady sheet thickness profile of the
crown. Leveraging the knowledge we gained on the unsteady crown sheet velocity
and thickness profiles, we derive the analytical expressions for the temporal
evolution of the crown diameter and crown height. We also show how the crown
and cavity radial expansions are coupled. The cavity and crown analysis
employed in the present study provides a new understanding of the traditionally
know cavity-crown system started in the seminal studies by Worthington in the

stochastic neuron field model was investigated by simulating coupled stochastic
processes defined by stochastic differential equations. It was found, for
several choices of parameters, that pattern formation in the phases of these
processes occurred if and only if the amplitudes were allowed to grow large.
Stimulated by recent work on homeostatic inhibitory plasticity, we introduced
static and plastic (adaptive) systemic inhibitory mechanisms to keep the
amplitudes stochastically bounded in subsequent simulations. The systems with
static systemic inhibition exhibited bounded amplitudes but no sustained phase
patterns, whereas the systems with plastic systemic inhibition exhibited both
bounded amplitudes and sustained phase patterns. These results demonstrate that
plastic inhibitory mechanisms in neural field models can stochastically control
amplitudes while allowing patterns of phase synchronization to develop. Similar
mechanisms of plastic systemic inhibition could play a role in regulating
oscillatory functioning in the brain.

novel composite structures assembly involves two challenges: (i) the highly
nonlinear and anisotropic properties of composite materials; and (ii)
inevitable uncertainty in the assembly process. To overcome those problems, we
propose a neural network Gaussian process model considering input uncertainty

approximate a complex process better, and consideration of input uncertainty
enables robust modeling with complete incorporation of the process uncertainty.
Based on simulation and case study, the NNGPIU can outperform other benchmark

constructed perturbations to an image can seriously impair classification
accuracy, while being imperceptible to humans. While there has been a
significant amount of research on defending against such attacks, most defenses
based on systematic design principles have been defeated by appropriately
modified attacks. For a fixed set of data, the most effective current defense
is to train the network using adversarially perturbed examples. In this paper,
we investigate a radically different, neuro-inspired defense mechanism,
starting from the observation that human vision is virtually unaffected by
adversarial examples designed for machines. We aim to reject L^inf bounded
adversarial perturbations before they reach a classifier DNN, using an encoder
with characteristics commonly observed in biological vision: sparse
overcomplete representations, randomness due to synaptic noise, and drastic
nonlinearities. Encoder training is unsupervised, using standard dictionary
learning. A CNN-based decoder restores the size of the encoder output to that
of the original image, enabling the use of a standard CNN for classification.
Our nominal design is to train the decoder and classifier together in standard
supervised fashion, but we also consider unsupervised decoder training based on
a regression objective (as in a conventional autoencoder) with separate
supervised training of the classifier. Unlike adversarial training, all
training is based on clean images.
  Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 show performance competitive with
state-of-the-art defenses based on adversarial training, and point to the
promise of neuro-inspired techniques for the design of robust neural networks.
In addition, we provide results for a subset of the Imagenet dataset to verify
that our approach scales to larger images.

of cell behavior at many levels of organization. Here, we review models in the
literature that focus on eukaryotic cell motility at 3 size scales:
intracellular signaling that regulates cell shape and movement, single cell
motility, and collective cell behavior from a few cells to tissues. We survey
recent literature to summarize distinct computational methods (phase-field,
polygonal, Cellular Potts, and spherical cells). We discuss models that bridge
between levels of organization, and describe levels of detail, both biochemical
and geometric, included in the models. We also highlight links between models
and experiments. We find that models that span the 3 levels are still in the
minority.

After performing each operation, the algorithm must report the length of the
longest increasing subsequence of the current sequence.
  Our main contribution is the first exact dynamic \textsf{LIS} algorithm with
sublinear update time. More precisely, we present a randomized algorithm that
performs each operation in time $\tilde O(n^{2/3})$ and after each update,
reports the answer to the \textsf{LIS} problem correctly with high probability.
We use several novel techniques and observations for this algorithm that may
find their applications in future work.
  In the second part of the paper, we study approximate dynamic \textsf{LIS}
algorithms, which are allowed to underestimate the solution size within a
bounded multiplicative factor. In this setting, we give a deterministic
algorithm with update time $O(n^{o(1)})$ and approximation factor $1-o(1)$.
This result substantially improves upon the previous work of Mitzenmacher and
Seddighin (STOC'20) that presents an $\Omega(\epsilon

O(n^\epsilon)$ for any constant $\epsilon > 0$.

current research in the field mainly focuses on tracking of opaque objects,

(86K frames) from 15 diverse transparent object categories. Each sequence is
manually labeled with axis-aligned bounding boxes. To the best of our
knowledge, TOTB is the first benchmark dedicated to transparent object
tracking. In order to understand how existing trackers perform and to provide
comparison for future research on TOTB, we extensively evaluate 25
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The evaluation results exhibit that more
efforts are needed to improve transparent object tracking. Besides, we observe
some nontrivial findings from the evaluation that are discrepant with some
common beliefs in opaque object tracking. For example, we find that deeper
features are not always good for improvements. Moreover, to encourage future
research, we introduce a novel tracker, named TransATOM, which leverages
transparency features for tracking and surpasses all 25 evaluated approaches by
a large margin. By releasing TOTB, we expect to facilitate future research and
application of transparent object tracking in both the academia and industry.

from the union of aromatic rings and related species, which are likely
responsible for strong infrared emission features (3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and
12.7 microns). In this work, using a sample of 50 Seyfert galaxies (DL<100 Mpc)
we compare the circumnuclear (inner kpc) PAH emission of AGN to that of a
control sample of star-forming galaxies (22 luminous infrared galaxies and 30
HII galaxies), and investigate the differences between central and extended PAH
emission. Using Spitzer/InfraRed Spectrograph spectral data of Seyfert and
star-forming galaxies and newly developed PAH diagnostic model grids, derived
from theoretical spectra, we compare the predicted and observed PAH ratios. We
find that star-forming galaxies and AGN-dominated systems are located in
different regions of the PAH diagnostic diagrams. This suggests that not only
are the size and charge of the PAH molecules different, but also the nature and
hardness of the radiation field that excite them. We find tentative evidence
that PAH ratios in AGN-dominated systems are consistent with emission from
larger PAH molecules (Nc>300-400) as well as neutral species. By subtracting
the spectrum of the central source from the total, we compare the PAH emission
in the central vs extended region of a small sample of AGN. In contrast to the
findings for the central regions of AGN-dominated systems, the PAH ratios
measured in the extended regions of both type 1 and type 2 Seyfert galaxies can
be explained assuming similar PAH molecular size distribution and ionized
fractions of molecules to those seen in central regions of star-forming
galaxies (100<Nc<300).

Adding descriptors having physical nature (atomic radius, number of valence

predicting the higher degree system configurations. Our result opens a broad
avenue to efficient high-throughput investigations of the combinatorial binary

enhanced swimming performance for an idealized, simple swimming model that
resembles a C. elegans, an organism that exhibits an anguilliform mode of
locomotion. The computational model uses the immersed boundary method to solve
the fluid-interaction system. The 1D swimmer propagates itself forward by
dynamically changing its preferred body curvature. Observations indicate that

average completion time while guaranteeing convergence. We provide upper and
lower bounds for the average completion and we find a necessary condition for
adding edge devices in two asymptotic regimes, namely the large dataset and the
high accuracy regime. Conducted experiments on real datasets and numerical
results confirm our analysis and substantiate our claim that the number of edge
devices should be carefully selected for timely distributed edge learning.

To overcome these challenges, we devise a novel RL algorithm that enables an

features. First, we devise two distance-based Q-value update schemes, incentive
update and penalty update, in a distance-based incentive/penalty update
technique to enable the agent to decide discrete and continuous actions in the
feasible region and to update the value of these types of actions. Second, we
propose a method for defining the penalty cost as a shadow price-weighted

These systems typically use direct teleoperation at the motion level, and are

situational awareness demands new interaction and planning workflows. We
explore the use of human-robot teaming through teleautonomy with assisted

diverse as glasses, colloids, foams, amorphous solids, constraint satisfaction
problems, neural networks, etc. A particularly interesting feature of this
class is that small interparticle forces ($f$) and gaps ($h$) are distributed
according to nontrivial power laws. A recently developed mean-field (MF) theory
predicts the characteristic exponents of these distributions in the limit of
very high spatial dimension, $d\rightarrow\infty$ and, remarkably, their values
seemingly agree with numerical estimates in physically relevant dimensions,
$d=2$ and $3$. These exponents are further connected through a pair of
inequalities derived from stability conditions, and both theoretical
predictions and previous numerical investigations suggest that these
inequalities are saturated. Systems at the jamming point are thus only
marginally stable. Despite the key physical role played by these exponents,
their systematic evaluation has yet to be attempted. Here, we carefully test
their value by analyzing the finite-size scaling of the distributions of $f$
and $h$ for various particle-based models for jamming. Both dimension and the
direction of approach to the jamming point are also considered. We show that,
in all models, finite-size effects are much more pronounced in the distribution
of $h$ than in that of $f$. We thus conclude that gaps are correlated over
considerably longer scales than forces. Additionally, remarkable agreement with
MF predictions is obtained in all but one model, namely near-crystalline
packings. Our results thus help to better delineate the domain of the jamming
universality class. We furthermore uncover a secondary linear regime in the
distribution tails of both $f$ and $h$. This surprisingly robust feature is
understood to follow from the (near) isostaticity of our configurations.

scenario in which a number of devices with low-complexity and low-energy wish
to upload their respective messages to a base station. In the original problem
formulation, all devices communicate using the same information rate. This may
be very inefficient in certain wireless situations with varied channel
conditions, power budgets, and payload requirements at the devices. This paper
extends the original problem setting so as to allow for such variability. More
specifically, we consider the scenario in which devices are clustered into two
classes, possibly with different SNR levels or distinct payload requirements.
In the cluster with higher power,devices transmit using a two-layer
superposition modulation. In the cluster with lower energy, users transmit with
the same base constellation as in the high power cluster. Within each layer,
devices employ the same codebook. At the receiver, signal groupings are
recovered using Approximate Message Passing(AMP), and proceeding from the high
to the low power levels using successive interference cancellation (SIC). This
layered architecture is implemented using Coded Compressed Sensing(CCS) within
every grouping. An outer tree code is employed to stitch fragments together
across times and layers, as needed.This pragmatic approach to heterogeneous CCS
is validated numerically and design guidelines are identified.

Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a

was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to
decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a
layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to
decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their
keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without
compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter,
their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system
is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over
an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances
or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.

out-of-plane ferroelectricity, is a fundamental phenomenon in the field of
condensed-mater physics. The current research is based on the paradigm of
bi-directional inversion asymmetry in single-layers, which restricts 2D
intercorrelated ferroelectrics to extremely few systems. Herein, we propose a
new scheme for achieving 2D intercorrelated ferroelectrics using van der Waals
(vdW) interaction, and apply this scheme to a vast family of 2D vdW materials.
Using first-principles, we demonstrate that 2D vdW multilayers-for example, BN,
MoS2, InSe, CdS, PtSe2, TI2O, SnS2, Ti2CO2 etc.- can exhibit coupled in-plane
and out-of-plane ferroelectricity, thus yielding 2D intercorrelated
ferroelectricsferroelectric physics. We further predict that such
intercorrelated ferroelectrics could demonstrate many distinct properties, for
example, electrical full control of spin textures in trilayer PtSe2 and
electrical permanent control of valley-contrasting physics in four-layer VS2.
Our finding opens a new direction for 2D intercorrelated ferroelectric
research.

systems where human drivers follow the navigation instructions completely) with
a utility-optimizing goal and the system's equilibrating processes in a routing
game among atomic selfish agents. Such a paradigm can assist policymakers in
devising optimal operational and planning countermeasures under both normal and
abnormal circumstances. To this end, we develop a Markov routing game (MRG) in
which each agent learns and updates her own en-route path choice policy while
interacting with others in transportation networks. To efficiently solve MRG,
we formulate it as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and devise a mean
field multi-agent deep Q learning (MF-MA-DQL) approach that captures the
competition among agents. The linkage between the classical DUE paradigm and
our proposed Markov routing game (MRG) is discussed. We show that the routing
behavior of intelligent agents is shown to converge to the classical notion of
predictive dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) when traffic environments are
simulated using dynamic loading models (DNL). In other words, the MRG depicts
DUEs assuming perfect information and deterministic environments propagated by
DNL models. Four examples are solved to illustrate the algorithm efficiency and
consistency between DUE and the MRG equilibrium, on a simple network without
and with spillback, the Ortuzar Willumsen (OW) Network, and a real-world

fundamental role on dynamical processes evolving on heterogeneous networks.
These localization analyses are frequently grounded, for example, on
eigenvectors of adjacency or non-backtracking matrices which emerge in theories
of dynamic processes near to an active to inactive transition. We advance in
this problem gauging nodal activity to quantify the localization in dynamical
processes on networks whether they are near to a transition or not. The method
is generic and applicable to theory, stochastic simulations, and real data. We
investigate spreading processes on a wide spectrum of networks, both
analytically and numerically, showing that nodal activity can present complex
patterns depending on the network structure. Using annealed networks we show
that a localized state at the transition and an endemic phase just above it are
not incompatible features of a spreading process. We also report that epidemic
prevalence near to the transition is determined by the delocalized component of
the network even when the analysis of the inverse participation ratio indicates
a localized activity. Also, dynamical processes with distinct critical
exponents can be described by the same localization pattern. Turning to
quenched networks, a more complex picture, depending on the type of activation
and on the range of degree exponent, is observed and discussed. Our work paves
an important path for investigation of localized activity in spreading and

While effective in terms of performance, these methods pose limitations in
scalability for dense video scenes with a high memory requirement for thousands
of proposals. We propose to solve this problem from a different perspective

pixel level joint actor-action detection in a single-shot, where every pixel of

1) It is a fully convolutional network which does not require any proposals and
post-processing making it memory as well as time efficient, 2) It is easily
scalable to dense video scenes as its memory requirement is independent of the
number of actors present in the scene. We evaluate the proposed method on the
Actor-Action dataset (A2D) and Video Object Relation (VidOR) dataset,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multiple actors and action detection in a

century, every hour a vast number of explosions happen in the whole universe,
emitting energy in the form of neutrinos, resulting in the diffuse supernova
neutrino background (DSNB). The DSNB has not yet been detected, but
Super-Kamiokande doped with gadolinium is expected to yield the first
statistically significant observation within the next several years. Since the
neutrinos produced at the core collapse undergo mixing during their propagation
to Earth, the flavor content at detection is a test of oscillation physics. In
this paper, we estimate the expected DSNB data at the DUNE, Hyper-K and JUNO
experiments which when combined are sensitive to all different neutrino
flavors. We determine how well the flavor content of the DSNB will be
reconstructed in the future, for a Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) scenario
as well as a neutrino decay scenario. A large fraction of the flavor space will
be excluded, but the heavy-lepton neutrino flux remains a challenge.

electromagnetic Hawking radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) in
critical collapse model. We consider the simplest case that all PBHs formed at
a single epoch stemming from an inflationary spectrum with a narrow peak, and
an extended mass distribution is obtained due to critical phenomena of
gravitational collapse. The presence of a low-mass tail of critical collapse
mass function could lead to an enhancement of energetic photon emissions from
Hawking radiation of PBHs. Nuclear photodisintegration rates are calculated
with a nonthermal photon spectrum derived by solving the Boltzmann equation
iteratively. The exact spectrum is much different than that based on an
often-used analytical bended power-law spectrum and it is found to
significantly depend on the adopted PBH mass functions. With the newest
observational limit on the $^3$He abundance in Galactic H II regions, the
updated $^3$He constraints on PBH mass spectrum in the horizon mass range
$10^{12} - 10^{13}$ g are derived. Our results for the first time show that
$^3$He constraints on the critical mass function are about one order of
magnitude severer than the monochromatic one although the fraction of PBHs in
the low-mass tail region is relatively small. The $^6$Li elemental abundance is
also enhanced significantly for the critical mass function. More precise
measurement of $^6$Li abundance is highly desirable to provide a promising
constraint on PBHs in the future. For monochromatic mass function, we provide
the analytical bounds for photodisintegration and hadrodissociation from PBH
radiation, and we report discrepancies between our updated $^3$He constraints

where the sequence of all the released sub-intervals is known in advance to the

BYOL from the view of our proposed interpretable self-supervised learning

representations and (ii) running away from the model's Mean Teacher (MT, the
exponential moving average of the history models) instead of BYOL's running
towards it. The second term of RAFT explicitly prevents the representation
collapse and thus makes RAFT a more conceptually reliable framework. We provide
basic benchmarks of RAFT on CIFAR10 to validate the effectiveness of our
method. Furthermore, we prove that BYOL is equivalent to RAFT under certain
conditions, providing solid reasoning for BYOL's counter-intuitive success.

end-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by
designing and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense
strategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world

spoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at
arbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five

to make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments
are conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a
Lincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed
assume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To
defend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication

parameters that correspond to a twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayer. First, we
consider irradiation with circularly polarized light in free space and
demonstrate that the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonian takes the same form as
the static Hamiltonian, only with a constant overall shift in quasi-energy.
This is in stark contrast to twisted bilayer graphene, where new terms are
typically generated under an analagous drive. Longitudinal light, on the other
hand, which can be generated from the transverse magnetic mode in a waveguide,
has a much more dramatic effect--it renormalizes the tunneling strength between
the layers, which effectively permits the tuning of the twist angle {\em
in-situ}. We find that, by varying the frequency and amplitude of the drive,
one can induce a topological transition that cannot be obtained with the
traditional form of the Floquet drive in free space. Furthermore, we find that
strong drives can have a profound effect on the layer pseudospin texture of the
twisted system, which coincides with multiple simultaneous band gap closings in
the infinite-frequency limit. Surprisingly, these bandgap closings are not
associated with topological transitions. For high but finite drive frequencies
near $0.7$eV, the infinite-frequency band crossings become band gap minima of
the order of $10^{-6}$ eV or smaller.

gluons. Above $T_c$, due to the deconfinement phase transition, the color
correlation among quarks is found to quickly dissappear. Further, we
investigate the color screening effect via the screening mass defined by
$\rho$, and discuss the differences in the screening properties between the
small and large R regions.

distinguishing various categories with high inter-class similarity by learning
the feature that differentiate the details. Conventional cross entropy trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fails this challenge as it may suffer from
producing inter-class invariant features in FGVC. In this work, we innovatively
propose to regularize the training of CNN by enforcing the uniqueness of the
features to each category from an information theoretic perspective. To achieve
this goal, we formulate a minimax loss based on a game theoretic framework,
where a Nash equilibria is proved to be consistent with this regularization
objective. Besides, to prevent from a feasible solution of minimax loss that
may produce redundant features, we present a Feature Redundancy Loss (FRL)
based on normalized inner product between each selected feature map pair to
complement the proposed minimax loss. Superior experimental results on several
influential benchmarks along with visualization show that our method gives full
play to the performance of the baseline model without additional computation
and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art models.

field has an exponential as $V=M^{4}\exp(\frac{\alpha\phi}{M_{pl}})$ and an
exponential coupling to the matter density component of the Universe as
$\rho_{m}\exp(\frac{\beta\phi}{M_{pl}})$. We finds the relations between the
four (in principle free) parameters of the model and the first five
cosmographic parameters (which can be written in terms of the Hubble parameter
and its first four derivatives). If such cosmographic parameter are known then
the we present the algebraic relations which can be used to derive the free
parameters in terms of the cosmographic ones. We show that, determining the
third derivative of scale factor $Q$ is of great importance if the chameleon
parameter $\beta$ and coupling constant $\alpha$ are known. On the other hand,
if nothing can be proposed about $(\alpha,\beta)$, reconstructing the free
parameters of the model can be done by measuring the first five derivatives of
the scale factor and testing the validity of theory is only possible by its
first six derivatives, so that the parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$ will also be
determined automatically. We also find relation between cosmographic parameters

random excitations/noise, and is often described by systems of random or
stochastic ordinary differential equations. Such systems admit a distribution
of solutions, which is (partially) characterized by the single-time joint

calculate such information-theoretic quantities as the mutual information

diffraction images that provide shape, size and orientation of the grains,
allowing a direct comparison between virtual and real experiments. An
optimisation algorithm is used to find the model parameters that reproduce the
evolution of the average strain in each grain as the load is increased. A
tensile bar, containing four grains aligned with the load direction, is used to
calibrate the model with eight unknown parameters. The approach is then
independently validated by simulating the strain distribution in a second

evaluated. The latent hardening of the most active twin system turns out to be
determined by coplanar twins and slip. The hardening rate of the most active

the solution only. A key issue in this problem is to robustly estimate the
derivatives of a function from noisy observations of only the function values
at given location points, under the assumption of a physical model in the form
of differential equation governing the function and its derivatives. To address
the key issue, we use the Gaussian Process Regression with Constraint (GPRC)
method which jointly model the solution, the derivatives, and the parametric
differential equation, to estimate the solution and its derivatives. For
nonlinear differential equations, a Picard-iteration-like approximation of
linearization method is used so that the GPRC can be still iteratively
applicable. A new potential which combines the data and equation information,
is proposed and used in the likelihood for our inference. With numerical

  Adversarial Learning","Accepted to IEEE TCSVT",,"10.1109/TCSVT.2020.3039522",,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The emerging vision-and-language navigation (VLN) problem aims at learning to
navigate an agent to the target location in unseen photo-realistic environments
according to the given language instruction. The main challenges of VLN arise
mainly from two aspects: first, the agent needs to attend to the meaningful
paragraphs of the language instruction corresponding to the dynamically-varying
visual environments; second, during the training process, the agent usually
imitate the shortest-path to the target location. Due to the discrepancy of
action selection between training and inference, the agent solely on the basis
of imitation learning does not perform well. Sampling the next action from its
predicted probability distribution during the training process allows the agent
to explore diverse routes from the environments, yielding higher success rates.
Nevertheless, without being presented with the shortest navigation paths during
the training process, the agent may arrive at the target location through an
unexpected longer route. To overcome these challenges, we design a cross-modal
grounding module, which is composed of two complementary attention mechanisms,
to equip the agent with a better ability to track the correspondence between
the textual and visual modalities. We then propose to recursively alternate the
learning schemes of imitation and exploration to narrow the discrepancy between
training and inference. We further exploit the advantages of both these two
learning schemes via adversarial learning. Extensive experimental results on
the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed learning
scheme is generalized and complementary to prior arts. Our method performs well
against state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

sets modulo prime powers. We focus on the complexity of finding a p-ordering

  Our first algorithm gives a p-ordering for set of size n in time O(nk\log p),

while not needing to merge their data contents physically has been an area of
active research. In this paper, we present a solution to benefit from a
distributed data setup in the case of training deep learning architectures by
making use of a smart contract system. Specifically, we propose a mechanism
that aggregates together the intermediate representations obtained from local
ANN models over a blockchain. Training of local models takes place on their
respective data. The intermediate representations derived from them, when
combined and trained together on the host node, helps to get a more accurate
system. While federated learning primarily deals with the same features of data
where the number of samples being distributed on multiple nodes, here we are
dealing with the same number of samples but with their features being
distributed on multiple nodes. We consider the task of bank loan prediction
wherein the personal details of an individual and their bank-specific details
may not be available at the same place. Our aggregation mechanism helps to
train a model on such existing distributed data without having to share and
concatenate together the actual data values. The obtained performance, which is
better than that of individual nodes, and is at par with that of a centralized
data setup makes a strong case for extending our technique across other
architectures and tasks. The solution finds its application in organizations
that want to train deep learning models on vertically partitioned data.

tiled with $k\times k$ squares for any fixed $k$ which can be part of the input
(that is, deciding if $P$ is the union of a set of non-overlapping $k\times k$
squares) and one for packing $P$ with a maximum number of non-overlapping and
axis-parallel $2\times 1$ dominos, allowing rotations by $90^\circ$. As packing
is more general than tiling, the latter algorithm can also be used to decide if
$P$ can be tiled by $2\times 1$ dominos.
  These are classical problems with important applications in VLSI design, and
the related problem of finding a maximum packing of $2\times 2$ squares is

$m_{\rho}^{s_z}(\omega)=m_\rho(\omega=0)-\omega s_z$, similar to the Zeeman

  free energy computation",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech math.OC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The computation of free energies is a common issue in statistical physics. A
natural technique to compute such high dimensional integrals is to resort to
Monte Carlo simulations. However these techniques generally suffer from a high
variance in the low temperature regime, because the expectation is often
dominated by high values corresponding to rare system trajectories. A standard
way to reduce the variance of the estimator is to modify the drift of the
dynamics with a control enhancing the probability of rare event, leading to
so-called importance sampling estimators. In theory, the optimal control leads
to a zero-variance estimator; it is however defined implicitly and computing it
is of the same difficulty as the original problem. We propose here a general
strategy to build approximate optimal controls in the small temperature limit
for diffusion processes, with the first goal to reduce the variance of free
energy Monte Carlo estimators. Our construction builds upon low noise
asymptotics by expanding the optimal control around the instanton, which is the
path describing most likely fluctuations at low temperature. This technique not
only helps reducing variance, but it is also interesting as a theoretical tool
since it differs from usual small temperature expansions (WKB ansatz). As a
complementary consequence of our expansion, we provide a perturbative formula
for computing the free energy in the small temperature regime, which refines
the now standard Freidlin--Wentzell asymptotics. We compute this expansion
explicitly for lower orders, and explain how our strategy can be extended to an
arbitrary order of accuracy. We support our findings with illustrative
numerical examples.

among electrical elements, which enables unidirectional transmission of
electrical wave. In this paper, we explore and exploit the interaction of a
piezoelectric beam with a one-way electrical transmission line to facilitate
nonreciprocal transmission of elastic wave in the linear fashion. Theoretical
dispersion analysis and numerical simulations are performed to reveal
transmission behaviors of elastic wave in the presented piezoelectric
metastructure. It is uncovered that, when the one-way electrical coupling
feature is introduced, local-resonance bandgaps are maintained in opposite
directions of the piezoelectric metastructure. However, the bandgap attenuation
capability in one direction is increased compared to conventional
local-resonance metastructures, in which no electrical coupling exists between
cells, while that in the other direction is decreased. Therefore, nonreciprocal
transmission of elastic wave emerges in this system due to the distinct bandgap
attenuation capability. It is also revealed that this sort of nonreciprocal
wave attenuation capability is adaptive with the one-way electrical coupling
coefficient and the resistance of electrical cells. An experimental set-up of
the piezoelectric metastructure is built and experimental results verify the
nonreciprocity property and its adaptiveness. Overall, the presented
piezoelectric metastructure provides a linear and concise approach to realize
adaptive nonreciprocal transmission of elastic wave.

such as certain oils, the droplet surprisingly vanishes, even in a confined
geometry. Such a phenomenon has crucial consequences for multiphase flows in
which confined nano- and/or picoliter droplets are considered. We report here
experiments of microdroplet dissolution in microchannels that reveal an
enhancement of the shrinkage of confined water microdroplets in oil due to the
permeability of the walls - made of polydimethilsiloxane (PDMS) - and a delay
when collective effects are present. The system is first modelled assuming that
the dissolution of the droplets in its surrounding liquid follows the
Epstein-Plesset solution of the diffusion equation. The dissolution of small
isolated droplets can indeed be described by this solution of the diffusion
equation, while the vanishing of droplets larger than a certain critical value
and those closer to other droplets requires numerical simulations which take
into account the boundary conditions of the confined system, the neighbouring
droplets and interestingly, the evaporative water vapour flux through the PDMS.
Our results thus reveal the important role of the water solubility in oil and
most remarkably, of the water vapour transport through permeable walls.

external factors. Therefore, based on the assumption that introducing external

attributes and static attributes and design an attribute-augmented unit to
encode and integrate those factors into the spatiotemporal graph convolution
model. Experiments on real datasets show the effectiveness of considering
external information on traffic forecasting tasks when compared to traditional

challenging task. In this paper, a robust unsupervised approach is proposed for
small area change detection from multi-temporal SAR images using deep learning.
First, a multi-scale superpixel reconstruction method is developed to generate
a difference image (DI), which can suppress the speckle noise effectively and
enhance edges by exploiting local, spatially homogeneous information. Second, a
two-stage centre-constrained fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is proposed to
divide the pixels of the DI into changed, unchanged and intermediate classes
with a parallel clustering strategy. Image patches belonging to the first two
classes are then constructed as pseudo-label training samples, and image
patches of the intermediate class are treated as testing samples. Finally, a
convolutional wavelet neural network (CWNN) is designed and trained to classify
testing samples into changed or unchanged classes, coupled with a deep
convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to increase the number of
changed class within the pseudo-label training samples. Numerical experiments
on four real SAR datasets demonstrate the validity and robustness of the
proposed approach, achieving up to 99.61% accuracy for small area change

(PCA) shows excellent properties for dimensionality reduction. It is a serious
problem that PCA is sensitive to outliers, which has been improved by numerous
Robust PCA (RPCA) versions. However, the existing state-of-the-art RPCA
approaches cannot easily remove or tolerate outliers by a non-iterative manner.
To tackle this issue, this paper proposes Angular Embedding (AE) to formulate a
straightforward RPCA approach based on angular density, which is improved for
large scale or high-dimensional data. Furthermore, a trimmed AE (TAE) is
introduced to deal with data with large scale outliers. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets with vector-level or pixel-level
outliers demonstrate that the proposed AE/TAE outperforms the state-of-the-art
RPCA based methods.

of high-quality datasets and associated benchmarks. However, these
benchmarks---such as ILSVRC---are relatively task-specific, focusing
predominately on predicting class labels. We introduce a publicly-available
dataset that embodies the task-general capabilities of human perception and
reasoning. The Human Similarity Judgments extension to ImageNet (ImageNet-HSJ)
is composed of human similarity judgments that supplement the ILSVRC validation
set. The new dataset supports a range of task and performance metrics,
including the evaluation of unsupervised learning algorithms. We demonstrate
two methods of assessment: using the similarity judgments directly and using a
psychological embedding trained on the similarity judgments. This embedding
space contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous
efforts based on human judgments. Scaling to the full 50,000 image set was made
possible through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian
inference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that
were most uncertain. This methodological innovation not only enables scaling,
but should also improve the quality of solutions by focusing sampling where it
is needed. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity
ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models
conform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that more complex models
that perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human
semantic judgments. In addition to the human similarity judgments, pre-trained
psychological embeddings and code for inferring variational embeddings are made
publicly available. Collectively, ImageNet-HSJ assets support the appraisal of
internal representations and the development of more human-like models.

In these systems, the measured time series is invariably contaminated by noise.
As the extreme events display large deviation from the mean behaviour, the
noise does not affect the extreme events as much as it affects the typical
values. Since the extreme events also carry the information about correlations
in the full time series, they can be used to infer the correlation properties
of the latter. In this work, from a given time series, we construct three
modified time series using only the extreme events. It is shown that the
correlations in the original time series and in the modified time series, as
measured by the exponent obtained from detrended fluctuation analysis

stimulation of exciton-polaritons via spin-valley locking in a WS2 monolayer

efficiently populate their ground state and induce a valley-dependent bosonic

polariton emission from the valley-dependent ground state. Our finding paves

the power of the signal. To overcome the low-SNRs, hundreds of thousands of
particle projections acquired over several days of data collection are averaged
in 3D to determine the structure of interest. Meanwhile, recent image
super-resolution (SR) techniques based on neural networks have shown state of
the art performance on natural images. Building on these advances, we present a
multiple-image SR algorithm based on deep internal learning designed
specifically to work under low-SNR conditions. Our approach leverages the
internal image statistics of cryo-EM movies and does not require training on
ground-truth data. When applied to a single-particle dataset of apoferritin, we

extract the exact eigenvalues of a macroscopically large set of pinned
localized excitations in a Cayley tree fractal network. Within a tight binding
scheme we exploit the above method to scrutinize the effect of a deterministic
deformation of the network, first through a hierarchical distribution in the
values of the nearest neighbor hopping integrals, and then through a radial
Aubry Andre Harper quasiperiodic modulation. With increasing generation index,
the inflating loop less tree structure hosts pinned eigenstates on the
peripheral sites that spread from the outermost rings into the bulk of the
sample, resembling the spread of a forest fire, lighting up a predictable set
of sites and leaving the rest unignited. The penetration depth of the envelope
of amplitudes can be precisely engineered. The quasiperiodic modulation yields
hitherto unreported quantum butterflies, which have further been investigated
by calculating the inverse participation ratio for the eigenstates, and a
multifractal analysis. The applicability of the scheme to photonic fractal
waveguide networks is discussed at the end.

benefiting from the invention of deep networks and its successive
breakthroughs. However, it is acknowledged that deep learning and deep neural
networks are difficult to interpret. SR networks inherit this mysterious nature
and little works make attempt to understand them. In this paper, we perform
attribution analysis of SR networks, which aims at finding the input pixels
that strongly influence the SR results. We propose a novel attribution approach
called local attribution map (LAM), which inherits the integral gradient method
yet with two unique features. One is to use the blurred image as the baseline
input, and the other is to adopt the progressive blurring function as the path
function. Based on LAM, we show that: (1) SR networks with a wider range of
involved input pixels could achieve better performance. (2) Attention networks
and non-local networks extract features from a wider range of input pixels. (3)
Comparing with the range that actually contributes, the receptive field is
large enough for most deep networks. (4) For SR networks, textures with regular
stripes or grids are more likely to be noticed, while complex semantics are
difficult to utilize. Our work opens new directions for designing SR networks
and interpreting low-level vision deep models.

due to the following reasons: First, there exists a wide variety of video game
genres, many of which are not concretely defined. Second, video game covers
vary in many different ways such as colors, styles, textual information, etc,
even for games of the same genre. Third, cover designs and textual descriptions

the cover designers and typographers push the cover designs to its limit in the
hope of attracting sales. The computer-based automatic video game genre
classification systems become a particularly exciting research topic in recent
years. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to solve
this problem. The contribution of this paper is four-fold. First, we compiles a

image-based and text-based, state-of-the-art models are evaluated thoroughly
for the task of genre classification for video games. Third, we developed an
efficient and salable multi-modal framework based on both images and texts.
Fourth, a thorough analysis of the experimental results is given and future
works to improve the performance is suggested. The results show that the
multi-modal framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art image-based or
text-based models. Several challenges are outlined for this task. More efforts

  Applications Development","10 Pages, Accepted to appear in 54th Hawaii International Conference
  on System Sciences, 2021",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ubiquity of mobile applications (apps) in daily life raises the
imperative that the apps should reflect users' values. However, users' values
are not usually taken into account in app development. Thus there is
significant potential for user dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic
consequences. To be cognizant of values in apps, the first step is to find out
what those values are, and that was the objective of this study conducted in
Bangladesh. Our focus was on rural women, specifically female farmers. The
basis for our study was Schwartz's universal human values theory, and we used
an associated survey instrument, the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). Our
survey of 193 Bangladeshi female farmers showed that Conformity and Security
were regarded as the most important values, while Power, Hedonism, and
Stimulation were the least important. This finding would be helpful for
developers to take into account when developing agriculture apps for this
market. In addition, the methodology we used provides a model to follow to
elicit the values of apps' users in other communities.

  University, in 2015",,"10.13140/RG.2.2.14059.95526",,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This thesis work presents an architectural design of a system to bring
non-repudiation concept into the IP based digital voice conversations (VoIP) in
LTE and UMTS networks, using electronic signatures, by considering a
centralized approach. Moreover, functionalities and technical methods to
support such a system are researched. Last but not least, ways to introduce
this system as a public and commercial service are discussed. Non-repudiation
concept provided by electronic signatures and related cryptographic functions,
as introduced in this study, allow using digital records of these voice
conversations as legally binding statements or proofs likewise and even instead
of traditional wet signatures. The system is designed as a subsystem to IMS
based 3G and 4G networks and maximum compatibility with current configurations,
components and interfaces of these networks is intended. On the other hand
non-repudiation is achieved by special signature, storage and verification
units located in the IMS core network. Voice data is proposed to be processed
in MRF unit of the IMS. Additionally, a USSD/USSI based special solution to
initiate these signed calls is developed. According to the proposed scheme;
during a signed call, two unidirectional voice streams originating from two
parties of the call, which are transferred in IP and UDP encapsulated RTP
packages, are received by the signature unit and interweaved using their
arrival times, so that they become a unified stream. Signature unit generates
hashes of groups of received packages and signs them using PKI algorithms and
applying hash/signature chaining to increase integrity protection and to
empower non-repudiation. Then, it forwards packages and signature information
to the storage unit. Storage unit keeps all the call records, signature data
and metadata of these calls. Verification unit later gathers relevant data from
the storage unit...

Similarities and dissimilarities of the languages can be measured by analyzing
the extracted features of the numerals. Handwritten numeral datasets are
available and accessible for many renowned languages of different regions. In
this paper, several handwritten numeral datasets of different languages are
collected. Then they are used to find the similarity among those written
languages through determining and comparing the similitude of each handwritten
numerals. This will help to find which languages have the same or adjacent
parent language. Firstly, a similarity measure of two numeral images is
constructed with a Siamese network. Secondly, the similarity of the numeral
datasets is determined with the help of the Siamese network and a new random
sample with replacement similarity averaging technique. Finally, an
agglomerative clustering is done based on the similarities of each dataset.
This clustering technique shows some very interesting properties of the
datasets. The property focused in this paper is the regional resemblance of the
datasets. By analyzing the clusters, it becomes easy to identify which
languages are originated from similar regions.
