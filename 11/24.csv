  Model",,"IJCAI-PRICAI2020",,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research indicates that pretraining cross-lingual language models on
large-scale unlabeled texts yields significant performance improvements over
various cross-lingual and low-resource tasks. Through training on one hundred
languages and terabytes of texts, cross-lingual language models have proven to
be effective in leveraging high-resource languages to enhance low-resource
language processing and outperform monolingual models. In this paper, we
further investigate the cross-lingual and cross-domain (CLCD) setting when a
pretrained cross-lingual language model needs to adapt to new domains.
Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised feature decomposition method that
can automatically extract domain-specific features and domain-invariant
features from the entangled pretrained cross-lingual representations, given
unlabeled raw texts in the source language. Our proposed model leverages mutual
information estimation to decompose the representations computed by a
cross-lingual model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts.
Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant
performance improvements over the state-of-the-art pretrained cross-lingual
language model in the CLCD setting. The source code of this paper is publicly

sub-hypergraph on $d$-uniform hypergraphs. This fundamental problem appears in
different contexts, e.g., community detection, average-case complexity, and
neuroscience applications as a structural variant of tensor-PCA problem. We
provide tight \emph{information-theoretic} upper and lower bounds for the exact
recovery threshold by the maximum-likelihood estimator, as well as
\emph{algorithmic} bounds based on approximate message passing algorithms. The
problem exhibits a typical statistical-to-computational gap observed in
analogous sparse settings that widen with increasing sparsity of the problem.
The bounds show that the signal structure impacts the location of the
statistical and computational phase transition that the known existing bounds
for the tensor-PCA model do not capture. This effect is due to the generic
planted signal prior that this latter model addresses.

these matrices arise naturally when analyzing a number of different algorithmic
tasks such as kernel methods, neural network training, natural language

use our new technique along with these connections to prove several new
structural results in these areas, including:
  $\bullet$ A function is a positive definite Manhattan kernel if and only if
it is a completely monotone function. These kernels are widely used across
machine learning; one example is the Laplace kernel which is widely used in
machine learning for chemistry.
  $\bullet$ A function transforms Manhattan distances to Manhattan distances if
and only if it is a Bernstein function. This completes the theory of Manhattan
to Manhattan metric transforms initiated by Assouad in 1980.
  $\bullet$ A function applied entry-wise to any square matrix of rank $r$
always results in a matrix of rank $< 2^{r-1}$ if and only if it is a
polynomial of sufficiently low degree. This gives a converse to a key lemma
used by the polynomial method in algorithm design.

simplify things both conceptually and computationally. That ultimately enabled
us to solve a large set of classical optimization problems on a very large

eigen states of finite first moment matrices. Their hybridization and
orientation can be a-priori tunned as per their anticipated neighbourhood.
Their Wannier function counterparts constructed from the Kohn-Sham(KS) single
particle states constitute an orthonormal multi-orbital tight-binding(TB) basis
resembling hybrid atomic-orbitals locked to their immediate atomic
neighborhood, while spanning the subs-space of KS states. The proposed basis
thus not only renders predominantly single TB parameters from first-principles
for each nearest neighbour bonds involving no more than two orbitals
irrespective of their orientation, but also facilitate an easy route for
transfer of such TB parameters across isostructural systems exclusively through
mapping of neighbourhoods and projection of orbital charge centres. With
hybridized 2s,2p and 3s,3p valence electrons, the spatial extent of self-energy
correction(SEC) to TB parameters in the proposed basis are found to be
localized mostly within the third nearest neighbourhood, thus allowing
effective transfer of self-energy corrected TB parameters from smaller
reference systems to much larger target systems, with nominal additional
computational cost beyond that required for explicit computation of SEC in the
reference systems. The proposed approach promises inexpensive estimation of
quasi-particle structure of large covalent systems with workable accuracy.

discuss the most fundamental CLuP concepts. On the other hand, in our companion
paper \cite{Stojniccluplargesc20} we started the story of going into a bit
deeper details that relate to many of other remarkable CLuP properties with
some of them reaching well beyond the basic fundamentals. Namely,
\cite{Stojniccluplargesc20} discusses how a somewhat silent RDT feature (its
algorithmic power) can be utilized to ensure that CLuP can be run on very large
problem instances as well. In particular, applying CLuP to the famous MIMO ML
detection problem we showed in \cite{Stojniccluplargesc20} that its a large
scale variant, $\text{CLuP}^{r_0}$, can handle with ease problems with
\textbf{\emph{several thousands}} of unknowns with theoretically minimal
complexity per iteration (only a single matrix-vector multiplication suffices).
In this paper we revisit MIMO ML detection and discuss another remarkable
phenomenon that emerges within the CLuP structure, namely the so-called
\bl{\textbf{\emph{rephasing}}}. As MIMO ML enters the so-called low $\alpha$
regime (fat system matrix with ratio of the number of rows and columns,
$\alpha$, going well below $1$) it becomes increasingly difficult even for the
basic standard CLuP to handle it. However, the discovery of the rephasing
ensures that CLuP remains on track and preserves its ability to achieve the ML
performance. To demonstrate the power of the rephasing we also conducted quite
a few numerical experiments, compared the results we obtained through them to
the theoretical predictions, and observed an excellent agreement.

golden rule the decay process is prevented when the atomic resonance frequency
falls in a stop band of the lattice, while time-reversal symmetry ensures that
the spontaneously emitted photon has equal probability to propagate in opposite
directions of the array. This scenario is drastically modified when the quantum
emitter drifts along the lattice at a constant speed. In the waveguide optics
analogue the atomic drift is emulated by the introduction of a slight geometric
tilt of the waveguide axis from the lattice axis. In this setting light
excitation in the array is chiral, i.e. light propagates in a preferred

error, represents an important step in improving the theoretical prediction for
Deuterium produced in the early universe. In view of this recent result, we
present in this paper a full analysis of its abundance, which includes a new
critical study of the impact of the other two main processes for Deuterium
burning, namely the deuteron-deuteron transfer reactions, D(d,p)3H and
D(d,n)3He. In particular, emphasis is given to the statistical method of
analysis of experimental data, to a quantitative study of the theoretical

primordial nucleosynthesis stage with the Planck experiment results on the
baryon density Omegab h2 and the effective number of neutrino parameter Neff,
as function of the assumed value of the 4He mass fraction Yp. While after the
LUNA results, the value of Deuterium is quite precisely fixed, and points to a
value of the baryon density in excellent agreement with the Planck result, a
combined analysis also including Helium leads to two possible scenarios with
different predictions for Omegab h2 and Neff. We argue that new experimental
results on the systematics and the determination of Yp would be of great

classification, multilabel classification, attention mechanisms, etc. However,
its efficacy is often questioned in literature. The log-softmax loss has been
shown to belong to a more generic class of loss functions, called spherical
family, and its member log-Taylor softmax loss is arguably the best alternative
in this class. In another approach which tries to enhance the discriminative
nature of the softmax function, soft-margin softmax (SM-softmax) has been
proposed to be the most suitable alternative. In this work, we investigate
Taylor softmax, SM-softmax and our proposed SM-Taylor softmax, an amalgamation
of the earlier two functions, as alternatives to softmax function. Furthermore,
we explore the effect of expanding Taylor softmax up to ten terms (original
work proposed expanding only to two terms) along with the ramifications of
considering Taylor softmax to be a finite or infinite series during
backpropagation. Our experiments for the image classification task on different
datasets reveal that there is always a configuration of the SM-Taylor softmax
function that outperforms the normal softmax function and its other
alternatives.

authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and
when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully
rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an
exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible.
Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an
important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the
political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection
theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and
develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime
to a critical one. A new sequential test -- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic
sequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available
COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST
is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off
between average decision delay $\Delta$ and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely
proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary
restrictive measures. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as
possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the
same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales
exponentially with the delay, $R \sim \exp{(-\omega \Delta)}$, where $\omega$
depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one
possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of
countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects
the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to three weeks,
much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident.

accommodates the underlying geometry of the indefinite Minkowski space metric,
together with its symmetry group. A unitary representation of the 15-parameter
group of conformal transformations can then be constructed that acts upon the
Hilbert space of square-integrable holomorphic functions on the future tube.
These structures are enough to allow one to put forward a quantum theory of
phase-space events. In particular, a theory of quantum measurement can be
formulated in a relativistic setting, based on the use of positive operator
valued measures, for the detection of phase-space events, hence allowing one to
assign probabilities to the outcomes of joint space-time and four-momentum

atmospheric dynamics and thermal contrasts, and thus their real impact on
spectra. The main goal of this study is to understand the formation,
distribution and observational consequences of water clouds on K2-18b and other
temperate sub-Neptunes. We simulated the atmospheric dynamics, water cloud
formation and spectra of K2-18b for H2-dominated atmosphere using a 3D GCM. We
analysed the impact of atmospheric composition (with metallicity from 1*solar
to 1000*solar), concentration of cloud condensation nuclei and planetary
rotation rate. Assuming that K2-18b has a synchronous rotation, we show that
the atmospheric circulation in the upper atmosphere essentially corresponds to
a symmetric day-to-night circulation. This regime preferentially leads to cloud
formation at the substellar point or at the terminator. Clouds form for
metallicity >100*solar with relatively large particles. For 100-300*solar
metallicity, the cloud fraction at the terminators is small with a limited
impact on transit spectra. For 1000*solar metallicity, very thick clouds form
at the terminator. The cloud distribution appears very sensitive to the
concentration of CCN and to the planetary rotation rate. Fitting HST transit
data with our simulated spectra suggests a metallicity of ~100-300*solar. In
addition, we found that the cloud fraction at the terminator can be highly
variable, leading to a potential variability in transit spectra. This effect
could be common on cloudy exoplanets and could be detectable with multiple
transit observations.

method is validated by the proposed planar 3D res-u-net network with encoder
transferred from the 2D VGG-16, which is applied for a single-stage unbalanced
3D image data segmentation. In particular, we evaluate the method on the MICCAI
2016 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset utilizing solely fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence without brain extraction for training and
inference to simulate real medical praxis. The planar 3D res-u-net network
performed the best both in sensitivity and Dice score amongst end to end
methods processing raw MRI scans and achieved comparable Dice score to a
state-of-the-art unimodal not end to end approach. Complete source code was
released under the open-source license, and this paper complies with the
Machine learning reproducibility checklist. By implementing practical transfer
learning for 3D data representation, we could segment heavily unbalanced data
without selective sampling and achieved more reliable results using less
training data in a single modality. From a medical perspective, the unimodal
approach gives an advantage in real praxis as it does not require
co-registration nor additional scanning time during an examination. Although
modern medical imaging methods capture high-resolution 3D anatomy scans
suitable for computer-aided detection system processing, deployment of
automatic systems for interpretation of radiology imaging is still rather
theoretical in many medical areas. Our work aims to bridge the gap by offering
a solution for partial research questions.

the Magellan-TESS Survey (MTS), which uses Magellan II/PFS to obtain radial

obtain due to host star faintness and low RV semi-amplitudes, and challenging
to interpret due to the potential biases in target selection and observation
planning decisions. The MTS attempts to minimize these biases by focusing on
bright TESS targets and employing a quantitative selection function and
observing strategy. In this paper, we (1) describe our motivation and survey
strategy, (2) present our first catalog of planet density constraints for 27

presence of a refractory organic mantle is necessary. The outflows of AGB stars
are among the main contributors of stellar dust to the ISM. We present the
first study of the refractory organic contribution of AGB stars to the ISM.
Based on laboratory experiments, we included a new reaction in our extended
chemical kinetics model: the photoprocessing of volatile complex ices into
inert refractory organic material. The refractory organic feedback of AGB
outflows to the ISM is estimated using observationally motivated parent species
and grids of models of C-rich and O-rich outflows. Refractory organic material
is mainly inherited from the gas phase through accretion onto the dust and
subsequent photoprocessing. Grain-surface chemistry, initiated by
photodissociation of ices, produces only a minor part and takes place in a
sub-monolayer regime in almost all outflows. The formation of refractory
organic material increases with outflow density and depends on the initial
gas-phase composition. While O-rich dust is negligibly covered by refractory
organics, C-rich dust has an average coverage of $3-9\%$, but can be as high as
$8-22\%$. Although C-rich dust does not enter the ISM bare, its average
coverage is too low to influence its evolution in the ISM or significantly
contribute to the coverage of interstellar dust. This study opens up questions
on the coverage of other dust-producing environments. It highlights the need
for an improved understanding of dust formation and for models specific to
density structures within the outflow.

sub-optimality gap for the optimal action-value function. More specifically,
under the linear MDP assumption (Jin et al. 2019), the LSVI-UCB algorithm can
achieve $\tilde{O}(d^{3}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot \log(T))$ regret; and

tissues have heterogeneous RI distributions, causing sample-induced scattering
that degrades the fluorescence image quality. When both fluorescence and 3D RI
are measured, one can use the RI information to digitally correct
multiple-scattering effects in the fluorescence image. Here, we develop a new
computational multi-modal imaging method based on epi-mode microscopy that
reconstructs both 3D fluorescence and 3D RI from a single dataset. We acquire
dozens of fluorescence images, each 'illuminated' by a single fluorophore, then
solve an inverse problem with a multiple-scattering forward model. We
experimentally demonstrate our method for epi-mode 3D RI imaging and digital
correction of multiple-scattering effects in fluorescence images.

critical issue in the quest for primordial $B$-modes. A typical method to
proceed is to factorize and parametrize the spectral properties of foregrounds
and their scale dependence (i.e. assuming that foreground spectra are well
described everywhere by their sky average). Since in reality foreground
properties vary across the Galaxy, this assumption leads to inaccuracies in the
model that manifest themselves as biases in the final cosmological parameters
(in this case the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$). This is particularly relevant
for surveys over large fractions of the sky, such as the Simons Observatory
(SO), where the spectra should be modeled over a distribution of parameter
values. Here we propose a method based on the existing ``moment expansion''
approach to address this issue in a power-spectrum-based analysis that is
directly applicable in ground-based multi-frequency data. Additionally, the
method uses only a small set of parameters with simple physical interpretation,
minimizing the impact of foreground uncertainties on the final $B$-mode
constraints. We validate the method using SO-like simulated observations,
recovering an unbiased estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with standard
deviation $\sigma(r)\simeq0.003$, compatible with official forecasts. When
applying the method to the public BICEP2/Keck data, we find an upper bound
$r<0.06$ ($95\%\,{\rm C.L.}$), compatible with the result found by BICEP2/Keck
when parametrizing spectral index variations through a scale-independent
frequency decorrelation parameter. We also discuss the formal similarities
between the power spectrum-based moment expansion and methods used in the
analysis of CMB lensing.

that the low-temperature thermal transition to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid

of renormalization-group (RG) invariance is not fulfilled in current

and three-nucleon systems has remained unknown. In this work we present a first
and systematic study of recent RG-invariant formulations of $\chi$EFT and their
predictions for the binding energies and other observables of selected nuclear
systems with mass-numbers up to $A =16$. Specifically, we have carried out ab
initio no-core shell-model and coupled cluster calculations of the ground-state
energy of $^3$H, $^{3,4}$He, $^{6}$Li, and $^{16}$O using several recent
power-counting (PC) schemes at leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order

Our calculations indicate that RG-invariant and realistic predictions can be
obtained for nuclei with mass number $A \leq 4$. We find, however, that
$^{16}$O is either unbound with respect to the four $\alpha$-particle
threshold, or deformed, or both. Similarly, we find that the $^{6}$Li
ground-state resides above the $\alpha$-deuteron separation threshold. These
results are in stark contrast with experimental data and point to either
necessary fine-tuning of all relevant counterterms, or that current
state-of-the-art RG-invariant PC schemes at LO in $\chi$EFT lack necessary

the detrimental effect of non-zero delay times on the cooling performance.
Steady state entanglement generation in the blue sideband can also be assisted
by passive interferometric feedback, which allows one to stabilise otherwise
unstable systems, though active feedback (including squeezing elements) does
not help to this aim. We show that active feedback loops only allow for the

Therefore, projecting out those shared subspaces reduces the intra-class

method Projection onto Orthogonal Complement (POC). Our experiments demonstrate
that PSSC obtains the best results among all shallow clustering algorithms.
Moreover, it achieves comparable clustering performance to that of recent

binary data based on the Prentice (1988) estimating equations method that
extends the Liang and Zeger (1986) generalized estimating equations (GEE)
method to include additional estimating equations for the pairwise correlation
between binary variates. This extension allows for flexible modeling of both
the marginal mean and within-cluster correlation as a function of their
respective covariate risk factors. This paper provides an overview of the
extended estimating equations method, describes the features and capabilities
of the GEECORR macro, and applies the GEECORR macro to three different
datasets. In addition, this paper describes the more detailed fitting algorithm
proposed by Prentice (1988), of which a variation has been implemented in the
GEECORR macro. We provide a small simulation study to demonstrate the
efficiency of the detailed method for estimating correlation parameters.

  Currencies","Accepted for presentation at the European Control Conference 2021",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When people choose routes minimizing their individual delay, the aggregate
congestion can be much higher compared to that experienced by a
centrally-imposed routing. Yet centralized routing is incompatible with the
presence of self-interested agents. How can we reconcile the two? In this paper
we address this question within a repeated game framework and propose a fair
incentive mechanism based on artificial currencies that routes selfish agents
in a system-optimal fashion, while accounting for their temporal preferences.
We instantiate the framework in a parallel-network whereby agents commute
repeatedly (e.g., daily) from a common start node to the end node. Thereafter,
we focus on the specific two-arcs case whereby, based on an artificial
currency, the agents are charged when traveling on the first, fast arc, whilst
they are rewarded when traveling on the second, slower arc. We assume the
agents to be rational and model their choices through a game where each agent
aims at minimizing a combination of today's discomfort, weighted by their
urgency, and the average discomfort encountered for the rest of the period
(e.g., a week). We show that, if prices of artificial currencies are
judiciously chosen, the routing pattern converges to a system-optimal solution,
while accommodating the agents' urgency. We complement our study through
numerical simulations. Our results show that it is possible to achieve a
system-optimal solution whilst reducing the agents' perceived discomfort by
14-20% when compared to a centralized optimal but urgency-unaware policy.

  and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'18)",,,,"cs.GT cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible resources to agents is a
central task in many multiagent systems. Often, non-trivial envy-free
allocations do not exist, and, when they do, finding them can be
computationally hard. Classical envy-freeness requires that every agent likes
the resources allocated to it at least as much as the resources allocated to
any other agent. In many situations this assumption can be relaxed since agents
often do not even know each other. We enrich the envy-freeness concept by
taking into account (directed) social networks of the agents. Thus, we require
that every agent likes its own allocation at least as much as those of all its
(out)neighbors. This leads to a ""more local"" concept of envy-freeness. We also
consider a ""strong"" variant where every agent must like its own allocation more
than those of all its (out)neighbors.
  We analyze the classical and the parameterized complexity of finding
allocations that are complete and, at the same time, envy-free with respect to
one of the variants of our new concept. To this end, we study different
restrictions of the agents' preferences and of the social network structure. We
identify cases that become easier (from $\Sigma^\textrm{p}_2$-hard or NP-hard
to polynomial-time solvability) and cases that become harder (from
polynomial-time solvability to NP-hard) when comparing classical envy-freeness
with our graph envy-freeness. Furthermore, we spot cases where graph
envy-freeness is easier to decide than strong graph envy-freeness, and vice
versa. On the route to one of our fixed-parameter tractability results, we also
establish a connection to a directed and colored variant of the classical
SUBGRAPH ISOMORPHISM problem, thereby extending a known fixed-parameter
tractability result for the latter.

the thermal dependence of the electrical conductance, thermal conductance, and

the temperature range associated with the Kondo crossover. In this thermal
range, general arguments indicate that any equilibrium property's temperature
dependence should be a universal function of the ratio $T^{*}=T/T_{K}$, where
$T_{K}$ is the Kondo temperature. Considering the particle-hole symmetric,
spin-degenerate Anderson model, the zero-bias electrical conductance has
already been shown to map linearly onto a universal conductance through a

renormalization-group arguments, we calculate universal thermoelectric
transport coefficients that allow us to extend this result to the thermopower

to illustrate the physics in our findings. Applying the universal
thermoelectric coefficients to recent experimental results of the electrical
conductance and thermo-voltages versus $V_{gate}$, at different temperatures in
the Kondo regime, we calculate all the thermoelectric properties and obtain
simple analytical fitting functions that can be used to predict the

lack of large scale repositories of labeled training data. In our research we
aim to facilitate the use of online videos, which exists in ample quantity for
most activities and are much easier to label than sensor data, to simulate
labeled wearable motion sensor data. In previous work we already demonstrate
some preliminary results in this direction focusing on very simple, activity
specific simulation models and a single sensor modality (acceleration
norm)\cite{10.1145/3341162.3345590}. In this paper we show how we can train a
regression model on generic motions for both accelerometer and gyro signals and
then apply it to videos of the target activities to generate synthetic IMU data
(acceleration and gyro norms) that can be used to train and/or improve HAR
models. We demonstrate that systems trained on simulated data generated by our
regression model can come to within around 10% of the mean F1 score of a system
trained on real sensor data. Furthermore we show that by either including a
small amount of real sensor data for model calibration or simply leveraging the
fact that (in general) we can easily generate much more simulated data from
video than we can collect in terms of real sensor data the advantage of real
sensor data can be eventually equalized.

of causal orders. We classify these matrices using their characteristic

  distribution networks",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State estimation plays a key role in the transition from the passive to the
active operation of distribution systems, as it allows to monitor these
networks and, successively, to perform control actions. However, designing
state estimators for distribution systems carries a significant amount of
challenges. This is due to the physical complexity of the networks, e.g., phase
unbalance, and limited measurements. Furthermore, the features of the
distribution system present significant local variations, e.g., voltage level
and number and type of customers, which makes it hard to design a
""one-size-fits-all"" state estimator. The present paper introduces a unifying
framework that allows to easily implement and compare diverse unbalanced static
state estimation models. This is achieved by formulating state estimation as a
general constrained optimization problem. The advantages of this approach are
described and supported by numerical illustration on a large set of
distribution feeders. The framework is also implemented and made available
open-source.

we present an array of color-magnitude and color-color diagrams to further
characterize census members, and we provide polynomial fits to the bulk trends.
Using these characterizations, we assign each object a $T_{\rm eff}$ value and
judge sample completeness over bins of $T_{\rm eff}$ and spectral type. Except
for types $\ge$ T8 and $T_{\rm eff} <$ 600K, our census is statistically
complete to the 20-pc limit. We compare our measured space densities to
simulated density distributions and find that the best fit is a power law
($dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha = 0.6{\pm}0.1$. We find that the
evolutionary models of Saumon & Marley correctly predict the observed magnitude
of the space density spike seen at 1200K $< T_{\rm eff} <$ 1350K, believed to
be caused by an increase in the cooling timescale across the L/T transition.
Defining the low-mass terminus using this sample requires a more statistically
robust and complete sample of dwarfs $\ge$Y0.5 and with $T_{\rm eff} <$ 400K.
We conclude that such frigid objects must exist in substantial numbers, despite
the fact that few have so far been identified, and we discuss possible reasons

also the whole spatiotemporal dynamics of the collision event. We study both
elastic and inelastic collisions between different kinds of mesons and also
more complex bound states of mesons, which one can interpret as an analog of
exotic particles such as the tetraquark in quantum chromodynamics. We argue
that our results not only apply to the specific studied spin model, but can be
readily extended to lattice gauge theories in a more general context. As the

(0.5M$_{\odot}$-0.8M$_{\odot}$), luminosity (50L$_{\odot}$-300L$_{\odot}$) and
effective temperature (full extent of the instability strip; in steps of 50K).
The total number of BL Her models with full-amplitude stable pulsations used in
this study is 10280 across the four sets of convection parameters. We obtain
their multiband ($UBVRIJHKLL'M$) light curves and derive new theoretical
period-luminosity ($PL$), period-Wesenheit ($PW$) and period-radius ($PR$)

Most empirical relations match well with the theoretical $PL$, $PW$ and $PR$
relations from the BL Her models computed using the four sets of convection
parameters. However, $PL$ slopes of the models with radiative cooling provide a
better match to empirical relations for BL Her stars in the LMC in the $HK_S$

significant in $U$ and $B$-bands and negligible in infrared bands, which is
consistent with empirical results. No significant metallicity effects are seen

building explainable classifiers from multi-variate time series data. A key
criterion to understand such predictive models involves elucidating and
quantifying the contribution of time varying input variables to the
classification. Hence, we introduce a novel, modular, convolution-based feature
extraction and attention mechanism that simultaneously identifies the variables
as well as time intervals which determine the classifier output. We present
results of extensive experiments with several benchmark data sets that show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on

poses a severe threat to the ecosystem and human health. Four different
ligninolytic fungi were studied as biodegradation candidates for the removal of
diuron. Among them, T. versicolor was the most effective species, degrading
rapidly not only diuron (83%) but also the major metabolite 3,4-dichloroaniline
(100%), after 7-day incubation. During diuron degradation, five transformation
products (TPs) were found to be formed and the structures for three of them are
tentatively proposed. According to the identified TPs, a hydroxylated
intermediate 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-hydroxymethyl-1-methylurea (DCPHMU) was
further metabolized into the N-dealkylated compounds
3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (DCPMU) and 3,4-dichlorophenylurea (DCPU).
The discovery of DCPHMU suggests a relevant role of hydroxylation for
subsequent N-demethylation, helping to better understand the main reaction
mechanisms of diuron detoxification. Experiments also evidenced that
degradation reactions may occur intracellularly and be catalyzed by the
cytochrome P450 system. A response surface method, established by central
composite design, assisted in evaluating the effect of operational variables in
a trickle-bed bioreactor immobilized with T. versicolor on diuron removal. The
best performance was obtained at low recycling ratios and influent flow rates.
Furthermore, results indicate that the contact time between the contaminant and
immobilized fungi plays a crucial role in diuron removal. This study represents
a pioneering step forward amid techniques for bioremediation of
pesticides-contaminated waters using fungal reactors at a real scale.

Smoothed pressure schemes produce excellent results in isolated hydrodynamics
tests; in more complex situations however, especially when coupling to the
`sub-grid' physics and multiple time-stepping used in many state-of-the-art
astrophysics simulations, these schemes produce large force errors that can
easily evade detection as they do not manifest as energy non-conservation. Here
two scenarios are evaluated: the injection of energy into the fluid (common for
stellar feedback) and radiative cooling. In the former scenario, force and
energy conservation errors manifest (of the same order as the injected energy),
and in the latter large force errors that change rapidly over a few timesteps
lead to instability in the fluid (of the same order as the energy lost to
cooling). Potential ways to remedy these issues are explored with solutions
generally leading to large increases in computational cost. Schemes using a
Density-based formulation do not create these instabilities and as such it is
recommended that they are preferred over Pressure-based solutions when combined
with an energy diffusion term to reduce errors at contact discontinuities.

the maximum dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm max}$) of FRBs for an ensemble that
includes bursts during the reionization. The DM$_{\rm max}$ provides
information regarding reionization much like the optical depth of the CMB to
Thomson scattering does, and it has the potential to be more accurate than
constraints from Planck, if DM$_{\rm max}$ can be measured to a precision
better than 500 $\mbox{pc cm}^{-3}$. Another method is to measure redshifts of
about 40 FRBs between z of 6-10 with$\sim10\%$ accuracy to obtain the average
electron density in 4 different z-bins with $\sim4\%$ accuracy. These two
methods don't require knowledge of the FRB luminosity function and its possible

in the number of FRBs per unit DM, given a fluence limited survey of FRBs that

that the contributions to DM from the FRB host galaxy $\&$ CGM during the

Attempts to break the geometrical degeneracy combining Planck data with
external datasets such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements all
point towards a spatially flat Universe, at the cost of significant tensions
with Planck, which make the resulting dataset combination problematic. Settling
this issue requires identifying a dataset which can break the geometrical
degeneracy while not incurring in these tensions. We argue that cosmic
chronometers (CC), measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ from the relative
ages of massive early-type passively evolving galaxies, are the dataset we are
after. Furthermore, CC come with the additional advantage of being virtually
free of cosmological model assumptions. Combining Planck 2018 CMB temperature
and polarization data with the latest CC measurements, we break the geometrical
degeneracy and find $\Omega_K=-0.0054 \pm 0.0055$, consistent with a spatially
flat Universe and competitive with the Planck+BAO constraint. Our results are
stable against minimal parameter space extensions and CC systematics, and we
find no substantial tension between Planck and CC data within a non-flat
Universe, making the resulting combination reliable. Our results allow us to
assert with confidence that the Universe is spatially flat to the ${\cal
O}(10^{-2})$ level, a finding which might possibly settle the ongoing spatial
curvature debate, and lends even more support to the already very successful

self-interactions that can influence the evolution of the superradiant
instability. As pointed out in arXiv:1604.06422 in the context of a toy model,
much of the existing literature on spin-0 superradiance does not take into
account the most important self-interaction-induced processes. These processes
lead to energy exchange between quasi-bound levels and particle emission to
infinity; for large self-couplings, superradiant growth is saturated at a
quasi-equilibrium configuration of reduced level occupation numbers. In this
paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the rich dynamics of spin-0
superradiance with self-interactions, and the resulting observational
signatures. We focus on quartic self-interactions, which dominate the evolution
for most models of interest. We explore multiple distinct regimes of parameter
space introduced by a non-zero self-interaction, including the simultaneous
population of two or more bound levels; at large coupling, we confirm the basic
picture of quasi-equilibrium saturation and provide evidence that the
""bosenova"" collapse does not occur in most of the astrophysical parameter
space. Compared to gravitational superradiance, we find that gravitational wave
""annihilation"" signals and black hole spin-down are parametrically suppressed
with increasing interactions, while new gravitational wave ""transition"" signals

emission is less suppressed at large couplings, and if the particle has

tracers algorithm to investigate whether the signatures of primordial magnetic
fields persist in galaxies throughout cosmic time. We simulate a Milky Way-like
galaxy in four scenarios: magnetised solely by primordial magnetic fields,
magnetised exclusively by SN-injected magnetic fields, and two combined
primordial + SN magnetisation cases. We find that once primordial magnetic
fields with a comoving strength $B_0 >10^{-12}$ G are considered, they remain
the primary source of galaxy magnetisation. Our magnetic tracers show that,
even combined with galactic sources of magnetisation, when primordial magnetic
fields are strong, they source the large-scale fields in the warm metal-poor
phase of the simulated galaxy. In this case, the circumgalactic and
intergalactic medium can be used to probe $B_0$ without risk of pollution by
magnetic fields originated in the galaxy. Furthermore, whether magnetic fields
are primordial or astrophysically-sourced can be inferred by studying local gas
metallicity. As a result, we predict that future state-of-the-art observational
facilities of magnetic fields in galaxies will have the potential to unravel

quantum fluctuations which vary among different causal (Hubble) patches. Such a
space dependence of the Higgs after the end of inflation leads to
space-dependent SM particle masses and hence variable efficiency of reheating,
when the inflaton decays to Higgsed SM particles. Inhomogeneous reheating
results in (observable) temperature anisotropies. Further, the resulting
temperature anisotropy spectrum acquires a significant non-Gaussian component,
which is constrained by $\textit{Planck}$ observations of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) and potentially detectable in next-generation experiments.
Constraints on this non-Gaussian signal largely exclude the possibility of the
observed temperature anisotropies arising primarily from Higgs effects. Hence,
in principle, observational searches for non-Gaussianity in the CMB can be used
to constrain the dynamics of the Higgs boson at very high (inflationary)
energies.

The formation of YMC precursor clouds may be difficult because a very compact

Recent observational studies suggest that YMCs can be formed as a consequence
of the fast HI gas collision with a velocity of ~100 km s^-1, which is the
typical velocity of the galaxy-galaxy interaction. In this study, we examine
whether the fast HI gas collision triggers YMC formation using

massive gravitationally bound gas clumps with M >10^4 M_sun and L~4 pc are

which massive gas clumps can evolve into YMCs. Our results show that the YMC

simulated on a classical computer, a result which is known as the
Gottesman-Knill theorem. However, an additional supply of magic states is
enough to promote them to a universal, fault-tolerant model for quantum
computing. To quantify the needed resources in terms of magic states, a
resource theory of magic has been developed. Stabiliser operations (SO) are
considered free within this theory, however they are not the most general class
of free operations. From an axiomatic point of view, these are the completely
stabiliser-preserving (CSP) channels, defined as those that preserve the convex
hull of stabiliser states. It has been an open problem to decide whether these
two definitions lead to the same class of operations. In this work, we answer
this question in the negative, by constructing an explicit counter-example.
This indicates that recently proposed stabiliser-based simulation techniques of
CSP maps are strictly more powerful than Gottesman-Knill-like methods. The
result is analogous to a well-known fact in entanglement theory, namely that

the accuracy of the solution, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\gamma$ is a

the corresponding optimal action can be recovered by solving a convex program.
The class of optimization problems to which our algorithm can be applied

mini-haloes hosting population (Pop) III stars and we show that, in PC regions,
the dominant stellar population changes from Pop III to Pop II at $z \gtrsim

a large classical ground-state space (CGSS). Quantum fluctuations may `select'
one of these ground states -- a phenomenon labeled `order by (quantum)
disorder' in literature. In this article, we examine the mechanism(s) by which
such state selection takes place. We argue that a magnet, at low energies, maps
to a particle moving on the CGSS. State selection corresponds to localization
of the particle at a certain point on this space. We distinguish two mechanisms
that can bring about localization. In the first, quantum fluctuations generate
a potential on the CGSS. If the potential has a deep enough minimum, then the
particle localizes in its vicinity. We denote this as `order by potential'
(ObP). In the second scenario, the particle localizes at a self-intersection
point due to bound-state formation -- a consequence of geometry and quantum
interference. Following recent studies by the present authors, we denote this
scenario as `order by singularity' (ObS). We place our discussion within the
context of the one-dimensional spin-$S$ Kitaev model. We map out its CGSS which
grows systematically with increasing system size. It resembles a network where
the number of nodes increases exponentially. In addition, the number of wires
that cross at each node also grows exponentially. This self-intersecting
structure leads to ObS, with the low-energy physics determined by a small
subset of the CGSS, consisting of `Cartesian' states. A contrasting picture
emerges when an additional XY antiferromagnetic coupling is introduced. The
CGSS simplifies dramatically, taking the form of a circle. Spin-wave
fluctuations generate a potential on this space, giving rise to state selection
by ObP under certain conditions. Apart from contrasting ObS and ObP, we discuss
the possibility of ObS in macroscopic magnets.

the proper $H$-graphs. The $H$-graphs are the intersection graphs of connected
subgraphs of a subdivision of a multigraph $H$, and the properness means that
the containment relationship between the representations of the vertices is
forbidden. The class of $H$-graphs was introduced as a natural (parameterized)
generalization of interval and circular-arc graphs by Bir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza
in 1992, and the proper $H$-graphs were introduced by Chaplick et al. in WADS
2019 as a generalization of proper interval and circular-arc graphs. For these
graph classes, $H$ may be seen as a structural parameter reflecting the
distance of a graph to a (proper) interval graph, and as such gained attention
as a structural parameter in the design of efficient algorithms. We show the
following results.
  - For a tree $T$ with $t$ nodes, it can be decided in $ 2^{\mathcal{O}(t^2
\log t)} \cdot n^3 $ time, whether an $n$-vertex graph $ G $ is a proper $ T
$-graph. For yes-instances, our algorithm outputs a proper $T$-representation.
This proves that the recognition problem for proper $H$-graphs, where $H$
required to be a tree, is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the
size of $T$. Previously only NP-completeness was known.
  - Contrasting to the first result, we prove that if $H$ is not constrained to
be a tree, then the recognition problem becomes much harder. Namely, we show

recognition accuracy at a low latency online recognition regime. We investigate
two approaches to multi-speaker model training of the RNN-T: deterministic
output-target assignment and permutation invariant training. We show that
guiding separation with speaker order labels in the former case enhances the
high-level speaker tracking capability of RNN-T. Apart from that, with
multistyle training on single- and multi-speaker utterances, the resulting
models gain robustness against ambiguous numbers of speakers during inference.
Our best model achieves a WER of 10.2% on simulated 2-speaker LibriSpeech data,
which is competitive with the previously reported state-of-the-art nonstreaming

Physics of ULIRGs with MUSE and ALMA (PUMA), which is a survey of 25 nearby (z

interferometer ALMA. This sample includes systems with both AGN and SB nuclear
activity in the pre- and post-coalescence phases of major mergers. The main
goals of the project are to study the prevalence of multi-phase outflows as a
function of the galaxy properties, to constrain the driving mechanisms of the
outflows (e.g. distinguish between SB and AGN winds), and to identify feedback
effects on the host galaxy. In this first paper, we present details on the
sample selection, MUSE observations, and derive first data products. MUSE data
were analysed to study the dynamical status of each of the 21 ULIRGs observed
so far, taking the stellar kinematics and the morphological properties inferred
from MUSE narrow-band images into account. We also located the ULIRG nuclei,
using near-IR (HST) and mm (ALMA) data, and studied their optical spectra to
infer the ionisation state through BPT diagnostics, and outflows in both
ionised and neutral gas. We show that the morphological and stellar kinematic
classifications are consistent: post-coalescence systems are more likely
associated with ordered motions, while interacting (binary) systems are
dominated by non-ordered and streaming motions. We also find broad and
asymmetric [OIII] and NaID profiles in almost all nuclear spectra, with line
widths in the range 300-2000 km/s, possibly associated with AGN- and SB-driven
winds. This result reinforces previous findings that indicated that outflows
are ubiquitous during the pre- and post-coalescence phases of major mergers.

long-term mass loss driven by the cooling planetary core, or the transition
between two fundamentally different planet formation modes as gas is lost from

that the large-scale stellar environment of a planetary system is a key factor

Relational data which are prevalent in enterprise applications are typically

joins to be provided as input to ML algorithms. In this paper, we study the
implementation of popular nonlinear ML models, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
and Neural Networks (NN), over normalized data addressing both cases of binary
and multi-way joins over normalized relations.
  For the case of GMM, we show how it is possible to decompose computation in a

mixture models. We demonstrate that by factoring the computation, one can
conduct the training of the models much faster compared to other applicable
approaches, without any loss in accuracy.

normalized data as the input. Similarly, we present algorithms that can conduct
the training of the network in a factorized way and offer performance
advantages. The redundancy introduced by denormalization can be exploited for
certain types of activation functions. However, we demonstrate that attempting
to explore this redundancy is helpful up to a certain point; exploring
redundancy at higher layers of the network will always result in increased
costs and is not recommended.

nearly smooth distribution of stars, and this leads to the creation of a gap.
The properties of such gaps depend on the parameters of the interaction. Their
characterisation could thus lead to the determination of the mass spectrum of
the perturbers and possibly reveal the existence of dark subhalos orbiting the
Milky Way. Our goal is to construct a fully analytical model of the formation
and evolution of gaps embedded in streams orbiting in a realistic Milky Way
potential. To this end, we extend the model of Helmi & Koppelman (2016) for
spherical potentials, and predict the properties of gaps in streams evolving in
axisymmetric St\""ackel potentials. We make use of action-angles and their
simple behaviour to calculate the divergence of initially nearby orbits
slightly perturbed by the interaction with a subhalo. Our model, corroborated
by N-body experiments, predicts that the size of a gap grows linearly with
time. We obtain analytical expressions for the dependencies of the growth rate
on the orbit of the stream, the properties of the subhalo (mass, scale-radius),
and the geometry of the encounter (relative velocity, impact parameter). We
find that the density at the centre of the gap decreases with time as a
power-law in the same way as the density of a stream. This results in the
density-contrast between a pristine and a perturbed stream on the same orbit
asymptotically reaching a constant value dependent only on the encounter
parameters. We find that at a fixed age, smallish gaps are sensitive mostly to
the mass of the subhalo, while gaps formed by subhalo flybys with a low
relative velocity, or when the stream and subhalo move parallel, are degenerate
to the encounter parameters.

These individuals also attend to a broader range of Trump's tweets than the
rest of the individuals we study. With respect to consumption, we note that
Trump's tweets are often viewed not in isolation, but rather in the context of
a set of algorithmically-curated replies. These replies may therefore color the
way Americans consume Trump's tweets. To this end, we find some evidence that
Twitter accounts see replies in line with their political leanings. However, we
show that this can be largely, although not entirely, attributed to the fact
that Twitter is more likely to show replies by accounts a user follows. As a
basis for comparison, all results for Trump are compared and contrasted with
replies to Joe Biden's tweets.

automatic differentiation to the coupled cluster with doubles method, in which

The benefit of this approach is that the l amplitudes can be obtained without

automatic differentiation. We further apply automatic differentiation to the
multicomponent coupled cluster with doubles method, which treats more than one

of total timeouts, along with other rule changes, to regulate the flow of the
game. With these rule changes, it becomes increasingly important for coaches to
effectively manage their timeouts. Understanding the utility of a timeout under
various game scenarios, e.g., during an opposing team's run, is of the utmost
importance. There are two schools of thought when the opposition is on a run:
(1) call a timeout and allow your team to rest and regroup, or (2) save a
timeout and hope your team can make corrections during play. This paper
investigates the credence of these tenets using the Rubin causal model
framework to quantify the causal effect of a timeout in the presence of an
opposing team's run. Too often overlooked, we carefully consider the stable
unit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA) in this context and use SUTVA to
motivate our definition of units. To measure the effect of a timeout, we
introduce a novel, interpretable outcome based on the score difference to
describe broad changes in the scoring dynamics. This outcome is well-suited for
situations where the quantity of interest fluctuates frequently, a commonality
in many sports analytics applications. We conclude from our analysis that while
comebacks frequently occur after a run, it is slightly disadvantageous to call
a timeout during a run by the opposing team and further demonstrate that the
magnitude of this effect varies by franchise.

present the performance analysis of the system for two different receive
diversity schemes - selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC),
in Nakagami-m fading. We also evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the CRS-NOMA
to determine the slope of the ergodic rate and diversity order. Our results
show that in contrast to the existing CRS-NOMA systems, the CRS-NOMA with
receive diversity outperforms its orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based
counterpart even in the low-SNR regime, by achieving higher ergodic rate.
Diversity analysis confirms that the CRS-NOMA achieves full diversity order
using both SC and MRC schemes, and this diversity order depends on both the
shape parameter m and the number of receive antennas. We also discuss the
problem of optimal power allocation for the minimization of the outage
probability of the system, and subsequently use this optimal value to obtain
the ergodic rate. An excellent match is observed between the numerical and the
analytical results, confirming the correctness of the derived analytical
expressions.

for a multitude of utilities and services. CPUs continue to scale up their raw
compute capabilities for DNN inference along with mature high performance
libraries to extract optimal performance. While general purpose CPUs offer
unique attractive advantages for DNN inference at both datacenter and edge,
they have primarily evolved to optimize single thread performance. For highly
parallel, throughput-oriented DNN inference, this results in inefficiencies in
both power and performance, impacting both raw performance scaling and overall
performance/watt.
  We present Proximu$\$$, where we systematically tackle the root
inefficiencies in power and performance scaling for CPU DNN inference.
Performance scales efficiently by distributing light-weight tensor compute near
all caches in a multi-level cache hierarchy. This maximizes the cumulative
utilization of the existing bandwidth resources in the system and minimizes
movement of data. Power is drastically reduced through simple ISA extensions
that encode the structured, loop-y workload behavior. This enables a bulk
offload of pre-decoded work, with loop unrolling in the light-weight near-cache
units, effectively bypassing the power-hungry stages of the wide Out-of-Order
(OOO) CPU pipeline.
  Across a number of DNN models, Proximu$\$$ achieves a 2.3x increase in
convolution performance/watt with a 2x to 3.94x scaling in raw performance.
Similarly, Proximu$\$$ achieves a 1.8x increase in inner-product
performance/watt with 2.8x scaling in performance. With no changes to the
programming model, no increase in cache capacity or bandwidth and minimal
additional hardware, Proximu$\$$ enables unprecedented CPU efficiency gains
while achieving similar performance to state-of-the-art Domain Specific
Accelerators (DSA) for DNN inference in this AI era.

such lateral access environments, LAX-RAY couples a perception pipeline
predicting a target object occupancy support distribution with a mechanical

polygonal objects and a stationary target with a known aspect ratio, we explore
three lateral access search policies: Distribution Area Reduction (DAR),
Distribution Entropy Reduction (DER), and Distribution Entropy Reduction over
Multiple Time Steps (DER-MT) utilizing the support distribution and prior

deployed on the robot, results show a success rate of at least 80% for all
policies, suggesting that LAX-RAY can efficiently reveal the target object in

handlebody H and H[R] has incompressible boundary, then there exists a unique
arc omega in bdry(H), meeting R only in its endpoints, such that, omega is
isotopic in bdry(H), keeping its endpoints on R, to a nontrivial wave based at
R in each Heegaard diagram of R on bdry(H) which has no cut-vertex. Then
surgery on R along its ""distinguished-wave"" omega yields a pair of simple
closed curves, say m_1 and m_2, in bdry(H), each representing an
""omega-determined-slope"" m on bdry(H[R]), that depends only on R and H.
  A few consequences: 1) Only Dehn filling of H[R] at slope m can yield S^3,
(S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q), or S^1 X S^2. So H[R] embeds in at most one of S^3, (S^1
X S^2) # L(p,q), or S^1 X S^2. And, if such an embedding exists, it is unique.
2) Theta curves arising from unknotting tunnels of tunnel-number-one knots in
S^3, S^1 X S^2, or (S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q), have canonical component knots. 3) One
can recognize (1,1) tunnels of (1,1) knots in S^3 or S^1 X S^2. 4) Algorithms
for recognizing genus two Heegaard diagrams of S^3, S^1 X S^2, or (S^1 X S^2) #
L(p,q) that use waves can be streamlined. 5) Efficient procedures for computing
the depth of an unknotting tunnel of a knot in S^3, S^1 X S^2, or (S^1 X S^2) #
L(p,q) exist.
  Finally, if H[R_1] is homeomorphic to H[R_2], but (H,R_1) and (H,R_2) are not
homeomorphic, then the omega-determined slopes on bdry(H[R_1]) and bdry(H[R_2])
may differ.
  However, computation suggests that, if 'R' is a set of simple closed curves
on bdry(H) such that R_1 in 'R' and R_2 in 'R' means H[R_1] is homeomorphic to
H[R_2], then at most two distinct slopes appear as omega-determined slopes for
curves in 'R', and that, if such distinct omega-determined slopes exist, they
are never more than distance one apart.

an effective mass. At higher densities, pairs can condense into a low
temperature superconducting phase and, at or near commensurate filling on a
bipartite lattice, to charge density wave (CDW) order. CDW formation breaks a
discrete symmetry and hence occurs via a second order (Ising) transition, and
therefore at a finite $T_{\rm cdw}$ in two dimensions. Quantum Monte Carlo
calculations have determined $T_{\rm cdw}$ for a variety of geometries,
including square, honeycomb, and Lieb lattices. The superconducting transition,
on the other hand, in $d=2$ is in the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) universality
class, and is much less well characterized. In this paper we determine $T_{\rm

insufficient for some important applications, like adequately sampling
distribution tails to characterize extreme events. As a compromise, emulators
are substantially less expensive but may not have all of the complexity of an
ESM. Here we demonstrate the use of a conditional generative adversarial
network (GAN) to act as an ESM emulator. In doing so, we gain the ability to
produce daily weather data that is consistent with what ESM might output over
any chosen scenario. In particular, the GAN is aimed at representing a joint
probability distribution over space, time, and climate variables, enabling the
study of correlated extreme events, such as floods, droughts, or heatwaves.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we present a new simple degree-based estimator for the size of
maximum matching in bounded arboricity graphs. When the arboricity of the graph
is bounded by $\alpha$, the estimator gives a $\alpha+2$ factor approximation
of the matching size. For planar graphs, we show the estimator does better and
returns a $3.5$ approximation of the matching size.
  Using this estimator, we get new results for approximating the matching size
of planar graphs in the streaming and distributed models of computation. In
particular, in the vertex-arrival streams, we get a randomized
$O(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon^2}\log n)$ space algorithm for approximating the
matching size within $(3.5+\epsilon)$ factor in a planar graph on $n$ vertices.
Similarly, we get a simultaneous protocol in the vertex-partition model for
approximating the matching size within $(3.5+\epsilon)$ factor using
$O(\frac{n^{2/3}}{\epsilon^2}\log n)$ communication from each player.
  In comparison with the previous estimators, the estimator in this paper does
not need to know the arboricity of the input graph and improves the
approximation factor for the case of planar graphs.

provisioned, aim to provide the illusion of infinite resources and abstract
users from details of the allocation decisions. With the goal of providing a
low cost and a high QoS, the serverless computing paradigm offers opportunities
that can be harnessed to attain the goals. Specifically, our strategy in this
dissertation is to avoid redundant computing, in cases where independent task
requests are similar to each other and for tasks that are pointless to process.
We explore two main approaches to (A) reuse part of computation needed to
process the services and (B) proactively pruning tasks with a low chance of
success to improve the overall QoS of the system. For the first approach, we
propose a mechanism to identify various types of ""mergeable"" tasks, which can
benefit from computational reuse if they are executed together as a group. To
evaluate the task merging configurations extensively, we quantify the
resource-saving magnitude and then leveraging the experimental data to create a
resource-saving predictor. We investigate multiple tasks merging approaches
that suit different workload scenarios to determine when it is appropriate to
aggregate tasks and how to allocate them so that the QoS of other tasks is
minimally affected. For the second approach, we developed the mechanisms to
skip tasks whose chance of completing on time is not worth pursuing by drop or
defer them. We determined the minimum chance of success thresholds for tasks to
pass to get scheduled and executed. We dynamically adjust such thresholds based
on multiple characteristics of the arriving workload and the system's
conditions. We employed approximate computing to reduce the pruning mechanism's
computational overheads and ensure that the mechanism can be used practically.

discovery, learning interpretable formulas that accurately describe scientific
data is very challenging because of the vast landscape of possible functions

effectively integrate existing knowledge or hypotheses about the underlying
structure of the data into the architecture of deep learning models to guide
machine learning. Currently, such integration is commonly done through
customization of the loss functions. Here we propose an alternative approach to
integrate existing knowledge or hypotheses of data structure by constructing
custom activation functions that reflect this structure. Specifically, we study
a common case when the multivariate target function $f$ to be learned from the
data is partially exchangeable, \emph{i.e.} $f(u,v,w)=f(v,u,w)$ for $u,v\in
\mathbb{R}^d$. For instance, these conditions are satisfied for the
classification of images that is invariant under left-right flipping. Through
theoretical proof and experimental verification, we show that using an even
activation function in one of the fully connected layers improves neural
network performance. In our experimental 9-dimensional regression problems,
replacing one of the non-symmetric activation functions with the designated
""Seagull"" activation function $\log(1+x^2)$ results in substantial improvement
in network performance. Surprisingly, even activation functions are seldom used
in neural networks. Our results suggest that customized activation functions
have great potential in neural networks.

reconfigurability allow on-the-fly changes to the executable design that can

Therefore, quickly identifying the optimal testing strategy is of critical

which individuals are most beneficial to test, automatically and dynamically
adapting the testing strategy to the characteristics of the disease outbreak.
Specifically, we simulate an outbreak using the archetypal

confirmed cases to train a neural network that learns to make predictions about
the rest of the population. Using these prediction, we manage to contain the

We show that in certain scenarios, the energy availability remains unchanged

data-aided sensing is applied to Gaussian process regression that is used to
learn data sets collected from sensors in Internet-of-Things systems. We focus
on the interpolation of sensors' measurements from a small number of
measurements uploaded by a fraction of sensors using Gaussian process
regression with data-aided sensing. Thanks to active sensor selection, it is
shown that Gaussian process regression with data-aided sensing can provide a
good estimate of a complete data set compared to that with random selection.
With multichannel ALOHA, data-aided sensing is generalized for distributed
selective uploading when sensors can have feedback of predictions of their
measurements so that each sensor can decide whether or not it uploads by
comparing its measurement with the predicted one. Numerical results show that
modified multichannel ALOHA with predictions can help improve the performance
of Gaussian process regression with data-aided sensing compared to conventional
multichannel ALOHA with equal uploading probability.

state vector but quadratic memory requirements, we derive a new consistent
approximate method in the information domain, which has linear memory
requirements and adjustable (constant to linear) processing cost. In
particular, this method, the resource-aware inverse Schmidt estimator (RISE),
allows trading estimation accuracy for computational efficiency. Furthermore,

exploration vs. a relocalization phase, we employ different configurations of
RISE (in terms of the number and order of states updated) to maximize accuracy

Specifically, we introduce an effective modification of the recent StyleGAN

along with HistoGAN. The recoloring model, ReHistoGAN, is an unsupervised

(DLS) using external eye photographs of 145,832 patients with diabetes from 301
diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening sites in one US state, and evaluated the
DLS on three validation sets containing images from 198 sites in 18 other US

detected poor blood glucose control (HbA1c > 9%) with an area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 70.2; moderate-or-worse DR with an AUC
of 75.3; diabetic macular edema with an AUC of 78.0; and vision-threatening DR

generalized to dilated pupils (validation set B, 5,058 patients) and to a

with highly variable emission associated with the primary star. Analysis of our
multi-epoch spectroscopic observations, the majority of which were carried out
on small aperture telescopes, indicates a very short orbital period of just
$2.9$ days, and a mass ratio M$_2$/M$_1$ of $0.23$. The A1 V star is a slow
rotator, with a rotational speed of $\sim34$ km/s. Assuming its mass is $2.3$
M$_{\odot}$, the present-day secondary is an evolved star of $\sim0.5$
M$_{\odot}$ that nearly fills its Roche lobe. This secondary star rotates
comparatively rapidly at $\sim44$ km/s, and we see evidence that it is
chromospherically active. Analysis of a photometric lightcurve from TESS
reveals two strong periods, one at the orbital period for the system and
another at half the orbital period. These findings suggest that HD 63021 is a
close binary system undergoing mass transfer from the secondary star onto the
primary star -- in all ways like an Algol eclipsing binary system, except
without the eclipse. We discuss the system's mass transfer, which is not steady
but seems to run in fits and bursts, and infer the system's basic physical
properties from an orbital parameter study, the Roche lobe geometry, and its

Counting Bloom filters and study its properties including the probabilities of

sample. Having found weaknesses, we established further factor analyses to
assert the dimensionality of IUIPC-10. We proposed a respecified instrument
IUIPC-8 with improved psychometric properties. Finally, we validated our

unidimensionality of its sub-scales Awareness and Control. Our respecified
scale IUIPC-8 offers a statistically significantly better model and outperforms

the construct validity raises doubts how well IUIPC-10 measures the latent

spurious and erratic results as well as attenuate relations with other latent

To facilitate CT analysis, recent efforts have focused on computer-aided

domain shift of data across clinical data centers poses a serious challenge
when deploying learning-based models. In this work, we attempt to find a
solution for this challenge via federated and semi-supervised learning. A
multi-national database consisting of 1704 scans from three countries is
adopted to study the performance gap, when training a model with one dataset
and applying it to another. Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans
for COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and
annotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed
to fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated
learning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable
for institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy.
Moreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a
distributed setting. The proposed framework is shown to be effective compared
to fully supervised scenarios with conventional data sharing instead of model
weight sharing.

non-determinism in inter-process communication. One algorithmic problem in this
challenge is the consistency verification of concurrent executions. Consistency
verification under a reads-from map allows to compute the reads-from (RF)
equivalence between concurrent traces, with direct applications to areas such
as Stateless Model Checking (SMC). The RF equivalence was recently shown to be
coarser than the standard Mazurkiewicz equivalence, leading to impressive
scalability improvements for SMC under SC (sequential consistency). However,
for the relaxed memory models of TSO and PSO (total/partial store order), the
algorithmic problem of deciding the RF equivalence, as well as its impact on
SMC, has been elusive. In this work we solve the problem of consistency
verification for the TSO and PSO memory models given a reads-from map, denoted
VTSO-rf and VPSO-rf, respectively. For an execution of $n$ events over $k$
threads and $d$ variables, we establish novel bounds that scale as $n^{k+1}$
for TSO and as $n^{k+1}\cdot \min(n^{k^2}, 2^{k\cdot d})$ for PSO. Based on our
solution to these problems, we develop an SMC algorithm under TSO and PSO that
uses the RF equivalence. The algorithm is exploration-optimal, in the sense
that it is guaranteed to explore each class of the RF partitioning exactly
once, and spends polynomial time per class when $k$ is bounded. We implement
all our algorithms in the SMC tool Nidhugg, and perform a large number of
experiments over benchmarks from existing literature. Our experimental results
show that our algorithms for VTSO-rf and VPSO-rf provide significant
scalability improvements over standard alternatives. When used for SMC, the RF
partitioning is often much coarser than the standard Shasha-Snir partitioning
for TSO/PSO, which yields a significant speedup in the model checking task.

progress in contrastive learning, which seeks to learn transformations that
embed positive input pairs nearby, while pushing negative pairs far apart.
While positive pairs can be generated reliably (e.g., as different views of the
same image), it is difficult to accurately establish negative pairs, defined as
samples from different images regardless of their semantic content or visual
features. A fundamental problem in contrastive learning is mitigating the
effects of false negatives. Contrasting false negatives induces two critical
issues in representation learning: discarding semantic information and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to identify false
negatives, as well as two strategies to mitigate their effect, i.e. false
negative elimination and attraction, while systematically performing rigorous
evaluations to study this problem in detail. Our method exhibits consistent
improvements over existing contrastive learning-based methods. Without labels,
we identify false negatives with 40% accuracy among 1000 semantic classes on
ImageNet, and achieve 5.8% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art when finetuning with 1% labels. Our code is available

not efficient at checking App updates as the generated GUI events do not
prioritise updates, and instead explore other App behaviours.
  We address this need in this paper with CAT (Change-focused Android GUI

impact analysis to identify GUI elements affected by the update. CAT then
generates length-3 GUI event sequences to interact with these GUI elements. Our
empirical evaluations using 21 publicly available open source Android Apps
demonstrated that CAT is able to automatically identify GUI elements affected
by App updates, generate and execute length-3 GUI event sequences focusing on
change-affected GUI elements. Comparison with two popular GUI event generation

interacting with the change-affected GUI elements. Finally, CAT was able to
detect previously unknown change-related bugs in two Apps.

analysis or causal inference, leaving common complications in medical studies
unaddressed. In practice one must handle problems jointly, without the luxury
of ignoring essential features of the data structure. In this paper, we follow
incident cases of end-stage renal disease and examine the effect on all-cause
mortality of starting treatment with transplant, so-called pre-emptive kidney
transplantation, versus dialysis. The question is relatively simple: which
treatment start is expected to bring the best survival for a target population?
To address the question, we emulate a target trial drawing on the Swedish Renal
Registry to estimate a causal effect on survival curves. Aware of important
challenges, we see how previous studies have selected patients into treatment
groups based on events occurring post treatment initiation. Our study reveals
the dramatic impact of resulting immortal time bias and other typical features
of long term incident disease registries, including: missing or mismeasured
covariates during (the early) phases of the register, varying risk profile of
patients entering treatment groups over calendar time and changes in risk as
care improves over the years. With characteristics of cases and versions of
treatment evolving over time, informative censoring is introduced in unadjusted
Kaplan-Meier curves and also their IPW version is no longer valid. Here we
discuss feasible ways of handling these features and answer different research
questions relying on the no unmeasured baseline confounders assumption.

been proposed to assist the diagnosis. This framework has two essential parts

a novel network, NASUNet, which follows an encoder-decoder architecture
paradigm and utilizes a multi-scale Enlarging cell. Moreover, a general
classification pipeline has been proposed for tendinopathy recognition, which
supports different base models as the feature extractor engine. Two feature
maps comprising positional information of the tendon region have been
introduced as the network input to make the classification network
spatial-aware. To evaluate the tendinopathy recognition system, a data set
consisting of 100 SST ultrasound images have been acquired, in which
tendinopathy cases are double-verified by magnetic resonance imaging. In both
segmentation and classification tasks, lack of training data has been
compensated by incorporating knowledge transferring, transfer learning, and
data augmentation techniques. In cross-validation experiments, the proposed
tendinopathy recognition model achieves 91% accuracy, 86.67% sensitivity, and
92.86% specificity, showing state-of-the-art performance against other models.

inputs, seam finding, which selects a source image for each pixel in the final
result, and blending, which fixes minor visual artifacts. Here, we observe that
the use of a single registration often leads to errors, especially in scenes

  Symposium",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS) is a robot soccer competition in which
two teams of three small robots play against each other. Traditionally, a
deterministic coach agent will choose the most suitable strategy and formation
for each adversary's strategy. Therefore, the role of a coach is of great
importance to the game. In this sense, this paper proposes an end-to-end
approach for the coaching task based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The
proposed system processes the information during the simulated matches to learn
an optimal policy that chooses the current formation, depending on the opponent
and game conditions. We trained two RL policies against three different teams
(balanced, offensive, and heavily offensive) in a simulated environment. Our
results were assessed against one of the top teams of the VSSS league, showing
promising results after achieving a win/loss ratio of approximately 2.0.

of the model is studied at the level of the Kikuchi approximation in square
lattices as a function of the ratio between $g = J_2/J_1$ , the temperature and
the longitudinal and transverse external fields. Our results show that quantum

the ferromagnetic and the stripe phases. Moreover, when both longitudinal and

contribute to the appearance of a nematic phase.

limited instance-level mask labels. Partially supervised instance segmentation
aims to improve mask prediction with limited mask labels by utilizing the more
abundant weak box labels. In this work, we show that a class agnostic mask
head, commonly used in partially supervised instance segmentation, has
difficulties learning a general concept of foreground for the weakly annotated
classes using box supervision only. To resolve this problem we introduce an
object mask prior (OMP) that provides the mask head with the general concept of
foreground implicitly learned by the box classification head under the
supervision of all classes. This helps the class agnostic mask head to focus on
the primary object in a region of interest (RoI) and improves generalization to
the weakly annotated classes. We test our approach on the COCO dataset using
different splits of strongly and weakly supervised classes. Our approach
significantly improves over the Mask R-CNN baseline and obtains competitive
performance with the state-of-the-art, while offering a much simpler
architecture.

knowledge of model data, i.e., arrival and service rates. However, such data
are not always available and may be time-variant. To address this challenge, we
consider a class of model data-independent (MDI) control policies that only
rely on traffic state observation and network topology. Specifically, we focus
on the MDI control policies that can stabilize multi-class Markovian queuing
networks under centralized and decentralized policies. Control actions include
routing, sequencing, and holding. By expanding the routes and constructing
piecewise-linear test functions, we derive an easy-to-use criterion to check
the stability of a multi-class network under a given MDI policy. For
stabilizable multi-class networks, we show that a centralized, stabilizing MDI
policy exists. For stabilizable single-class networks, we further show that a
decentralized, stabilizing MDI policy exists. In addition, for both settings,
we construct explicit policies that attain maximal throughput and present
numerical examples to illustrate the results.

which aligns the source images with a common target image; seam finding, which
determines for each target pixel the source image it should come from; and
blending, which smooths transitions over the seams. As described in [1], the
seam finding phase attempts to place seams between pixels where the transition
between source images is not noticeable. Here, we observe that the most
problematic failures of this approach occur when objects are cropped, omitted,
or duplicated. We therefore take an object-centered approach to the problem,
leveraging recent advances in object detection [2,3,4]. We penalize candidate
solutions with this class of error by modifying the energy function used in the
seam finding stage. This produces substantially more realistic stitching
results on challenging imagery. In addition, these methods can be used to
determine when there is non-recoverable occlusion in the input data, and also
suggest a simple evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate the output of
stitching algorithms.

by advancing previous scaling laws (Moored & Quinn 2018) with physics-driven
modifications to the added mass and circulatory forces to account for ground
distance variations. The key physics introduced are the increase in the added
mass of a foil near the ground and the reduction in the influence of a wake
vortex system due to the influence of its image system. The scaling laws are
found to be in good agreement with new inviscid simulations and viscous

when disorder is present, we find that Hall angle starts near zero at the
depinning threshold and increases linearly with increasing drive before
reaching a saturation close to the disorder free value at the highest drives.
The drive dependence is the result of a side jump effect produced when the
charges move over pinning sites. The magnitude of the side jump is reduced at
the higher velocities. The drive dependent Hall angle is robust for a wide
range of disorder parameters and should be a generic feature of classical
charges driven in the presence of quenched disorder and a magnetic field.

same sample. Here we conduct an experiment by shearing four oil-in-water
emulsions with a rheometer. We observe both a glass and a jamming transition
for our smaller diameter droplets, and only a jamming transition for our larger
diameter droplets. The bidisperse sample behaves similarly to the small droplet
sample, with two transitions observed. Our rheology data are well-fit by both
the Herschel-Bulkley model and the Three Component model. Based on the fitting
parameters, our raw rheological data would not collapse onto a master curve.
Our results suggest that liquid-solid transitions in dispersions may not be
universal, but depend on particle type.

to utterances within a search collection. In low- or zero-resource settings,
QbE search is often addressed with approaches based on dynamic time warping
(DTW). Recent work has found that methods based on acoustic word embeddings
(AWEs) can improve both performance and search speed. However, prior work on
AWE-based QbE has primarily focused on English data and with single-word
queries. In this work, we generalize AWE training to spans of words, producing
acoustic span embeddings (ASE), and explore the application of ASE to QbE with
arbitrary-length queries in multiple unseen languages. We consider the commonly
used setting where we have access to labeled data in other languages (in our
case, several low-resource languages) distinct from the unseen test languages.
We evaluate our approach on the QUESST 2015 QbE tasks, finding that
multilingual ASE-based search is much faster than DTW-based search and
outperforms the best previously published results on this task.

external perturbations, of which critical transitions toward degraded ecosystem
states are a prominent example. Resilience restoration focuses on the ability
of spatially-extended systems and the required time to recover to their desired
states under stochastic environmental conditions. While mean-field approaches
may guide recovery strategies by indicating the conditions needed to
destabilize undesired states, these approaches are not accurately capturing the
transition process toward the desired state of spatially-extended systems in
stochastic environments. The difficulty is rooted in the lack of mathematical
tools to analyze systems with high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and stochastic
effects. We bridge this gap by developing new mathematical tools that employ
nucleation theory in spatially-embedded systems to advance resilience
restoration. We examine our approach on systems following mutualistic dynamics
and diffusion models, finding that systems may exhibit single-cluster or
multi-cluster phases depending on their sizes and noise strengths, and also
construct a new scaling law governing the restoration time for arbitrary system
size and noise strength in two-dimensional systems. This approach is not
limited to ecosystems and has applications in various dynamical systems, from
biology to infrastructural systems.

opposite interference effects, namely interference-induced ballistic transport
on one hand, and strong (Anderson) localization on the other. While the former
effect allows for resistance free transport, the latter brings the transport to
a complete halt. As a model system, we consider the quantum kicked rotor, where
strong localization is observed in the discrete momentum coordinate. In this
model, we introduce the ballistic transport in the form of a Hadamard quantum
walk in that momentum coordinate. The two transport mechanisms are combined by
alternating the corresponding Floquet operators. Extending the corresponding
calculation for the kicked rotor, we estimate the classical diffusion
coefficient for thecombined dynamics. Another argument, based on the
introduction of an effective Heisenberg time should then allow to estimate the
localization time and the localization length. While this is known to work
reasonably well in the kicked rotor case, we find that it fails in our case.
While the combined dynamics still shows localization, it takes place at much
larger times and shows much larger localization lengths than predicted.
Finally, we combine the kicked rotor with other types of quantum walks, namely
diffusive and localizing quantum walks. In the diffusive case, the localizing
dynamics of the kicked rotor is completely canceled and we get pure diffusion.
In the case of the localizing quantum walk, the combined system remains
localized, but with a larger localization length.

more planets. The star's chemical abundance pattern is metal-deficient except

$\Delta_d$ at which magnetic field lines lose distinguishability differs
enormously from the scale $a$ of magnetic reconnection across the field lines.
In the solar corona, plasma resistivity gives $a/\Delta_d\sim10^{12}$, which is
the magnetic Reynold number $R_m$. The traditional resolution of the paradox of
disparate scales is for the current density $j$ associated with the
reconnecting field $B_{rec}$ to be concentrated by a factor of $R_m$ by the
ideal evolution, so $ j\sim B_{rec}/\mu_0\Delta_d$. A second resolution is for
the ideal evolution to increase the ratio of the maximum to minimum separation
between pairs of arbitrarily chosen magnetic field lines,
$\Delta_{max}/\Delta_{min}$, when calculated at various points in time.
Reconnection becomes inevitable where $\Delta_{max}/\Delta_{min}\sim R_m$. A
simple model of the solar corona will be used for a numerical illustration that
the natural rate of increase in time is linear for the current density but
exponential for $\Delta_{max}/\Delta_{min}$. Reconnection occurs on a time
scale and with a current density enhanced by only $\ln(a/\Delta_d)$ from the
ideal evolution time and from the current density $B_{rec}/\mu_0a$. In both
resolutions, once a sufficiently wide region, $\Delta_r$, has undergone
reconnection, the magnetic field loses static force balance and evolves on an
Alfv\'enic time scale. The Alfv\'enic evolution is intrinsically ideal but
expands the region in which $\Delta_{max}/\Delta_{min}$ is large.

are often extremely scarce; ii) sample selection bias: conventional CVR models
are trained with clicked impressions while making inference on the entire space
of all impressions; iii) delayed feedback: many conversions can only be
observed after a relatively long and random delay since clicks happened,
resulting in many false negative labels during training. Previous studies
mainly focus on one or two issues while ignoring the others. In this paper, we
propose a novel neural network framework ESDF to tackle the above three
challenges simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, ESDF models the CVR
prediction from a perspective of entire space, and combines the advantage of
user sequential behavior pattern and the time delay factor. Specifically, ESDF
utilizes sequential behavior of user actions on the entire space with all
impressions to alleviate the sample selection bias problem. By sharing the
embedding parameters between CTR and CVR networks, data sparsity problem is
greatly relieved. Different from conventional delayed feedback methods, ESDF
does not make any special assumption about the delay distribution. We
discretize the delay time by day slot and model the probability based on
survival analysis with deep neural network, which is more practical and
suitable for industrial situations. Extensive experiments are conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ESDF is
the first attempt to unitedly solve the above three challenges in CVR
prediction area.

Most of the

TFN is a residual structure with multiple convolutional layers. It functions as
a local-feature extraction network to mine sufficient local features from data.
LSTMaN is composed of two identical layers, where attention and long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks are hybridized. This network acts as a relation
extraction network to discover the intrinsic relationships among the extracted
features at different positions in sequential data. In experiments, we embed
RTFN into a supervised structure as a feature extractor and into an

crucial performance metric in fog computing, especially for real-time
applications. In this paper, we study a peer computation offloading problem for
a fog network with unknown dynamics. In this scenario, each fog node (FN) can
offload their computation tasks to neighboring FNs in a time slot manner. The
offloading latency, however, could not be fed back to the task dispatcher
instantaneously due to the uncertainty of the processing time in peer FNs.
Besides, peer competition occurs when different FNs offload tasks to one FN at
the same time. To tackle the above difficulties, we model the computation
offloading problem as a sequential FN selection problem with delayed
information feedback. Using adversarial multi-arm bandit framework, we
construct an online learning policy to deal with delayed information feedback.
Different contention resolution approaches are considered to resolve peer
competition. Performance analysis shows that the regret of the proposed
algorithm, or the performance loss with suboptimal FN selections, achieves a
sub-linear order, suggesting an optimal FN selection policy. In addition, we
prove that the proposed strategy can result in a Nash equilibrium (NE) with all

estimation of a rollout policy by removing the implicit perfect state

significantly higher success rate and total reward.

$F=\left(f^1,\ldots,f^n\right):\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a
polynomial map such that $\det DF$ is nowhere zero, then $F$ is a global
injective.
  The first part is to study the two-dimensional real Jacobian conjecture via
the method of the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. By Bendixson
compactification, an induced polynomial differential system can be obtained
from the Hamiltonian system associated to polynomial map $F$. We prove that the
following statements are equivalent: (A) $F$ is a global injective; (B) the
origin of induced system is a center; (C) the origin of induced system is a
monodromic singular point; (D) the origin of induced system has no hyperbolic
sectors; (E) induced system has a $C^k$ first integral with an isolated minimun
at the origin and $k\in\mathbb{N}^{+}\cup\{\infty\}$. Moreover, applying the
above results we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity
of the two-dimensional real Jacobian conjecture, which is an algebraic
criterion. By definition a criterion function, $F$ is a global injective if and
only if the limit of criterion function is infinite as
$\left|x\right|+\left|y\right|$ tends to infinity. This algebraic criterion
improves the main result of Braun et al [J. Differential Equations {\bf 260}

nonlinear functional analysis, $F$ is a global injective if and only if
$\parallel F\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\parallel$ approaches to infinite as
$\parallel\mathbf{x}\parallel\rightarrow\infty$, which is a generalization of
the above algebraic criterion. As an application, we give an alternate proof of
the Cima's result on the $n$-dimensional real Jacobian conjecture [Nonlinear

challenging and necessary step of track reconstruction in sub-atomic physics
experiments. Aiding in the discrimination of relevant interactions, pattern
recognition seeks to accelerate track reconstruction by isolating signals of
interest. In high collision rate experiments, such algorithms can be
particularly crucial for determining whether to retain or discard information
from a given interaction even before the data is transferred to tape. As data
rates, detector resolution, noise, and inefficiencies increase, pattern
recognition becomes more computationally challenging, motivating the
development of higher efficiency algorithms and techniques. Quantum associative
memory is an approach that seeks to exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to
gain advantage in learning capacity, or the number of patterns that can be
stored and accurately recalled. Here, we study quantum associative memory based
on quantum annealing and apply it to the particle track classification. We
focus on discrimination models based on Ising formulations of quantum
associative memory model (QAMM) recall and quantum content-addressable memory
(QCAM) recall. We characterize classification performance of these approaches
as a function detector resolution, pattern library size, and detector
inefficiencies, using the D-Wave 2000Q processor as a testbed. Discrimination
criteria is set using both solution-state energy and classification labels
embedded in solution states. We find that energy-based QAMM classification
performs well in regimes of small pattern density and low detector
inefficiency. In contrast, state-based QCAM achieves reasonably high accuracy
recall for large pattern density and the greatest recall accuracy robustness to
a variety of detector noise sources.

We employ two separate prediction networks HA-Net and DS-Net to predict the
labels by human annotation and distant supervision, respectively, to prevent
the degradation of accuracy by the incorrect labeling of distant supervision.
Furthermore, we propose an additional loss term called disagreement penalty to
enable HA-Net to learn from distantly supervised labels. In addition, we
exploit additional networks to adaptively assess the labeling bias by
considering contextual information. Our performance study on sentence-level and
document-level REs confirms the effectiveness of the dual supervision
framework.

  Gradient-Based Methods and Global Convergence",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, policy optimization for control purposes has received renewed
attention due to the increasing interest in reinforcement learning. In this
paper, we investigate the global convergence of gradient-based policy
optimization methods for quadratic optimal control of discrete-time Markovian
jump linear systems (MJLS). First, we study the optimization landscape of
direct policy optimization for MJLS, with static state feedback controllers and
quadratic performance costs. Despite the non-convexity of the resultant
problem, we are still able to identify several useful properties such as
coercivity, gradient dominance, and almost smoothness. Based on these
properties, we show global convergence of three types of policy optimization
methods: the gradient descent method; the Gauss-Newton method; and the natural
policy gradient method. We prove that all three methods converge to the optimal
state feedback controller for MJLS at a linear rate if initialized at a
controller which is mean-square stabilizing. Some numerical examples are
presented to support the theory. This work brings new insights for
understanding the performance of policy gradient methods on the Markovian jump
linear quadratic control problem.

Determining the metallicities and ages of M31 clusters is
fundamental to the study of the formation and evolution of M31 itself. The
Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has carried
out a systematic spectroscopic campaign of clusters and candidates in M31.
Aims. We constructed a catalogue of 346 M31 clusters observed by LAMOST. By
combining the information of the LAMOST spectra and the multi-band photometry,
we developed a new algorithm to estimate the metallicities and ages of these
clusters. Methods. We distinguish young clusters from old using random forest
classifiers based on a empirical training data set selected from the
literature. Ages of young clusters are derived from the spectral energy
distribution (SED) fits of their multi-band photometric measurements. Their
metallicities are estimated by fitting their observed spectral principal
components extracted from the LAMOST spectra with those from the young
metal-rich single stellar population (SSP) models. For old clusters, we built
non-parameter random forest models between the spectral principal components
and/or multi-band colours and the parameters of the clusters based on a
training data set constructed from the SSP models. The ages and metallicities
of the old clusters are then estimated by fitting their observed spectral
principal components extracted from the LAMOST spectra and multi-band colours
from the photometric measurements with the resultant random forest models.
Results. We derived parameters of 53 young and 293 old clusters in our
catalogue. Our resultant parameters are in good agreement with those from the
literature. The ages of about 30 catalogued clusters and metallicities of about
40 sources are derived for the first time.

alternative method, the label propagation algorithm (LPA), avoids the

cyclic and mutually reinforcing manner to exploit the advantages of both GNNs

learned by GNN module with the augmented information by label propagation,
while fine-tunes the weighted graph of label propagation with the help of node

favorable for the atom to align its polarizability with respect to that of the
dielectric. As the atom moves away from, but along the symmetry axis of the
annular dielectric, it encounters a point where the polarizable atom
experiences no torque and the energy is free of orientation dependence. At this
height, abruptly, the atom prefers to orient its polarizability perpendicular
to that of the dielectric. For certain configurations, it encounters another
torsion-free point a larger distance away, beyond which it prefers to again
point its polarizability with respect to that of the dielectric. We find when
the atom is close enough, and oriented such that the energy is close to
maximum, the atom could be repelled. For certain annular polarizations,
repulsion can happen below or above the torsion-free height. Qualitative
features differ when the atom is interacting with a ring, versus a plate of
infinite extent with a hole. In particular, the atom can prefer to orient
perpendicular to the polarizability of the plate at large distances, in
striking contrast to the expectation that it will orient parallel. To gain
insight of this discrepancy, we investigate an annular disc, which captures the

First, the multimodal mixtures for each base class and the feature extractor
parameters are learned using a combination of two loss functions. Second, the
resulting network and mixture models are progressively refined through a
leader-follower learning procedure, which uses the current estimate as a

  probability weighting",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the analysis of observational studies, inverse probability weighting (IPW)
is commonly used to consistently estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) or
the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT). The variance of the IPW ATE
estimator is often estimated by assuming the weights are known and then using
the so-called ""robust"" (Huber-White) sandwich estimator, which results in
conservative standard error (SE) estimation. Here it is shown that using such
an approach when estimating the variance of the IPW ATT estimator does not
necessarily result in conservative SE estimates. That is, assuming the weights
are known, the robust sandwich estimator may be conservative or
anti-conservative. Thus confidence intervals of the ATT using the robust SE
estimate will not be valid in general. Instead, stacked estimating equations
which account for the weight estimation can be used to compute a consistent,
closed-form variance estimator for the IPW ATT estimator. The two variance
estimators are compared via simulation studies and in a data analysis of the
effect of smoking on gene expression.

joint task offloading, communication and computation resource allocation
problem to minimize the energy consumption of MDs and UAVs by considering the
limited communication resources for the uplink transmission, the computation
resources of UAVs and the tolerable latency of the tasks. The formulated
problem is a mixed-integer non-convex problem which is NP hard. Thus, we relax
the channel assignment variable from the binary to continuous values. However,
the problem is still non-convex due to the coupling among the variables. To
solve the formulated optimization problem, we apply the Block Successive
Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) method which guarantees to obtain the
stationary points of the non-convex objective function. In essence, the
non-convex objective function is decomposed into multiple subproblems which are
then solved in a block-by-block manner. Finally, the extensive evaluation
results are conducted to show the superior performance of our proposed

  Autoencoder",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of fair classification can be mollified if we develop a method to
remove the embedded sensitive information from the classification features.
This line of separating the sensitive information is developed through the
causal inference, and the causal inference enables the counterfactual
generations to contrast the what-if case of the opposite sensitive attribute.
Along with this separation with the causality, a frequent assumption in the
deep latent causal model defines a single latent variable to absorb the entire
exogenous uncertainty of the causal graph. However, we claim that such
structure cannot distinguish the 1) information caused by the intervention
(i.e., sensitive variable) and 2) information correlated with the intervention
from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes Disentangled Causal Effect
Variational Autoencoder (DCEVAE) to resolve this limitation by disentangling
the exogenous uncertainty into two latent variables: either 1) independent to
interventions or 2) correlated to interventions without causality.
Particularly, our disentangling approach preserves the latent variable
correlated to interventions in generating counterfactual examples. We show that
our method estimates the total effect and the counterfactual effect without a
complete causal graph. By adding a fairness regularization, DCEVAE generates a
counterfactual fair dataset while losing less original information. Also,
DCEVAE generates natural counterfactual images by only flipping sensitive
information. Additionally, we theoretically show the differences in the
covariance structures of DCEVAE and prior works from the perspective of the
latent disentanglement.

cosmological constant renders the branes to be non-flat and gives rise to a
potential and a non-canonical kinetic term for the radion field in the four
dimensional effective action. The kinetic term exhibits a phantom-like behavior
within the domain of evolution of the modulus which leads to a violation of the
null-energy condition often observed in a bouncing universe. The interplay of
the radion potential and kinetic term enables the evolution of the radion field
from a normal to a phantom regime where the universe transits from a
contracting era to an expanding epoch through a non-singular bounce. Analysis
of the scalar and tensor perturbations over such background evolution reveal
that the primordial observables e.g., the amplitude of scalar perturbations

we propose to solve two toll pricing problems with different levels of
complexity using the concept of the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram
(MFD or NFD), where a large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment
model of Melbourne, Australia is used. Four computationally efficient SBO
methods are applied and compared, including the proportional-integral (PI)
controller, regressing kriging (RK), DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), and
simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The comparison
reveals that these methods work equally well on the simple problem without
exhibiting significant performance differences. But, for the complex problem,
RK manifests itself to be the best-performing method thanks to its capability
of filtering out the numerical noise arising from computer simulations (i.e.
allowing for non-smoothness of the objective function). While the PI controller
is a more competitive solution to the simple problem given its faster rate of
convergence, the poor scalability of the method in the complex problem results
in limited applicability. Two caveats, however, deserve emphasis: (i) the
chosen critical network density of the NFD does not necessarily represent a
robust network control or optimization threshold, as it might shift in the
presence of toll pricing; and (ii) re-interpolation is required as part of RK
in order to achieve global convergence.

potentials account for the isotropic birefringence recently reported by
analyzing the Planck 2018 polarization data. For the quadratic and cosine
potentials, we obtain lower bounds on the mass, coupling constant to photon
$g$, abundance and equation of state of the ALP to produce the observed
birefringence. Especially when the ALP is responsible for dark energy, it is
possible to probe the tiny deviation of dark energy equation of state from $-1$
through the cosmic birefringence. We also explore ALPs working as early dark
energy (EDE), which alleviates the Hubble tension problem. Since the other
parameters are limited by the EDE requirements, we narrow down the ALP-photon
coupling to $10^{-19}\, {\rm GeV}^{-1}\lesssim g\lesssim 10^{-16}\, {\rm
GeV}^{-1}$ for the decay constant $f=M_\mathrm{pl}$. Therefore, the Hubble
tension and the isotropic birefringence imply that $g$ is typically the order
of $f^{-1}$, which is a non-trivial coincidence.

of the QAH effect in individual devices could be related to commensurability
between the graphene/graphene and graphene/hBN moir\'e patterns. We identify a
series of points in the $(\theta_{\rm GG},\theta_{\rm GBN})$ twist-angle space
at which the two moir\'e patterns are commensurate, allowing moir\'e band
theory to be applied, and show that the band Chern numbers are in this case
sensitive to a rigid in-plane hBN displacement. Given this property, we argue
that the QAH effect is likely only when i) the $(\theta_{\rm GG},\theta_{\rm
GBN})$ twist-angle-pair is close enough to a commensurate point that the two
moir\'e patterns yield a supermoir\'e pattern with a sufficiently long length
scale, and ii) the supermoir\'e has a percolating topologically non-trivial QAH
phase. For twist angles far from commensurability, the hBN layer acts as a
source of disorder that can destroy the QAH effect. Our proposal can explain a
number of current experimental observations. Further experimental studies that
can test this proposal more directly are suggested.

scenario of spatiotemporal imaging with large diffeomorphic and mass-preserving
deformations. Specifically, we first use the Benamou--Brenier formula to
characterize the optimal transport cost among the flow of mass-preserving

many scenarios, it is necessary to perform nearest neighbor search under
multiple weighted distance functions in high-dimensional spaces. This paper
considers the important problem of supporting efficient approximate nearest

to the wide variety of locomotion strategies they can employ. Terrain
classification is a key enabling technology for autonomous legged robots, as it
allows the robot to harness their innate flexibility to adapt their behaviour
to the demands of their operating environment. In this paper, we show how
highly capable machine learning techniques, namely gated recurrent neural
networks, allow our target legged robot to correctly classify the terrain it
traverses in both supervised and semi-supervised fashions. Tests on a benchmark
data set shows that our time-domain classifiers are well capable of dealing
with raw and variable-length data with small amount of labels and perform to a
level far exceeding the frequency-domain classifiers. The classification
results on our own extended data set opens up a range of high-performance
behaviours that are specific to those environments. Furthermore, we show how
raw unlabelled data is used to improve significantly the classification results
in a semi-supervised model.

quantum gravity, in which Perelman's Ricci flow equations on Riemannian
manifolds appear precisely as the localization equations in the path integral.
In this mapping between physics and mathematics, the role of Perelman's dilaton
is played by our lapse function. Perelman's local fixed volume condition
emerges dynamically as the $\lambda$ parameter in our kinetic term approaches
$\lambda\to-\infty$. The DeTurck trick that decouples the metric flow from the
dilaton flow is simply a gauge-fixing condition for the gauge symmetry of
spatial diffeomorphisms. We show how Perelman's ${\cal F}$ and ${\cal W}$
entropy functionals are related to our superpotential. We explain the origin of
Perelman's $\tau$ function, which appears in the ${\cal W}$ entropy functional
for shrinking solitons, as the Goldstone mode associated with time translations
and spatial rescalings: In fact, in our quantum gravity, Perelman's $\tau$
turns out to play the role of a dilaton for anisotropic scale transformations.
The map between Perelman's flow and the localization equations in our
topological quantum gravity requires an interesting redefinition of fields,
which includes a reframing of the metric. With this embedding of Perelman's
equations into topological quantum gravity, a wealth of mathematical results on
the Ricci flow can now be imported into physics and reformulated in the
language of quantum field theory.

evolution of stellar streams on orbits near the boundaries between orbit
families (separatrices) in a flattened axisymmetric potential. We demonstrate
that the separatrix divides these streams into two groups of stars that belong

more rapidly than streams that evolve elsewhere in the potential. We utilize
Hamiltonian perturbation theory to estimate both the timescale of this effect
and the likelihood of a stream evolving close enough to a separatrix to be
affected by it. We analyze two prior reports of stream-fanning in simulations
with triaxial potentials, and conclude that at least one of them is caused by
separatrix divergence. These results lay the foundation for a method of mapping

to be robust to adversarial perturbations. Though a few defenses against
adversarial point cloud classification have been proposed, it remains unknown
whether they are truly robust to adaptive attacks. To this end, we perform the
first security analysis of state-of-the-art defenses and design adaptive
evaluations on them. Our 100% adaptive attack success rates show that current
countermeasures are still vulnerable. Since adversarial training (AT) is
believed as the most robust defense, we present the first in-depth study

that sorting-based parametric pooling can significantly improve the models'

Once the ILC converges, the feedback controller that meets the desired loop

Confronting five alternative cosmological models with cluster edges from the

cluster edges can serve as a promising probe to constrain models beyond
$\Lambda$CDM. Especially, the constraining precision of equation of state of
dark energy from cluster edges is just about two times larger than that from
the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae sample. We find that the constraining power of
cluster edges can be exhibited better by combining it with other probes.
Combining cluster edges with cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic
oscillations, Type Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers and simulated

respectively, we constrain $\Lambda$CDM and find that the data combination of
cosmic microwave background and cluster edges gives the best constraint on the
Hubble constant $H_0$ with a $0.5\%$ precision and the matter density ratio
$\Omega_m$ with a $1.6\%$ precision among these five pair datasets, and that

also give the most stringent constraint on $\Lambda$CDM by combining cluster

high data rate and low latency in 5G wireless cellular networks. Since
directional beamforming and antenna arrays are exploited in the mmWave
networks, accurate angle-of-arrival (AOA) information can be obtained and
utilized for localization purposes. The performance of a localization system is
typically assessed by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) evaluated based on
fixed node locations. However, this strategy only produces a fixed value for
the CRLB specific to the scenario of interest. To allow randomly distributed
nodes, stochastic geometry has been proposed to study the CRLB for
time-of-arrival-based localization. To the best of our knowledge, this
methodology has not yet been investigated for AOA-based localization. In this
work, we are motivated to consider the mmWave cellular network and derive the
CRLB for AOA-based localization and its distribution using stochastic geometry.
We analyze how the CRLB is affected by the node locations' spatial
distribution, including the target and participating base stations. To apply
the CRLB on a network setting with random node locations, we propose an
accurate approximation of the CRLB using the L/4-th value of ordered distances
where L is the number of participating base stations. Furthermore, we derive
the localizability of the mmWave network, which is the probability that a
target is localizable, and examine how the network parameters influence the
localization performance. These findings provide us deep insight into optimum
network design that meets specified localization requirements.

with the temporal variation of the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite soft X-ray flux of the associated flares, except that the velocity
peak precedes the soft X-ray peak by minutes. Moreover, the duration of the
acceleration phase of the erupting blobs is moderately correlated with that of
the flare rise phase. For nine of the 26 cases, the erupting blobs even appear

the initiation and development of these confined flares are similar to that of

great benefits in a range of advanced solutions towards Smart Road and crash
prevention, although there are intrinsic challenges, especially lack of ground
truth, definition of multiple risk exposures. This study proposes a
domain-specific automatic clustering (termed Autocluster) to self-learn the
optimal models for unsupervised risk assessment, which integrates key steps of
risk clustering into an auto-optimisable pipeline, including feature and
algorithm selection, hyperparameter auto-tuning. Firstly, based on surrogate
conflict measures, indicator-guided feature extraction is conducted to
construct temporal-spatial and kinematical risk features. Then we develop an
elimination-based model reliance importance (EMRI) method to
unsupervised-select the useful features. Secondly, we propose balanced
Silhouette Index (bSI) to evaluate the internal quality of imbalanced
clustering. A loss function is designed that considers the clustering
performance in terms of internal quality, inter-cluster variation, and model
stability. Thirdly, based on Bayesian optimisation, the algorithm selection and
hyperparameter auto-tuning are self-learned to generate the best clustering
partitions. Various algorithms are comprehensively investigated. Herein, NGSIM
vehicle trajectory data is used for test-bedding. Findings show that
Autocluster is reliable and promising to diagnose multiple distinct risk
exposures inherent to generalised driving behaviour. Besides, we also delve
into risk clustering, such as, algorithms heterogeneity, Silhouette analysis,
hierarchical clustering flows, etc. Meanwhile, the Autocluster is also a method
for unsupervised multi-risk data labelling and indicator threshold calibration.
Furthermore, Autocluster is useful to tackle the challenges in imbalanced
clustering without ground truth or priori knowledge

maximum mass of neutron stars and the minimum mass of black holes is currently
under hot debate. Among the many possibilities proposed in the literature, the
$m_2$ was suggested as a superfast pulsar while its r-mode stability against
the run-away gravitational radiation through the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz
mechanism is still unknown. Using those fulfilling all currently known
astrophysical and nuclear physics constraints among a sample of 33 unified
equation of states (EOSs) constructed previously by Fortin {\it et al.} (2016)
using the same nuclear interactions from the crust to the core consistently, we
compare the minimum frequency required for the $m_2$ to rotationally sustain a
mass higher than $2.50\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ with the critical frequency above
which the r-mode instability occurs. We use two extreme damping models assuming
the crust is either perfectly rigid or elastic. Using the stability of 19
observed low-mass x-ray binaries as an indication that the rigid crust damping
of the r-mode dominates within the models studied, we find that the $m_2$ is
r-mode stable while rotating with a frequency higher than 870.2 Hz (0.744 times
its Kepler frequency of 1169.6 Hz) as long as its temperate is lower than about
$3.9\times 10^7 K$, further supporting the proposal that GW190814's secondary
component is a supermassive and superfast pulsar.

booming e-commerce business in our company, results in a growing number of
scenes. Most of them are so-called long-tail scenes, which means that the
traffic of a single scene is limited, but the overall traffic is considerable.
Typical studies mainly focus on serving a single scene with a well designed
model. However, this method brings excessive resource consumption both on
offline training and online serving. Besides, simply training a single model
with data from multiple scenes ignores the characteristics of their own. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel but practical model named
Domain-Aware Deep Neural Network(DADNN) by serving multiple scenes with only
one model. Specifically, shared bottom block among all scenes is applied to
learn a common representation, while domain-specific heads maintain the
characteristics of every scene. Besides, knowledge transfer is introduced to
enhance the opportunity of knowledge sharing among different scenes. In this
paper, we study two instances of DADNN where its shared bottom block is
multilayer perceptron(MLP) and Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts(MMoE)
respectively, for which we denote as DADNN-MLP and DADNN-MMoE.Comprehensive
offline experiments on a real production dataset from our company show that
DADNN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for multi-scene CTR
prediction. Extensive online A/B tests reveal that DADNN-MLP contributes up to
6.7% CTR and 3.0% CPM(Cost Per Mille) promotion compared with a well-engineered
DCN model. Furthermore, DADNN-MMoE outperforms DADNN-MLP with a relative
improvement of 2.2% and 2.7% on CTR and CPM respectively. More importantly,
DADNN utilizes a single model for multiple scenes which saves a lot of offline
training and online serving resources.

approach that has been widely claimed to improve software quality. However, the
extent to which TDD improves quality appears to be largely dependent upon the
characteristics of the study in which it is evaluated (e.g., the research
method, participant type, programming environment, etc.). The particularities
of each study make the aggregation of results untenable. Objectives: The goal
of this paper is to: increase the accuracy and generalizability of the results
achieved in isolated experiments on TDD, provide joint conclusions on the
performance of TDD across different industrial and academic settings, and
assess the extent to which the characteristics of the experiments affect the
quality-related performance of TDD. Method: We conduct a family of 12
experiments on TDD in academia and industry. We aggregate their results by
means of meta-analysis. We perform exploratory analyses to identify variables
impacting the quality-related performance of TDD. Results: TDD novices achieve
a slightly higher code quality with iterative test-last development (i.e., ITL,
the reverse approach of TDD) than with TDD. The task being developed largely
determines quality. The programming environment, the order in which TDD and ITL
are applied, or the learning effects from one development approach to another
do not appear to affect quality. The quality-related performance of
professionals using TDD drops more than for students. We hypothesize that this
may be due to their being more resistant to change and potentially less
motivated than students. Conclusion: Previous studies seem to provide
conflicting results on TDD performance (i.e., positive vs. negative,
respectively). We hypothesize that these conflicting results may be due to
different study durations, experiment participants being unfamiliar with the
TDD process...

State-of-the-art localization approaches often rely on image retrieval

(2) determine which parts of the scene are potentially visible in a given query
image. It is common practice to use state-of-the-art image retrieval algorithms

the same landmark under a large range of viewpoint changes. However, robustness
to viewpoint changes is not necessarily desirable in the context of visual
localization. This paper focuses on understanding the role of image retrieval

synchrotron signals. In particular, we identify various regimes where, in
analogy to prompt gamma rays, the diffuse radio signal from dark matter
annihilation/decay can be expressed as the multiplication of a ""halo"" times a
spectral function. These functions are computed here for the first time for a
number of benchmark cases. Furthermore, we find parameter regions in which the
emissivity can be well approximated by a universal function ~ sin(kr)/r, where
r is the galacto-centric distance. Our theoretical setup differs from previous
work in that, instead of employing a method-of-images strategy, we consider a
Fourier-mode expansion of the relevant Green's functions. With this strategy,
exact results can be obtained with very low computational cost and for generic
dark matter models. In particular, O(10- 100) Fourier modes can be easily
incorporated into the computations in order to probe the smallest scales of the
problem. We also propose a new strategy to search for dark matter using radio
observations of dwarf galaxies that is (1) easy to implement and (2) free of
the otherwise large degeneracies in the description of synchrotron signals from
dark matter. Finally, we correct a mistake in a widely used Green's function
formula in this context. We show that the original expression leads to
systematically incorrect - and in some cases divergent - results in the regime
where the characteristic time-scale for diffusion is smaller than that for
energy losses.

We rectify this inconsistency and propose more general definitions that either

$\chi_\mathrm{p}\in[0,2]$ presents an exclusive region $\chi_\mathrm{p}>1$ that
can only be populated by binaries with two precessing spins. We apply our
prescriptions to current LIGO/Virgo events and find that posterior

like quarks $T_{L,R}$ are introduced to avoid the quantum anomaly. It is
crucial to probe their interactions with the standard model particles. However,
flavor changing neutral couplings are always difficult to detect directly in
the current and future experiments. In this paper, we will show how to
constrain the flavor changing neutral Yukawa coupling $Tth$ through the
di-Higgs production indirectly. We consider the simplified model including a
pair of gauge singlet $T_{L,R}$. Under the perturbative unitarity and
experimental constraints, we choose $m_T=400~\mathrm{GeV},s_L=0.2$ and
$m_T=800~\mathrm{GeV},s_L=0.1$ as benchmark points. After the analysis of
amplitude and evaluation of the numerical cross sections, we find that the
present constraints from di-Higgs production have already surpassed the
unitarity bound because of the $(y_{L,R}^{tT})^4$ behavior. For the case of
$m_T=400~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $s_L=0.2$, $\mathrm{Re}y_{L,R}^{tT}$ and
$\mathrm{Im}y_{L,R}^{tT}$ can be bounded optimally in the range $(-0.4, 0.4)$

bounded optimally in the range $(-0.5, 0.5)$ at HL-LHC with $2\sigma$ CL. The
anomalous triple Higgs coupling $\delta_{hhh}$ can also affect the constraints
on $y_{L,R}^{tT}$. Finally, we find that the top quark electric dipole moment
can give stronger bounds of $y_{L,R}^{tT}$ in the off-axis regions for some
scenarios.

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated airway segmentation is a prerequisite for pre-operative diagnosis
and intra-operative navigation for pulmonary intervention. Due to the small
size and scattered spatial distribution of peripheral bronchi, this is hampered
by severe class imbalance between foreground and background regions, which
makes it challenging for CNN-based methods to parse distal small airways. In
this paper, we demonstrate that this problem is arisen by gradient erosion and
dilation of the neighborhood voxels. During back-propagation, if the ratio of
the foreground gradient to background gradient is small while the class
imbalance is local, the foreground gradients can be eroded by their
neighborhoods. This process cumulatively increases the noise information
included in the gradient flow from top layers to the bottom ones, limiting the
learning of small structures in CNNs. To alleviate this problem, we use group
supervision and the corresponding WingsNet to provide complementary gradient
flows to enhance the training of shallow layers. To further address the
intra-class imbalance between large and small airways, we design a General
Union loss function which obviates the impact of airway size by distance-based
weights and adaptively tunes the gradient ratio based on the learning process.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
can predict the airway structures with higher accuracy and better morphological
completeness than the baselines.

which is mostly due to limited availability of large-scale labeled data in
training. However, labeling large-scale training data is very expensive and
time-consuming, while large-scale synthetic dataset shows promising value in
learning generalizable person re-identification models. Therefore, in this
paper a novel and practical person re-identification task is proposed,i.e. how
to use labeled synthetic dataset and unlabeled real-world dataset to train a
universal model. In this way, human annotations are no longer required, and it
is scalable to large and diverse real-world datasets. To address the task, we
introduce a framework with high generalizability, namely DomainMix.
Specifically, the proposed method firstly clusters the unlabeled real-world
images and selects the reliable clusters. During training, to address the large
domain gap between two domains, a domain-invariant feature learning method is
proposed, which introduces a new loss,i.e. domain balance loss, to conduct an
adversarial learning between domain-invariant feature learning and domain
discrimination, and meanwhile learns a discriminative feature for person
re-identification. This way, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world
data is much reduced, and the learned feature is generalizable thanks to the
large-scale and diverse training data. Experimental results show that the
proposed annotation-free method is more or less comparable to the counterpart
trained with full human annotations, which is quite promising. In addition, it
achieves the current state of the art on several person re-identification
datasets under direct cross-dataset evaluation.

on large quantities of hand-labelled data. As this data is potentially
expensive to capture, and difficult to clearly visualise and label manually, a
means of supplementing real LiDAR scans with simulated data is becoming a
necessary step in realising the potential of these methods. We present an open
source tool, SimTreeLS (Simulated Tree Laser Scans), for generating point
clouds which simulate scanning with user-defined sensor, trajectory, tree shape
and layout parameters. Upon simulation, material classification is kept in a
pointwise fashion so leaf and woody matter are perfectly known, and unique
identifiers separate individual trees, foregoing post-simulation labelling.
This allows for an endless supply of procedurally generated data with similar
characteristics to real LiDAR captures, which can then be used for development
of data processing techniques or training of machine learning algorithms. To
validate our method, we compare the characteristics of a simulated scan with a
real scan using similar trees and the same sensor and trajectory parameters.
Results suggest the simulated data is significantly more similar to real data
than a sample-based control. We also demonstrate application of SimTreeLS on
contexts beyond the real data available, simulating scans of new tree shapes,
new trajectories and new layouts, with results presenting well. SimTreeLS is

Loops typically form when costs for new edges are small or inputs uncertain.
Here, we shed further light on the transition to loop formation. We demonstrate
that loops emerge discontinuously when decreasing the costs for new edges for
both an edge-damage model and a fluctuating sink model. Mathematically, new
loops are shown to form through a saddle-node bifurcation. Our analysis allows
to heuristically predict the location and cost where the first loop emerges.

67 frames per second on a 1080Ti GPU. Experiments show that MODNet outperforms
prior trimap-free methods by a large margin on both Adobe Matting Dataset and a

challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which
serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud
realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) strong backbone
design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed
for LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features are shared by the semantic
branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style.
2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that
commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of
handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud
distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient
learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions
on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally,
consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic
and instance predictions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of
LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two
large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.

to tackle this problem under separability assumptions which require the sources
to appear as samples in the data set. The first algorithm generalizes the
successive nonnegative projection algorithm (SNPA), designed for linear BSS,
and is referred to as SNPALQ. By explicitly modeling the product terms inherent
to the LQ model along the iterations of the SNPA scheme, the nonlinear
contributions of the mixing are mitigated, thus improving the separation
quality. SNPALQ is shown to be able to recover the ground truth factors that
generated the data, even in the presence of noise. The second algorithm is a
brute-force (BF) algorithm, which is used as a post-processing step for SNPALQ.
It enables to discard the spurious (mixed) samples extracted by SNPALQ, thus
broadening its applicability. The BF is in turn shown to be robust to noise
under easier-to-check and milder conditions than SNPALQ. We show that SNPALQ
with and without the BF postprocessing is relevant in realistic numerical
experiments.

most of the western countries, within which foundations of quantum mechanics
were vastly dismissed as pointless speculations. In this paper, we show that in
Italy, however, the interest toward quantum foundations was revived at the turn
of the 1960s, mainly thanks to the initiative of Franco Selleri, who started
criticising the contents and the practice of modern physics (in the context of
capitalistic society), and thought that the solution was to be sought in a
rethinking of the foundations of the discipline. In 1969, supported by Luis de
Broglie himself, Selleri wrote a paper reviving the idea of hidden variables
and he successfully proposed to the Italian Physical Society to devote the
""Varenna School"" of 1970 to quantum foundations. This school's historical
pivotal importance is twofold: it gathered some of the most preeminent
international physicists working on the foundations of quantum theory; and it
provided a first platform for young physicists to express their dissatisfaction
towards ""scientism"". In fact, Selleri's highly politicised views found the
favour of a critical mass of young, left-wing physicists, who made of quantum
foundations their main topic of research in the 1970s. Although these
physicists understood very early the central importance of Bell's theorem,
their (ideological) aim was to demonstrate that quantum theory could have
limits of validity. Such a research program turned out to be unsuccessful, yet
the Italian endeavour was worldwide one of the first and most significant
revivals of the interest towards quantum foundations.

however, they pose severe problems for artificial agents. For starters, a
natural language command requesting something will leave many pieces of
information necessary for performing the task unspecified. Humans can solve
such problems fast as we reduce the search space by recourse to prior knowledge
such as a connected collection of plans that describe how certain goals can be
achieved at various levels of abstraction. Rather than enumerating fine-grained
physical contexts SOMA sets out to include socially constructed knowledge about
the functions of actions to achieve a variety of goals or the roles objects can
play in a given situation. As the human cognition system is capable of
generalizing experiences into abstract knowledge pieces applicable to novel
situations, we argue that both physical and social context need be modeled to
tackle these challenges in a general manner. This is represented by the link
between the physical and social context in SOMA where relationships are
established between occurrences and generalizations of them, which has been
demonstrated in several use cases that validate SOMA.

on the use of bulky cavities hindering applications in subwavelength photonics.
Here, we propose a novel mechanism of optical isolation by integrating the
unique dispersion of a hyperbolic metamaterial with the transverse spin-orbit
interaction of evanescent waves. We show that rotation of a subwavelength
hyperbolic nanoparticle breaks the time-reversal symmetry and yields two
resonant chiral modes that selectively couple to the transverse spin of
waveguide modes. Remarkably, the transverse spin-orbit interaction can give
rise to unidirectional coupling and $>95\%$ isolation of infrared light at an
experimentally feasible rotation speed. Our work fuses the two important fields
of optical isolation and photonic spin-orbit interactions, leading to
magnetic-free yet compact nonreciprocal devices for novel applications in
optical communications, chiral quantum optics, and topological photonics.

show that diffusion close to the droplet contact line controls the coffee-ring
structure in the initial stages of evaporation. We perform a systematic matched
asymptotic analysis for two evaporation models -- a simple, non-equilibrium,
one-sided model (in which the evaporative flux is taken to be constant across
the droplet surface) and a vapour-diffusion limited model (in which the
evaporative flux is singular at the contact line) -- valid during the early
stages in which the solute remains dilute. We call this the `nascent coffee
ring' and describe the evolution of its features, including the size and
location of the peak concentration and a measure of the width of the ring.
Moreover, we use the asymptotic results to investigate when the assumption of a
dilute solute breaks down and the effects of finite particle size and jamming
are expected to become important. In particular, we illustrate the limited
validity of this model in the diffusive evaporative flux regime.

when the data are sparse and noisy. It is also difficult to discover
heterogeneous parametric PDEs where heterogeneous parameters are embedded in

discovery. In the framework, a deep neural network is firstly trained with
observation data to generate meta-data and calculate derivatives. Then, a
unified integral form is defined, and the genetic algorithm is employed to
discover the best structure. Finally, the value of parameters is calculated,
and whether the parameters are constants or variables is identified. Numerical
experiments proved that our proposed algorithm is more robust to noise and more
accurate compared with existing methods due to the utilization of integral
form. Our proposed algorithm is also able to discover PDEs with high-order

applications. While practitioners prefer Adam because it requires less

practical performance. In this paper, we propose a new method named Adam$^+$

but it also has several noticeable differences: (i) it does not maintain the
moving average of second moment estimate but instead computes the moving
average of first moment estimate at extrapolated points; (ii) its adaptive step
size is formed not by dividing the square root of second moment estimate but
instead by dividing the root of the norm of first moment estimate. As a result,
Adam$^+$ requires few parameter tuning, as Adam, but it enjoys a provable
convergence guarantee. Our analysis further shows that Adam$^+$ enjoys adaptive
variance reduction, i.e., the variance of the stochastic gradient estimator
reduces as the algorithm converges, hence enjoying an adaptive convergence. We
also propose a more general variant of Adam$^+$ with different adaptive step
sizes and establish their fast convergence rate. Our empirical studies on
various deep learning tasks, including image classification, language modeling,

state as unanimously required for most adiabatic crossing, this work reports a
faster sweeping policy taking advantage of excited level dynamics. It is
obtained based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) from a multi-step training
scheme we develop. In the absence of loss, a fidelity $\ge 99\%$ between
prepared and the target Dicke state is achieved over a small fraction of the
adiabatically required time. When loss is included, training is carried out

The flow is forced inertially by a canonical oscillating grid using either its
normal (He~I) or superfluid (He~II) phase, generating a statistically
stationary turbulence. We characterise the turbulent properties of the flow
using 2D Lagrangian Particle tracking on hollow glass micro-spheres. As
expected for tracer particles, the Vorono\""{i} tessellation on particle
positions does not show a significant departure from a random Poisson process
neither in He~I nor He~II phase. Particles' positions are tracked with high
temporal resolution, allowing to resolve velocity fluctuations at integral and
inertial scales while properly assessing the noise contribution. Additionally,
we differentiate the particles' positions (by convolution with Gaussian
kernels) in order to access small scale quantities like acceleration. Using
these measured quantities and the formalism of classical Homogeneous Isotropic
Turbulence (HIT) to perform an energy budget across scales we extract the
energy injection rate at the large scale, the energy flux cascading through
inertial scales, down to small scales at which it is dissipated. We found that
in such inertially driven turbulence, regardless of the normal or superfluid
state of the fluid, estimates of energy at the different scales are compatible
with each other and consistent with oscillating grid turbulence results
reported for normal fluids in the literature. The largest discrepancy shows up
at small scales where the signal to noise ratio is harder to control and where
the 2D measurement is contaminated by the 3D nature of the flow. This motivates
to focus future experimental projects towards small scales, low noise and 3D
measurements.

feature holds even in high-scale supersymmetry as long as the gauge coupling
unification, which is required as a prerequisite for mirage mediation,
accommodates such light Higgsinos. Under the experimental constraints on the

investigated a slightly different approach that uses only the local information

proposed learning rule is derived from the concepts of spike timing dependant

binary classification of MNIST and IRIS datasets with two hidden layers shows
comparable performance with backpropagation. The model learned using this

FGSM attack compared to the model learned through backpropagation of

coating and partially transmitting outer glass in the thermal infrared,
especially when constructed from borosilicate. We develop analytic expressions
for the heat transfer through the outer envelope and show the equations no

using an evacuated solar collector manufactured in the 1980s by the Nitto Kohki

typical heat transfer characteristics using net radiative heat flows in both

results confirm that the effective emittance method can be used in situations
with typical glass wall thickness and temperatures. At temperatures greater

significantly within the transmitting region of the outer glass and can no
longer be neglected. The work has verified the stability of the vacuum in this

has questioned the conventional belief of supercritical fluid as a single phase
with varying properties. On the same line, a novel two-phase approach has been
proposed to study the supercritical flow with heat transfer deterioration (HTD)
phenomena. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model has been used to analyze
the flow, and the simulation result reasonably predicts the wall temperature
peaks. Moreover, the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles for
different axial locations explain the occurrence of HTD, and it is on par with
the pre-existing numerical method. Besides, the quantitative analysis presented
in the paper expounds on qualitative understanding. The parametric study of the
thermophysical properties revealed that the density variation is the primary
cause of HTD in supercritical flows. So banking on this conclusion, the
propounded study focuses on the forces generated due to the density variation.
This technique equips us with a holistic picture of the supercritical flows. It
leads to the inference that for no HTD effects to be present, buoyancy and
inertia forces have to be of comparable magnitude throughout the flow. In
addition, the pseudo phase change model outclasses the existing research by
rendering us the volume fraction data. Mapping of this variable reveals a
sudden jump in the lighter phase's thickness near the wall at the site of HTD,
which is also reflected as a maximum in the nondimensional two-phase thickness
(P) plot. Nevertheless, this observation is only restricted to HTD caused by
buoyancy. In the end, a theoretical expression has been conceptualized for
computing the two-phase thickness (h) value, which can serve as a fundamental
length scale in supercritical flows as it marks the region of highest property
gradient near the wall.

large-scale analysis of all the 134337 X-ray crystallographic structures of the
Protein Data Bank averaged over clusters of almost identical protein sequences.
In this work, we explore the complexity of the organization of all the
interaction interfaces observed when a protein lies in alternative complexes,
showing that interfaces progressively add up in a hierarchical way. We further
investigate the connection of this complexity with different measures of
structural disorder: the standard missing residues and a new definition, called
""soft disorder"", that covers all the flexible and structurally amorphous
residues of a protein. We show evidences that both the interaction interfaces
and the soft disordered regions tend to involve roughly the same amino-acids of
the protein, and preliminary results suggesting that soft disorder spots those
surface regions where new interfaces are progressively accommodated by complex
formation. Our results suggest that disordered regions not only carry crucial
information about the location of alternative interfaces within complexes, but
also of the order of the assembly. We verify these hypotheses in several
examples. We finally compare our measures of disorder with several disorder
predictors, showing that these latter are optimized to predict the residues
that are missing in all the alternative structures of a protein, and they are
not able to catch the progressive evolution of the disordered regions upon
complex formation. Yet, the predicted residues, if not missing, tend to be
characterized as soft disordered.

slow-rolling in a suitable potential. Ultimately, this inflaton must be
identified as the expectation value of a quantum field, evolving in a quantum
effective potential. The shape of this potential is determined by the
underlying tree-level potential, dressed by quantum corrections from the scalar
field itself and the metric perturbations. Following [1], we compute the
effective scalar field equations and the corrected Friedmann equations to
quadratic order in both scalar field, scalar metric and tensor perturbations.
We identify the quantum corrections from different sources at leading order in
slow-roll, and estimate their magnitude in benchmark models of inflation. We
comment on the implications of non-minimal coupling to gravity in this context.

Spectral Gap Condition, which was used in the theory of inertial manifolds by

allows to construct inertial manifolds for semilinear parabolic equations

  Science",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in securing face recognition
systems from the presentation attacks (PAs). As more and more realistic PAs
with novel types spring up, it is necessary to develop robust algorithms for
detecting unknown attacks even in unseen scenarios. However, deep models
supervised by traditional binary loss (e.g., `0' for bonafide vs. `1' for PAs)
are weak in describing intrinsic and discriminative spoofing patterns.
Recently, pixel-wise supervision has been proposed for the FAS task, intending
to provide more fine-grained pixel/patch-level cues. In this paper, we firstly
give a comprehensive review and analysis about the existing pixel-wise
supervision methods for FAS. Then we propose a novel pyramid supervision, which
guides deep models to learn both local details and global semantics from
multi-scale spatial context. Extensive experiments are performed on five FAS
benchmark datasets to show that, without bells and whistles, the proposed
pyramid supervision could not only improve the performance beyond existing
pixel-wise supervision frameworks, but also enhance the model's
interpretability (i.e., locating the patch-level positions of PAs more
reasonably). Furthermore, elaborate studies are conducted for exploring the
efficacy of different architecture configurations with two kinds of pixel-wise
supervisions (binary mask and depth map supervisions), which provides
inspirable insights for future architecture/supervision design.

  We leverage the fellow traveling to derive a correspondence between recurrent

correspondence can be promoted to a homeomorphism on the circle of directions.
By analysing cuspidal winding of a typical WP geodesic ray, we show that the
homeomorphism pushes forward a Lebesgue measure on the circle to a singular

down to a comparison that we prove, namely, the average coefficient is bounded

show how different implementations lead to different compromises. We measure

show that, when DTLS/TLS 1.3 requires more resources than DTLS/TLS 1.2, this
additional overhead is quite reasonable. We also observe that, in some
configurations, DTLS/TLS 1.3 actually decreases overhead and resource
consumption. All in all, our study indicates that there is still room to
optimize the existing implementations of these protocols.

the function-on-function linear regression model where each value of the
response, at any domain point, depends on the full trajectory of the predictor.
The AdaSS estimator is obtained by the optimization of an objective function
with two spatially adaptive penalties, based on initial estimates of the
partial derivatives of the regression coefficient function. This allows the
proposed estimator to adapt more easily to the true coefficient function over
regions of large curvature and not to be undersmoothed over the remaining part
of the domain. A novel evolutionary algorithm is developed ad hoc to obtain the
optimization tuning parameters. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations have been
carried out to compare the AdaSS estimator with competitors that have already
appeared in the literature before. The results show that our proposal mostly
outperforms the competitor in terms of estimation and prediction accuracy.
Lastly, those advantages are illustrated also on two real-data benchmark
examples.

measured only in Hermitian systems, where the role of the quantum metric is
mostly shown to determine corrections to physical effects. On the contrary, in
non-Hermitian systems, and in particular near exceptional points, the quantum
metric is expected to diverge and to often play a dominant role, for example on
the enhanced sensing and on wave packet dynamics. In this work, we report the
first experimental measurement of the quantum metric in a non-Hermitian system.
The specific platform under study is an organic microcavity with
exciton-polariton eigenstates, which demonstrate exceptional points. We measure

$n=-1.01\pm0.08$, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions for the

nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers for quantum metrology and quantum information
applications. Different methods showed different nuclear spin polarization
efficiencies and rely on electronic spin polarization associated to the NV
center, which in turn crucially depends on the inter-system crossing. Recently,
the rates involved in the inter-system crossing have been measured leading to
different transition rate models. Here, we consider the effect of these rates
on several nuclear polarization methods based on the level anti-crossing, and
precession of the nuclear population while the electronic spin is in the ms = 0
and ms = 1 spin states. We show that the nuclear polarization depends on the
power of optical excitation used to polarize the electronic spin. The degree of
nuclear spin polarization is different for each transition rate model.
Therefore, the results presented here are relevant for validating these models
and for polarizing nuclear spins. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of
each method by considering the nuclear position relative to the symmetry axis
of the NV center.

Universe. Although they host very old stellar populations, several studies
found the existence of blue cores in some BCGs indicating ongoing star
formation. We analyse VLT/X-Shooter stacked spectra of 6 nearby massive central
galaxies with high central velocity dispersions ($\sigma$>300 km/s) at
different galactocentric distances. We quantify the young stellar population
out to 4 kpc by fitting near-UV and optical absorption line indices with
predictions of composite stellar populations modelled by an old and a young
stellar component. We also use IMF-sensitive indices since these galaxies have
been found to host a bottom-heavy IMF in their central regions. We derive
negative young stellar populations gradients, with mass fractions of stars
younger than 1 Gyr decreasing with galactocentric distance, from 0.70% within
0.8 kpc to zero beyond 2 kpc. We also measure the mass fraction in young stars
for individual galaxies in the highest S/N central regions. All the galaxies
have young components of less than one percent. Our results clearly suggest
that the star formation in massive central cluster galaxies takes place in
their galaxy cores (<2 kpc), which, with deeper gravitational potential wells,
are capable of retaining more gas. Among the possible sources for the gas
required to form these young stars, our results are consistent with an in-situ
origin via stellar evolution, which is sufficient to produce the observed young
stellar populations.

neural architecture search (NAS). For NAS, we typically have to calculate the
validation accuracy of a large number of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), what is
computationally complex. Predictor-based NAS algorithms address this problem.
They train a proxy model that can infer the validation accuracy of DNNs
directly from their network structure. During optimization, the proxy can be
used to narrow down the number of architectures for which the true validation
accuracy must be computed, what makes predictor-based algorithms sample
efficient. Usually, we compute the proxy for all DNNs in the network search
space and pick those that maximize the proxy as candidates for optimization.
However, that is intractable in practice, because the search spaces are often
very large and contain billions of network architectures. The contributions of
this paper are threefold: 1) We define a sample efficiency gain to compare
different predictor-based NAS algorithms. 2) We conduct experiments on the
NASBench-101 dataset and show that the sample efficiency of predictor-based
algorithms decreases dramatically if the proxy is only computed for a subset of
the search space. 3) We show that if we choose the subset of the search space
on which the proxy is evaluated in a smart way, the sample efficiency of the
original predictor-based algorithm that has access to the full search space can
be regained. This is an important step to make predictor-based NAS algorithms
useful, in practice.

sketch of an input data matrix X in O(nnz(X))time where nnz(X) denotes the
number of non-zero entries in X. The sketched matrix will be much smaller than
X while preserving most of its properties. Therefore, count-sketch is widely
used for addressing high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. However,
there are two main limitations of count-sketch: (1) The sketching matrix used
count-sketch is generated randomly which does not consider any intrinsic data
properties of X. This data-oblivious matrix sketching method could produce a
bad sketched matrix which will result in low accuracy for subsequent machine
learning tasks (e.g.classification); (2) For highly sparse input data,
count-sketch could produce a dense sketched data matrix. This dense sketch
matrix could make the subsequent machine learning tasks more computationally
expensive than on the original sparse data X. To address these two limitations,
we first show an interesting connection between count-sketch and k-means
clustering by analyzing the reconstruction error of the count-sketch method.
Based on our analysis, we propose to reduce the reconstruction error of
count-sketch by using k-means clustering algorithm to obtain the
low-dimensional sketched matrix. In addition, we propose to solve k-mean
clustering using gradient descent with -L1 ball projection to produce a sparse
sketched matrix. Our experimental results based on six real-life classification
datasets have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy
than the original count-sketch and other popular matrix sketching algorithms.
Our results also demonstrate that our method produces a sparser sketched data

However, extremely small memory and low-energy budgets have so far prevented
wide use of VMs on typical microcontroller-based IoT devices. In this paper, we
explore the potential of two minimal VM approaches on such low-power hardware.
We design rBPF, a register-based VM based on extended Berkeley Packet Filters
(eBPF). We compare it with a stack-based VM based on WebAssembly (Wasm) adapted
for embedded systems. We implement prototypes of each VM, hosted in the IoT
operating system RIOT. We perform measurements on commercial off-the-shelf IoT
hardware. Unsurprisingly, we observe that both Wasm and rBPF virtual machines
yield execution time and memory overhead, compared to not using a VM. We show
however that this execution time overhead is tolerable for low-throughput,
low-energy IoT devices. We further show that, while using a VM based on Wasm
entails doubling the memory budget for a simple networked IoT application using
a 6LoWPAN/CoAP stack, using a VM based on rBPF requires only negligible memory
overhead (less than 10% more memory). rBPF is thus a promising approach to host
small software modules, isolated from OS software, and updatable on-demand,

giants is confirmed by the optical/infrared color-color diagrams ($r-z/z-H$ and
$B-V/V-R$), and the Gaia measurement of parallax and proper motion. The RSGs
are then identified by their outstanding location in the members' $J-K/K$
diagram due to high luminosity and low effective temperature. The resultant
sample has 5,498 and 3,055 RSGs in M31 and M33 respectively, which should be
complete because the lower limiting $K$ magnitude of RSGs in both cases is
brighter than the complete magnitude of the UKIRT photometry. Analysis of the
control fields finds that the pollution rate in the RSGs sample is less than

  the COVID-19 pandemic","19 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As of November 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in
many countries. In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late
spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew
throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of
the effective reproduction numbers ${\cal R}(t)$ for each country by
integrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based
on the estimated ${\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.
The result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries
respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we
extend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$
of new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social
response is on the form $d_t{\cal R}=-\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold
for response. The response rate $\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or
above this threshold, on three parameters $\nu_1,\;\nu_2,\,\nu_3,$, and on $t$.
When $X<X^*$, $\nu= \nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when
the incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\nu=\nu_2\exp{(-\nu_3t)}$, models the
impact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\nu_3$
represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time
passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19
epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters
$\nu_1,\,\nu_2,\,\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\cal R}_0$, for
different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social
responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave
in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during
the summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the
fall.

Low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) of target and the interference caused by
irregular background clutter make it difficult to get an accurate result. In
this paper, small targets are considered to have two characteristics of high
contrast and isotropy, and we propose a multilayer gray difference (MGD) method
constrained by isotropy. Firstly, the suspected regions are obtained through
MGD, and then the eigenvalues of the original image's Hessian matrix are
calculated to obtain the isotropy parameter of each region. Finally, those
regions do not meet the isotropic constraint condition are suppressed.
Experiments show that the proposed method is effective and superior to several

further divided active regions into three classes. Class A comprised magnetic
bipoles obeying Hale's polarity law, Joy's law, and exhibiting more coherent
leading polarity in comparison with the following one. The second class B
included active regions violating at least one of the aforementioned empirical

active region (AR) when it is on the stage of early emergence. The aim of this
study is to probe two parameters of the photospheric magnetic field, both
derived during the emergence phase of an AR, and to compare them with the flare
productivity of the well-developed AR. The parameters are: (i) the index of the
magnetic power spectrum (the slope of the spectrum) on the stage of emergence,
and (ii) the flux emergence rate. Analysis of 243 emerging ARs showed that the
magnetic power index increases from values typical for quiet-Sun regions to the
values typical for mature ARs within a day while the emergence proceeds for
several days; frequently, after the increase, the value of the power index
undulates around some mean value with fluctuations being several time less than
the growth of the power index during the emergence onset. For a subset of 34
flare-productive ARs we found no correlation between the power spectrum index
at the stage of emergence and flare index derived from the entire interval of
the AR's presence on the disc. At the same time, the flux emergence rate
correlates well with the flare index (the Pearson's correlation coefficient is
0.74). We conclude that high flux emergence rate is a necessary condition for
an AR to produce strong flares in the future, and so, the flux emergence rate
can be used to probe the future flare productivity of the AR.

incorporates, for the first time, the role of mechanical straining as the
electrochemical driving force, accelerating corrosion kinetics. The
computational complexities associated with tracking the evolving
metal-electrolyte interface are resolved by making use of a phase field
paradigm, enabling an accurate approximation of complex SCC morphologies. The
coupled electro-chemo-mechanical formulation is numerically implemented using
the finite element method and an implicit time integration scheme;
displacements, phase field order parameter and concentration are the primary
variables. Five case studies of particular interest are addressed to showcase
the predictive capabilities of the model, revealing an excellent agreement with
analytical solutions and experimental measurements. By modelling these
paradigmatic 2D and 3D boundary value problems we show that our formulation can
capture: (i) the transition from activation-controlled corrosion to
diffusion-controlled corrosion, (ii) the sensitivity of interface kinetics to
mechanical stresses and strains, (iii) the role of film passivation in reducing
corrosion rates, and (iv) the dependence of the stability of the passive film
to local strain rates. The influence of these factors in driving the shape

change of orbital period of neutron star binary systems. The observational

the mesh vertices under prescribed geometric conditions. This occurs in
particular in methods cycling through the constraint set such as Position-Based
Dynamics (PBD). A common case is the approximate local area preservation of
triangular 2D meshes under external editing constraints. At the constraint
level, this yields the nonconvex optimal triangle projection under prescribed
area problem, for which there does not currently exist a direct solution
method. In current PBD implementations, the area preservation constraint is
linearised. The solution comes out through the iterations, without a guarantee
of optimality, and the process may fail for degenerate inputs where the
vertices are colinear or colocated. We propose a closed-form solution method
and its numerically robust algebraic implementation. Our method handles
degenerate inputs through a two-case analysis of the problem's generic
ambiguities. We show in a series of experiments in area-based 2D mesh editing
that using optimal projection in place of area constraint linearisation in PBD
speeds up and stabilises convergence.

In
particular, graphs are one of the most powerful tools, being able to represent
relations between objects. Causal relations are frequently represented by
directed graphs, with nodes denoting causes and links denoting causal
influence. A causal graph is a skeletal picture, showing causal associations
and impact between entities. Common methods used for graphically representing
causal scenarios are neurons, truth tables, causal Bayesian networks, cognitive
maps and Petri Nets. Causality is often defined in terms of precedence (the
cause precedes the effect), concurrency (often, an effect is provoked
simultaneously by two or more causes), circularity (a cause provokes the effect
and the effect reinforces the cause) and imprecision (the presence of the cause
favors the effect, but not necessarily causes it). We will show that, even
though the traditional graphical models are able to represent separately some
of the properties aforementioned, they fail trying to illustrate indistinctly
all of them. To approach that gap, we will introduce Fuzzy Stochastic Timed
Petri Nets as a graphical tool able to represent time, co-occurrence, looping
and imprecision in causal flow.

$U$. We calculate the ground state and correlation functions for all possible
distances, the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, as well as
thermodynamic properties, namely the specific heat and spin susceptibility.
  We find that unlike the exactly solvable C$_{20}$ to C$_{32}$, the lowest
excited state is a triplet rather than a singlet, indicating a reduced
frustration due to the presence of many hexagon faces and the separation of the
pentagon faces. This implies that frustration may be tuneable within the
fullerenes by changing their size.
  The spin-spin correlations are much stronger along the hexagon bonds and
rapidly decrease with distance, so that the molecule is large enough not to be
correlated across its whole extent. The specific heat shows a high-temperature
peak and a low-temperature shoulder reminiscent of the Kagom\'e lattice, while
the spin susceptibility shows a single broad peak and is very close to the one
of C$_{20}$.

its impact in application problems such as disease treatments (diabetes, HIV,
influenza, among many others), where the control action (drug administration)
is given by short-duration pulses followed by time periods of null values.
Within this framework the concept of equilibrium needs to be extended
(redefined) to allows the system to keep orbiting (between two consecutive
pulses) in some state space regions out of the origin, according to usual
objectives of most real applications. Although such regions can be
characterized by means of a discrete-time system obtained by sampling the NIS
at the impulsive times, no agreements have reached about their asymptotic
stability (AS). This paper studies the asymptotic stability of control
equilibrium orbits for NSI, based on the underlying discrete time system, in
order to establish the conditions under which the AS for the latter leads to
the AS for the former. Furthermore, based on the latter AS characterization, an
impulsive Model Predictive Control (i-MPC) that feasibly stabilizes the
non-linear impulsive system is presented. Finally, the proposed stable MPC is
applied to two control problems of interest: the intravenous bolus
administration of Lithium and the administration of antiretrovirals for HIV
treatments.

plays essential theoretical and practical roles. The research article discusses
the experiences of unsupervised training of neural networks to represent
elements on the 2D latent space based on their electron configurations. To
emphasize chemical properties of the elements, the original data of electron
configurations has been realigned towards valence orbitals. Recognizing seven
shells and four subshells, the input data has been arranged as 7x4 images.
Latent space representation has been performed using a convolutional beta
variational autoencoder (beta-VAE). Despite discrete and sparse input data, the
beta-VAE disentangles elements of different periods, blocks, groups, and types.
The unsupervised representation of elements on the latent space reveals
pairwise symmetries of periods and elements related to the invariance of
quantum numbers of corresponding elements. In addition, it isolates outliers
that turned out to be known cases of Madelung's rule violations for lanthanide
and actinide elements. Considering the generative capabilities of beta-VAE, the
supervised machine learning has been set to find out if there are insightful
patterns distinguishing electron configurations between real elements and
decoded artificial ones. Also, the article addresses the capability of dual
representation by autoencoders. Conventionally, autoencoders represent
observations of input data on the latent space. By transposing and duplicating
original input data, it is possible to represent variables on the latent space
which can lead to the discovery of meaningful patterns among input variables.
Applying that unsupervised learning for transposed data of electron
configurations, the order of input variables that has been arranged by the
encoder on the latent space has turned out to exactly match the sequence of
Madelung's rule.

(AVS), is a core theme in multimedia data management and retrieval. The success
of AVS counts on cross-modal representation learning that encodes both query
sentences and videos into common spaces for semantic similarity computation.
Inspired by the initial success of previously few works in combining multiple
sentence encoders, this paper takes a step forward by developing a new and
general method for effectively exploiting diverse sentence encoders. The
novelty of the proposed method, which we term Sentence Encoder Assembly (SEA),
is two-fold. First, different from prior art that use only a single common
space, SEA supports text-video matching in multiple encoder-specific common
spaces. Such a property prevents the matching from being dominated by a
specific encoder that produces an encoding vector much longer than other
encoders. Second, in order to explore complementarities among the individual
common spaces, we propose multi-space multi-loss learning. As extensive
experiments on four benchmarks (MSR-VTT, TRECVID AVS 2016-2019, TGIF and MSVD)
show, SEA surpasses the state-of-the-art. In addition, SEA is extremely ease to
implement. All this makes SEA an appealing solution for AVS and promising for
continuously advancing the task by harvesting new sentence encoders.

fact, inadequate system software support is responsible for a decade of
underutilized hardware support for 1GB pages.
  Through extensive experimentation on a real system, we demonstrate that 1GB
pages can improve performance over 2MB pages, and when used in tandem with 2MB
pages for an important set of applications; the support for the latter is
crucial but missing in current systems. Our design and implementation of
\trident{} in Linux fully exploit hardware supported large pages by dynamically
and transparently allocating 1GB, 2MB, and 4KB pages as deemed suitable.
\trident{} speeds up eight memory-intensive applications by {$18\%$}, on
average, over Linux's use of 2MB pages. We also propose \tridentpv{}, an
extension to \trident{} that effectively virtualizes 1GB pages via copy-less
promotion and compaction in the guest OS. Overall, this paper shows that even
GB-sized pages have considerable practical significance with adequate software

Therefore, the differences in the content of the magazines aimed specifically

men-oriented one, both produced by the same editorial group, over a decade
(2008-2018). With Topic Modelling techniques we identify the main themes
discussed in the magazines and quantify how much the presence of these topics
differs between magazines over time. Then, we performed a word-frequency
analysis to validate this methodology and extend the analysis to other subjects
that did not emerge automatically. Our results show that the frequency of
appearance of the topics Family, Business and Women as sex objects, present an
initial bias that tends to disappear over time. Conversely, in Fashion and
Science topics, the initial differences between both magazines are maintained.
Besides, we show that in 2012, the content associated with horoscope increased
in the women-oriented magazine, generating a new gap that remained open over
time. Also, we show a strong increase in the use of words associated with
feminism since 2015 and specifically the word abortion in 2018. Overall, these

calibration based on emission-line ratios little sensitive to the shock
presence. The models were used to reproduce optical (3000 < A < 7000) emission
line intensities of 244 local (z < 0.4) Seyfert 2s, whose observational data
were selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Our models suggest that shocks
in Seyfert 2 nuclei have velocities in the range of 50-300 km/s and imply a
narrower metallicity range (0.6 < (Z/Z) < 1.6) than those derived using pure
photoionization models. Our results indicate that shock velocity in AGNs can
not be estimated using standard optical line ratio diagrams, based on
integrated spectra. Our models predict a different temperature structure and
O+/O and O2+/O fractional abundances throughout the NLR clouds than those
derived from pure photoionization models, mainly in shock-dominated objects.
This suggests that, in order to minimize the shock effects, the combination of
emission-lines emitted by ions with similar intermediate ionization potential
could be good metallicity indicators. Finally, we derive two calibrations
between the N/O abundance ratio and the N2O2=log([N II]6584/[O II]3727) and

currently attract increasing interest since they are versatile and highly
tunable systems for probing many-body physics quantum phenomena, such as
superfluidity. Superfluid flow of light has already been reported in
microcavity exciton-polariton condensates but clear observation of this
phenomenon in cavityless systems, that is, for propagating photon fluids,
remains elusive. In this thesis, we study the hydrodynamical properties of
light propagating close to resonance in hot rubidium vapors. Whereas photons in
air are not interacting with each other, the situation is different in rubidium
vapors, as an effective interaction between them, mediated by the atomic
ensemble, appears. The light behaves therefore as a fluid flowing in the plane
perpendicular to the optical axis. The primary purpose of this thesis was to
show that light in those systems can behave as a superfluid. The first step
toward the observation of superfluidity is to measure the dispersion relation
of small amplitude density waves travelling onto the propagating photon fluid.
I show that this dispersion exhibits a linear trend for small excitation
wave-vectors, which is, according to the Landau criterion, a sufficient

temporal information contained in the raw time-series data obtained from

sensor variables and the temporal dependency of each sensor on others which
considerably increases the performance of fault detection model. A 10-fold
cross-validation approach is used to verify the generalization of the model and
evaluate the classification metrics. To evaluate the performance of the model,
simulated data from a benchmark floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) with

radiation pattern of the antenna. It is analyzed that if changes in variables

from sentence descriptions of sound classes. Audio classification is performed
by a linear compatibility function that measures how compatible an acoustic
embedding and a semantic embedding are. We evaluate the proposed method on a
small balanced dataset ESC-50 and a large-scale unbalanced audio subset of
AudioSet. The experimental results show that classification performance is
significantly improved by involving sound classes that are semantically close
to the test classes in training. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that both label

Classification performance is improved by concatenating label/sentence

bound for the distance between the side information and the data is known. As a
corollary, we also show that our algorithms provide efficient schemes for the

which attains the optimal convergence rate by exploiting the fact that the
gradient estimates are close to each other. Specifically, the gradient
compression scheme in our algorithm first uses half of the parties to form side
information and then uses our Wyner-Ziv estimator to compress the remaining
half of the gradient estimates.

study examines the causal relationship between the ratio of thermal power in
total power generation (RTPG) and economic growth (GDP) in the western and
central China by using the heterogeneous mixed panel Granger causality approach
that accounts for both slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. For
the overall panel, the empirical findings support the presence of
unidirectional causality running from GDP to RTPG (in northwest China), and
from RTPG to GDP (in central). At the provincial level, there is causality from
GDP to RTPG in NeiMongol and Ningxia, and causality from RTPG to GDP in Shanxi,
Anhui, and Jiangxi. As for the cross regions relationships, we find that GDP
(in western) Granger-cause RTPG (in central), and RTPG (in southwest)
Granger-cause GDP (in central and northwest). Moreover, panel regressions show
the negative impact from GDP to RTPG in the northwest, and RTPG to GDP in the
central. However, RTPG has a positive influence on GDP in the northwest.
Therefore, to improve economic development without compromising the regions'
competitiveness in central and western China, we can adjust the power
generation structure, and increase investments in the renewable energy supply
and energy efficiency.

non-pharmaceutical interventions like wearing masks, physical distancing,
lockdown, and travel restrictions. Because of their economic and logistical
effects, tracking mobility changes during quarantines is crucial in assessing
their efficacy and predicting the virus spread. Chile, one of the worst-hit
countries in the world, unlike many other countries, implemented quarantines at
a more localized level, shutting down small administrative zones, rather than
the whole country or large regions. Given the non-obvious effects of these
localized quarantines, tracking mobility becomes even more critical in Chile.
To assess the impact on human mobility of the localized quarantines in Chile,
we analyze a mobile phone dataset made available by Telef\'onica Chile, which
comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records and 5.4 million users covering the
period February 26th to September 20th, 2020. From these records, we derive
three epidemiologically relevant metrics describing the mobility within and
between comunas. The datasets made available can be used to fight the COVID-19
epidemics, particularly for localized quarantines' less understood effect.

The topology consists of a modular DCDC converter and a tap selector, where the
DC-DC converter provides several DC-output levels and the tap selector produces
an AC signal by choosing different DC-output signals from the DC-DC converter.
To produce the DC-levels, the DC-DC converter consists of a modular structure
where the modules are connected in series. The novelty is that the modules are
connected both, magnetically in the AC-domain and electrically in the DCdomain.
Due to the usage of low power switches in the modules, the proposed structure
provides high efficiency. Furthermore, the DC-DC converter is capable of
self-balancing its modules and thus does not require large capacitors which
yields a high power density. A prototype of the proposed converter is built and
simulation, as well as experimental results, are used to verify the findings.

translation, i.e., both source-to-target and target-to-source translation using
a single model. If we exclude some pioneering attempts, such as multilingual
systems, all other bidirectional translation approaches are required to train
two individual models. This paper proposes to build a single end-to-end
bidirectional translation model using a two-dimensional grid, where the
left-to-right decoding generates source-to-target, and the bottom-to-up
decoding creates target-to-source output. Instead of training two models
independently, our approach encourages a single network to jointly learn to
translate in both directions. Experiments on the WMT 2018
German$\leftrightarrow$English and Turkish$\leftrightarrow$English translation
tasks show that the proposed model is capable of generating a good translation
quality and has sufficient potential to direct the research.

transcription, which provides a supervision signal from the source side and
helps the transformation between source speech and target text. Such modeling
suffers from error propagation between ASR and MT models. Direct speech
translation is an alternative method to avoid error propagation; however, its
performance is often behind the cascade system. To use an intermediate
representation and preserve the end-to-end trainability, previous studies have
proposed using two-stage models by passing the hidden vectors of the recognizer
into the decoder of the MT model and ignoring the MT encoder. This work
explores the feasibility of collapsing the entire cascade components into a
single end-to-end trainable model by optimizing all parameters of ASR and MT
models jointly without ignoring any learned parameters. It is a tightly
integrated method that passes renormalized source word posterior distributions
as a soft decision instead of one-hot vectors and enables backpropagation.
Therefore, it provides both transcriptions and translations and achieves strong
consistency between them. Our experiments on four tasks with different data
scenarios show that the model outperforms cascade models up to 1.8% in BLEU and
2.0% in TER and is superior compared to direct models.

jet passing the sharp trailing edge of a horizontally aligned flat plate under
surface tension and the weak action of gravity acting vertically in the
asymptotic slender-layer limit (J. Fluid Mech. 850, pp. 924--953, 2018). We
revisit the capillarity-driven short-scale viscous--inviscid interaction, on
account of the inherent upstream influence, immediately downstream of the edge
and scrutinise flow detachment on all smaller scales. We adhere to the
assumption of a Froude number so large that choking at the plate edge is
insignificant but envisage the variation of the relevant Weber number of O(1).
The aspect in the main focus, tackled essentially analytically, is the
continuation of the structure of the flow towards scales much smaller then the
interactive ones and where it no longer can be treated as slender. As a
remarkable phenomenon, this analysis predicts harmonic capillary ripples of
Rayleigh type, prevalent on the free surface upstream of the trailing edge.
They exhibit an increase of both the wavelength and amplitude as the
characteristic Weber number decreases. Finally, the theory clarifies the actual
detachment process, unprecedented in the rational theories of flow separation.
At this stage, the wetting properties of the fluid and the microscopically
wedge-shaped edge, viewed as infinitely thin on the larger scales, come into
play. As this geometry typically models the exit of a spout, the predicted
wetting of the wedge is related to what in the literature is referred to as the
so-called teapot effect.

street-view query images by matching with GPS-tagged reference images from
aerial view. Recent works have achieved surprisingly high retrieval accuracy on
city-scale datasets. However, these results rely on the assumption that there
exists a reference image exactly centered at the location of any query image,
which is not applicable for practical scenarios. In this paper, we redefine
this problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be
arbitrary in the area of interest and the reference images are captured before
the queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of
existing datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned
pairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location.
To bridge the gap between this realistic setting and existing datasets, we
propose a new large-scale benchmark -- VIGOR -- for cross-View Image
Geo-localization beyond One-to-one Retrieval. We benchmark existing
state-of-the-art methods and propose a novel end-to-end framework to localize
the query in a coarse-to-fine manner. Apart from the image-level retrieval
accuracy, we also evaluate the localization accuracy in terms of the actual
distance (meters) using the raw GPS data. Extensive experiments are conducted
under different application scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The results indicate that cross-view geo-localization in this
realistic setting is still challenging, fostering new research in this
direction. Our dataset and code will be released at

heavy output generation problem in polynomial time. This pinpoints that
exponential resources may be unavoidable for even the most basic verification

evolution. We show how causal invariance of the hypergraph rewriting system can
be used to infer conformal invariance of the induced causal partial order, in a
manner that is provably compatible with the measure-theoretic arguments of
Bombelli, Henson and Sorkin. We then illustrate how many of the local dimension
estimation algorithms developed in the context of the Wolfram model may be
reformulated as generalizations of the midpoint scaling estimator on causal
sets, and are compatible with the generalized Myrheim-Meyer estimators, as well
as exploring how the presence of the underlying hypergraph structure yields a
significantly more robust technique for estimating spacelike distances when
compared against several standard distance and predistance estimator functions
in causal set theory. We finally demonstrate how the Benincasa-Dowker action on
causal sets can be recovered as a special case of the discrete Einstein-Hilbert
action over Wolfram model systems (with ergodicity assumptions in the
hypergraph replaced by Poisson distribution assumptions in the causal set), and
also how both classical and quantum sequential growth dynamics can be recovered

detect samples of dual or multiple active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies.
Although galaxy mergers are common, the detection of dual AGN is rare. Their
detection is very important as they help us understand the formation of
supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, SMBH growth and AGN feedback effects
in multiple nuclei systems. There is thus a need for an algorithm to do a
systematic survey of existing imaging data for the discovery of DNGs and dual
AGN. We have tested GOTHIC on a known sample of DNGs and subsequently applied
it to a sample of a million SDSS DR16 galaxies lying in the redshift range of 0

159 dual AGN in this sample, of which 2 are triple AGN systems. Our results
show that dual AGN are not common, and triple AGN even rarer. The color (u-r)
magnitude plots of the DNGs indicate that star formation is quenched as the
nuclei come closer and as the AGN fraction increases. The quenching is
especially prominent for dual/triple AGN galaxies that lie in the extreme end

  ISIS Foreign Fighters","37 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper compares networks of foreign fighters who joined the Islamic State
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula in order to test
whether there are differences in their recruitment and how those differences
affect the nature of the foreign fighter mobilization. It is the first study to
compare different networks of foreign fighters that joined the same group in
the same conflict at the same period of time. This study finds that foreign
fighter recruitment resembles an efficiency-secrecy tradeoff: in places where
recruitment needs to be hidden from legal scrutiny, recruitment networks are
decentralized; composed of small and more local recruitment cells. These cells
can operate more secretly and the group as a whole is more resilient to
disruption. In exchange, it is hard for the group to attract large numbers of
recruits. Whereas in places where recruitment could occur more freely,
recruitment networks are more hierarchical; comprised of a larger number of
recruits with more geographically diverse connections. The hierarchical design
of their recruitment networks may be easier to disrupt, but it also helps the
group efficiently recruit more followers if left undisturbed. This study
concludes that the ISIS foreign fighter recruitment process varied
significantly. Researchers and policymakers focused on recruitment and
radicalization should therefore carefully frame their results or policies based
on the different types of recruitment processes and the various social,
political, and legal contexts where their work takes place.

  Evasion Attack","Submitted to EMSE",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Machine learning-based security detection models have become
prevalent in modern malware and intrusion detection systems. However, previous
studies show that such models are susceptible to adversarial evasion attacks.
In this type of attack, inputs (i.e., adversarial examples) are specially
crafted by intelligent malicious adversaries, with the aim of being
misclassified by existing state-of-the-art models (e.g., deep neural networks).
Once the attackers can fool a classifier to think that a malicious input is
actually benign, they can render a machine learning-based malware or intrusion
detection system ineffective. Goal: To help security practitioners and
researchers build a more robust model against non-adaptive, white-box, and
non-targeted adversarial evasion attacks through the idea of an ensemble model.
Method: We propose an approach called Omni, the main idea of which is to
explore methods that create an ensemble of ""unexpected models""; i.e., models
whose control hyperparameters have a large distance to the hyperparameters of
an adversary's target model, with which we then make an optimized weighted
ensemble prediction. Result: In studies with five types of adversarial evasion
attacks (FGSM, BIM, JSMA, DeepFooland Carlini-Wagner) on five security datasets
(NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICAnd-Mal2017, and the Contagio PDF
dataset), we show Omni is a promising approach as a defense strategy against
adversarial attacks when compared with other baseline treatments. Conclusion:
When employing ensemble defense against adversarial evasion attacks, we suggest
creating an ensemble with unexpected models that are distant from the
attacker's expected model (i.e., target model) through methods such as
hyperparameter optimization.

peer-to-peer systems, it is more frequently associated with the architectural
style for developing cloud-native applications. From the developer's
perspective, serverless architectures allow reducing management efforts since
applications are composed using provider-managed components, e.g.,
Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings.
Blockchains are distributed systems designed to enable collaborative scenarios
involving multiple untrusted parties. It seems that the decentralized
peer-to-peer nature of blockchains makes it interesting to consider them in
serverless architectures, since resource allocation and management tasks are
not required to be performed by users. Moreover, considering their useful
properties of ensuring transaction's immutability and facilitating accountable
interactions, blockchains might enhance the overall guarantees and capabilities
of serverless architectures. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how the
blockchain technology and smart contracts fit into the serverless picture and
derive a set of scenarios in which they act as different component types in
serverless architectures. Furthermore, we formulate the implementation
requirements that have to be fulfilled to successfully use blockchains and
smart contracts in these scenarios. Finally, we investigate which existing
technologies enable these scenarios, and analyze their readiness and

applications in precision measurements. The Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Advanced Virgo use coatings of
SiO$_2$ (silica) and TiO$_2$:Ta$_2$O$_5$ (titania doped tantala) and
post-deposition annealing to 500$^\circ$C to achieve low thermal noise and low
optical absorption. Optical scattering by these coatings is a key limit to the
detectors' sensitivity. This paper describes optical scattering measurements
for single-layer ion-beam-sputtered thin films on fused silica substrates: two
samples of Ta$_2$O$_5$ and two of TiO$_2$:Ta$_2$O$_5$. Using an imaging
scatterometer at a fixed scattering angle of 12.8$^\circ$, in-situ changes in
the optical scatter of each sample were assessed during post-deposition
annealing to 500$^\circ$C in vacuum. The scatter of three of the four coated
optics was observed to decrease during the annealing process, by 25-30$\%$ for
tantala and up to 74$\%$ for titania-doped tantala, while scatter from the
fourth sample held constant. Angle-resolved scatter measurements performed
before and after vacuum annealing suggests some improvement in three of four
samples. These results demonstrate that post-deposition high-temperature
annealing of single-layer tantala and titania-doped tantala thin films in
vacuum does not lead to an increase in scatter, and may actually improve their
scatter.

  with Space-Filling Curves","17 figures, 52 pages",,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents the first classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
that can be applied directly to data from unstructured finite element meshes or
control volume grids. CNNs have been hugely influential in the areas of image
classification and image compression, both of which typically deal with data on
structured grids. Unstructured meshes are frequently used to solve partial
differential equations and are particularly suitable for problems that require
the mesh to conform to complex geometries or for problems that require variable
mesh resolution. Central to the approach are space-filling curves, which
traverse the nodes or cells of a mesh tracing out a path that is as short as
possible (in terms of numbers of edges) and that visits each node or cell
exactly once. The space-filling curves (SFCs) are used to find an ordering of
the nodes or cells that can transform multi-dimensional solutions on
unstructured meshes into a one-dimensional (1D) representation, to which 1D
convolutional layers can then be applied. Although developed in two dimensions,
the approach is applicable to higher dimensional problems.
  To demonstrate the approach, the network we choose is a convolutional
autoencoder (CAE) although other types of CNN could be used. The approach is
tested by applying CAEs to data sets that have been reordered with an SFC.
Sparse layers are used at the input and output of the autoencoder, and the use
of multiple SFCs is explored. We compare the accuracy of the SFC-based CAE with
that of a classical CAE applied to two idealised problems on structured meshes,
and then apply the approach to solutions of flow past a cylinder obtained using
the finite-element method and an unstructured mesh.

infers causal structure directly from observations of a system's behaviors
whether they are over discrete or continuous events or time. A structural
representation -- a finite- or infinite-state kernel $\epsilon$-machine -- is
extracted by a reduced-dimension transform that gives an efficient
representation of causal states and their topology. In this way, the system
dynamics are represented by a stochastic (ordinary or partial) differential
equation that acts on causal states. We introduce an algorithm to estimate the
associated evolution operator. Paralleling the Fokker-Plank equation, it
efficiently evolves causal-state distributions and makes predictions in the
original data space via an RKHS functional mapping. We demonstrate these
techniques, together with their predictive abilities, on discrete-time,
discrete-value infinite Markov-order processes generated by finite-state hidden
Markov models with (i) finite or (ii) uncountably-infinite causal states and

long-lived radionuclides, such as 238U, 232Th and 40K, near the presence of

can produce chemical species of biological importance, such as H2. Although the
proposal of radioactive decay as an alternative source of energy for living

after the recent discovery of a peculiar ecosystem in a gold mine in South

locally by water radiolysis due gamma radiation and analyse the possible
contribution of this disequilibrium for the emergence of life, considering

between the conditions caused by water radiolysis and those found on alkaline

applications. Along with a rapidly growing amount of location data, machine
learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely adopted. A key reason is that ML
inference is significantly more energy-efficient than GPS query at comparable
accuracy, and GPS signals can become extremely unreliable for specific
scenarios. To this end, several techniques such as deep neural networks have
been proposed. However, during training, almost none of them incorporate the
known structural information such as floor plan, which can be especially useful
in indoor or other structured environments. In this paper, we argue that the
state-of-the-art-systems are significantly worse in terms of accuracy because
they are incapable of utilizing these essential structural information. The
problem is incredibly hard because the structural properties are not explicitly
available, making most structural learning approaches inapplicable. Given that
both input and output space potentially contain rich structures, we study our
method through the intuitions from manifold-projection. Whereas existing
manifold based learning methods actively utilized neighborhood information,
such as Euclidean distances, our approach performs Neighbor Oblivious Learning

applications, including WiFi-based fingerprint localization and inertial
measurement unit(IMU) based device tracking, and show that it gives significant
improvement over state-of-art prediction accuracy.

linear order on their ground sets) from the Hopf-theoretic point of view. We
define a \textit{Hopf class} to be a family of pure ordered simplicial

The prototypical Hopf class is the family of ordered matroids. The idea of a
Hopf class allows us to give a systematic study of simplicial complexes related
to matroids, including shifted complexes, broken-circuit complexes, and
\textit{unbounded matroids} (which arise from unbounded generalized
permutohedra with 0/1 coordinates).
  We compute the antipodes in two cases: \textit{facet-initial complexes} (a
much larger class than shifted complexes) and unbounded ordered matroids. In
the latter case, we embed the Hopf monoid of ordered matroids into the Hopf
monoid of ordered generalized permutohedra, enabling us to compute the antipode
using the topological method of Aguiar and Ardila. The calculation is
complicated by the appearance of certain auxiliary simplicial complexes that we
call \textit{Scrope complexes}, whose Euler characteristics control certain

field in the past century. In addition to radiology imaging of tumor tissues,
digital pathology imaging, which captures histological details in high spatial
resolution, is fast becoming a routine clinical procedure for cancer diagnosis
support and treatment planning. Recent developments in deep-learning methods
facilitate the segmentation of tumor regions at almost the cellular level from
digital pathology images. The traditional shape features that were developed
for characterizing tumor boundary roughness in radiology are not applicable.
Reliable statistical approaches to modeling tumor shape in pathology images are
in urgent need. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling a tumor
boundary with a closed polygonal chain. A Bayesian landmark-based shape
analysis (BayesLASA) model is proposed to partition the polygonal chain into
mutually exclusive segments to quantify the boundary roughness piecewise. Our
fully Bayesian inference framework provides uncertainty estimates of both the
number and locations of landmarks. The BayesLASA outperforms a recently
developed landmark detection model for planar elastic curves in terms of
accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate how this model-based analysis can lead
to sharper inferences than ordinary approaches through a case study on the 246
pathology images from 143 non-small cell lung cancer patients. The case study
shows that the heterogeneity of tumor boundary roughness predicts patient
prognosis (p-value < 0.001). This statistical methodology not only presents a
new model for characterizing a digitized object's shape features by using its
landmarks, but also provides a new perspective for understanding the role of

combining multiple model predictions. Additionally these schemes allow the
uncertainty, as well as the source of the uncertainty, to be derived for the
prediction. Unfortunately these benefits come at a computational and memory
cost. To address this problem ensemble distillation (EnD) and more recently
ensemble distribution distillation (EnDD) have been proposed that compress the
ensemble into a single model, representing either the ensemble average
prediction or prediction distribution respectively. This paper examines the
application of both these distillation approaches to a sequence prediction
task, grammatical error correction (GEC). This is an important application area
for language learning tasks as it can yield highly useful feedback to the
learner. It is, however, more challenging than the standard tasks investigated
for distillation as the prediction of any grammatical correction to a word will
be highly dependent on both the input sequence and the generated output history
for the word. The performance of both EnD and EnDD are evaluated on both
publicly available GEC tasks as well as a spoken language task.

retrospective analysis of urban rail systems, taking advantage of the
availability of extensive automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle
location (AVL) data. Important inputs to such models, in addition to
origin-destination flows, include passenger path choices and train capacity.
Train capacity, which has often been overlooked in the literature, is an
important input that exhibits a lot of variabilities. The paper proposes a
simulation-based optimization (SBO) framework to simultaneously calibrate path
choices and train capacity for urban rail systems using AFC and AVL data. The
calibration is formulated as an optimization problem with a black-box objective
function. Seven algorithms from four branches of SBO solving methods are
evaluated. The algorithms are evaluated using an experimental design that
includes five scenarios, representing different degrees of path choice
randomness and crowding sensitivity. Data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit
Railway (MTR) system is used as a case study. The data is used to generate
synthetic observations used as ""ground truth"". The results show that the
response surface methods (particularly Constrained Optimization using Response
Surfaces) have consistently good performance under all scenarios. The proposed
approach drives large-scale simulation applications for monitoring and
planning.

optimization topics, due to its practical importance and methodological
interest. Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies
are hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution
methods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is
becoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care
for details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the
opportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple -- open-source --
implementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the
capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm
uses the same general methodology as Vidal et al. (2012) but also includes
additional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade
of research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP*
which consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an
insertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of
SWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches.
Moreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches
on the classical instances of Uchoa et al. (2017), HGS still stands as a
leading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and
conceptual simplicity.

challenging task due to its strong stiffness and high dimensionality. The
current work presents a deep learning-based numerical method called
DeepCombustion0.0 to solve stiff ordinary differential equation systems. The
homogeneous autoignition of DME/air mixture, including 54 species, is adopted
as an example to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the algorithm. The
training and testing datasets cover a wide range of temperature, pressure, and
mixture conditions between 750-1200 K, 30-50 atm, and equivalence ratio =
0.7-1.5. Both the first-stage low-temperature ignition (LTI) and the
second-stage high-temperature ignition (HTI) are considered. The methodology
highlights the importance of the adaptive data sampling techniques, power
transform preprocessing, and binary deep neural network (DNN) design. By using
the adaptive random samplings and appropriate power transforms, smooth
submanifolds in the state vector phase space are observed, on which two
three-layer DNNs can be appropriately trained. The neural networks are
end-to-end, which predict temporal gradients of the state vectors directly. The
results show that temporal evolutions predicted by DNN agree well with
traditional numerical methods in all state vector dimensions, including
temperature, pressure, and species concentrations. Besides, the ignition delay
time differences are within 1%. At the same time, the CPU time is reduced by
more than 20 times and 200 times compared with the HMTS and VODE method,
respectively. The current work demonstrates the enormous potential of applying
the deep learning algorithm in chemical kinetics and combustion modeling.

of the quality and quantity of water resources and their careful allocation to
the different uses. Protection of water resources requires the control of
pollution sources that may deteriorate them. This is a challenging task in
multi-stressed catchments. This work presents an approach that combines
pesticide occurrence patterns and stable isotope analyses of nitrogen
(delta15N-NO3-, delta15N-NH4+), oxygen (delta18O-NO3-), and boron (delta11B) to
discriminate the origin of pesticides and nitrogenpollution to tackle this
challenge. The approach has been applied to a Mediterranean subcatchment
subject to a variety of natural and anthropogenic pressures. Combining the
results from both analytical approaches in selected locations of the basin, the
urban/industrial activity was identified as the main pressure on the quality of
the surface water resources, and to a large extent also on the groundwater
resources, although agriculture may play also an important role, mainly in
terms of nitrate and ammonium pollution. Total pesticide concentrations in
surface waters were one order of magnitude higher than in groundwaters and
believed to originate mainly from soil and/or sediments desorption processes
and urban and industrial use, as they were mainly associated with treated
wastewaters. These findings are supported by the stable isotope results, that
pointed to an organic origin of nitrate in surface waters and most groundwater
samples. Ammonium pollution observed in some aquifer locations is probably
generated by nitrate reduction. Overall, no significant attenuation processes
could be inferred for nitrate pollution. The approach presented here
exemplifies the investigative monitoring envisioned in the Water Framework
Directive.
