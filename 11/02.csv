  Development: An Example Based on Minirhizotron Observations","18 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The characterisation of the spatial and temporal distribution of the root
system in a cultivated field depends on the soil volume occupied by the root
systems (the scatter), and the local intensity of the root colonisation in the
field (the intensity). We introduce a multivariate generalised linear mixed
model for simultaneously describing the scatter and the intensity using data
obtained with minirhizotrons (i.e., tubes with observation windows, which are
inserted in the soil, enabling to observe the roots directly). The models
presented allow studying intricate spatial and temporal dependence patterns
using a graphical model to represent the dependence structure of latent random
components.
  The scatter is described by a binomial mixed model (presence of roots in
observation windows). The number of roots crossing the reference lines in the
observational windows of the minirhizotron is used to estimate the intensity
through a specially defined Poisson mixed model. We explore the fact that it is
possible to construct multivariate extensions of generalised linear mixed
models that allow to simultaneously represent patterns of dependency of the
scatter and the intensity along with time and space.
  We present an example where the intensity and scatter are simultaneously
determined at three different time points. A positive association between the
intensity and scatter at each time point was found, suggesting that the plants
are not compensating a reduced occupation of the soil by increasing the number
of roots per volume of soil. Using the general properties of graphical models,
we identify a first-order Markovian dependence pattern between successively
observed scatters and intensities. This lack of memory indicates that no
long-lasting temporal causal effects are affecting the roots' development. The
two dependence patterns described above cannot be detected with univariate
models.

  First, given a non-degenerate minimal hypersurface with strictly stable and
strictly minimizing tangent cone at each singular point, under any small
perturbation of the metric, we show the existence of a nearby minimal
hypersurface under new metric. For a generic choice of perturbation direction,
we show the entire smoothness of the resulting minimal hypersurface.

uniquely homologically minimizing in its neighborhood.
  Lastly, given a family of stable minimal hypersurfaces multiplicity $1$
converges to a stable minimal hypersurface $\Sigma$ in an eight manifold, we

21-cm signal experiments, we present a methodology for generating basis
eigenvectors that combines analytical and observational models of both the
galactic spectral index and sky brightness temperature with simulations of
beams having various angular and spectral dependencies and pointings. Each
combination creates a unique beam-weighted foreground. By generating
eigenvectors to fit each foreground model using Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD), we examine the effects of varying the components of the beam-weighted
foreground. We find that the eigenvectors for modelling an achromatic,
isotropic beam -- the ideal case -- are nearly identical regardless of the
unweighted foreground model used, and are practicably indistinguishable from
polynomial-based models. When anisotropic, chromatic beams weight the
foreground, however, a coupling is introduced between the spatial and spectral
structure of the foreground which distorts the eigenvectors away from the
polynomial models and induces a dependence of the basis upon the exact features
of the beam (chromaticity, pattern, pointing) and foreground (spectral index,
sky brightness temperature map). We find that the beam has a greater impact
upon the eigenvectors than foreground models. Any model which does not account
for its distortion may produce RMS uncertainties on the order of $\sim 10$ -
$10^3$ Kelvin for six-parameter, single spectrum fits. If the beam is
incorporated directly using SVD and training sets, however, the resultant
eigenvectors yield milli-Kelvin level uncertainties. Given a sufficiently
detailed description of the sky, our methodology can be applied to any
particular experiment with a suitably characterized beam for the purpose of
generating accurate beam-weighted foreground models.

attention bias considering both query-level and item-level features. Due to the
item-specific attention bias modeling, the optimization for expected utility

We base the optimization of this objective in an efficient Lambdaloss

recognizing actions, or avoiding collisions. Training a neural network via
supervised learning for scene flow is impractical, as this requires manual
annotations for each 3D point at each new timestamp for each scene. To that
end, we seek for a self-supervised approach, where a network learns a latent
metric to distinguish between points translated by flow estimations and the
target point cloud. Our adversarial metric learning includes a multi-scale
triplet loss on sequences of two-point clouds as well as a cycle consistency
loss. Furthermore, we outline a benchmark for self-supervised scene flow

designed to study individual aspects of flow estimation in progressive order of

propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based trust-driven robot
navigation algorithm that learns humans' trustworthiness to perform a language
guided navigation task. Our approach seeks to answer the question as to whether
a robot can trust a human's navigational guidance or not. To this end, we look
at training a policy that learns to navigate towards a goal location using only
trustworthy human guidance, driven by its own robot trust metric. We look at
quantifying various affective features from language-based instructions and
incorporate them into our policy's observation space in the form of a human
trust metric. We utilize both these trust metrics into an optimal cognitive
reasoning scheme that decides when and when not to trust the given guidance.
Our results show that the learned policy can navigate the environment in an

performs the same task. We showcase the efficacy of our results both in

layered antiferromagnetic order was predicted to enable even-odd layer-number
dependent topological states, supported by promising edge transport
measurements. Furthermore, it becomes a Chern insulator when all spins are
aligned by an applied magnetic field. However, the evolution of the bulk
electronic structure as the magnetic state is continuously tuned and its
dependence on layer number remains unexplored. Here, employing multimodal
probes, we establish one-to-one correspondence between bulk electronic
structure, magnetic state, topological order, and layer thickness in atomically
thin MnBi2Te4 devices. As the magnetic state is tuned through the canted
magnetic phase, we observe a band crossing, i.e., the closing and reopening of
the bulk bandgap, corresponding to the concurrent topological phase transition.
Surprisingly, we find that the even- and odd-layer number devices exhibit a
similar topological phase transition coupled to magnetic states, distinct from
recent theoretical and experimental reports. Our findings shed new light on the
interplay between band topology and magnetic order in this newly discovered
topological magnet and validate the band crossing with concurrent measurements

of $x$ with radius $2R$, where $R$ (according to Delone's theory of the 'empty

free of points of $X$.
  The main result seems to be the first rigorously proved statement on
absolutely generic Delone sets which implies substantial statements for Delone
sets with strong crystallographic restrictions. For instance, an important
observation of Shtogrin on the boundedness of local groups in Delone sets with
equivalent $2R$-clusters immediately follows from the main theorem.

weaker versions (Conjectures 2 and 3) are suggested. According to Conjecture 1,
in a quite arbitrary Delone set, points with locally crystallographic axes (of

These conjectures significantly generalize the famous statement of

The most important missing element is the availability of a standardized

construct a standard test collection of Urdu documents for IR evaluation and
named it Collection for Urdu Retrieval Evaluation (CURE). We select 1,096
unique documents against 50 diverse queries from a large collection of 0.5
million crawled documents using two IR models. The purpose of test collection
is the evaluation of IR models, ranking algorithms, and different natural
language processing techniques. Next, we perform binary relevance judgment on
the selected documents. We also built two other language resources for
lemmatization and query expansion specific to our test collection. Evaluation
of test collection is carried out using four retrieval models as well using the
stop-words list, lemmatization, and query expansion. Furthermore, error

recognition. Recent works have shown that these 3D recognition networks are
also vulnerable to adversarial samples produced from various attack methods,
including optimization-based 3D Carlini-Wagner attack, gradient-based iterative
fast gradient method, and skeleton-detach based point-dropping. However, after
a careful analysis, these methods are either extremely slow because of the
optimization/iterative scheme, or not flexible to support targeted attack of a
specific category. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel
label guided adversarial network (LG-GAN) for real-time flexible targeted point
cloud attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation based
3D point cloud attack method. By feeding the original point clouds and target
attack label into LG-GAN, it can learn how to deform the point clouds to
mislead the recognition network into the specific label only with a single
forward pass. In detail, LGGAN first leverages one multi-branch adversarial
network to extract hierarchical features of the input point clouds, then
incorporates the specified label information into multiple intermediate
features using the label encoder. Finally, the encoded features will be fed
into the coordinate reconstruction decoder to generate the target adversarial
sample. By evaluating different point-cloud recognition models (e.g., PointNet,
PointNet++ and DGCNN), we demonstrate that the proposed LG-GAN can support
flexible targeted attack on the fly while guaranteeing good attack performance
and higher efficiency simultaneously.

deriving a fluid model that is well-posed and compatible with the second law of

covariance information in order to accelerate the convergence of Stochastic
Gradient Descent. In particular, starting with Adagrad, a seemingly endless
line of research advocates the use of diagonal approximations of the so-called
empirical Fisher matrix in stochastic gradient-based algorithms, with the most
prominent one arguably being Adam. However, in recent years, several works cast

inspiration from two-level domain decomposition methods used as preconditioners
in the field of scientific computing, we extend K-FAC by enriching it with
off-diagonal (i.e. global) curvature information in a computationally efficient
way. We achieve this by adding a coarse-space correction term to the
preconditioner, which captures the global Fisher information matrix at a
coarser scale. We present a small set of experimental results suggesting
improved convergence behaviour of our proposed method.

liquids is one of the central questions regarding the anomalous dynamics of
these fluids. The dominant explanation for this phenomenon has long been the
proposition that spatial averaging over a heterogeneous distribution of locally
exponential relaxation processes leads to stretching. Here we perform
simulations of model polymeric and small-molecule glass-formers in the
isoconfigurational ensemble to show that stretching instead emerges from a
combination of spatial averaging and locally nonexponential relaxation. Results
indicate that localities in the fluid exhibiting faster-than-average relaxation
tend to exhibit locally stretched relaxation, whereas slower-than-average
relaxing domains exhibit compressed exponential relaxation. We show that local
stretching is predicted by loose local caging, as measured by the Debye-Waller
factor, and vice versa. This phenomenology in the local relaxation of
in-equilibrium glasses parallels the dynamics of out of equilibrium under-dense
and over-dense glasses, which likewise exhibit an asymmetry in their degree of
stretching vs compression. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that
local stretching and compression in equilibrium glass-forming liquids results
from evolution of particle mobilities over a single local relaxation time, with
slower particles tending towards acceleration and vice versa. In addition to
providing new insight into the origins of stretched relaxation, these results
have implications for the interpretation of stretching exponents as measured
via metrologies such as dielectric spectroscopy: measured stretching exponents
cannot universally be interpreted as a direct measure of the breadth of an
underlying distribution of relaxation times.

various applications, but they require large amounts of memory and
computational power. This severely restricts their deployment on
resource-limited devices. To address this issue, many efforts have been made on
training low-bit weight DNNs. In this paper, we focus on training ternary
weight \{-1, 0, +1\} networks which can avoid multiplications and dramatically
reduce the memory and computation requirements. A ternary weight network can be
considered as a sparser version of the binary weight counterpart by replacing
some -1s or 1s in the binary weights with 0s, thus leading to more efficient
inference but more memory cost. However, the existing approaches to training
ternary weight networks cannot control the sparsity (i.e., percentage of 0s) of
the ternary weights, which undermines the advantage of ternary weights. In this
paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first sparsity-control approach
(SCA) to training ternary weight networks, which is simply achieved by a weight
discretization regularizer (WDR). SCA is different from all the existing
regularizer-based approaches in that it can control the sparsity of the ternary
weights through a controller $\alpha$ and does not rely on gradient estimators.
We theoretically and empirically show that the sparsity of the trained ternary
weights is positively related to $\alpha$. SCA is extremely simple,
easy-to-implement, and is shown to consistently outperform the state-of-the-art
approaches significantly over several benchmark datasets and even matches the
performances of the full-precision weight counterparts.

different survey methods. Each survey method gives rise to a type of data and,
in the last five decades, a large number of associated statistical models have
been developed for analysing these data. Although these models have been
parameterised and fitted using different approaches, they have all been
designed to model the pattern with which individuals enter and exit the
population and to estimate the population size. However, existing approaches
rely on a predefined model structure and complexity, either by assuming that
parameters are specific to sampling occasions, or by employing parametric
curves. Instead, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework for
modelling entry and exit patterns based on the Polya Tree (PT) prior for
densities. Our Bayesian non-parametric approach avoids overfitting when
inferring entry and exit patterns while simultaneously allowing more
flexibility than is possible using parametric curves. We apply our new
framework to capture-recapture, count and ring-recovery data and we introduce
the replicated PT prior for defining classes of models for these data.
Additionally, we define the Hierarchical Logistic PT prior for jointly
modelling related data and we consider the Optional PT prior for modelling long

performance. Nevertheless, the improved results are attained at the price of
bigger models, more power consumption, and slower inference, which hinder their
applicability to low-resource (both memory and computation) platforms.
Knowledge distillation (KD) has been demonstrated as an effective framework for
compressing such big models. However, large-scale neural network systems are
prone to memorize training instances, and thus tend to make inconsistent
predictions when the data distribution is altered slightly. Moreover, the
student model has few opportunities to request useful information from the
teacher model when there is limited task-specific data available. To address
these issues, we propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that
leverages mixup, a simple yet efficient data augmentation approach, to endow
the resulting model with stronger generalization ability. Concretely, in
addition to the original training examples, the student model is encouraged to
mimic the teacher's behavior on the linear interpolation of example pairs as
well. We prove from a theoretical perspective that under reasonable conditions
MixKD gives rise to a smaller gap between the generalization error and the
empirical error. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on the
GLUE benchmark, where MixKD consistently leads to significant gains over the
standard KD training, and outperforms several competitive baselines.
Experiments under a limited-data setting and ablation studies further
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

overcome this limitation by taking into account the well-known property of

structures in treebanks, i.e., the arcs of a dependency tree can be split into
two planes such that arcs in a given plane do not cross. We take advantage of
this property to design a method that balances the brackets and that encodes
the arcs belonging to each of those planes, allowing for almost unrestricted
non-projectivity (round 99.9% coverage) in sequence labeling parsing. The
experiments show that our linearizations improve over the accuracy of the
original bracketing encoding in highly non-projective treebanks (on average by
0.4 LAS), while achieving a similar speed. Also, they are especially suitable
when PoS tags are not used as input parameters to the models.

expected to contain a substantial amount of ices. The high ice content leads to
unique conditions in the interior, under which the structure of a planet is
affected by ice interaction with other metals. We apply experimental data of
ice-rock interaction at high pressure, and calculate detailed thermal evolution
for possible interior configurations of ice-rich planets, in the mass range of
super-Earth to Neptunes (5-15 Earth masses). We model the effect of migration
inward on the ice-rich interior by including the influences of stellar flux and
envelope mass loss. We find that ice and rock are expected to remain mixed, due
to miscibility at high pressure, in substantial parts of the planetary interior
for billions of years. We also find that the deep interior of planetary twins
that have migrated to different distances from the star are usually similar, if
no mass loss occurs. Significant mass loss results in separation of the water
from the rock on the surface and emergence of a volatile atmosphere of less
than 1 percent of the planet's mass. The mass of the atmosphere of water/steam
is limited by the ice-rock interaction. We conclude that when ice is abundant
in planetary interiors the planet structure may differ significantly from the
standard layered structure of a water shell on top of a rocky core. Similar
structure is expected in both close-in and further-out planets.

checking its reliance on sensitive features using ""Lime explanations"". If
deemed unfair, LimeOut then applies feature dropout to obtain a pool of
classifiers. These are then combined into an ensemble classifier that was
empirically shown to be less dependent on sensitive features without
compromising the classifier's accuracy. We present different experiments on

positrons in an ambient electron-proton plasma have revealed an acceleration of
positrons at the expense of electron kinetic energy. The dominant instability
within the jet was a filamentation instability between electrons, protons and
positrons. In this work we show that a filamentation instability, between an
initially unmagnetized ambient electron-proton plasma at rest and a beam of
pair plasma that moves through it at a non-relativistic speed, indeed results
in preferential positron acceleration. Filaments form that are filled
predominantly with particles with the same direction of their electric current
vector. Positron filaments are separated by electromagnetic fields from beam
electron filaments. Some particles can cross the field boundary and enter the
filament of the other species. Positron filaments can neutralize their net
charge by collecting the electrons of the ambient plasma while protons cannot
easily follow the beam electron filaments. Positron filaments can thus be
compressed to a higher density and temperature than the beam electron
filaments. Filament mergers, which take place after the exponential growth
phase of the instability has ended, lead to an expansion of the beam electron
filaments, which amplifies the magnetic field they generate and induces an
electric field in this filament. Beam electrons lose a substantial fraction of
their kinetic energy to the electric field. Some positrons in the beam electron
filament are accelerated by the induced electric field to almost twice their
initial speed. The simulations show that a weaker electric field is induced in
the positron filament and particles in this filament hardly change their speed.

establishing from first principles the hydrodynamic equations in large,
isolated, strongly interacting many-body systems. This involves understanding
relaxation at long times under reversible dynamics, determining the space of
emergent collective degrees of freedom (the ballistic waves), showing that
projection occurs onto them, and establishing their dynamics (the hydrodynamic
equations). We make progress in these directions, focussing for simplicity on
one-dimensional systems. Under a model-independent definition of the complete
space of extensive conserved charges, we show that hydrodynamic projection
occurs in Euler-scale two-point correlation functions. A fundamental ingredient
is a property of relaxation: we establish ergodicity of correlation functions
along almost every direction in space-time. We further show that to every
extensive conserved charge with a local density is associated a local current
and a continuity equation; and that Euler-scale two-point correlation functions
of local conserved densities satisfy a hydrodynamic equation. The results are
established rigorously within a general framework based on Hilbert spaces of
observables. These spaces occur naturally in the $C^*$ algebra description of
statistical mechanics by the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction. Using Araki's
exponential clustering and the Lieb-Robinson bound, we show that the results
hold, for instance, in every nonzero-temperature Gibbs state of short-range
quantum spin chains. Many techniques we introduce are generalisable to higher

ballistic waves at the Euler scale and how they propagate within homogeneous,
stationary states.

areas of physics and engineering, with the light's properties believed to be
successfully captured by classical electromagnetism in all relevant
experimental settings. The advent of interactions between light and free
quantum matter waves brought about fundamental questions regarding the role of
the particle wavefunction. Here we show that even in seemingly classical
experimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to quantum
properties of the emitting particles, such as their quantum coherence and
correlations. By employing quantum electrodynamics, we unveil the role of the
particle's coherent momentum uncertainty, without which decoherence of light
becomes dominant. As an example, we consider Cherenkov radiation, envisioned
for almost a century as a shockwave of light. We find instead that the
shockwave's duration is fundamentally bound from below by the particle's
coherent momentum uncertainty due to the underlying entanglement between the
particle and light. This quantum optical paradigm opens new capabilities in
analytical electron microscopy, enabling the measurement of quantum
correlations of shaped electron wavepackets. Our findings also have
applications for Cherenkov detectors in particle physics. For example, by
measuring spectral photon autocorrelations, one can unveil the particle's
wavefunction size, shape and coherence. Such schemes are especially intriguing
for many high-energy particles, where other techniques are not available.

structure learning of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A typical setting
is a causally sufficient setting, i.e. a system with no latent confounders,
selection bias, or feedback, when the essential graph of the observational
equivalence class (EC) is given as an input and interventions are assumed to be
noiseless. Most existing works focus on worst-case or average-case lower bounds
for the number of interventions required to orient a DAG. These worst-case
lower bounds only establish that the largest clique in the essential graph
could make it difficult to learn the true DAG. In this work, we develop a
universal lower bound for single-node interventions that establishes that the
largest clique is always a fundamental impediment to structure learning.
Specifically, we present a decomposition of a DAG into independently orientable
components through directed clique trees and use it to prove that the number of
single-node interventions necessary to orient any DAG in an EC is at least the
sum of half the size of the largest cliques in each chain component of the
essential graph. Moreover, we present a two-phase intervention design algorithm
that, under certain conditions on the chordal skeleton, matches the optimal
number of interventions up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number

objects, are combinatorially hard problems. Existing algorithms either do not
scale well or assume a great deal of prior knowledge about the environment, and
few offer any rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid
control architecture for achieving such tasks with mobile manipulators. On the
discrete side, we enrich a temporal logic specification with mobile
manipulation primitives such as moving to a point, and grasping or moving an
object. Such specifications are translated to an automaton representation,
which orchestrates the physical grounding of the task to mobility or
manipulation controllers. The grounding from the discrete to the continuous
reactive controller is online and can respond to the discovery of unknown
obstacles or decide to push out of the way movable objects that prohibit task
accomplishment. Despite the problem complexity, we prove that, under specific
conditions, our architecture enjoys provable completeness on the discrete side,
provable termination on the continuous side, and avoids all obstacles in the
environment. Simulations illustrate the efficiency of our architecture that can
handle tasks of increased complexity while also responding to unknown obstacles
or unanticipated adverse configurations.

and efficient integration of functions over polygons and two-dimensional
regions bounded by parametric curves. Over two-dimensional domains, the SBC
method reduces integration over a region bounded by $m$ curves to integration
over $m$ regions (referred to as curved triangular regions), where each region
is bounded by two line segments and a curve. With proper (counterclockwise)
orientation of the boundary curves, the scheme is applicable to convex and
nonconvex domains. Additionally, for star-convex domains, a tensor-product
cubature rule with positive weights and integration points in the interior of
the domain is obtained. If the integrand is homogeneous, we show that this new
method reduces to the homogeneous numerical integration scheme; however, the
SBC scheme is more versatile since it is equally applicable to both homogeneous
and non-homogeneous functions. This paper also introduces several methods for
smoothing integrands with point singularities and near-singularities. When
these methods are used, highly efficient integration of weakly singular
functions is realized. The SBC method is applied to a number of benchmark
problems, which reveal its broad applicability and superior performance (in
terms of time to generate a rule and accuracy per cubature point) when compared
to existing methods for integration.

simulation and real road test in autonomous driving. In this paper, we present
a Dynamic model-Residual correction model Framework (DRF) for vehicle dynamic
modeling. On top of any existing open-loop dynamic model, this framework builds
a Residual Correction Model (RCM) by integrating deep Neural Networks (NN) with
Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) model. RCM takes a sequence of
vehicle control commands and dynamic status for a certain time duration as
modeling inputs, extracts underlying context from this sequence with deep
encoder networks, and predicts open-loop dynamic model prediction errors. Five
vehicle dynamic models are derived from DRF via encoder variation. Our
contribution is consolidated by experiments on evaluation of absolute
trajectory error and similarity between DRF outputs and the ground truth.
Compared to classic rule-based and learning-based vehicle dynamic models, DRF
accomplishes as high as 74.12% to 85.02% of absolute trajectory error drop

Von-Neumann computing. Resistive RAM (RRAM) is one of the promising devices for
IMC applications (e.g. integer and Floating Point (FP) operations and random
logic implementation) due to low power consumption, fast operation, and small
footprint in crossbar architecture. In this paper, we propose FAME, a pipelined
FP arithmetic (adder/subtractor) using RRAM crossbar based IMC. A novel shift
circuitry is proposed to lower the shift overhead during FP operations. Since
96% of the RRAMs used in our architecture are in High Resistance State (HRS),
we propose two approaches namely Shift-At-The-Output (SATO) and Force To VDD
(FTV) (ground (FTG)) to mitigate Stuck-at-1 (SA1) failures. In both techniques,
the fault-free RRAMs are exploited to perform the computation by using an extra

faults whereas FTV can handle 99% of the faults in the RRAM-based compute array

consist of a 3-stage differential ring oscillator which is current starved with
the resistive sensor, a differential to single ended amplifier, an off-chip
counter and serial interface. The first design RDC included the basic structure
of time-based RDC and targeted low energy/conversion step. The second design
RDC aimed to improve the rms jitter/phase noise of the oscillator with help of
speed-up latches, to achieve higher bit-resolution as compared to the first
design RDC. The third design RDC reduced the power consumption by scaling the
technology with the improved phase-noise design, achieving 1-bit better
resolution as that of the second design RDC. Using a time-based implementation,
the RDCs exhibit energy-resolution scalablity, and consume 861nW with 18-bit

framework that takes LiDAR bird's-eye view, LiDAR range view and camera view
images as inputs for 3D object detection. To effectively fuse multi-view
features, we propose an attentive pointwise fusion (APF) module to estimate the
importance of the three sources with attention mechanisms that can achieve
adaptive fusion of multi-view features in a pointwise manner. Furthermore, an
attentive pointwise weighting (APW) module is designed to help the network
learn structure information and point feature importance with two extra tasks,
namely, foreground classification and center regression, and the predicted
foreground probability is used to reweight the point features. We design an
end-to-end learnable network named MVAF-Net to integrate these two components.
Our evaluations conducted on the KITTI 3D object detection datasets demonstrate
that the proposed APF and APW modules offer significant performance gains.
Moreover, the proposed MVAF-Net achieves the best performance among all

more massive and compact black hole. We show that after several reconnections
that produce ejections of smaller loops, the loop that remains bound to the
black hole moves on a nearly-periodic non-self-intersecting trajectory, ""the
orbit"". The orbit evolves due to an energy and angular momentum exchange
between the loop and the spinning black hole. We show that such evolution is
mathematically equivalent to a certain continuous deformation of an auxiliary
closed curve in a 3-dimensional space; for zero black-hole spin this
deformation is curve-shortening that has been extensively studied by
mathematicians. The evolution features competing effects of loop growth by the
superradiant extraction of the black-hole spin energy, and loop decay by the
friction of the moving string against the horizon. A self-intersection of an
auxiliary curve corresponds to a capture by the black hole of a new string
segment and thus an addition of a new captured loop. Possible asymptotic states
of such evolution are shown to be strong emitters of gravitational waves.
Whether reconnections prevent reaching the asymptotic states remains to be
explored. Additionally, the orbit's shape also evolves due to an emission of
gravitational waves, and a recoil of the black hole that changes the orbit and
likely leads to self-intersections.
  We argue that for a significant range of the dimensionless tension $\mu$,
string loops are captured by supermassive black holes at the centers of
galaxies. This strongly motivates further study of interaction between string
loops and black holes, especially the influence of this process on the black
hole spindown and on the production of gravitational waves by strings created
in galactic nuclei. We also discuss potential loop captures by primordial black
holes.

Originally conceived to help aerospace engineers plan tests to determine how

illustrate that the majority of tests should be performed at the lowest (unit
test) level, with fewer integration tests, and even fewer acceptance tests

the value of acceptance tests and integration tests increasingly depends on the

of galaxies is truly random. It is unclear whether is there any large-scale
symmetry-breaking in the distribution of the vorticity field in the universe.
Here, we present a formulation to evaluate the dipole component D_{max} of the
observed spin distribution, whose statistical significance sigma_{D} can be
calibrated by the expected amplitude for 3D random walk (random flight)
simulations.
  We apply this formulation to evaluate the dipole component in the
distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spirals. Shamir(2017a)
published a catalog of spiral galaxies from the SDSS DR8, classifying them with
his pattern recognition tool into clockwise and counterclockwise (Z-spiral and
S-spirals, respectively). He found significant photometric asymmetry in their
distribution. We have confirmed that this sample provides dipole asymmetry up
to a level of sigma_{D}=4.00.
  However, we also found that the catalog contains a significant number of
multiple entries of the same galaxies. After removing the duplicated entries,
the number of samples shrunk considerably to 45%. The actual dipole asymmetry
observed for the 'cleaned' catalog is quite modest, sigma_{D}=0.29. We conclude
that SDSS data alone does not support the presence of a large-scale
symmetry-breaking in the spin vector distribution of galaxies in the local
universe. The data are compatible with a random distribution.

Since $P_X$ contains the symmetric and dual symmetric inverse monoids on the

The new results are contrasted with known results concerning relation monoids,
and a number of interesting dualities arise, stemming from the traditional
philosophies of inverse semigroups as models of partial symmetries (Vagner and

also consider some related diagram monoids, including rook partition monoids,

control, as it enables high fidelity and robust force control, improving the
safety of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). Safety is an imperative
design criterion for pHRI that limits the interaction performance since there
exists a fundamental trade-off between stability robustness and rendering
performance. The safety of interaction necessitates the closed-loop stability
of a pHRI system when coupled to a wide range of unknown operators and
environments. In this study, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions
for two-port passivity of series damped elastic actuation under
velocity-sourced impedance control within the frequency-domain passivity
framework. Based on the newly established conditions, we derive
non-conservative passivity bounds for a virtual coupler and rigorously prove
the necessity of a dissipative element parallel to the series elastic component
and the necessity of a virtual coupler with dissipation for the absolute
stability and two-port passivity of the system. The additional dissipative
elements in the physical filter and the virtual coupler enable the system to
render virtual stiffness values higher than that can be rendered using a pure
SEA. Our results extend earlier studies on coupled stability by presenting the
necessary and sufficient conditions for all passive terminations. We validate
our results through a set of physical experiments and systematic numerical
simulations.

challenge is to augment existing strong neural VQA models with the mechanisms
that allow them to retain information from previous dialog turns. One strong
VQA model is the MAC network, which decomposes a task into a series of
attention-based reasoning steps. However, since the MAC network is designed for
single-turn question answering, it is not capable of referring to past dialog
turns. More specifically, it struggles with tasks that require reasoning over
the dialog history, particularly coreference resolution. We extend the MAC
network architecture with Context-aware Attention and Memory (CAM), which
attends over control states in past dialog turns to determine the necessary
reasoning operations for the current question. MAC nets with CAM achieve up to
98.25% accuracy on the CLEVR-Dialog dataset, beating the existing
state-of-the-art by 30% (absolute). Our error analysis indicates that with CAM,
the model's performance particularly improved on questions that required

and propagation of uncertainties that result from stochastic variations and a
lack of knowledge or data in the natural world. Monte Carlo (MC) method is a
sampling-based approach that has widely used for quantification and propagation
of uncertainties. However, the standard MC method is often time-consuming if
the simulation-based model is computationally intensive. This article gives an
overview of modern MC methods to address the existing challenges of the
standard MC in the context of UQ. Specifically, multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)
extending the concept of control variates achieves a significant reduction of
the computational cost by performing most evaluations with low accuracy and
corresponding low cost, and relatively few evaluations at high accuracy and
correspondingly high cost. Multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) accelerates the
convergence of standard Monte Carlo by generalizing the control variates with
different models having varying fidelities and varying computational costs.
Multimodel Monte Carlo method (MMMC), having a different setting of MLMC and
MFMC, aims to address the issue of uncertainty quantification and propagation
when data for characterizing probability distributions are limited. Multimodel
inference combined with importance sampling is proposed for quantifying and
efficiently propagating the uncertainties resulting from small datasets. All of
these three modern MC methods achieve a significant improvement of
computational efficiency for probabilistic UQ, particularly uncertainty
propagation. An algorithm summary and the corresponding code implementation are
provided for each of the modern Monte Carlo methods. The extension and
application of these methods are discussed in detail.

repair a connected network to make it biconnected as fast as possible, where a
biconnected network is a communication topology that cannot be disconnected by
removing one node. We develop a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP)

on graph theory. By conducting empirical studies, we demonstrate that our

with that, a data-driven framework is developed. By modeling the wind
curtailment as a cap enforced on the wind power output, the proposed framework
constructs a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate to describe the relationship
between wind curtailment and the chance constraints. This allows us to
reformulate the CCO with wind curtailment as a mixed-integer second-order cone

solving a convex linear programming (LP) to improve the modeling accuracy. Case

escalation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As lockdowns
were implemented, the significant changes caused by these restrictions brought
a dramatic improvement in air quality in metropolitan cities such as Los
Angeles (LA Basin).Methods: We use real-time data from The South Coast Air
Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the California Department
of Transportation to evaluate the drivers of the pollution sources. We also
mapped monthly spatial variations and constructed hourly heatmaps of those
pollutants in 2020 to understand the impacts of the lockdown on different
locations and times of day in the LA Basin. Results: Compared to the same dates
in 2019, traffic flow on highways in the Los Angeles Basin dropped by 20.86 %
when the stay at home order was initiated and it continued to decrease along
with dramatic declines in NO2, CO, and PM2.5. The correlation (Pierson r)
between truck flow change and changes of NO2, CO, and PM2.5 is statistically
significant. Conclusion: The declines in truck flow are mainly responsible for
the drop of NO2 and CO, with traffic having a slightly smaller effect on PM2.5.
The lockdowns provided a large-scale experiment into air quality research. The
result of this research would provide an important reference for the policy
markers regarding truck management in light of air quality control to prepare

\textbf{cds}, performs certain types of block interchanges on permutations.
When a permutation is sortable by \textbf{cds}, then \textbf{cds} sorts it
using the fewest possible block interchanges of any kind. This work introduces
a classification of permutations based on their number of \textbf{cds}-eligible
contexts. In prior work an object called the strategic pile of a permutation
was discovered and shown to provide an efficient measure of the
non-\textbf{cds}-sortability of a permutation. Focusing on the classification
of permutations with maximal strategic pile, a complete characterization is
given when the number of \textbf{cds}-eligible contexts is close to maximal as
well as when the number of eligible contexts is minimal. A group action that
preserves the number of \textbf{cds}-eligible contexts of a permutation
provides, via the orbit-stabilizer theorem, enumerative results regarding the
number of permutations with maximal strategic pile and a given number of
\textbf{cds}-eligible contexts. Prior work introduced a natural two-person game
on permutations that are not \textbf{cds}-sortable. The decision problem of
which player has a winning strategy in a particular instance of the game
appears to be of high computational complexity. Extending prior results, this
work presents new conditions for player ONE to have a winning strategy in this
combinatorial game.

plus onsite Coulomb correlation (U), i.e., the GGA+U method. Interestingly, we
find that the magnetic SHG, LEO and photocurrent in the AF BL CrI$_3$ are huge,
being comparable or even larger than that of the well-known nonmagnetic
noncentrosymmetric semiconductors. For example, the calculated SHG coefficients
are in the same order of magnitude as that of MoS$_2$ monolayer (ML), the most
promising 2D material for NLO devices. The calculated LEO coefficients are
almost three times larger than that of MoS$_2$ ML. The calculated NLO
photocurrent in the CrI$_3$ BL is among the largest values predicted so far for
the BPVE materials. On the other hand, unlike nonmagnetic semiconductors, the
NLO responses in the AF BL CrI$_3$ are nonreciprocal and also switchable by
rotating magnetization direction. Therefore, our interesting findings indicate
that the AF BL CrI$_3$ will not only provide a valuable platform for exploring
new physics of low-dimensional magnetism but also have promising applications

formation mechanism for coronal rain along magnetically open field lines due to

chromospheric and transition region temperatures originating from the coronal
condensations facilitated by reconnection between open and closed coronal
loops. For this, we employ the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
Around 2013 October 19, a coronal rain along curved paths was recorded by IRIS
over the southeastern solar limb. Related to this, we found reconnection
between a system of higher-lying open features and lower-lying closed loops
that occurs repeatedly in AIA images. In this process, the higher-lying
features form magnetic dips. In response, two sets of newly reconnected loops
appear and retract away from the reconnection region. In the dips, seven events
of cooling and condensation of coronal plasma repeatedly occur due to thermal
instability over several days, from October 18 to 20. The condensations flow
downward to the surface as coronal rain, with a mean interval between
condensations of 6.6 hr. In the cases where IRIS data were available we found
the condensations to cool all the way down to chromospheric temperatures. Based
on our observations we suggest that some of the coronal rain events observed at
chromospheric temperatures could be explained by the new and alternative
scenario for the formation of coronal rain, where the condensation is
facilitated by interchange reconnection.

standard deviation of the spins, while PBHs of $M\ll M_{H}$ formed through
near-critical collapse may have larger spins than those of $M\simeq M_{H}$. In
comparison to the previous estimate, the new estimate has the explicit

Several end-effector designs for robust manipulation have been proposed but
they mostly work when provided with prior information about the objects or
equipped with external sensors for estimating object shape or size. Such
approaches are limited to many-shot or unknown objects and are prone to
estimation errors from external estimation systems. We propose an approach to
grasp and manipulate previously unseen or zero-shot objects: the objects
without any prior of their shape, size, material and weight properties, using
only feedback from tactile sensors which is contrary to the state-of-the-art.
Such an approach provides robust manipulation of objects either when the object
model is not known or when it is estimated incorrectly from an external system.
Our approach is inspired by the ideology of how animals or humans manipulate
objects, i.e., by using feedback from their skin. Our grasping and manipulation
revolves around the simple notion that objects slip if not grasped stably. This
slippage can be detected and counteracted for a robust grasp that is agnostic
to the type, shape, size, material and weight of the object. At the crux of our
approach is a novel tactile feedback based controller that detects and
compensates for slip during grasp. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our
proposed approach on many real world experiments using the Shadow Dexterous

measurements of 7 strong lensing systems and 120 intermediate-luminosity
quasars calibrated as standard rulers, we obtain stringent constraints on the
Hubble constant ($H_0=78.3\pm2.9 \mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$) and the cosmic
curvature ($\Omega_K=0.49\pm0.24$). On the one hand, in the framework of a flat
universe, the measured Hubble constant ($H_0=73.6^{+1.8}_{-1.6}
\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$) is strongly consistent with that derived from
the local distance ladder, with a precision of 2\%. On the other hand, if we
use the local $H_0$ measurement as a prior, our results are marginally
compatible with zero spatial curvature ($\Omega_K=0.23^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$) and
there is no significant deviation from a flat universe. Finally, we also
evaluate whether strongly lensed quasars would produce robust constraints on

processes is thereby neglected, and is instead assumed to sum to an incoherent

free-electron wave-shaping can be used to engineer quantum interferences that
alter the results of scattering processes in QED. Specifically, the
interference of two or more pathways in a QED process (such as photon emission)
enables precise control over the rate of that process. As an example, we apply
our concept to Bremsstrahlung, a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs, for
instance, in X-ray sources for state-of-the-art medical imaging, security
scanning, materials analysis, and astrophysics. We show that free electron
wave-shaping can be used to tailor both the spatial and the spectral
distribution of emitted photons, enhancing their directionality and
monochromaticity, and adding more degrees of freedom that make emission
processes like Bremsstrahlung more versatile. The ability to tailor the
spatiotemporal attributes of photon emission via quantum interference provides
a new degree of freedom in shaping radiation across the entire electromagnetic
spectrum. More broadly, the ability to tailor general QED processes through the
shaping of free electrons opens up new avenues of control in processes ranging
from optical excitation processes (e.g., plasmon and phonon emission) in

techniques such as spin reversal (SR), anneal offsets (AO), or chain weights

optimizations over a large number of parameters, which would be too costly if
needed to be done for each new problem instance. In this work, we show that the
aforementioned parameter optimization can be done for an entire class of
problems, given each instance uses a previously chosen fixed embedding.
Specifically, in the training phase, we fix an embedding E of a complete graph
onto the hardware of the annealer, and then run an optimization algorithm to
tune the following set of parameter values: the set of bits to be flipped for
SR, the specific qubit offsets for AO, and the distribution of chain weights,
optimized over a set of training graphs randomly chosen from that class, where
the graphs are embedded onto the hardware using E. In the testing phase, we
estimate how well the parameters computed during the training phase work on a

practical importance for photoinjector applications, closely follow the 1/3
gradient Dowell-Schmerge (DS) law describing the spectral dependence of the
mean transverse energy ($MTE$), $viz.$ $MTE$ as a function of the incident
laser photon energy. However, some (rare) semiconductor photocathodes show
$MTE$ trends that are significantly different. For example, spectral $MTE$
measurements on PbTe, BaLaSnO or Hf/HfO$_2$ have clearly demonstrated trends
that can differ from DS law being non-monotonic, slower growing, or displaying
constant $MTE$ versus laser photon energy. We have discovered that $n$-type
ultra-nano-crystalline diamond (UNCD) and single crystal diamond are anti-DS
photocathodes in that their $MTE$ decreases with the incident photon energy. It
was previously established that UNCD is a highly emissive material in the near

unique and novel combination of high increasing $QE$ and low decreasing $MTE$
of UNCD may pave the way to desired high brightness electron beams, through
operation well above its work function which fundamentally differs from
'Boltzmann tail' operation near the photoemission threshold. One other
remarkable result followed: As UNCD is a $sp^2$ grain boundary diluted $sp^3$
diamond matrix, control over grain boundary/grain engineering in the material's

B-mode images using the X6-1 connected to an EPIQ7 system. Operators were then
asked to maintain the transducer position for 4 minutes under three feedback

The magnitude of displacement over the cine was computed as an estimate of the

blazars. However, the central engines in these two types of AGN are thought to
operate in different regimes of accretion rate. Our INOV search in a fairly
large and unbiased sample of 15 $\gamma$-ray NLSy1s was conducted in 36
monitoring sessions, each lasting $\geq$ 3 hrs. In our analysis, special care
has been taken to address the possible effect on the differential light curves,
of any variation in the seeing disc during the session, since that might lead
to spurious claims of INOV from such AGN due to the possibility of a
significant contribution from the host galaxy to the total optical emission.
From our observations, a duty cycle (DC) of INOV detection in the $\gamma$-ray
NLSy1s is estimated to be around 25% - 30%, which is comparable to that known
for blazars. This estimate of DC will probably need an upward revision, once it
becomes possible to correct for the dilution of the AGN's nonthermal optical
emission by the (much steadier) optical emission contributed not only by the
host galaxy but also the nuclear accretion disc in these high Eddington rate
accretors. Finally, we also draw attention to the possibility that sharp
optical flux changes on sub-hour time scale are less rare for $\gamma$-ray
NLSy1s, in comparison to blazars.

remarkable feature of these solid solutions is the \emph{morphotropic phase

Critically, it has long been observed that the dielectric and piezoelectric as
well as the ability to pole a ceramic increases dramatically at the MPB. While
this has motivated much study of perovskite MPBs, a number of important
questions about the role of disorder remain unanswered. We address these
questions using a new approach based on the random-field Ising model with
long-range interactions that incorporates the basic elements of the physics at
the meso-scale. We show that the MPB emerges naturally in this approach as a
frustrated state where stability is exchanged between two well-defined phases.
Specifically, long-range interactions suppress the disorder at compositions
away from MPB but are unable to do so when there is an exchange of stability.
Further, the approach also predicts a number of experimentally observed
features like the fragmented domain patterns and superior ability to pole at
the MPB. The insights from this model also suggest the possibility of entirely

inequalities involving some PL-invariants which state that for any PL-manifold
$M$ with non spherical boundary components, the regular genus $\mathcal{G}(M)$
of $M$ is at least the weighted regular genus $\tilde{G}(M)$ of $M$ which is
again at least the generalized regular genus $\bar{G}(M)$ of $M$. Another
inequality states that the weighted G-degree $\tilde{D}_G (M)$ of $M$ is always
greater than or equal to the G-degree $D_G (M)$ of $M$. Let $M$ be any compact
connected PL $4$-manifold with $h$ number of non spherical boundary components.
Then we compute the following: $$\tilde{G} (M) \geq 2 \chi(M)+3m+2h-4+2 \hat{m}
\mbox{ and } \tilde{D}_G (M) \geq 12(2 \chi(M)+3m+2h-4+2 \hat{m}),$$ where $m$

corresponding singular manifold $\widehat{M}$ (obtained by coning off the
boundary components of $M$) respectively. As a
  consequence we prove that the regular genus $\mathcal{G}(M)$ satisfies the
following inequality:
  $$\mathcal{G} (M) \geq 2 \chi(M)+3m+2h-4+2 \hat{m},$$

weak semi-simple gems, and prove that the lower bounds for the weighted

Existing AL heuristics are generally designed on the principle of selecting
uncertain yet representative training instances, where annotating these

across six typologically diverse languages (German, Swedish, Galician, North
Sami, Persian, and Ukrainian), we found the surprising result that even in an

current heuristics are far from optimal. Based on this analysis, we pose the
problem of AL as selecting instances which maximally reduce the confusion

aforementioned languages shows that our proposed AL strategy outperforms other
AL strategies by a significant margin. We also present auxiliary results
demonstrating the importance of proper calibration of models, which we ensure
through cross-view training, and analysis demonstrating how our proposed
strategy selects examples that more closely follow the oracle data

fine-tuning, the back-propagation is conducted on the DFV data flow to update
the network parameters. The experiments on various datasets and network

polymer composites. To capture microscopic matrix cracking and fibre-matrix
debonding, the framework couples the phase field fracture method and a cohesive
zone model in the context of the finite element method. Virtual single-notched
three point bending tests are conducted. The actual microstructure of the
composite is simulated by an embedded cell in the fracture process zone, while
the remaining area is homogenised to be an anisotropic elastic solid. A
detailed comparison of the predicted results with experimental observations
reveals that it is possible to accurately capture the crack path, interface
debonding and load versus displacement response. The sensitivity of the crack
growth resistance curve (R-curve) to the matrix fracture toughness and the
fibre-matrix interface properties is determined. The influence of porosity upon
the R-curve of fibre-reinforced composites is also explored, revealing a
stabler response with increasing void volume fraction. These results shed light
into microscopic fracture mechanisms and set the basis for efficient design of
high fracture toughness composites.

encoding lattices as opposed to 1-best results generated by automatic speech

Recently, pretrained language models with the transformer architecture have
achieved the state-of-the-art results on natural language understanding, but
their ability of encoding lattices has not been explored. Therefore, this paper
aims at adapting pretrained transformers to lattice inputs in order to perform
understanding tasks specifically for spoken language. Our experiments on the
benchmark ATIS dataset show that fine-tuning pretrained transformers with
lattice inputs yields clear improvement over fine-tuning with 1-best results.

specifying the actor and its performing action with a textual query. Previous
methods fail to explicitly align the video content with the textual query in a
fine-grained manner according to the actor and its action, due to the problem
of \emph{semantic asymmetry}. The \emph{semantic asymmetry} implies that two
modalities contain different amounts of semantic information during the
multi-modal fusion process. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel actor
and action modular network that individually localizes the actor and its action
in two separate modules. Specifically, we first learn the actor-/action-related
content from the video and textual query, and then match them in a symmetrical
manner to localize the target tube. The target tube contains the desired actor
and action which is then fed into a fully convolutional network to predict
segmentation masks of the actor. Our method also establishes the association of
objects cross multiple frames with the proposed temporal proposal aggregation
mechanism. This enables our method to segment the video effectively and keep
the temporal consistency of predictions. The whole model is allowed for joint
learning of the actor-action matching and segmentation, as well as achieves the

in studies of covariance matrices in multivariate statistics, where it is
referred to as Pillai's $V$ statistic. In this context, Davis showed that for

characterised by $(N+1) \times (N+1)$ matrix differential equations. For the
Fourier-Laplace transform, this leads to a vector recurrence for the moments.
However, for the distribution itself the characterisation provided was
incomplete, as the connection problem of determining the linear combination of
Frobenius type solutions that correspond to the statistic was not solved. We

topological essence of CNN filters. Our theory first abstracts a topological
representation of how the features locate for a CNN filter, named feature
topology, and characterises it by defining the starting edge density. We reveal
a principle of CNN filters: tending to organize the feature topologies for the
same category, and thus propose the SED Distribution to statistically describe
such an organization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN filters reflects
in the compactness of SED Distribution, and introduce filter entropy to measure
it. Remarkably, the variation of filter entropy during training reveals the
essence of CNN training: a filter-entropy-decrease process. Also, based on the
principle, we give a metric to assess the filter performance. The second one
investigates the inter-class distinguishability in a model-agnostic way. For
each class, we propose the MBC Distribution, a distribution that could
differentiate categories by characterising the intrinsic organization of the
given category. As for multi-classes, we introduce the category distance which
metricizes the distance between two categories, and moreover propose the CD
Matrix that comprehensively evaluates not just the distinguishability between
each two category pair but the distinguishable degree for each category.

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had already resulted in more
than thirty-two million cases infected and more than one million deaths
worldwide.
  Given the fact that the pandemic is still threatening health and safety, it
is in the urgency to understand the COVID-19 contagion process and know how it
might be controlled. With this motivation in mind, in this paper, we consider a
version of a stochastic discrete-time
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death~(SIRD)-based epidemiological model with
two uncertainties: The uncertain rate of infected cases which are undetected or
asymptomatic, and the uncertain effectiveness rate of control. Our aim is to
study the effect of an epidemic control policy on the uncertain model in a
control-theoretic framework. We begin by providing the closed-form solutions of
states in the modified SIRD-based model such as infected cases, susceptible
cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases. Then, the corresponding expected
states and the technical lower and upper bounds for those states are provided
as well. Subsequently, we consider two epidemic control problems to be
addressed: One is almost sure epidemic control problem and the other average
epidemic control problem. Having defined the two problems, our main results are
a set of sufficient conditions on a class of linear control policy which
assures that the epidemic is ""well-controlled""; i.e., both of the infected
cases and deceased cases are upper bounded uniformly and the number of infected
cases converges to zero asymptotically. Our numerical studies, using the
historical COVID-19 contagion data in the United States, suggest that our
appealingly simple model and control framework can provide a reasonable
epidemic control performance compared to the ongoing pandemic situation.

given query instance. For evaluating such predictions, the set of predicted
labels needs to be compared to the ground-truth label set associated with that
instance, and various loss functions have been proposed for this purpose. In
addition to assessing predictive accuracy, a key concern in this regard is to
foster and to analyze a learner's ability to capture label dependencies. In
this paper, we introduce a new class of loss functions for multi-label
classification, which overcome disadvantages of commonly used losses such as
Hamming and subset 0/1. To this end, we leverage the mathematical framework of
non-additive measures and integrals. Roughly speaking, a non-additive measure
allows for modeling the importance of correct predictions of label subsets
(instead of single labels), and thereby their impact on the overall evaluation,
in a flexible way - by giving full importance to single labels and the entire
label set, respectively, Hamming and subset 0/1 are rather extreme in this
regard. We present concrete instantiations of this class, which comprise
Hamming and subset 0/1 as special cases, and which appear to be especially
appealing from a modeling perspective. The assessment of multi-label
classifiers in terms of these losses is illustrated in an empirical study.

expressed brush border regions from histological images of human duodenum. Our
contribution is three-fold: (1) we approach the weakly supervised segmentation

diffuse image patterns rather than focal objects; and (3) the proposed

directly driven component, or dayside reconnection, and an unloading component,
associated with the release of magnetic energy via nightside reconnection. The
two processes are poorly correlated on short time scales, but exactly equal
when averaged over long time windows. Because of this peculiar property,
regression models of ionospheric electrodynamics that are based on solar wind
data are time scale specific: Models derived from 1 min resolution data will be
different from models derived from hourly, daily, or monthly data. We explain
and quantify this effect on simple linear regression models of various
geomagnetic indices. We also derive a time scale-dependent correction factor
that can be used with the Average Magnetic field and Polar current System
model. Finally, we show how absolute estimates of the nightside reconnection
rate can be calculated from solar wind measurements and geomagnetic indices.

especially when interacting with deformable soft tissues. The main difficulty
is to generate model-based control methods that account for deformation
dynamics during tissue manipulation. Previous works in vision-based perception
can capture the geometric changes within the scene, however, model-based
controllers integrated with dynamic properties, a more accurate and safe
approach, has not been studied before. Considering the mechanic coupling
between the robot and the environment, it is crucial to develop a registered,
simulated dynamical model. In this work, we propose an online, continuous,
real-to-sim registration method to bridge 3D visual perception with
position-based dynamics (PBD) modeling of tissues. The PBD method is employed
to simulate soft tissue dynamics as well as rigid tool interactions for
model-based control. Meanwhile, a vision-based strategy is used to generate 3D
reconstructed point cloud surfaces based on real-world manipulation, so as to
register and update the simulation. To verify this real-to-sim approach, tissue
experiments have been conducted on the da Vinci Research Kit. Our real-to-sim
approach successfully reduces registration error online, which is especially
important for safety during autonomous control. Moreover, it achieves higher
accuracy in occluded areas than fusion-based reconstruction.

leverage the hierarchical structure of the paper reviews with three levels of

inter-review encoder (level three). Each encoder first derives contextual
representation of each level, then generates a higher-level representation, and
after the learning process, we are able to identify useful predictors to make
the final acceptance decision, as well as to help discover the inconsistency
between numerical review ratings and text sentiment conveyed by reviewers.
Furthermore, we introduce two new metrics to evaluate models in data imbalance

proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.

initially prepared in a nonequilibrium sheared state. Two classes of Mpemba
effect are identified, the normal and the anomalous one. The former is generic,
in the sense that the kinetic temperature starting from a cold nonequilibrium

in a faster initial cooling. The anomalous Mpemba effect is opposite to the
normal one since, despite the initial slower cooling of the nonequilibrium
sheared state, it can eventually overtake an initially colder quasi-equilibrium
state. The theoretical results based on kinetic theory agree with those
obtained from event-driven simulations for inelastic hard spheres. It is also
confirmed the existence of the inverse Mpemba effect, which is a peculiar

Toutant (J. Comput. Phys., 374:822-842 (2018)) for incompressible flow
simulation. It circumvents the Poisson equation for the pressure and performs
better than the classical artificial compressibility method. Here it is
generalized for two-phase incompressible viscous flows with variable density
and viscosity. First, the pressure evolution equation is modified to account
for the density variation. Second, customized discretizations are proposed to
deal with the viscous stress terms with variable viscosity. Besides, additional
terms related to the bulk viscosity are included to stabilize the simulation.
The interface evolution and surface tension effects are handled by a
phase-field model coupled with the GPE-based flow equations. The pressure and
momentum equations are discretized on a stagger grid using the second order
centered scheme and marched in time using the third order total variation
diminishing Runge-Kutta scheme. Several unsteady two-phase problems in two
dimensional, axisymmetric and three dimensional geometries at intermediate
density and viscosity ratios were simulated and the results agreed well with
those obtained by other incompressible solvers and/or the lattice-Boltzmann
method (LBM) simulations. Similar to the LBM, the proposed GPE-based method is
fully explicit and easy to be parallelized. Although slower than the LBM, it
requires much less memory than the LBM. Thus, it can be a good alternative to

  Minimization",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many fundamental combinatorial optimization problems, a feasible solution
induces some real cost vectors as an intermediate result, and the optimization
objective is a certain function of the vectors. For example, in the problem of
makespan minimization on unrelated parallel machines, a feasible job assignment
induces a vector containing the sizes of assigned jobs for each machine, and
the goal is to minimize the $L_\infty$ norm of $L_1$ norms of the vectors.
Another example is fault-tolerant $k$-center, where each client is connected to
multiple open facilities, thus having a vector of distances to these
facilities, and the goal is to minimize the $L_\infty$ norm of $L_\infty$ norms
of these vectors. In this paper, we study the maximum of norm problem. Given an
arbitrary symmetric monotone norm $f$, the objective is defined as the maximum
($L_\infty$ norm) of $f$-norm values of the induced cost vectors. This
versatile formulation captures a wide variety of problems, including makespan
minimization, fault-tolerant $k$-center and many others. We give concrete
results for load balancing on unrelated parallel machines and clustering
problems, including constant-factor approximation algorithms when $f$ belongs
with a certain rich family of norms, and $O(\log n)$-approximations when $f$ is
general and satisfies some mild assumptions. We also consider the
aforementioned problems in a generalized fairness setting. As a concrete
example, the insight is to prevent a scheduling algorithm from assigning too
many jobs consistently on any machine in a job-recurring scenario, and causing
the machine's controller to fail. Our algorithm needs to stochastically output
a feasible solution minimizing the objective function, and satisfy the given
marginal fairness constraints.

such 2D schemes are very time-consuming due to the moment integrals (triple
integrals) so that they are no longer practical. In view of this, the
simplified BGK (sBGK) schemes are presented by removing some terms in the
approximate nonequilibrium distribution at the cell interface for the BGK
scheme without loss of accuracy. They are practical because the moment
integrals of the approximate distribution can be reduced to the single
integrals by some coordinate transformations. The relations between the left
and right states of the shock wave, rarefaction wave, and contact discontinuity
are also discussed, so that the exact solution of the 1D Riemann problem could
be derived and used for the numerical comparisons. Several numerical
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed gas-kinetic schemes
are accurate and stable. A comparison of the sBGK schemes with the BGK scheme
in one dimension shows that the former performs almost the same as the latter
in terms of the accuracy and resolution, but is much more efficiency.

services, increasing ride-pooling is an important means to address these
concerns. Shareability depends not only on riders attitudes and preferences but
also on operating models deployed by providers. The paper introduces an advance
requests operating model for ride pooling where users may request rides at
least H minutes in advance of their desired departure times. A platform with
efficient algorithms for request matching, vehicle routing, rebalancing, and
flexible user preferences is developed. A large-scale transportation network

system relative to current practices. The impacts of various design aspects of
the system (advance requests horizon, vehicle capacity) on its performance are
investigated. The sensitivity of the results to user preferences in terms of
the level of service (time to be served and excess trip time), willingness to
share and place requests in advance, and traffic conditions are explored. The
results suggest that significant benefits in terms of sustainability, level of
service, and fleet utilization can be realized when advance requests are along

paper proposes a new remote array diagnosis technique that relaxes the need for
full CSI and only requires knowledge of the incident angle-of-arrivals, i.e.
partial channel knowledge. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed technique and show that fault detection can be obtained with

Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However the AIS scale cannot currently be

above which a serious or fatal injury occurs. In order to overcome these
limitations, a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able to calculate the threat to
life of any organ injury is proposed. The focus, in this case is on real world
pedestrian brain injuries. The OTM uses a power method, named Peak Virtual
Power (PVP), and defines brain white and grey matters trauma responses as a
function of impact location and impact speed extracted from the pedestrian
collision kinematics. This research has included ageing in the injury severity
computation by including soft tissue material degradation, as well as brain
volume changes. Further, to account for the limitations of the Lagrangian
formulation of the brain model in representing haemorrhage, an approach to
include the effects of subdural hematoma is proposed and included as part of
the OTM predictions in this study. The OTM model was tested against three
real-life pedestrian accidents and has proven to reasonably predict the Post

severity than standard MPS methods currently recommended. This study suggests
that the OTM has the potential to improve forensic predictions as well as
contribute to the improvement in vehicle safety design through the ability to
measure injury severity. This study concludes that future advances in trauma

a version of Conditional Generalized Adversarial Network (CGAN) can be used. It
has been observed by others that CGAN can help to improve the results even for
deterministic sequences, where only one output is associated with the
processing of a given input. Surprisingly, our CGAN-based tests on
deterministic geophysical processing sequences did not produce a real
improvement compared to the use of an $L_p$ loss; we here propose a first
theoretical explanation why. Our analysis goes from the non-deterministic case
to the deterministic one. It led us to develop an adversarial way to train a

number of sensors to facilitate meticulous monitoring and functioning. These
requirements could potentially lead to inefficient system designs. The data
coming from various sensors are often correlated due to the underlying
relations in the system parameters that the sensors monitor. In theory, it
should be possible to emulate the output of certain sensors based on other
sensors. Tapping into such possibilities holds tremendous advantages in terms
of reducing system design complexity. In order to identify the subset of
sensors whose readings can be emulated, the sensors must be grouped into
clusters. Complex systems generally have a large quantity of sensors that
collect and store data over prolonged periods of time. This leads to the
accumulation of massive amounts of data. In this paper we propose an end-to-end
algorithmic solution, to realise virtual sensors in such systems. This
algorithm splits the dataset into blocks and clusters each of them
individually. It then fuses these clustering solutions to obtain a global
solution using an Ant Colony inspired technique, FAC2T. Having grouped the
sensors into clusters, we select representative sensors from each cluster.
These sensors are retained in the system while the other sensors readings are
emulated by applying supervised learning algorithms.

  Minisymposium Mathematics and Arts at the annual meeting of the German
  Mathematical Society",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mondrian was one of the most significant painters of the 20th century. He was
a prominent member of DeStijl, the movement which revolutionized art by setting
it free of the obligation to make images of existing objects, persons, or
situations. DeStijl was one of the interrelated movements in early 20th century
Europe including Cubism, Constructivism, the Futurists, and Dada. Their
disruptive ideas changed the meaning of Western art. It was Mondrian, more than
anyone else, who worked restlessly to find expression for the purest possible
kind of beauty and truth, based on a theory called Neoplasticism. He was
already famous during his lifetime and still now, his name is almost synonym
for modern art. We analyze the structure of the system of black lines in his
paintings and put the hypothesis to the test that the paintings could be
obtained by recursive (binary) splitting. We used a novel tailor-made
interactive analysis tool and apply it to as many Mondrian paintings as
possible (in total 147). The results will be explained in a visual manner, but
we also present statistical findings from the analysis of the 147 paintings.
Our main conclusion is that the hypothesis of splitting decomposition is in
general not true. It is possible to make Mondrian-like compositions by
splitting, yet one misses out on a great deal of Neoplastic beauty if one would
work by splitting only. It is possible to consider all crossings as pairs of
Tees, but that is clumsy, and it leaves out essential information. Moreover
there are other important design decisions of Mondrian, such as the
keeping-distance to the canvas-edge which are not well-described by splitting.

state-of-the-art 2D generative models like GANs show unprecedented quality in
modeling the natural image manifold, it is unclear whether they implicitly
capture the underlying 3D object structures. And if so, how could we exploit
such knowledge to recover the 3D shapes of objects in the images? To answer
these questions, in this work, we present the first attempt to directly mine 3D
geometric cues from an off-the-shelf 2D GAN that is trained on RGB images only.
Through our investigation, we found that such a pre-trained GAN indeed contains
rich 3D knowledge and thus can be used to recover 3D shape from a single 2D
image in an unsupervised manner. The core of our framework is an iterative
strategy that explores and exploits diverse viewpoint and lighting variations
in the GAN image manifold. The framework does not require 2D keypoint or 3D
annotations, or strong assumptions on object shapes (e.g. shapes are
symmetric), yet it successfully recovers 3D shapes with high precision for
human faces, cats, cars, and buildings. The recovered 3D shapes immediately
allow high-quality image editing like relighting and object rotation. We
quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to
previous methods in both 3D shape reconstruction and face rotation. Our code is

are often partitioned into multiple iterative sub-tasks. This puts huge
pressure on the available system resources such as interconnect and memory
bandwidth. The optimal partitioning of the feature maps for these sub-tasks can
reduce the bandwidth requirement substantially. Some accelerators avoid

power in such architectures. In this paper, we propose a first order analytical
method to partition the feature maps for optimal bandwidth and evaluate the

designing an active memory controller which can perform basic arithmetic

recognise human activities. Recently, federated learning systems that use edge

a new paradigm to combine local (individual-level) and global (group-level)
models. This approach provides better scalability and generalisability and also
offers better privacy compared with the traditional centralised analysis and
learning models. The assumption behind federated learning, however, relies on
supervised learning on clients. This requires a large volume of labelled data,
which is difficult to collect in uncontrolled IoT environments such as remote
in-home monitoring.
  In this paper, we propose an activity recognition system that uses
semi-supervised federated learning, wherein clients conduct unsupervised
learning on autoencoders with unlabelled local data to learn general
representations, and a cloud server conducts supervised learning on an activity
classifier with labelled data. Our experimental results show that using a long
short-term memory autoencoder and a Softmax classifier, the accuracy of our
proposed system is higher than that of both centralised systems and
semi-supervised federated learning using data augmentation. The accuracy is
also comparable to that of supervised federated learning systems. Meanwhile, we
demonstrate that our system can reduce the number of needed labels and the size

supervised federated learning does.

Fluids",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study dynamo action using numerical simulations of planar Boussinesq
convection at rapid rotation (low Ekman numbers, Ek), focusing on subcritical
dynamo action in which the dynamo is sustained for Rayleigh numbers, Ra, below
the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of nonmagnetic convection, Ra$_c$.
These solutions are found by first investigating the supercritical regime, in
which the dynamo is able to generate a large-scale magnetic field that
significantly influences the convective motions, with an associated Elsasser
number of order Ek$^{1/3}$. Subcritical solutions are then found by tracking
this solution branch into the subcritical regime, taking a supercritical
solution and then gradually lowering the corresponding Rayleigh number. We show
that decreasing the Ekman number leads to an extension of the subcritical range
of Ra/Ra$_c$, down to an optimal value of Ek$=10^{-5}$. For magnetic Prandtl
numbers of order unity, subcriticality is then hampered by the emergence of a
large-scale mode at lower Ekman numbers when the dynamo driven by the smaller
scale convection generates relatively stronger large-scale magnetic field. The
inability of the large-scale mode to sustain dynamo action leads to an
intermittent behaviour that appears to inhibit subcriticality. The subcritical
solutions are also sensitive to the value of the magnetic Reynolds number (or
equivalently, the magnetic Prandtl number, Pm), as values of the magnetic
Reynolds number greater than 70 are required to produce dynamo action, but
large values lead to fluctuations that are able to push the system too far from
the subcritical branch and towards the trivial conducting state.

spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distribution. The model has been
obtained through generating a new class of solutions by invoking the Tolman
{\em ansatz} for one of the metric potentials $g_{rr}$ and a physically
reasonable selective profile of radial pressure. We have matched our obtained
interior solution to the Schwarzschild exterior spacetime over the bounding
surface of the compact star. These matching conditions together with the
condition of vanishing the radial pressure across the boundary of the star have
been utilized to determine the model parameters. We have shown that the central
pressure of the star depends on the parameter $p_0$. We have estimated the
range of $p_0$ by using the recent data of compact stars 4U 1608-52 and Vela
X-1. The effect of $p_0$ on different physical parameters e.g., pressure
anisotropy, the subliminal velocity of sound, relativistic adiabatic index etc.
have also been discussed. The developed model of the compact star is
elaborately discussed both analytically and graphically to justify that it
satisfies all the criteria demanded a realistic star. From our analysis, we
have shown that the effect of anisotropy becomes small for higher values of
$p_0$. The mass-radius (M-R) relationship which indicates the maximum mass
admissible for observed pulsars for a given surface density has also been
investigated in our model. Moreover, the variation of radius and mass with
central density has been shown which allow us to estimate central density for a
given radius (or mass) of a compact star.

the proposed approach combines a set of binary classifiers spaced according to
a decay function reflecting the relevance of short-term mortality predictions.
Models and baselines are evaluated under weighted calibration and
discrimination metrics for individual survival distributions which closely
reflect the utility of a model in ICU practice. We show competitive results
with state-of-the-art probabilistic models, while greatly reducing training

e.g.~by computational biology, and belongs to the class of median problems
(over different metric spaces), which are fundamental tasks in data analysis.
  Our main result is for the Ulam metric, where all strings are permutations
over $[n]$ and each edit operation moves a symbol (deletion plus insertion). We
devise for this problem an algorithms that breaks the $2$-approximation
barrier, i.e., computes a $(2-\delta)$-approximate median permutation for some

model of the Ulam median: the input consists of $m$ perturbations of an

combining spectrum modeling and cross correlation techniques. We find that Type
I SLSNe can be divided into two groups by their pre-maximum spectra. Members of
the first group have the W-shaped absorption trough in their pre-maximum
spectrum, usually identified as due to O II. This feature is absent in the
spectra of supernovae in the second group, whose spectra are similar to
SN~2015bn. We confirm that the pre- or near-maximum photospheric velocities
correlate with the velocity gradients: faster evolving SLSNe have larger
photosheric velocities around maximum. We classify the studied SLSNe into the
Fast or the Slow evolving group by their estimated photosheric velocities, and
find that all those objects that resemble to SN~2015bn belong to the Slow
evolving class, while SLSNe showing the W-like absorption are represented in
both Fast and Slow evolving groups. We estimate the ejecta masses of all
objects in our sample, and obtain values in the range of 2.9 ($\pm$0.8) - 208

Multiple Input/Single Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel with Confidential
Messages (BCCM) and alternating Channel State Information at the Transmitter
(CSIT) is investigated. In the MISO BCCM, a $K$-antenna transmitter (TX)
communicates toward $K$ single-antenna receivers (RXs), so that message for RX
$k$ is kept secret from RX $j$ with $j<k$. For this model, we consider the
scenario in which the CSI of the RXs from $2$ to $K$ is instantaneously known
at the transmitter while CSI of RX $1$ is known at the transmitter (i)
instantaneously for half of the time and (ii) with a unit delay for the
remainder of the time. We refer to this CSIT availability as \emph{alternating}
CSIT. Alternating CIST has been shown to provide synergistic gains in terms of
SDoF and is thus of a viable strategy to ensure secure communication by simply
relying on the CSI feedback strategy. Our main contribution is the
characterization of sum SDoF for this model as $SDoF_{\rm sum}= (2K-1)/2$.
Interestingly, this $SDoF_{\rm sum}$ is attained by a rather simple
achievability in which the TX uses artificial noise to prevent the decoding of
the message of the unintended receivers at RX $1$. For simplicity first, the
proof for the case $K=3$ is discussed in detail and after that, we have
presented the results for any number of RXs.

pretrained encoders achieve sample efficiency in downstream applications, they
still require abundant amounts of unlabelled text. Nevertheless, most of the
world's languages lack such resources. Hence, we investigate a more radical
form of unsupervised knowledge transfer in the absence of linguistic data. In
particular, for the first time we pretrain neural networks via emergent
communication from referential games. Our key assumption is that grounding
communication on images---as a crude approximation of real-world
environments---inductively biases the model towards learning natural languages.
On the one hand, we show that this substantially benefits machine translation
in few-shot settings. On the other hand, this also provides an extrinsic
evaluation protocol to probe the properties of emergent languages ex vitro.
Intuitively, the closer they are to natural languages, the higher the gains
from pretraining on them should be. For instance, in this work we measure the
influence of communication success and maximum sequence length on downstream
performances. Finally, we introduce a customised adapter layer and annealing
strategies for the regulariser of maximum-a-posteriori inference during
fine-tuning. These turn out to be crucial to facilitate knowledge transfer and
prevent catastrophic forgetting. Compared to a recurrent baseline, our method
yields gains of $59.0\%$$\sim$$147.6\%$ in BLEU score with only $500$ NMT

for a turbine in a wind farm array. The solution is a fairly simple explicit
relationship that predicts the streamwise velocity distribution within a wind
farm with an arbitrary layout. As this model is obtained by solving flow
governing equations directly for a turbine that is subject to upwind turbine
wakes, no ad hoc superposition technique is needed to predict wind farm flows.
A suite of large-eddy simulations (LES) of wind farm arrays is used to examine
self-similarity as well as validity of the so-called conservation of momentum
deficit for turbine wakes in wind farms. The simulations are performed with and
without the presence of some specific turbines in the wind farm. This allows us
to systematically study some of the assumptions made to develop the analytical
model. A modified version of the conservation of momentum deficit is also
proposed to provide slightly better results at short downwind distances, as
well as in the far wake of turbines deep inside a wind farm. Model predictions
are validated against the LES data for turbines in both full-wake and
partial-wake conditions. While our results highlight the limitation in
capturing the flow speed-up between adjacent turbine columns, the model is
overall able to acceptably predict flow distributions for a moderately sized
wind farm. Finally, the paper employs the new model to provide insights on the

antineutrino\,($\overline{\nu}_e$) disappearance between six reactors and two
detectors with baselines of 294\,m\,(RENO) and 24\,m\,(NEOS). A spectral

from the RENO measurement can explore reactor $\overline{\nu}_e$ oscillations

show in fact they do have a small mass. Currently only the differences of the
masses' squares are known, and an upper bound on the sum. However, upcoming
surveys of the Universe's large-scale structure (LSS) can probe the neutrino
mass by exposing how neutrinos modulate galaxy clustering. But these
measurements are challenging: in looking at the clustering of galaxy pairs, the
effect of neutrinos is degenerate with galaxy formation, the details of which
are unknown. Marginalizing over them degrades the constraints. Here we show
that using correlations of galaxy triplets---the 3-Point Correlation Function
or its Fourier-space analog the bispectrum---can break the degeneracy between
galaxy formation physics (known as biasing) and the neutrino mass.
Specifically, we find a signature of neutrinos in the bispectrum's dipole
moment (with respect to triangle opening angle) that is roughly orthogonal to
the contribution of galaxy biases. This signature was missed in previous works
by failing to account for how neutrinos alter mode-coupling between
perturbations on different scales. Our proposed signature will contribute to
upcoming LSS surveys' such as DESI making a robust detection of the neutrino
mass. We estimate that it can offer several-$\sigma$ evidence for non-zero
$m_{\nu}$ with DESI from the bispectrum alone, and that this is independent
from information in the galaxy power spectrum.

have two main types of sampling in statistics. The first type is survey
sampling which draws samples from a set or population. The second type is
sampling from probability distribution where we have a probability density or

some required background on mean squared error, variance, bias, maximum
likelihood estimation, Bernoulli, Binomial, and Hypergeometric distributions,
the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, and the Markov property. Then, we explain the
theory of simple random sampling, bootstrapping, stratified sampling, and
cluster sampling. We also briefly introduce multistage sampling, network
sampling, and snowball sampling. Afterwards, we switch to sampling from
distribution. We explain sampling from cumulative distribution function, Monte
Carlo approximation, simple Monte Carlo methods, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. For simple Monte Carlo methods, whose iterations are
independent, we cover importance sampling and rejection sampling. For MCMC
methods, we cover Metropolis algorithm, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs

Monte Carlo methods and more efficient Monte Carlo methods, including
Hamiltonian (or hybrid) Monte Carlo, Adler's overrelaxation, and ordered

signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio balancing problem in a multiuser

approaches to predict beamforming rely on the assumption that the training and
testing channels follow the same distribution which may not hold in practice.
As a result, a trained model may lead to performance deterioration when the
testing network environment changes. To deal with this task mismatch issue, we
propose two offline adaptive algorithms based on deep transfer learning and
meta-learning, which are able to achieve fast adaptation with the limited new
labelled data when the testing wireless environment changes. Furthermore, we
propose an online algorithm to enhance the adaptation capability of the offline
meta algorithm in realistic non-stationary environments. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive algorithms achieve much better
performance than the direct deep learning algorithm without adaptation in new
environments. The meta-learning algorithm outperforms the deep transfer
learning algorithm and achieves near optimal performance. In addition, compared
to the offline meta-learning algorithm, the proposed online meta-learning
algorithm shows superior adaption performance in changing environments.

distributions, perhaps more efficiently than can be achieved classically. The
Born machine is an example of such a model, easily implemented on near term
quantum computers. However, in its original form, the Born machine only
naturally represents discrete distributions. Since probability distributions of
a continuous nature are commonplace in the world, it is essential to have a
model which can efficiently represent them. Some proposals have been made in
the literature to supplement the discrete Born machine with extra features to
more easily learn continuous distributions, however, all invariably increase
the resources required to some extent. In this work, we present the continuous

order ~ 10^-9. The detected anisotropy is related to large-scale directional
LCDM cosmological parameter variations across the CMB sky, that are sourced by
three distinct patches in the maps with circularly-averaged sizes between 40 to

these well-defined regions within the cosmological parameter maps may reflect
finite and casually disjoint horizons across the observable universe. In
particular we show that the observed relation between horizon size and mean
dark energy density within a given horizon is in good agreement with
expectations from a recently proposed model of the universe that explains
cosmic acceleration and cosmological parameter tensions between the high and

stochastic forcing on the Incompressible Slice Model (ISM) in a smooth 2D
bounded domain, which can be derived by adapting the Lagrangian function in
Hamilton's principle for CHSM to the Euler-Boussinesq Eady incompressible case.
First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of local pathwise solution
(probability strong solution) to the ISM perturbed by nonlinear multiplicative
stochastic forcing in Banach spaces $W^{k,p}(D)$ with $k>1+1/p$ and $p\geq 2$.
The solution is obtained by introducing suitable cut-off operators applied to
the $W^{1,\infty}$-norm of the velocity and temperature fields, using the
stochastic compactness method and the Yamada-Watanabe type argument based on
the Gy\""{o}ngy-Krylov characterization of convergence in probability. Then,
when the ISM is perturbed by linear multiplicative stochastic forcing and the
potential temperature does not vary linearly on the $y$-direction, we prove
that the associated Cauchy problem admits a unique global-in-time pathwise
solution with high probability, provided that the initial data is sufficiently
small or the diffusion parameter is large enough. The results partially answer

countless protocols in quantum information processing. Quantum mechanics sets
an ultimate lower limit of half a photon to the added input noise for
phase-preserving amplification of narrowband signals, also known as the
standard quantum limit (SQL). This limit, which is equivalent to a maximum
quantum efficiency of $0.5$, can be overcome by employing nondegenerate
parametric amplification of broadband signals. We show that, in principle, a
maximum quantum efficiency of 1 can be reached. Experimentally, we find a
quantum efficiency of $0.69 \pm 0.02$, well beyond the SQL, by employing a
flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier and broadband thermal signals. We
expect that our results allow for fundamental improvements in the detection of
ultraweak microwave signals.

features in the persistent current arise. The elementary flux quantum, which
fixes the persistent current periodicity, is observed to evolve from a single
particle one to an extreme case of fractional flux quantum, in which one
quantum is shared by all the particles. We show that the persistent current
depends on the number of spin components $N$, number of particles and
interaction in a specific way that in certain physical regimes has universality

above a threshold of the repulsive interaction by the Mott spectral gap.
Despite its mesoscopic nature, the current displays a clear finite size scaling
behavior. Specific parity effects in the persistent current landscape hold.

accounts for superdirectivity and mutual coupling effects along with near field

Data compression and noise level estimation schemes are also proposed to apply
the algorithm efficiently to large datasets and unknown noise level scenarios.
Two approaches in system identification and receding horizon control are
developed based on the derived optimal estimator. The first one identifies a
finite impulse response model. This approach improves the least-squares
estimator with less restrictive assumptions. The second one applies the signal

leverages the uncertainty estimates supplied by GPs to better allocate labeling

which was recently argued to be caused by a real age spread similar to the
cluster age (~160 Myr). We combined accurate Washington and Stromgren
photometry of high membership probability stars to explore the nature of such
an eMSTO. From different ad hoc defined pseudo colors we found that bluer and
redder stars distributed throughout the eMSTO do not show any inhomogeneities
of light and heavy-element abundances. These 'blue' and 'red' stars split into
two clearly different groups only when the Washington $M$ magnitudes are
employed, which delimites the number of spectral features responsible for the
appearance of the eMSTO. We speculate that Be stars populate the eMSTO of
NGC1971 because: i) Hbeta contributes to the M passband; ii) Hbeta emissions
are common features of Be stars and; iii) Washington M and T1 magnitudes show a
tight correlation; the latter measuring the observed contribution of Halpha
emission line in Be stars, which in turn correlates with Hbeta emissions. As
far as we are aware, this is the first observational result pointing to Hbeta
emissions as the origin of eMSTOs observed in young star clusters. The presence
outcome will certainly open new possibilities of studying eMSTO from

a powerful ability to generate natural speech. However, it is still not robust
enough to meet the stability requirements for industrial products. Besides, it
suffers from slow inference speed owning to the autoregressive generation

attention-based neural TTS system. Firstly, we propose a novel Gaussian
attention which utilizes interpretability of Gaussian attention and the strict
monotonic property in TTS. By this method, we replace the commonly used stop
token prediction architecture with attentive stop prediction. Secondly, we
apply block sparsity on the autoregressive decoder to speed up speech
synthesis. The experimental results show that our proposed FeatherTTS not only
nearly eliminates the problem of word skipping, repeating in particularly hard
texts and keep the naturalness of generated speech, but also speeds up acoustic
feature generation by 3.5 times over Tacotron. Overall, the proposed FeatherTTS
can be $35$x faster than real-time on a single CPU.

from the interstellar medium (ISM). Estimates of the efficiency of this

propagating into a homogeneous medium, whereas the ISM possesses significant
substructure in reality. We self-consistently model the dust and gas properties
of the shocked ISM in three supernova remnants (SNRs), using X-ray and infrared
(IR) data combined with corresponding emission models. Collisional heating by
gas with properties derived from X-ray observations produces dust temperatures
too high to fit the far-IR fluxes from each SNR. An additional colder dust
component is required, which has a minimum mass several orders of magnitude
larger than that of the warm dust heated by the X-ray emitting gas. Dust-to-gas
mass ratios indicate that the majority of the dust in the X-ray emitting
material has been destroyed, while the fraction of surviving dust in the cold
component is plausibly close to unity. As the cold component makes up virtually
all the total dust mass, destruction timescales based on homogeneous models,
which cannot account for multiple phases of shocked gas and dust, may be
significantly overestimating actual dust destruction efficiencies, and
subsequently underestimating grain lifetimes.

mechanism with bristled wings for lift augmentation and drag reduction at
chord-based Reynolds number ($Re$) on $\mathcal{O}$(10). We examine wing-wing
interaction of bristled wings in fling at $Re$=10, as a function of initial
inter-wing spacing ($\delta$) and degree of overlap between rotation and linear
translation. A dynamically scaled robotic platform was used to drive physical
models of bristled wing pairs with the following kinematics (all angles
relative to vertical): 1) rotation about the trailing edge to angle
$\theta_\text{r}$; 2) linear translation at a fixed angle ($\theta_\text{t}$);
and 3) combined rotation and linear translation. The results show that: 1)
cycle-averaged drag coefficient decreased with increasing $\theta_\text{r}$ and
$\theta_\text{t}$; and 2) decreasing $\delta$ increased the lift coefficient
owing to increased asymmetry in circulation of leading and trailing edge
vortices. A new dimensionless index, reverse flow capacity (RFC), was used to
quantify the maximum possible ability of a bristled wing to leak fluid through
the bristles. Drag coefficients were larger for smaller $\delta$ and
$\theta_\text{r}$ despite larger RFC, likely due to blockage of inter-bristle
flow by shear layers around the bristles. Smaller $\delta$ during early
rotation resulted in formation of strong positive pressure distribution between
the wings, resulting in increased drag force. The positive pressure region
weakened with increasing $\theta_\text{r}$, which in turn reduced drag force.
Tiny insects have been reported to use large rotational angles in fling, and
our findings suggest that a plausible reason is to reduce drag forces.

significantly improves the efficiency of online recommendation. To alleviate
data sparsity and cold-start problems, the user-item interactive information

items and users. Specifically, we first pre-train robust item representation
from item content data by a Denoising Auto-encoder instead of other
deterministic deep learning frameworks; then we finetune the entire framework
by adding a pairwise loss objective with discrete constraints; moreover, DPH
aims to minimize a pairwise ranking loss that is consistent with the ultimate
goal of recommendation. Finally, we adopt the alternating optimization method
to optimize the proposed model with discrete constraints. Extensive experiments
on three different datasets show that DPH can significantly advance the
state-of-the-art frameworks regarding data sparsity and item cold-start

providing an identification with the standard conformal tractor bundle via a
dynamical soldering form. This can also be seen as a generalization of the so

end, we propose a collaborative generated hashing (CGH) framework to improve
the efficiency by denoting users and items as binary codes, then fast hashing
search techniques can be used to speed up the online recommendation. In
addition, the proposed CGH can generate potential users or items for marketing
application where the generative network is designed with the principle of
Minimum Description Length (MDL), which is used to learn compact and
informative binary codes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the
advantages for recommendations in various settings over competing baselines and

also require large computational resources and specific datasets to generate
high fidelity images. In our work, we have formulated a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) over the latent space of a pre-trained GAN model to learn a conditional
policy for semantic manipulation along specific attributes under defined

  (NeurIPS2020)",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommendation techniques are important approaches for alleviating
information overload. Being often trained on implicit user feedback, many
recommenders suffer from the sparsity challenge due to the lack of explicitly
negative samples. The GAN-style recommenders (i.e., IRGAN) addresses the
challenge by learning a generator and a discriminator adversarially, such that
the generator produces increasingly difficult samples for the discriminator to
accelerate optimizing the discrimination objective. However, producing samples
from the generator is very time-consuming, and our empirical study shows that
the discriminator performs poor in top-k item recommendation. To this end, a
theoretical analysis is made for the GAN-style algorithms, showing that the
generator of limit capacity is diverged from the optimal generator. This may
interpret the limitation of discriminator's performance. Based on these
findings, we propose a Sampling-Decomposable Generative Adversarial Recommender
(SD-GAR). In the framework, the divergence between some generator and the
optimum is compensated by self-normalized importance sampling; the efficiency
of sample generation is improved with a sampling-decomposable generator, such
that each sample can be generated in O(1) with the Vose-Alias method.
Interestingly, due to decomposability of sampling, the generator can be
optimized with the closed-form solutions in an alternating manner, being
different from policy gradient in the GAN-style algorithms. We extensively
evaluate the proposed algorithm with five real-world recommendation datasets.
The results show that SD-GAR outperforms IRGAN by 12.4% and the SOTA
recommender by 10% on average. Moreover, discriminator training can be 20x
faster on the dataset with more than 120K items.

and dynamical coupling between small-scale droplets and large-scale rheology.
By using a specifically designed Taylor-Couette (TC) shear flow system, we are
able to characterize the statistical properties of a turbulent emulsion made of
oil droplets dispersed in an ethanol-water continuous solution, at the oil
volume fraction up to 40%. We find that the dependence of the droplet size on
the Reynolds number of the flow at the volume fraction of 1% can be well
described by Hinze's criterion. The distribution of droplet sizes is found to
follow a log-normal distribution, hinting at a fragmentation process as the
possible mechanism dominating droplet formation. Additionally, the effective
viscosity of the turbulent emulsion increases with the volume fraction of the
dispersed oil phase, and decreases when the shear strength is increased. We
find that the dependence of the effective viscosity on the shear rate can be
described by the Herschel-Bulkley model, with a flow index monotonically
decreasing with increasing the oil volume fraction. This finding indicates that
the degree of shear thinning systematically increases with the volume fraction
of the dispersed phase. The current findings have important implications for
bridging the knowledge on turbulence and low-Reynolds-number emulsion flows to
turbulent emulsion flows.

increases when a mismatch occurs between the training and the testing
conditions due to the noise, etc. In this case, the acoustic information can be
less reliable. This work aims to improve ASR by modeling long-term semantic
relations to compensate for distorted acoustic features. We propose to perform
this through rescoring of the ASR N-best hypotheses list. To achieve this, we
train a deep neural network (DNN). Our DNN rescoring model is aimed at
selecting hypotheses that have better semantic consistency and therefore lower
WER. We investigate two types of representations as part of input features to
our DNN model: static word embeddings (from word2vec) and dynamic contextual
embeddings (from BERT). Acoustic and linguistic features are also included. We
perform experiments on the publicly available dataset TED-LIUM mixed with real
noise. The proposed rescoring approaches give significant improvement of the
WER over the ASR system without rescoring models in two noisy conditions and
with n-gram and RNNLM.

$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the weight $M$ of a minimum spanning forest

$\varepsilon>0$.
  (1) Our deterministic algorithm takes $O({W^2 \log W}/{\varepsilon^3})$
worst-case update time, which is $O(1)$ if both $W$ and $\varepsilon$ are
constants. Note that there is a lower bound by Patrascu and Demaine (SIAM J.
Comput. 2006) which shows that it takes $\Omega(\log n)$ time per operation to
maintain the exact weight of an MSF that holds even in the unweighted case,
i.e. for $W=1$. We further show that any deterministic data structure that
dynamically maintains the $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate weight of an MSF
requires super constant time per operation, if $W\geq (\log n)^{\omega_n(1)}$.
  (2) Our randomized (Monte-Carlo style) algorithm works with high probability
and runs in worst-case $O(\log W/ \varepsilon^{4})$ update time if $W=
O({(m^*)^{1/6}}/{\log^{2/3} n})$, where $m^*$ is the minimum number of edges in
the graph throughout all the updates. It works even against an adaptive
adversary. This implies a randomized algorithm with worst-case $o(\log n)$
update time, whenever $W=\min\{O((m^*)^{1/6}/\log^{2/3} n), 2^{o({\log n})}\}$

any constant $\varepsilon,\alpha>0$ and $W=n^{\alpha}$, any (randomized) data
structure that dynamically maintains the weight of an MSF of a graph $G$ with
edge weights in $[1,W]$ and $W = \Omega(\varepsilon m^*)$ within a

such program-like specifications exhibit lots of structure such as repeating
subpatterns. Established techniques like probabilistic bisimulation
minimization are able to exploit these structures; however, they operate
directly on the explicit-state model. On the other hand, methods for reducing
structured state spaces by reasoning about the high-level program have not been
investigated that much. In this paper, we present a new, simple, and fully
automatic program-level technique to reduce the underlying Markov model. Our
approach aims at computing the summary behavior of adjacent locations in the
program's control-flow graph, thereby obtaining a program with fewer ""control

semantics, enabling more efficient model checking. A key insight is that in
principle, each (combination of) program variable(s) with finite domain can
play the role of the program counter that defines the flow structure. Unlike
most other reduction techniques, our approach is property-directed and
naturally supports unspecified model parameters. Experiments demonstrate that
our simple method yields state-space reductions of up to 80% on practically
relevant benchmarks.

multilayer networks consisting of at least one directed layer. We rigorously
demonstrate that directionality in multilayer networks can fundamentally change
the behavior of diffusive dynamics: from monotonic (in undirected systems) to
non-monotonic diffusion with respect to the interlayer coupling strength.
Moreover, for certain multilayer network configurations, the directionality can
induce a unique superdiffusion regime for intermediate values of the interlayer
coupling, wherein the diffusion is even faster than that corresponding to the
theoretical limit for undirected systems, i.e., the diffusion in the integrated
network obtained from the aggregation of each layer. We theoretically and
numerically show that the existence of superdiffusion is fully determined by
the directionality of each layer and the topological overlap between layers. We
further provide a formulation of multilayer networks displaying superdiffusion.
Our results highlight the significance of incorporating the interacting
directionality in multilevel networked systems and provide a framework to

optical fabrication in term of achievable optical quality and reduction of

technique in the fabrication process. The first method makes use of 3D printing
in the fabrication of warping harnesses for stress polishing, and we apply that
to the fabrication of the WFIRST coronagraph off axis parabolas. The second
method considers a proof of concept for 3D printing of lightweight X-Ray
mirrors, targeting the next generation of X-rays telescopes. Stress polishing
is well suited for the fabrication of the high quality off axis parabolas
required by the coronagraph to image exoplanets.. Here we describe a new design
of warping harness which can generate astigmatism and coma with only one
actuator. The idea is to incorporate 3D printing in the manufacturing of the
warping harness. The method depicted in this paper demonstrates that we reach
the tight precision required at the mirrors surface. Moreover the error
introduced by the warping harness fabricated by 3D printing does not impact the
final error budget. Concerning the proof of concept project, we investigate 3D
printing towards lightweight X-ray mirrors. We present the surface metrology of
test samples fabricated by stereo lithography (SLA) and Selective Laser
Sintering (SLS) with different materials. The lightweighting of the samples is
composed of a series of arches. By complementing 3D printing with finite
element analysis topology optimization we can simulate a specific optimum shape
for the given input parameters and external boundary conditions. The next set
of prototypes is designed taking to account the calculation of topology
optimisation.

magnetic anisotropy in a rotating magnetic field is studied. The theory of
paramagnetic particle chains usually assumes that the particles are
magnetically isotropic and do not rotate in a rotating field. In experiments it
is seen that spherical paramagnetic particles rotate, which can be explained by
small magnetic anisotropy. In this article, the maximal chain length is
calculated for paramagnetic particles with magnetic anisotropy in a rotating
magnetic field. Results show that the maximal chain length as a function of
field frequency has the same trend for isotropic magnetic particles and
particles with magnetic anisotropy if the field frequency is much higher or
much lower than the critical frequency of an individual particle. blue
Initially randomly distributed particles will form chains that will collide and
exchange with particles till they obtain a typical chain length. The typical
chain length of a small cluster is shorter than the maximal chain length of an
isolated chain for the same field frequency. The distribution of chain lengths
in a small cluster of chains is narrower for particles with higher magnetic
anisotropy. Due to the narrower distribution of chain lengths, particles with
magnetic anisotropy can suit better for mass-production. This article will show
how magnetic anisotropy parameters of paramagnetic particles influence chain
length of chains which form in a rotating magnetic field.

between $3\times10^{22}$ and $1.5\times10^{25}\text{ W Hz}^{-1}$ and total
radio emission no larger than 80 kpc. These objects, which we term galaxy-scale
jets (GSJ), are small enough to be directly influencing the evolution of the
host on galaxy scales. We report upon the typical host properties of our
sample, finding that 9 per cent are hosted by spirals with the remainder being
hosted by elliptical galaxies. Two of the spiral-hosted GSJ are highly unusual
with low radio luminosities and FRII-like morphology. The host properties of
our GSJ show that they are ordinary AGN observed at a stage in their life
shortly after the radio emission has expanded beyond the central regions of the
host. Based on our estimates, we find that about half of our GSJ have internal
radio lobe energy within an order of magnitude of the ISM energy so that, even
ignoring any possible shocks, GSJ are energetically capable of affecting the
evolution of the host. The current sample of GSJ will grow in size with future
releases of LoTSS and can also form the basis for further studies of feedback

$G$ and each vertex of the graph is assigned to one of $\ell$ servers, where
servers have capacity $k$ and we assume that the graph has $\ell \cdot k$
vertices. Initially, $G$ does not contain any edges and then the edges of $G$
are revealed one-by-one. The goal is to design an online algorithm
$\operatorname{ONL}$, which always places the connected components induced by
the revealed edges on the same server and never exceeds the server capacities
by more than $\varepsilon k$ for constant $\varepsilon>0$. Whenever
$\operatorname{ONL}$ learns about a new edge, the algorithm is allowed to move
vertices from one server to another. Its objective is to minimize the number of
vertex moves. More specifically, $\operatorname{ONL}$ should minimize the
competitive ratio: the total cost $\operatorname{ONL}$ incurs compared to an
optimal offline algorithm $\operatorname{OPT}$.
  Our main contribution is a polynomial-time randomized algorithm, that is
asymptotically optimal: we derive an upper bound of $O(\log \ell + \log k)$ on
its competitive ratio and show that no randomized online algorithm can achieve
a competitive ratio of less than $\Omega(\log \ell + \log k)$. We also settle
the open problem of the achievable competitive ratio by deterministic online
algorithms, by deriving a competitive ratio of $\Theta(\ell \lg k)$; to this
end, we present an improved lower bound as well as a deterministic
polynomial-time online algorithm.
  Our algorithms rely on a novel technique which combines efficient integer
programming with a combinatorial approach for maintaining ILP solutions. We
believe this technique is of independent interest and will find further
applications in the future.

  This paper presents a novel storage engine that provides a flexible address

relies on the hardness of solving a system of polynomial equations over a

equations is closely related to the cost of computing Groebner bases, since
computing the solutions of a polynomial system can be reduced to finding a
lexicographic Groebner basis for the ideal generated by the equations. Several
algorithms for computing such bases exist: We consider those based on repeated
Gaussian elimination of Macaulay matrices. In this paper, we analyze the case
of random systems, where random systems means either semi-regular systems, or
quadratic systems in n variables which contain a regular sequence of n
polynomials. We provide explicit formulae for bounds on the solving degree of
semi-regular systems with m > n equations in n variables, for equations of
arbitrary degrees for m = n+1, and for any m for systems of quadratic or cubic
polynomials. In the appendix, we provide a table of bounds for the solving
degree of semi-regular systems of m = n + k quadratic equations in n variables

  In this paper we extend this mirror phenomenon to the equivariant case.
Namely, for any $G$ - a symmetry group of a cusp polynomial $f_{A'}$, we
introduce the Frobenius manifold of a pair $(f_{A'},G)$ and show that it is

  For some special values of $A'$ with the special choice of $G$ it happens
that $\mathbb{P}^1_{A'} \cong \mathbb{P}^1_{A,\Lambda}$. Combining our mirror
symmetry isomorphism for the pair $(A,\Lambda)$, together with the ""usual"" one

the baryon fraction in halos as a function of mass and large-scale
$\delta_{bc}$, which also allows us to study details of the nontrivial

transitions raise the question about such phenomena in the $D$ decays induced
by $c\to (s,d)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ transitions. In the experimental side, current
measurements on the pure leptonic and semileptonic $D$ decays agree with the
standard model predictions, such agreements can be used to constrain the new
physics (NP) contributions. In this work, we extend the standard model by
assuming general effective Hamiltonians describing the $c\to
(s,d)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ transitions including the full set of the four-fermion
operators. Within the latest experimental data, we perform a minimum $\chi^2$
fit of the Wilson coefficient corresponding to each operator. The results show
that the Wilson coefficients of scalar operators in muon sector are at the
order of ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$, and others are at the order of ${\cal
O}(10^{-3})$. The lepton flavor universality could be violated by the scalar
operators. We also calculate the branching fractions, the forward-backward
asymmetries and polarizations of final vector mesons and leptons with the
fitted Wilson coefficients of scalar and tensor operators. It is found that the
pure leptonic decays are very sensitive to the scalar operators. The effects of
NP on the semileptonic decays with electron are negligible, while for the
semileptonic decays with muon the effects of scalar operators will show up in
the forward-backward asymmetries and polarizations of muon of $D \to P\mu^+
\nu_\mu$. The future measurements in BESIII and Belle II experiments will help
us to test effects of NP and to further test new physics models.

reflection planes either parallel or perpendicular to the incident direction)
can be incorporated to ensure simultaneously the invariance of transmission and

of reciprocity and parity conservation, which are fully independent of the

thermal transport properties for a wide range of materials, from perfect
periodic crystals to systems with strong structural and compositional disorder,
as well as their interfaces. Although MD does not intrinsically rely on a plane
wave-like phonon description, when coupled with lattice dynamics calculations,
it can give insights to the vibrational mode level contributions to thermal
transport, which includes plane-wave like modes as well as others, rendering
the approach versatile and powerful. On the other hand, several deficiencies
including the lack of vibrationally accurate interatomic potentials and the
inability to rigorously include the quantum nature of phonons prohibit the
widespread applicability and reliability of Molecular Dynamics simulations.

Potential user equipments (UEs) in vicinity of the source UE must be explored
in order to select a new relay when the current link gets blocked. However,
dynamic obstacles are not known in advance and thus may cause unpredictable
fluctuations to D2D channel quality causing newly selected relay link also to
be susceptible to blockage. This might cause frequent relay switching leading
to call drops and high energy consumption. We have proposed the idea of
reducing frequency in relay exploration and switching and thus average
end-to-end delay (in seconds) at the expense of additional exploration time
units (few milliseconds) during beam alignment. We seek to learn the
uncertainty in D2D link qualities by modeling the problem as finite horizon
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework locally at each
UE. We have derived an optimal threshold policy which maps the state to set of
actions. We then give a simplified and easy to implement stationary threshold
policy which counts the number of successive acknowledgment successes/failures
for making decisions of selecting or not selecting a given relay locally.
Through extensive simulation, we validate our theoretical findings and

high fidelity full solutions are obtained by discretizing the RTSWE in space
with skew-symmetric finite-differences, that preserve the Hamiltonian
structure. The resulting skew-gradient system is integrated in time with the
energy preserving average vector field (AVF) method. The reduced-order model
(ROM) is constructed in the same way as the full order model (FOM), preserving
the reduced skew-symmetric structure and integrating in time with the AVF
method. Relying on structure-preserving discretizations in space and time and
applying proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the Galerkin projection, an
energy preserving reduced order model (ROM) is constructed. The nonlinearities
in the ROM are computed by applying the discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM)
method to reduce the computational cost. The computation of the reduced-order
solutions is accelerated further by the use of tensor techniques. The overall
procedure yields a clear separation of the offline and online computational
cost of the reduced solutions. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the
ROMs are demonstrated for a numerical test problem. Preservation of the energy

strong breaking of the $C_2$ symmetry in the atomic structure of TBG. For large

increasingly attracted a large number of potential cloud consumers (PCC) plan
to migrate the traditional business to the cloud service. However, trust has
become one of the most challenging issues that prevent the PCC from adopting
cloud services, especially in trustworthy cloud service selection. Besides, due
to the diversity and dynamic of quality of service (QoS) in the cloud
environment, the existing trust assessment methods based on the single constant
value of QoS attribute and the subjective weight assignment are not good enough
to provide an effective solution for PCCs to identify and select a trustworthy
cloud service among a wide range of functionally-equivalent cloud service
providers (CSPs). To address the challenge, a novel assessment and selection
framework for trustworthy cloud service, FASTCloud, is proposed in this study.
This framework facilitates PCCs to select a trustworthy cloud service based on
their actual QoS requirements. In order to accurately and efficiently assess
the trust level of cloud services, a QoS-based trust assessment model is
proposed. This model represents a trust level assessment method based on the
interval multiple attributes with an objective weight assignment method based
on the deviation maximization to adaptively determine the trust level of
different cloud services provisioned by candidate CSPs. The advantage of the
proposed trust level assessment method in time complexity is demonstrated by
the performance analysis and comparison. The experimental result of a case
study with an open-source dataset shows that the trust model is efficient in
cloud service trust assessment and the FASTCloud can effectively help PCCs
select a trustworthy cloud service.

to allow vertices to have a prescribed, possibly non-zero difference (modulo
$3$) between the inflow and outflow. They conjectured that all
$5$-edge-connected graphs with a valid prescription function have a nowhere
zero $3$-flow meeting that prescription (we call this the Strong $3$-Flow
Conjecture). Kochol (2001) showed that replacing $4$-edge-connected with
$5$-edge-connected would suffice to prove the $3$-Flow Conjecture and Lov\'asz

the edge connectivity condition is relaxed to $6$-edge-connected. Both problems
are still open for $5$-edge-connected graphs.
  The $3$-Flow Conjecture was known to hold for planar graphs, as it is the
dual of Gr\""otzsch's Colouring Theorem. Steinberg and Younger (1989) provided
the first direct proof using flows for planar graphs, as well as a proof for
projective planar graphs. Richter et al.(2016) provided the first direct proof

tissue remains a challenge. Therefore, we must, perforce, rely on in-silico
simulations of scroll waves in mathematical models for cardiac tissue to
develop an understanding of the dynamics of these waves in mammalian hearts. We
use direct numerical simulations of the Hund-Rudy-Dynamic (HRD) model, for
canine ventricular tissue, to examine the interplay between electrical
scroll-waves and conduction and ionic inhomogeneities, in anatomically
realistic canine ventricular geometries with muscle-fiber architecture. We find
that millimeter-sized, distributed, conduction inhomogeneities cause a
substantial decrease in the scroll wavelength, thereby increasing the
probability for wave breaks; by contrast, single, localized, medium-sized
($\simeq $ cm) conduction inhomogeneities, exhibit the potential to suppress
wave breaks or enable the self-organization of wave fragments into stable,
intact scrolls. We show that ionic inhomogeneities, both distributed or
localised, suppress scroll-wave break up. The dynamics of a stable rotating
wave is not affected significantly by such inhomogeneities, except at high
concentrations of distributed inhomogeneities, which can cause a partial break
up of scroll waves. Our results indicate that inhomogeneities in the canine
ventricular tissue are less arrhythmogenic than inhomogeneities in porcine
ventricular tissue, for which an earlier in silico study has shown that the
inhomogeneity-induced suppression of scroll waves is a rare occurrence.

in natural language processing. However, the sentence embeddings from the
pre-trained language models without fine-tuning have been found to poorly
capture semantic meaning of sentences. In this paper, we argue that the
semantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first
reveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model
pre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then
analyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always
induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its
performance of semantic similarity. To address this issue, we propose to
transform the anisotropic sentence embedding distribution to a smooth and
isotropic Gaussian distribution through normalizing flows that are learned with
an unsupervised objective. Experimental results show that our proposed
BERT-flow method obtains significant performance gains over the
state-of-the-art sentence embeddings on a variety of semantic textual
similarity tasks. The code is available at

It briefly describes the application of some adversarial examples in different

author also introduces the defense methods, and analyzes the performance of
these methods against the black and white box attack.

  Self-Supervised Scene Flow Estimation","Master Thesis",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Scene flow is the task of estimating 3D motion vectors to individual points
of a dynamic 3D scene. Motion vectors have shown to be beneficial for
downstream tasks such as action classification and collision avoidance.
However, data collected via LiDAR sensors and stereo cameras are computation
and labor intensive to precisely annotate for scene flow. We address this
annotation bottleneck on two ends. We propose a 3D scene flow benchmark and a
novel self-supervised setup for training flow models. The benchmark consists of
datasets designed to study individual aspects of flow estimation in progressive
order of complexity, from a single object in motion to real-world scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce Adversarial Metric Learning for self-supervised flow
estimation. The flow model is fed with sequences of point clouds to perform
flow estimation. A second model learns a latent metric to distinguish between
the points translated by the flow estimations and the target point cloud. This
latent metric is learned via a Multi-Scale Triplet loss, which uses
intermediary feature vectors for the loss calculation. We use our proposed
benchmark to draw insights about the performance of the baselines and of
different models when trained using our setup. We find that our setup is able
to keep motion coherence and preserve local geometries, which many
self-supervised baselines fail to grasp. Dealing with occlusions, on the other
hand, is still an open challenge.

  Analysis and Visualization (TopoInVis 2019)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CG cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a concept to design, track, and compare
application-specific feature definitions expressed as sets of critical points.
Our work has been inspired by the observation that in many applications a large
variety of different feature definitions for the same concept are used. Often,
these definitions compete with each other and it is unclear which definition
should be used in which context. A prominent example is the definition of
cyclones in climate research. Despite the differences, frequently these feature
definitions can be related to topological concepts.
  In our approach, we provide a cyclone tracking framework that supports
interactive feature definition and comparison based on a precomputed tracking
graph that stores all extremal points as well as their temporal correspondents.
The framework combines a set of independent building blocks: critical point
extraction, critical point tracking, feature definition, and track exploration.
One of the major advantages of such an approach is the flexibility it provides,
that is, each block is exchangeable. Moreover, it also enables us to perform
the most expensive analysis, the construction of a full tracking graph, as a
prepossessing step, while keeping the feature definition interactive. Different
feature definitions can be explored and compared interactively based on this
tracking graph. Features are specified by rules for grouping critical points,
while feature tracking corresponds to filtering and querying the full tracking
graph by specific requests. We demonstrate this method for cyclone
identification and tracking in the context of climate research.
