case of damage. However, robot damages are prevalent in real-world

fragility of robots greatly limits their widespread application. We propose an
adversarial reinforcement learning framework, which significantly increases
robot robustness over joint damage cases in both manipulation tasks and
locomotion tasks. The agent is trained iteratively under the joint damage cases
where it has poor performance. We validate our algorithm on a three-fingered

also demonstrates exceeding success rates over arbitrary joint damage cases.

accomplishing the challenging task of autonomous driving. We then dwell upon
each of these operations to explain their role in the autonomous system
architecture, with a prime focus on control strategies. The core portion of

system is essential to ensure that it will be trusted and consequently used to
its full capabilities in critical applications. In cases where a scheduler
schedules activities in an invalid location, it is usually easy for the user to
infer the missing constraint by inspecting the schedule with the invalid
activity to determine the missing constraint. If a scheduler fails to schedule
activities because constraints could not be satisfied, determining the cause
can be more challenging. In such cases it is important to understand which
constraints caused the activities to fail to be scheduled and how to alter
constraints to achieve the desired schedule. In this paper, we describe such a
scheduling system for NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, as well as
Crosscheck, an explainable scheduling tool that explains the scheduler
behavior. The scheduling system and Crosscheck are the baseline for operational
use to schedule activities for the Mars 2020 rover. As we describe, the
scheduler generates a schedule given a set of activities and their constraints
and Crosscheck: (1) provides a visual representation of the generated schedule;
(2) analyzes and explains why activities failed to schedule given the
constraints provided; and (3) provides guidance on potential constraint
relaxations to enable the activities to schedule in future scheduler runs.

(LSG-EMS) for operating microgrids on a distribution feeder powered by one or

feeder are divided into load switching groups that can be remotely switched on

programming (MILP) problem, has an objective function of maximizing the served
loads while minimizing the total number of switching actions. A new set of
topology constraints are developed for allowing multiple microgrids to be
formed on the feeder and selecting the optimal supply path. Customer comfort is
accounted for by maximizing the supply duration in the customer preferred
service period and enforcing a minimum service duration. The proposed method is
demonstrated on a modified IEEE 33-bus system using actual customer data.

BESIII experiment. From its decay modes, it is reasonable for people to assign
it to the category of exotic state, say $Z^+_{cs}$, the stranged-parter of
$Z_{c}(3900)$. This finding indicates for the first time the exotic state with
strange quark in charm sector, and hence has a peculiar importance. By virtue
of the QCD Sum Rule technique, we analyze the $Z^+_{cs}$ about its possible
configuration and physical properties, and find it could be configured as a
mixture of two types of structures, $[1_c]_{\bar{c} u}\otimes[1_c]_{\bar{s} c}$
and $[1_c]_{\bar{c} c}\otimes[1_c]_{\bar{s} u}$, or $[3_c]_{\bar{c}
u}\otimes[\bar{3}_c]_{\bar{s} c}$ and $[3_c]_{\bar{c}

to be the emergence of a compound of four possible currents in each
configuration, which tells the single current evaluation of hadron spectroscopy
and their decay properties are sometimes not enough. We find in both cases the
energy spectra may fit well with the experimental observation, i.e. $3.98$ GeV,
within the uncertainties, while noted the former is not favored by vector meson
exchange model. Various $Z^+_{cs}(3980)$ decay modes are evaluated, which are

layer is first determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray

roughness on the film thickness, and we study the homogeneity of magnetic flux
penetration into the films by magneto-optical imaging. We find that the
superconducting critical temperature and critical current density of these
films are very similar to those of YBCO films grown on well-matched substrates.
It appears that the microstructure of YBCO films is affected by structural
defects in the buffer layer as well as variations in oxygen deficiency, which
results in high values of critical current density suitable for application.

unexpected discovery of GeV gamma-rays from Galactic novae has highlighted the
complexity of novae and their value as laboratories for studying shocks and
particle acceleration. We review half a century of nova literature through this
new lens, and conclude:
  --The basics of the thermonuclear runaway theory of novae are confirmed by
observations. The white dwarf sustains surface nuclear burning for some time
after runaway, and until recently, it was commonly believed that radiation from
this nuclear burning solely determines the nova's bolometric luminosity.
  --The processes by which novae eject material from the binary system remain
poorly understood. Mass loss from novae is complex (sometimes fluctuating in
rate, velocity, and morphology) and often prolonged in time over weeks, months,
or years.
  --The complexity of the mass ejection leads to gamma-ray producing shocks
internal to the nova ejecta. When gamma-rays are detected (around optical
maximum), the shocks are deeply embedded and the surrounding gas is very dense.
  --Observations of correlated optical and gamma-ray light curves confirm that
the shocks are radiative and contribute significantly to the bolometric
luminosity of novae. Novae are therefore the closest and most common

between wind, sand transport and surface topography. Depending on varying
environmental and wind conditions, the mechanism driving dune formation and,
ultimately, the shape of nascent dunes may differ markedly. In cases where sand
availability is plentiful one mechanism suggested for triggering dune growth is
linear stability theory. Until now, this theory has only been tested using
field evidence in unidirectional winds. However, in many areas of the world and
on other planets where aeolian processes act, wind regimes are often bimodal or
multimodal. Here, we investigate field evidence of protodune formation under
bimodal winds by applying linear stability analysis to a developing protodune
field. Employing recent theoretical and experimental research, combined with
in-situ wind, sediment transport, and topographic measurements during a month
long field campaign at Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado, USA, we use a
development of the linear stability theory to predict the spatial
characteristics (orientation and wavelength) and temporal evolution (growth
rate and migration velocity) of a protodune field. We find that the theoretical
predictions compare well with measured dunefield attributes as characterized by
high-resolution Digital Elevation Models measured using repeat terres trial
laser scanning. Our findings suggest that linear stability theory is a
quantitative predictor of protodune development on sandy surfaces with a
bimodal wind regime. Our findings are significant as they offer critical
validation of the linear stability theory for explaining the initiation and
development of dunes towards maturity in a complex natural environment.

extend the recently introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) with a novelty scoring

what degree a text matches the classes covered by the training data. We
demonstrate that the clauses provide a succinct interpretable description of
known topics, and that our scoring mechanism makes it possible to discern novel
topics from the known ones. Empirically, our TM-based approach outperforms
seven other novelty detection schemes on three out of five datasets, and
performs second and third best on the remaining, with the added benefit of an

symmetry breaking/restoration one. Depending on the model parameters, we find
that the GW spectra may fall within the sensibility region of ground-based and
space-based interferometers, as well as of Pulsar Timing Arrays. In the latter
case, the signal could be compatible with the recent potential observation by
NANOGrav. When the two phase transitions happen at different critical
temperatures, characteristic spectra with double frequency peaks show up.

and has a much more modest active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity than the
other examples. Using recent CO(1-0) observations with the NOrthern Extended
Millimeter Array (NOEMA), we characterised the molecular gas content of the
host galaxy for the first time. We found that the molecular gas is distributed
into an apparent central disc of 1.1x10^9 Msun, and a northern extension
located up to 8 kpc from the centre with a molecular gas mass M_H2~10^8 Msun.
The molecular gas mass and the CO dynamics in the northern extension reveal
that IRAS 17020+4544 is not a standard spiral galaxy, instead it is interacting
with a dwarf object corresponding to the northern extension. This interaction
possibly triggers the high accretion rate onto the super massive black hole.
Within the main galaxy, which hosts the AGN, a simple analytical model predicts
that the molecular gas may lie in a ring, with less molecular gas in the
nuclear region. Such distribution may be the result of the AGN activity which
removes or photodissociates the molecular gas in the nuclear region (AGN
feedback). Finally, we have detected a molecular outflow of mass
M_H2=(0.7-1.2)x10^7 Msun in projection at the location of the northern galaxy,
with a similar velocity to that of the massive outflow reported in previous
millimeter data obtained by the Large Millimeter Telescope.

Circuits (PQCs). Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quantum Neural Networks and
Variational Quantum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum
advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Recent
works have focused on quantum-aware optimizers specifically tailored for PQCs.
However, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such
optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs: (1) We
find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large
degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast
as an exponential reduction in the volume of relevant hyperparameter space. (2)
We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it
is conserved under unital noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries
and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based
on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based
Minima Hopping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our
numerical simulations show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance
in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware.
Overall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate
transformations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method.

Law of Thermodynamics. Thermodynamic consistency is restored as they dissipate
heat, thereby increasing the net entropy of their environment. Recently
introduced estimators for the entropy production rate have provided major
insights into the thermal efficiency of important cellular processes. In
experiments, however, many degrees of freedom typically remain hidden to the
observer, and in these cases, existing methods are not optimal. Here, by
reformulating the problem within an optimization framework, we are able to
infer improved bounds on the rate of entropy production from partial
measurements of biological systems. Our approach yields provably optimal
estimates given certain measurable transition statistics. In particular, it can
reveal non-zero heat production rates even when non-equilibrium processes
appear time symmetric and so may pretend to obey detailed balance. We
demonstrate the broad applicability of this framework by providing improved
bounds on the entropy production rate in a diverse range of biological systems
including bacterial flagella motors, growing microtubules, and calcium
oscillations within human embryonic kidney cells.

consider the scenario where an AI system may need to operate at

requirements. We propose a simple function that divides the cost of using an AI
system into the cost of the decision making process and the cost of decision
execution. For simple binary decision problems with convolutional neural
networks, it is shown that minimizing the cost corresponds to using fewer than
the maximum number of resources (e.g. convolutional neural network layers and

significantly reduced by leveraging high-confidence predictions made in

information has spread with it. Deemed an infodemic by the World Health
Organization, and described as an overabundance of information, some accurate,
some not, that occurs during an epidemic, this proliferation of data, research
and opinions provides both opportunities and challenges for academics.
Academics and scientists have a key role to play in the solutions to the
infodemic challenge: as educators, influences and communicators, even where
their expertise and experience does not align precisely with the SARS-Cov2
virus and its impacts.
  Successful communication requires a better understanding of how the public
seeks, understands and processes scientific information, however, in order to
maximise the ways in which experts engage with traditional and social media and
to make sure that such engagement does not add to confusion and misinformation
alongside efforts to counter or challenge it. This paper will outline the key
advantages to be had from greater engagement with COVID19 discussions, the
popular channels through which such discussions take place and through which
information is disseminated. It also warns against the common pitfalls those
who choose to engage might encounter, whilst stressing that the disadvantages
of doing so are far outweighed by the advantages such engagement offers.

by phenomena occurring in epidemiology (spread of infectious diseases) or
social dynamics (spread of opinions, behaviors, ideas), and described by a

naive (susceptible) person can either become promoter himself or become
$\textit{weakened}$, hence more vulnerable. Weakened individuals become
contagious when they experience a second contact with members of the promoter
group. After a certain time in the contagious compartment, individuals become
inactive (are insusceptible and cannot spread) and are removed from the chain
of transmission. We combine this two-stage contagion process with renewal of
the naive population, modeled by means of transitions from the weakened or the
inactive status to the susceptible compartment. This leads to rich dynamics,
showing for instance coexistence and bistability of equilibria and periodic
orbits. Properties of (nontrivial) equilibria are studied analytically. In
addition, a numerical investigation of the parameter space reveals numerous
bifurcations, showing that the dynamics of such a system can be more complex

Perceptron, where a weight vector used to classify examples is maintained, and

$\frac{1}{\gamma^2}$. What has never been fully addressed is: does there exist
an algorithm that can achieve this with fewer updates? In this paper we answer

high sensitivity, angular resolution, and large area of the LOFAR Deep Fields,
which probes an unprecedented dynamic range of luminosity and volume. We
cross-match Herschel sources and LOFAR sources in Bootes (8.63 deg^2), Lockman
Hole (10.28 deg^2), and ELAIS-N1 (6.74 deg^2) with rms sensitivities of around
32, 22, and 20 mJy per beam, respectively. We divide the matched samples into
unique and multiple categories. For the multiple matches, we de-blend the
Herschel fluxes using the LOFAR positions and the 150-MHz flux densities as
priors. We perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, combined with
multi-wavelength counterpart identifications and photometric redshift
estimates, to derive IR luminosities. The depth of the LOFAR data allows us to
identify highly complete (around 92% completeness) samples of bright Herschel
sources with a simple selection based on the 250 micron flux density (45, 40,
and 35 mJy in Bootes, Lockman Hole, and ELAIS-N1, respectively). Most of the
bright Herschel sources fall into the unique category (i.e. a single LOFAR
counterpart). For the multiple matches, there is excellent correspondence
between the radio emission and the far-IR emission. We find a good agreement in
the IR LFs with a previous study out to z around 6 which used de-blended
Herschel data. Our sample gives the strongest and cleanest indication to date
that the population of HLIRGs has surface densities of around 5 to 18 / deg^2
(with variations due to a combination of the applied flux limit and cosmic
variance) and an uncertainty of a factor of 2. In comparison, the GALFORM
semi-analytic model significantly under-predicts the abundance of HLIRGs.

  fractured porous media satisfying discrete maximum principle and conservation
  properties",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Numerical simulations of flow and transport in porous media usually rely on
hybrid-dimensional models, i.e., the fracture is considered as objects of a
lower dimension compared to the embedding matrix. Such models are usually
combined with non-conforming discretizations as they avoid the inherent
difficulties associated with the generation of meshes that explicitly resolve
fractures-matrix interfaces. However, non-conforming discretizations demand a
more complicated coupling of different sub-models and may require special care
to ensure conservative fluxes. We propose a novel approach for the simulation
of flow and transport problems in fractured porous media based on an
equi-dimensional representation of the fractures. The major challenge for these
types of representation is the creation of meshes which resolve the several
complex interfaces between the fractures and the embedding matrix. To overcome
this difficulty, we employ a strategy based on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
The idea at the base of the proposed AMR is to start from an initially uniform
coarse mesh and refine the elements which have non-empty overlaps with at least
one of the fractures. Iterating this process allows to create non-uniform
non-conforming meshes, which do not resolve the interfaces but can approximate
them with arbitrary accuracy. We demonstrate that low-order finite element (FE)
discretizations on adapted meshes are globally and locally conservative and we
suitably adapt an algebraic flux correction technique to ensure the discrete
maximum principle. In particular, we show that the notorious conditions on
M-matrices have to be adapted to the basis functions defined on non-conforming
meshes. Although the proposed applications come from geophysical applications,
the obtained results could be applied to any diffusion and transport problems,
on both conforming and non-conforming meshes.

mechanism driving the reaction. As oxygen accumulated on the catalyst, a
transition in the mechanism was clearly defined in the machine learning

a longitudinal study of the character of superconducting vortices within s-wave

a function of solute size and applied voltage. Based on this model we are able
to predict the free energy cost of cavity formation at the interface directly
from the free energy cost in the bulk plus an interface-dependent correction
term. The interfacial water network contributes significantly to the free
energy yielding a preference for outer-sphere adsorption at the gold surface
for ideal hydrophobes. We predict an accumulation of small hydrophobic solutes
of sizes comparable to CO or N$_2$, while the free energy cost to hydrate
larger hydrophobes, above 2.5 Angstrom radius, is shown to be greater at the
interface than in the bulk. Interestingly, the transition from the volume
dominated to the surface dominated regimes predicted by the LCW theory in the

which the whole northern radio sky will be observed at 150 MHz with a

Additionally, deeper observations are planned to cover smaller areas with
higher sensitivity. The Lockman Hole, the Bo\""otes and the Elais-N1 regions are
among the most well known northern extra-galactic fields, and the deepest of
the LoTSS Deep Fields so far. We exploit these deep observations to derive the
deepest radio source counts at 150~MHz to date. Our counts are in broad
agreement with those from the literature, and show the well known upturn at
$\leq$ few mJy, mainly associated with the emergence of the star-forming galaxy
population. More interestingly, our counts show for the first time a very
pronounced drop around S$\sim$2 mJy, which results in a prominent `bump' at
sub-mJy flux densities. Such a feature was not observed in previous counts'
determinations (neither at 150 MHz nor at higher frequency). While sample
variance can play a role in explaining the observed discrepancies, we believe
this is mostly the result of a careful analysis aimed at deblending confused
sources and removing spurious sources and artifacts from the radio catalogues.
This `drop and bump' feature cannot be reproduced by any of the existing

novel conceptual framework that organizes context for clinical events into
various orthogonal dimensions. In this process, we define specific contextual

report the results of preliminary experiments. CMED consists of 9,013

proposed to estimate various parameters characterizing complex systems such as
the environments of quantum systems. These probes, prepared in some initial
state, are allowed to interact with their environment, and subsequent
measurements reveal information about different quantities characterizing the
environment such as the system-environment coupling strength, the cutoff
frequency, and the temperature. These estimates have generally been made by
considering only the way that the probe undergoes decoherence. However, we show
that information about the environment is also imprinted on the probe via the
probe and environment correlations that exist before the probe state
preparation. This information can then be used to improve our estimates for any
environment. We apply this general result to the particular case of a two-level
system probe undergoing pure dephasing, due to a harmonic oscillator
environment, to show that a drastic increase in the quantum Fisher information,
and hence the precision of our estimates, can indeed be obtained. We also
consider applying periodic control pulses to the probe to show that with a
combination of the two - the effect of the control pulses as well as the
initial correlations - the quantum Fisher information can be increased by
orders of magnitude.

each other, a quantum jump takes place upon particle collision, which erases
their distinguishability and projects the two-particle state onto an

times can be estimated quasi-classically using the Wigner functions of the
particles' wavepackets, or derived from fully quantum mechanical considerations
using an appropriately adapted time-of-arrival operator. Moreover, the state
symmetrization can be formally regarded as a consequence of the spontaneous
measurement of the collision time. We show that symmetric measurements
performed on identical particles can in principle discriminate between the
product and symmetrized states. Our model and its conclusions can be tested

effects for halos covering six decades in mass: $10^{8}-10^{14}{h^{-1}{\rm
M}_{\odot}}$. We find that the fraction of halos living in various web
components is a strong function of mass, with the majority of
$M>10^{12}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ halos living in filaments and nodes. Low
mass halos are more equitably distributed in filaments, walls, and voids. For
halo density profiles and formation times we find a universal mass threshold of
$M_{th}\sim6\times10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ below which these properties
vary with environment. Here, filament halos have the steepest
concentration-mass relation, walls are close to the overall mean, and void
halos have the flattest relation. This amounts to $c_{200}$ for filament and
void halos that are respectively $14\%$ higher and $7\%$ lower than the mean at
$M=2\times10^8{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$, with low-mass node halos being most
likely splashed-back. We find double power-law fits that very well describe
$c(M)$ for the four environments in the whole probed mass range. A
complementary picture is found for the average formation times, with the
mass-formation time relations following trends shown for the concentrations:
the nodes halos being the oldest and void halo the youngest. The CW
environmental effect is much weaker when studying the halo spin and shapes. The
trends with halo mass is reversed: the small halos with $M<10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm

visible for more massive void and walls halos, which, on average, are
characterized by lower spin and higher triaxiality parameters.

large-scale structure, which distorts observations of the primordial
anisotropies in any given direction. Averaged over the sky, this important
effect is routinely modelled with the lensed CMB power spectra. This accounts
for the variance of this distortion, where the leading variance effect is
quadratic in the lensing deflections. However, we show that if bright
extragalactic sources correlated with the large-scale structure are masked in a
CMB map, the power spectrum measured over the unmasked area using a standard
pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimator has an additional~\emph{linear} lensing effect
arising from correlations between the masked area and the lensing. This induces
a scale-dependent average demagnification of the unlensed distance between
unmasked pairs of observed points and a negative contribution to the CMB
correlation function peaking at $\sim 10\,\arcmin$. We give simple analytic
models for point sources and a threshold mask constructed on a correlated
Gaussian foreground field. We demonstrate the consistency of their predictions
for masks removing radio sources and peaks of Sunyaev-Zeldovich and cosmic
infrared background emissions using realistic numerical simulations. We discuss
simple diagnostics that can be used to test for the effect in the absence of a
good model for the masked sources and show that by constructing specific masks
the effect can be observed on Planck data. For masks employed in the analysis
of Planck and other current data sets, the effect is likely to be negligible,
but may become an important subpercent correction for future surveys if
substantial populations of resolved sources are masked.

galaxy clusters and groups is a challenge for particle acceleration processes.
In this work, we analyse the Coma radio bridge using new LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) observations at 144 MHz. LOFAR detects the bridge and its substructures
with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. We find that the radio emission
peaks on the NGC 4839 group. Towards the halo, in front of the NGC 4839 group,
the radio brightness decreases and streams of radio emission connect the NGC
4839 group to the radio relic. Using X-ray observations, we find that thermal
and non-thermal plasma are moderately correlated with a sub-linear scaling. We
use archival radio data at 326 MHz to constrain the spectral index in the
bridge, and quantify the distribution of particles and magnetic field at
different frequencies. We find that the spectrum is steeper than $-1.4 \pm
0.2$, and that the emission could be clumpier at 326 MHz than at 144 MHz. Using
cosmological simulations and a simplified approach to compute particle
acceleration, we derive under which conditions turbulent acceleration of mildly
relativistic electrons could generate the radio emission in the bridge.
Assuming that the initial energy ratio of the seed electrons is $3 \cdot
10^{-4}$ with respect to the thermal gas, we are able to reproduce the observed
luminosity. Our results suggest that the seed electrons released by
radiogalaxies in the bridge and the turbulence generated by the motion of gas
and galaxies are essential to produce the radio emission.

Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z=7.0281\pm0.0003$, observed as part of the
Reionization Cluster Lensing Survey (RELICS). This galaxy, dubbed ""Dichromatic
Primeval Galaxy"" at $z\sim7$ (DP7), shows two distinct components. While fairly
unremarkable in terms of its ultraviolet (UV) luminosity
($\sim0.3L^{\ast}_{UV}$, where $L^{\ast}_{UV}$ is the characteristic
luminosity), DP7 has one of the highest observed Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent
widths (EWs) among Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters at $z>6$ ($>200$ Angstrom in the
rest frame). The strong Lyman-$\alpha$ emission generally suggests a young
metal-poor, low-dust galaxy; however, we find that the UV slope $\beta$ of the
galaxy as a whole is redder than typical star-forming galaxies at these
redshifts, $-1.13\pm 0.84$, likely indicating, on average, a considerable
amount of dust obscuration, or an older stellar population. When we measure
$\beta$ for the two components separately, however, we find evidence of
differing UV colors, suggesting two separate stellar populations. Also, we find
that Lyman-$\alpha$ is spatially extended and likely larger than the galaxy
size, hinting to the possible existence of a Lyman-$\alpha$ halo. Rejuvenation
or merging events could explain these results. Either scenario requires an
extreme stellar population, possibly including a component of Population III
stars, or an obscured Active Galactic Nucleus. DP7, with its low UV luminosity
and high Lyman-$\alpha$ EW, represents the typical galaxies that are thought to
be the major contribution to the reionization of the Universe, and for this
reason DP7 is an excellent target for follow-up with the James Webb Space
Telescope.

the standard, analytical halo-model power spectrum calculation. This results in
a corrective term that is added to the usual two-halo term. We measure this
correction using data from $N$-body simulations and demonstrate that it can
boost power in the two-halo term by a factor of $\sim2$ at scales $k\sim0.7\,h
Mpc^{-1}$, with the exact magnitude of the boost determined by the specific
pair of fields in the two-point function. How this translates to the full power
spectrum depends on the relative strength of the one-halo term, which can mask
the importance of this correction to a greater or lesser degree, again
depending on the fields. Generally we find that our correction is more
important for signals that arise from lower-mass haloes. When comparing our
calculation to simulated data we find that the under-prediction of power in the
transition region between the two- and one-halo terms, which typically plagues
halo-model calculations, is almost completely eliminated when including the
full non-linear halo bias. We show improved results for the auto and cross
spectra of galaxies, haloes and matter. In the specific case of matter-matter
or matter-halo power we note that a large fraction of the improvement comes
from the non-linear biasing between low- and high-mass haloes. We envisage our
model being useful in the analytical modelling of cross correlation signals.

turn, is the product over all events P of the density, $\rho(P)$, of
microscopic configurations associated with each event P. One would have
expected $\rho\propto\sqrt{g}$ so that $\rho d^4x$ scales as the proper volume

show how these two apparently contradictory requirements can be reconciled by
using the functional dependence of $\sqrt{g}$ on curvature, in the Riemann
normal coordinates (RNC), and coarse-graining over Planck scales. This leads to
the density of microscopic configurations to be $\rho = \Delta^{-1} =
\sqrt{g}_{RNC}$ where $\Delta$ is the coarse grained Van-Vleck determinant. The

random forest (RF) algorithm in selecting optically variable AGN candidates,
investigating how the use of different AGN labeled sets (LSs) and features sets
affects this performance. We define a heterogeneous AGN LS and choose a set of
variability features and optical and near-infrared colors based on what can be
extracted from LSST data. We find that an AGN LS that includes only Type I
sources allows for the selection of a highly pure (91%) sample of AGN
candidates, obtaining a completeness with respect to spectroscopically
confirmed AGN of 69% (vs. 59% in our previous work). The addition of colors to
variability features mildly improves the performance of the RF classifier,
while colors alone prove less effective than variability in selecting AGN as
they return contaminated samples of candidates and fail to identify most
host-dominated AGN. We observe that a bright (r < 21 mag) AGN LS is able to
retrieve candidate samples not affected by the magnitude cut, which is of great
importance as faint AGN LSs for LSST-related studies will be hard to find and
likely imbalanced. We estimate a sky density of 6.2 million AGN for the LSST

most recent Galactic plane crossings and the corresponding flight times. All 12

associated with LIGO/Virgo candidate BHNS GW events to sharpen parameter
estimation, we study the impact of neutron star spin in BHNS mergers. Using
dynamical spacetime magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNSs initially on a
quasicircular orbit, we survey configurations that differ in the BH spin
($a_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm BH}=0$ and $0.75$), the NS spin ($a_{\rm NS}/M_{\rm

the NS prograde spin increases both the rest mass of the accretion disk onto
the remnant black hole, and the rest mass of dynamically ejected matter. By a
time~$\Delta t\sim 3500-5500M\sim 88-138(M_{\rm NS}/1.4M_\odot)\,\rm ms$ after

underlying dark matter (DM) substructure, which is sensitive to the nature of
the DM particle. In particular, a class of DM models have a power spectrum
cut-off on the mass scale of dwarf galaxies and thus predict only small numbers
of substructures below the cut-off mass. This makes the MW satellite system
appealing to constrain the DM properties: feasible models must produce enough
substructure to host the number of observed Galactic satellites. Here, we
compare theoretical predictions of the abundance of DM substructure in thermal
relic warm DM (WDM) models with estimates of the total satellite population of
the MW. This produces conservative robust lower limits on the allowed mass,
$m_\mathrm{th}$, of the thermal relic WDM particle. As the abundance of
satellite galaxies depends on the MW halo mass, we marginalize over the
corresponding uncertainties and rule out $m_\mathrm{th} \leq 2.02\,
\mathrm{keV}$ at 95 per cent confidence independently of assumptions about
galaxy formation processes. Modelling some of these - in particular, the effect
of reionization, which suppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies - strengthens
our constraints on the DM properties and excludes models with $m_\mathrm{th}
\leq 3.99\, \mathrm{keV}$ in our fiducial model. We also find that thermal
relic models cannot produce enough satellites if the MW halo mass is
$M_{200}\leq 0.6\times 10^{12}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, which imposes a lower limit
on the MW halo mass in CDM. We address several observational and theoretical
uncertainties and discuss how improvements in these will strengthen the DM mass
constraints.

hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation from the Simba-hires (25 h$^{-1}$

LADUMA will be successful in detecting weak redshift evolution of the BTFR,

pronounced redshift evolution compared to $W_{\rm 50}$. We also compare these

rotational velocity and the dark matter halo mass, and provide fits for
estimating a galaxy's dark matter halo mass from HI spectral line widths. This
study with Simba showcases the importance of upcoming, deep SKA pathfinder

over 2 more years than in DR1. The southern photometric zeropoints in $griz$
are more accurate by using the Skymapper DR1 and ATLAS-Ref2 catalogs, and
improved extinction corrections were used for high-extinction regions. In
addition, the astrometric accuracy is improved by taking advantage of Gaia DR2
proper motions when calibrating the WCS of individual images. This improves the
NSC proper motions to $\sim$2.5 mas/yr (precision) and $\sim$0.2 mas/yr
(accuracy). The combination of sources into unique objects is performed using a
DBSCAN algorithm and mean parameters per object (such as mean magnitudes,
proper motion, etc.) are calculated more robustly with outlier rejection.
Finally, eight multi-band photometric variability indices are calculated for
each object and variable objects are flagged (23 million objects). NSC DR2 will
be useful for exploring solar system objects, stellar streams, dwarf satellite
galaxies, QSOs, variable stars, high-proper motion stars, and transients.
Several examples of these science use cases are presented. The NSC DR2 catalog
is publicly available via the NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab science platform.

its distribution and contribution in emission allows us to properly study both
its ionization and star formation in galaxies. Here, we measure for the first
time the DIG emission in 38 gas-stripped galaxies in local clusters drawn from
the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE survey (GASP). These galaxies
are at different stages of stripping. We also compare the DIG properties to
those of 33 normal galaxies from the same survey. To estimate the DIG fraction
(C$_{DIG}$) and derive its maps, we combine attenuation corrected H$\alpha$
surface brightness with $\rm [SII]/H\alpha$ line ratio. Our results indicate
that we cannot use neither a single H$\alpha$ or $\rm [SII]/H\alpha$ value, nor
a threshold in equivalent width of H$\alpha$ emission line to separate spaxels
dominated by DIG and non-DIG emission. Assuming a constant surface brightness
of the DIG across galaxies underestimates C$_{DIG}$. Contrasting stripped and
non-stripped galaxies, we find no clear differences in C$_{DIG}$. The DIG
emission contributes between 20\% and 90\% of the total integrated flux, and
does not correlate with the galactic stellar mass and star-formation rate
(SFR). The C$_{DIG}$ anti-correlates with the specific SFR, which may indicate
an older ($>10^8$ yr) stellar population as ionizing source of the DIG. The DIG
fraction shows anti-correlations with the SFR surface density, which could be
used for a robust estimation of integrated C$_{DIG}$ in galaxies.

was discovered via monitoring with $Swift$ during 2019-20, and to date has
exhibited a peak luminosity of $L_{\rm{X}} \sim 6 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Archival searches show that, prior to its recent transition into the ULX
regime, ULX3 appeared to exhibit a fairly stable luminosity of $L_{\rm{X}} \sim
10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Such strong long-timescale variability may be
reminiscent of the small population of known ULX pulsars, although deep
follow-up observations with $XMM$-$Newton$ and $NuSTAR$ do not reveal any
robust X-ray pulsation signals. Pulsations similar to those seen from known ULX
pulsars cannot be completely excluded, however, as the limit on the pulsed
fraction of any signal that remains undetected in these data is $\lesssim$20\%.
The broadband spectrum from these observations is well modelled with a simple
thin disc model, consistent with sub-Eddington accretion, which may instead
imply a moderately large black hole accretor ($M_{\rm{BH}} \sim 40 ~
M_{\odot}$). Similarly, though, more complex models consistent with the
super-Eddington spectra seen in other ULXs (and the known ULX pulsars) cannot
be excluded given the limited signal-to-noise of the available broadband data.
The nature of the accretor powering this new ULX therefore remains uncertain.

that Oph 98 AB forms a binary system. From our multi-band photometry, we
constrain the primary to be an M9-L1 dwarf, and the faint companion to have an
L2-L6 spectral type. For a median age of 3 Myr for Ophiuchus, fits of

the lowest binding energy system imaged to date, indicating that the outcome of
low-mass star formation can result in such extreme, weakly-bound systems. With

quasi-simultaneous, multiband ($\sim1-18$ GHz) follow-up study of 14 sources

with peaked radio spectral shapes. The high-amplitude variability over decadal
timescales at 1.5 GHz (100% to $>$2500%), but roughly steady fluxes over a few
months at 3 GHz, are inconsistent with extrinsic variability due to propagation
effects, thus favoring an intrinsic origin. We conclude that our sources are
powerful quasars hosting compact/young jets. This challenges the generally
accepted idea that ""radio-loudness"" is a property of the quasar/AGN population
that remains fixed on human timescales. Our study suggests that frequent
episodes of short-lived AGN jets that do not necessarily grow to large scales

triggered a lot of interest also as hosts to massive stars and hence their
neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) remnants. Migration traps and gas torques
in these disks favor binary formation and enhance the rate of compact object
mergers. In these environments both long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the death
of massive stars and short GRBs from NS-NS and NS-BH mergers are expected.
However, their properties in the unique environments of AGN disks have never
been studied. Here we show that GRBs in AGNs can display unique features, owing
to the unusual relative position of the shocks that characterize the burst
evolution and the Thomson photosphere of the AGN disk. In dense environments,
for example, the external shock develops before the internal shocks, leading to
prompt emission powered by a relativistic reverse shock. The transient's time
evolution is also compressed, yielding afterglow emission that is much brighter
and peaks much earlier than for GRBs in the interstellar medium. Additionally,
in regions of the disk that are sufficiently dense and extended, the light
curves are dominated by diffusion, since the fireball is trapped inside the
disc photosphere. These diffusion-dominated transients emerge on timescales of
days in disks around SMBHs of $\sim 10^6 M_\odot$ to years for SMBHs of $\sim
10^8 M_\odot$. Finally, a large fraction of events, especially in AGNs with
SMBHs $\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$, display time-variable absorption in the X-ray

sub-class of interactions that are renormalizable) marginalizes the its impact
when the coupling is formally small, we argue that a non-perturbative and
non-ambiguous renormalization cannot be built if there is any reference to the

(MHD) effects (Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion) that are treated
together for their influence on the properties of gravitational instability for
a rotating sheet-like cloud or disk. Our results show that there is always a
preferred length scale and associated minimum timescale for gravitational
instability. We investigate their dependence on important dimensionless free
parameters of the problem: the initial normalized mass-to-flux ratio $\mu_0$,
the rotational Toomre parameter $Q$, the dimensionless Ohmic diffusivity
$\tilde{\eta}_{\rm OD,0}$, and the dimensionless neutral-ion collision time
$\tilde{\tau}_{\rm{ni,0}}$ that is a measure of the ambipolar diffusivity. One
consequence of $\tilde{\eta}_{\rm OD,0}$ is that there is a maximum preferred
lengthscale of instability that occurs in the transcritical ($\mu_0 \gtrsim 1$)
regime, qualitatively similar to the effect of $\tilde{\tau}_{\rm{ni,0}}$, but
with quantitative differences. The addition of rotation leads to a generalized
Toomre criterion (that includes a magnetic dependence) and modified
lengthscales and timescales for collapse. When nonideal MHD effects are also
included, the Toomre criterion reverts back to the hydrodynamic value. We apply
our results to protostellar disk properties in the early embedded phase and
find that the preferred scale of instability can significantly exceed the

Our method is based on the attention mechanism with a learnable query for each
group. The query is fully trainable and can capture group-specific information
when combined with the diversity loss. An appealing property of our method is
that it naturally lends itself interpretability. The attention scores between
the learnable query and each spatial position can be interpreted as the
importance of that position. We formally show that our proposed grouping method
is invariant to spatial permutations of features. When used as a module in
convolutional neural networks, our method leads to translational invariance. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our quantitative
results indicate that the proposed method outperforms prior methods
consistently and significantly across different datasets, evaluation metrics,
base models, and loss functions. For the first time to the best of our

of their evolution. Modelling the angular momentum and chemical elements
transport occurring during these phases remains an unsolved problem.
  Aims. We study a stellar radiative zone undergoing radial contraction and
investigate the induced differential rotation and meridional circulation.
  Methods. We consider a rotating spherical layer crossed by an imposed radial
velocity field that mimics the contraction and solve numerically the
axisymmetric hydrodynamical equations in both the Boussinesq and anelastic
approximations. An extensive parametric study is conducted to cover regimes of
contraction, rotation, stable stratification and density stratification that
are relevant for stars.
  Results. The differential rotation and the meridional circulation result from
a competition between the contraction-driven inward transport of angular
momentum and an outward transport dominated by either viscosity or an
Eddington-Sweet type circulation, depending on the value of the $P_r \left( N_0
/ \Omega_0 \right)^2 $ parameter, where $P_r$ is the Prandtl number, $N_0$ the
Brunt-V\""ais\""ail\""a frequency and $\Omega_0$ the rotation rate. Taking the
density stratification into account is important to study more realistic radial

Additionally, both SSE signals show a tendency to saturate at low temperatures.
The nonlocal SSE signal decays exponentially for intermediate injector-detector

planet structure and composition. Relative proportions of iron core, rocky
mantle, and gaseous envelopes are degenerate for a given density. This
degeneracy is reduced for rocky planets without significant gaseous envelopes
when the structure is assumed to be a differentiated iron core and rocky
mantle, in which the core mass fraction (CMF) is a first-order description of a
planet's bulk composition. A rocky planet's CMF may be derived both from bulk
density and by assuming the planet reflects the host star's major rock-building
elemental abundances (Fe, Mg, and Si). Contrasting CMF measures, therefore,
shed light on the outcome diversity of planet formation from processes
including mantle stripping, out-gassing, and/or late-stage volatile delivery.
We present a statistically rigorous analysis of the consistency of these two
CMF measures accounting for observational uncertainties of planet mass and
radius and host-star chemical abundances. We find that these two measures are
unlikely to be resolvable as statistically different unless the bulk density
CMF is at least 40% greater than or 50% less than the CMF as inferred from the
host star. Applied to 11 probable rocky exoplanets, Kepler-107c has a CMF as
inferred from bulk density that is significantly greater than the inferred CMF
from its host star (2$\sigma$) and is therefore likely an iron-enriched
super-Mercury. K2-229b, previously described as a super-Mercury, however, does

Whilst major success has been reported using supervised techniques, they assume
a large and well-representative labelled set. This is a strong assumption in
the medical domain where annotations are expensive, time-consuming, and
inherent to human bias. To address this problem, unsupervised techniques have
been proposed in the literature yet it is still an open problem due to the

segmentation. Secondly, we embed a contrastive learning mechanism into the
registration architecture to enhance the discriminating capacity of the network

  sizes","12 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The persistent motion of bacteria produces clusters with a stationary cluster
size distribution (CSD). Here we develop a minimal model for bacteria in a
narrow channel to assess the relative importance of motility diversity (i.e.
polydispersity in motility parameters) and confinement. A mixture of
run-and-tumble particles with a distribution of tumbling rates (denoted
generically by $\alpha$) is considered on a 1D lattice. Particles facing each
other cross at constant rate, rendering the lattice quasi-1D. To isolate the
role of diversity, the global average $\alpha$ stays fixed. For a binary
mixture with no particle crossing, the average cluster size ($L_\text{c}$)
increases with the diversity as lower-$\alpha$ particles trap higher-$\alpha$
ones for longer. At finite crossing rate, particles escape from the clusters
sooner, making $L_\text{c}$ smaller and the diversity less important, even
though crossing can enhance demixing of particle types between the cluster and
gas phases. If the crossing rate is increased further, the clusters become
controlled by particle crossing. We also consider an experiment-based
continuous distribution of tumbling rates, revealing similar physics. Using
parameters fitted from experiments with Escherichia coli bacteria, we predict
that the error in estimating $L_\text{c}$ without accounting for polydispersity
is around $60\%$. We discuss how to find a binary system with the same CSD as
the fully polydisperse mixture. An effective theory is developed and shown to
give accurate expressions for the CSD, the effective $\alpha$, and the average
fraction of mobile particles. We give reasons why our qualitative results are
expected to be valid for other active matter models and discuss the changes
that would result from polydispersity in the active speed rather than in the
tumbling rate.

similarity expansions locally applicable to the leading and trailing edges of

maintained rather than resorting to point vortex discretizations. Beyond this,
there are two theoretical novelties to our approach as compared to previous
studies. First, an expansion is applied to the attached outer flow rather than
the vortex sheet circulations and positions. This allows the asymmetric effect
of the sweeping component of the free-stream flow parallel to the plate to be
built-in to the same governing equation as the singular-order flow. Second, we
develop a time-dependent self similarity procedure that allows the modeling of
more complex evolution of the flow structures. This is accomplished through an
implicit time variation of the similarity variables. As a collective result,
the predicted vortex dynamics and forces on the plate compare favorably to
Navier-Stokes simulations. Lastly, the model is utilized to provide some new

computation. In particular, the state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g.,

idea from software engineering, in order to address these limitations, we
propose a novel algorithm, SHIELD, which modifies and re-trains only the last
layer of a textual NN, and thus it ""patches"" and ""transforms"" the NN into a
stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads. Considering that
most of current black-box attacks rely on iterative search mechanisms to
optimize their adversarial perturbations, SHIELD confuses the attackers by
automatically utilizing different weighted ensembles of predictors depending on
the input. In other words, SHIELD breaks a fundamental assumption of the
attack, which is a victim NN model remains constant during an attack. By
conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN,
BERT, and RoBERTa-based textual NNs, once patched by SHIELD, exhibit a relative
enhancement of 15%--70% in accuracy on average against 14 different black-box

present work is to answer the question how the surface preparation influences
the oxidation behavior of Fe-based alloys. To answer this question, a high
purity model alloy, Fe 5 wt Al, was isothermally oxidized in a
thermogravimetrical furnace. The post-exposure analysis included SEM/EDS (WDS)

protective Al2O3. In contrast, gritblasting leads to the formation of a thick
outer Fe-oxide and internal aluminum nitridation. A significant increase in the
oxidation rate of the material after gritblasting was attributed to grain
refinement in the near-surface region, resulting in an increase in easy

known as Waleffe flow) and plane Couette flow in small periodic domains. A
first derivation for Waleffe flow exploits Fourier modes that form a natural
orthonormal basis for the problem. A ROM for such basis is obtained by a
Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equation. A large basis was reduced to
12 modes that contribute significantly in maintaining chaotic, turbulent
dynamics. A key difference from earlier ROMs is the inclusion of two
roll-streak structures, with spanwise wavelengths equal to $L_z$ and $L_z/2$,
where $L_z$ is the spanwise length of the computational box. The resulting
system was adapted to Couette flow by rewriting the Galerkin system for the
same 12 modes, modified so as to satisfy no-slip conditions on the walls. The
resulting dynamical systems lead to turbulence with finite lifetimes, in
agreement with earlier ROMs and simulations in small domains. However, the
present models display lifetimes that are much longer than in earlier ROMs,
with differences of more than an order of magnitude. The Couette-flow model is
compared to results of direct numerical simulation (DNS), with statistics
displaying fair agreement. The inclusion of the $L_z$ and $L_z/2$ lengthscales
is seen to be a key feature for longer turbulence lifetimes: neglecting any of
the roll modes, or their non-linear interaction, leads to drastic reductions of
turbulence lifetimes. The present ROMs thus highlight some of the dominant
nonlinear interactions that are relevant in maintaining turbulence for long
lifetimes.

performance of the monolithic material is then seen to arise from the combined
properties of these much simpler regions. It is the nearsightedness of
electronic matter (NEM) principle that provides the rigorous justification for
this ""divide and conquer"" approach. NEM asserts that a material property may be
significantly affected by a perturbation, no matter how large, only over a
neighborhood of size $R$. Though NEM posits the existence of meaningful atomic
scale neighborhoods, for the most part these regions are identified
empirically. In this paper we propose a methodology to divide real materials
into meaningful neighborhoods determined by the topology of the charge density.
We generalize this approach by applying the same to determine neighborhoods
representative of elemental crystalline materials and then use these
neighborhoods to model the embrittling effects of bismuth atoms segregated to
copper grain boundaries. We show that embrittlement is the result of impurity
atom-induced enhancements of copper nearsightedness. We further suggest that
just as nearsightedness plays an overlooked role mediating embrittlement, it
may also be an important factor affecting a broad range of unresolved problems
as apparently diverse as energy focussing phenomena and enzyme kinetics.

low-temperature variations in the standard resistance plateau arises from a
surface or a bulk channel in floating zone samples. The results show
significant sample-dependent residual bulk conduction, in contrast to smaller
amounts of residual bulk conduction previously observed in Al flux grown
samples with Sm vacancies. We consider hopping in an activated impurity band as
a possible source for the observed bulk conduction, but it is unlikely that the
large residual bulk conduction seen in floating zone samples is solely due to
Sm vacancies. We therefore propose that one-dimensional defects, or
dislocations, contribute as well. Using chemical etching, we find evidence for

quantum computer. It relies on forming Majorana fermions using circular
electronic gates in two-dimensional p-wave superconductors. The gates allow the
precise control of the number, position, and dynamics of Majorana fermions.
Using an array of such gates, one can implement the full features of
topological quantum computation, including the braiding and fusion of Majoranas
in space-time. The gates serve two purposes: They modulate the chemical
potential locally to turn a topological superconductor into a normal conductor,
and they are used to move the Majoranas in space-time. With a perpendicular
magnetic field, the normal region localizes a quantum of magnetic flux. Under
these conditions, the boundary between the normal region and the
superconducting region supports a single zero-energy Majorana bound state. The
localized zero mode is sufficiently separate from other states and can be
dragged by sequentially applying voltages to the adjacent gates to implement
quantum computation. We briefly describe the fabrication process to construct
the device and determine key properties from experimentally determined
parameters. The digital qualities of topological protection provide intrinsic
immunity to the inevitable fabrication nonuniformities.

authenticity and integrity of messages while taking preventive action (e.g.,
applying brakes) within tens of milliseconds is one of the main challenges. In
such a brief moment after receiving a message, the agent not only must verify
the integrity and authenticity of the received message but also needs to
perform extra computations to localize the sender of the message for taking
appropriate action (e.g., an immediate stop warning from a vehicle in front vs.
rear). In this paper, we present an inherently location-aware and lightweight
authentication protocol by exploiting in situ visual localization (i.e., SLAM).
In this protocol, each agent displays its public key using visual
authentication beacons (e.g., QR codes). Thus, receiving agents not only can
verify and authenticate the messages but also can easily localize the sender by
keeping a shortlist of observed visual beacons within their visual localization
system with no additional computation cost. Compared to prior work, our
location-aware protocol is scalable, does not depend on any infrastructure,
removes the high cost of post-message-delivery localization, and provides
trustworthiness guarantees for information that are beyond the reach of each

produce large or unbalanced bags that hinder the training of MIL models, we
propose to use self-supervised contrastive learning to extract good

large bags. Third, we adopt a pyramidal fusion mechanism for multiscale WSI

near-optimal solution for MRMP -- satisfying these conditions implies near
optimality for a variety of popular planners, including dRRT*, and the discrete
methods M* and CBS when applied to the continuous domain. We develop the first
finite-sample analysis of this kind, which specifies the number of samples,
their deterministic distribution, and magnitude of the connection radii that
should be used by each individual PRM graph, to guarantee near-optimality using
the TR. This significantly improves upon a previous asymptotic analysis,
wherein the number of samples tends to infinity. Our new finite sample-size
analysis supports guaranteed high-quality solutions in practice within finite

extended to the regime of large electric field gradients perpendicular to the
magnetic field. A gradient in the electric field directly modifies the
oscillation frequency and causes the Larmor orbits to deform from circular to
elliptical trajectories. In order to retain a good adiabatic invariant, there
can only be strong dependence on a single coordinate at lowest order, so that
resonances do not generate chaotic motion that destroys the invariant. When the
gradient across magnetic flux surfaces is dominant, the guiding center drift
velocity becomes anisotropic in response to external forces and additional
curvature drifts must be included. The electric polarization density remains
gyrotropic, but both the polarization and magnetization are modified by the
change in gyrofrequency. The theory can be applied to shear flows that are even
stronger than those observed in the edge transport barrier of a
high-performance tokamak (H-mode) pedestal, even if the toroidal field is as
small as or even smaller than the poloidal field. Yet, the theory retains a
mathematical form that is similar to the standard case and can readily be
implemented within existing simulation tools.

political, commercial, and social information. Users with high visibility are
often selected as seeds to spread information and affect their adoption in
target groups. We study how gender differences and similarities can impact the
information spreading process. Using a large-scale Instagram dataset and a
small-scale Facebook dataset, we first conduct a multi-faceted analysis taking
the interaction type, directionality and frequency into account. To this end,
we explore a variety of existing and new single and multihop centrality
measures. Our analysis unveils that males and females interact differently
depending on the interaction types, e.g., likes or comments, and they feature
different support and promotion patterns. We complement prior work showing that
females do not reach top visibility (often referred to as the glass ceiling
effect) jointly factoring in the connectivity and interaction intensity, both
of which were previously mainly discussed independently.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel seeding framework, called
Disparity Seeding, which aims at maximizing spread while reaching a target user
group, e.g., a certain percentage of females -- promoting the influence of
under-represented groups. Disparity Seeding ranks influential users with two
gender-aware measures, the Target HI-index and the Embedding index. Extensive
simulations comparing Disparity Seeding with target-agnostic algorithms show
that Disparity Seeding meets the target percentage while effectively maximizing
the spread. Disparity Seeding can be generalized to counter different types of
inequality, e.g., race, and proactively promote minorities in the society.

The metric considers charge-imbalance within the local substructures in

pool of structurally stable and unstable phases. We showcase how local
structural information related to Wyckoff symmetry uniquely identifies four new
carbon-nitride phases. The metric predicts three new structurally stable phases
of 4 (C)$:$3 (N) stoichiometry, i.e., C$_{4}$N$_{3}$, which is further
confirmed by direct phonon calculations. The structurally stable phases also
satisfy the thermodynamic stability and mechanical stability criteria. New
phases possess extraordinary mechanical properties, similar to diamond, and
show insulating bandgap ranging from optimal, 1.45 eV (optimal) to 5.5 eV
(large gap). The structural, electronic, and optical properties of
Pm(1)-C$_{4}$N$_{3}$, discussed in detail, indicate possible application in
optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies. The way metric is design, it can
be used to predict stability of any material with three-dimensional bonding
network. The metric was also able to predict structural stability of other

quick filtering of dynamically stable phases without expensive

window into the processes by which a black hole was born and grew. Further,
spin can be a potent energy source for powering relativistic jets and energetic
particle acceleration. In this review, I describe the techniques currently used
to detect and measure the spins of black holes. It is shown that: (1) Two well
understood techniques, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and thermal continuum
fitting, can be used to measure the spins of black holes that are accreting at
moderate rates. There is a rich set of other electromagnetic techniques
allowing us to extend spin measurements to lower accretion rates. (2) Many
accreting supermassive black holes are found to be rapidly-spinning, although a
population of more slowly spinning black holes emerges at masses above
$M>3\times 10^7\,M_\odot$ as expected from recent structure formation models.
(3) Many accreting stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems are rapidly
spinning and must have been born in this state. (4) The advent of gravitational
wave astronomy has enabled the detection of spin effects in merging binary
black holes. Most of the pre-merger black holes are found to be slowly
spinning, a notable exception being an object that may itself be a merger
product. (5) The stark difference in spins between the black hole X-ray binary
and the binary black hole populations shows that there is a diversity of
formation mechanisms. Given the array of new electromagnetic and gravitational
wave capabilities currently being planned, the future of black hole spin
studies is bright.

Firstly, the computation of the posterior distribution involves evaluating the

We hence propose to use the multi-level algorithm. More precisely, we use the

formation of gas-phase methanol during this cold phase is believed to occur via
desorption from the icy grain surfaces, observations of CH$_2$DOH may be useful
as a probe of the deuterium fraction in the ice mantles of dust grains. We

to have larger virial parameters and larger methanol linewidths than detected

scrambling. A BPBE image can be obtained through four processes, positional
scrambling, block rotation/flip, negative-positive transformation, and color
component shuffling, after dividing the original image into multiple blocks.
The proposed scheme scrambles the R, G, and B components independently in
positional scrambling, block rotation/flip, and negative-positive
transformation, by assigning different keys to each color component. The
conventional scheme considers the compression efficiency using JPEG and JPEG
2000, which need a color conversion before the compression process by default.
Therefore, the conventional scheme scrambles the color components identically
in each process. In contrast, the proposed scheme takes into account the
RGB-based compression, such as JPEG-LS, and thus can increase the extent of the
scrambling. The resilience against jigsaw puzzle solver (JPS) can consequently
be increased owing to the wider color distribution of the BPBE image.
Additionally, the key space for resilience against brute-force attacks has also
been expanded exponentially. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can maintain the
JPEG-LS compression efficiency compared to the conventional scheme. We confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by experiments and analyses.

prognostic histopathology models remains a challenge. In this study, we
developed a deep learning system (DLS) for predicting disease specific survival
for stage II and III colorectal cancer using 3,652 cases (27,300 slides). When
evaluated on two validation datasets containing 1,239 cases (9,340 slides) and
738 cases (7,140 slides) respectively, the DLS achieved a 5-year
disease-specific survival AUC of 0.70 (95%CI 0.66-0.73) and 0.69 (95%CI
0.64-0.72), and added significant predictive value to a set of 9
clinicopathologic features. To interpret the DLS, we explored the ability of
different human-interpretable features to explain the variance in DLS scores.
We observed that clinicopathologic features such as T-category, N-category, and
grade explained a small fraction of the variance in DLS scores (R2=18% in both
validation sets). Next, we generated human-interpretable histologic features by
clustering embeddings from a deep-learning based image-similarity model and
showed that they explain the majority of the variance (R2 of 73% to 80%).
Furthermore, the clustering-derived feature most strongly associated with high
DLS scores was also highly prognostic in isolation. With a distinct visual
appearance (poorly differentiated tumor cell clusters adjacent to adipose
tissue), this feature was identified by annotators with 87.0-95.5% accuracy.
Our approach can be used to explain predictions from a prognostic deep learning
model and uncover potentially-novel prognostic features that can be reliably
identified by people for future validation studies.

stochastic effects that can substantially impact the epidemic trajectory. While
numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established

epidemic size over time, and derive new results to elucidate the early dynamics
of an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We show that
the initial growth of epidemics that eventually take off is accelerated by
stochasticity. These results are critical to improve early cluster detection
and control. As an application, we compute the distribution of the first
detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on
the testing effort, and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha
detected in September 2020 first appeared in the United Kingdom early August
2020. We also compute a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before
they exceed a given threshold size. These results improve our theoretical
understanding of early epidemics and will be useful for the study and control
of local infectious disease clusters.

deep learning due to its efficiency and scalability that enable training deep

SGD is usually applied with large batch size. However, as opposed to
small-batch SGD, neural network models trained with large-batch SGD can hardly
generalize well, i.e., the validation accuracy is low. In this work, we
introduce a novel regularization technique, namely distinctive regularization

little computation overhead. Moreover, we empirically show that optimizing the

the convergence and improved generalization performance. We also demonstrate
that DReg can boost the convergence of large-batch SGD with momentum. We

tackle this problem, the alternating optimization approach is utilized to
decouple the variables. In each alternative procedure, the optimal solutions

of single-qubit gates acting on each individual qubit and at least one

however, some qubits may be 'hidden' and lacking direct addressability through

discuss the impact of such restricted control capabilities on the quantum

control, considered communication topology forms a strongly connected graph.
The graph is no more strongly connected whenever an agent loses
communication.Whenever an agent loses communication, the topology is no more
strongly connected. The proposed back-tracking algorithm makes sure that the
agent backtracks its position unless the communication is reestablished, and
path is changed to reach consensus. In history following, the agents use their
memory and move towards previous consensus point until the communication is
regained. Upon regaining communication, a new consensus point is calculated
depending on the current positions of the agents and they change their
trajectories accordingly. Simulation results, for a network of six agents, show
that when the agents follow the previous history, the average consensus time is
less than that of back-tracking. However, situation may arise in history
following where a false notion of reaching consensus makes one of the agents
stop at a point near to the actual consensus point. An obstacle avoidance
algorithm is integrated with the proposed algorithms to avoid collisions.

spring equinox that are not observed at the same local time in any other year.
It is the nighttime temperatures that are most perturbed compared to other
years, with strong temperature inversions at 35-55 km altitude. Analysis of
data at different local times reveals that the temperatures and water ice
clouds at 03:45 am in MY29 more closely resemble those at 05:00 am in other

earlier local time. This phase shift, and the large amplitude non-migrating
thermal tides, appear to be related to early dust activity. Two early dust
storms occurred in MY29 around the time there was upwelling over the tropics,
associated with the Hadley circulation, enabling the dust to be transported to
higher altitudes where it has a larger radiative influence. As well as dust,
water ice clouds are also found to influence the tidal structure. Due to the
interaction of non-migrating tides, water ice clouds occur in two discrete
longitudinal regions at night. The increased radiative cooling results in
increased downwelling above the clouds, leading to increased adiabatic warming
and a strengthening the temperature inversions.

global solution or establishes infeasibility. However, the algorithm may
produce infeasible iterates during the search. For a strongly-convex constraint
function and a feasible initial solution guess, the second algorithm returns a
near-optimal global solution without any constraint violation. In contrast to
existing methods, both of the algorithms also compute global suboptimality
bounds at every iteration. We also show that the algorithms can satisfy
user-specified tolerances in the computed solution with near-optimal complexity
in oracle calls for a large class of optimization problems. We propose
tractable implementations of the algorithms by exploiting the structure

environmental sustainability. The growth of last mile deliveries alongside
ridesharing calls for an efficient and cohesive system that transports both
passengers and goods. Existing methods address this using static routing
methods considering neither the demands of requests nor the transfer of goods
between vehicles during route planning. In this paper, we present a dynamic and
demand aware fleet management framework for combined goods and passenger
transportation that is capable of (1) Involving both passengers and drivers in
the decision-making process by allowing drivers to negotiate to a mutually
suitable price, and passengers to accept/reject, (2) Matching of goods to
vehicles, and the multi-hop transfer of goods, (3) Dynamically generating
optimal routes for each vehicle considering demand along their paths, based on
the insertion cost which then determines the matching, (4) Dispatching idle
vehicles to areas of anticipated high passenger and goods demand using Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL), (5) Allowing for distributed inference at each
vehicle while collectively optimizing fleet objectives. Our proposed model is
deployable independently within each vehicle as this minimizes computational
costs associated with the growth of distributed systems and democratizes
decision-making to each individual. Simulations on a variety of vehicle types,
goods, and passenger utility functions show the effectiveness of our approach
as compared to other methods that do not consider combined load transportation

between the optical position of the Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) and the

electricity markets is generally referred to as a ""coupling"". In this paper we
propose a new mechanism design for efficient coupling of independent
electricity markets. The mechanism operates after each individual market has
settled (e.g. hour-ahead) and based upon the reported supply and demand
functions for internal market optimization (clearing), each market operator is
asked to iteratively quote the terms of energy trade (on behalf of the agents
participating in its market) across the transmission lines connecting to other
markets. The mechanism is scalable as the informational demands placed on each
market operator at each iteration are limited. We show that the mechanism's
outcome converges to the optimal flows between markets given the reported
supply and demand functions from each individual market clearing. We show the
proposed market coupling design does not alter the structure of incentives in
each internal market, i.e., any internal market equilibrium will remain so
(approximately) after coupling is implemented. This is achieved via incentive
transfers (updated at each iteration) that remunerate each market with its
marginal contribution (i.e. cost savings) to all other participating markets.
We identify a sufficient condition on a uniform participation fee for each
market operator ensuring the mechanism incurs no deficit. The proposed
decentralized mechanism is implemented on the three-area IEEE Reliability Test
System where the simulation results showcase the efficiency of proposed model.

governed by the generalized sheet transition conditions, which relate the
tangential fields on each side of the surface through the surface parameters.
Ideally, engineers would like to determine the surface parameters for
transformations based on their application-specific far-field criteria.
However, determining the surface parameters to satisfy these criteria is
challenging without direct knowledge of the tangential fields on one side of
the surface, which are not unique for a given far field pattern. As a result,
current design is restricted to analytical examples where the tangential fields
are solvable or other ad hoc methods. This paper presents a convex
optimization-based scheme which determines surface parameters, such as surface
impedance, admittance, and magneto-electric coupling, which satisfy far-field
constraints such as beam magnitude, side lobe level, and null locations. The
optimization is performed on a model constructed using the method of moments.
This model incorporates edge effects and mutual coupling. The resulting
non-convexity from this model is relaxed using the alternating direction method
of multipliers. Examples of this optimization scheme performing multi-criteria

  Error-Bounded Lossy Compression","11 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, accepted by PPoPP '21 as a poster",,,,"cs.DC cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming increasingly deeper, wider, and
non-linear due to the growing demands on prediction accuracy and analysis
quality. When training a DNN model, the intermediate activation data must be
saved in the memory during forward propagation and then restored for backward
propagation. However, state-of-the-art accelerators such as GPUs are only
equipped with very limited memory capacities due to hardware design
constraints, which significantly limits the maximum batch size and hence
performance speedup when training large-scale DNNs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel memory-driven high performance DNN training
framework that leverages error-bounded lossy compression to significantly
reduce the memory requirement for training in order to allow training larger
networks. Different from the state-of-the-art solutions that adopt image-based
lossy compressors such as JPEG to compress the activation data, our framework
purposely designs error-bounded lossy compression with a strict
error-controlling mechanism. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis on
the compression error propagation from the altered activation data to the
gradients, and then empirically investigate the impact of altered gradients
over the entire training process. Based on these analyses, we then propose an
improved lossy compressor and an adaptive scheme to dynamically configure the
lossy compression error-bound and adjust the training batch size to further
utilize the saved memory space for additional speedup. We evaluate our design
against state-of-the-art solutions with four popular DNNs and the ImageNet
dataset. Results demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly
reduce the training memory consumption by up to 13.5x and 1.8x over the
baseline training and state-of-the-art framework with compression,
respectively, with little or no accuracy loss.

(driven by percolation) and density (driven by buoyancy). Modelling the
segregation of mixtures of large/heavy particles and small/light particles is
challenging due to the opposing effects of the two segregation mechanisms.
Using discrete element method (DEM) simulations of combined size and density
segregation we show that the segregation velocity is well described by a model
that depends linearly on the local shear rate and quadratically on the species
concentration. Concentration profiles predicted by incorporating this
segregation velocity model into a continuum advection-diffusion-segregation
transport model match DEM simulation results well for a wide range of particle
size and density ratios. Most surprisingly, the DEM simulations and the
segregation velocity model both show that the segregation direction for a range
of size and density ratios depends on the local species concentration. This
leads to a methodology to determine the combination of particle size ratio,
density ratio, and particle concentration for which a bidisperse mixture will
not segregate.

decades of research, existing methods either over simplify the models only
using independent factorization which leads to inaccurate estimates, or over
complicate them by lossless conditional factorization without any independent

propose FLAT, a CardEst method that is simultaneously fast in probability
computation, lightweight in model size and accurate in estimation quality. The
key idea of FLAT is a novel unsupervised graphical model, called FSPN. It
utilizes both independent and conditional factorization to adaptively model
different levels of attributes correlations, and thus dovetails their
advantages. FLAT supports efficient online probability computation in near
liner time on the underlying FSPN model, provides effective offline model
construction and enables incremental model updates. It can estimate cardinality
for both single table queries and multi table join queries. Extensive
experimental study demonstrates the superiority of FLAT over existing CardEst
methods on well known IMDB benchmarks: FLAT achieves 1 to 5 orders of magnitude
better accuracy, 1 to 3 orders of magnitude faster probability computation
speed and 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower storage cost. We also integrate FLAT

project the rows and columns onto another $p_1$ and $p_2$ directions according

Consequently, we treat the data as nonsingular linear row and column

idiosyncratic components. We propose a common orthonormal projection method to
estimate the front and back loading matrices of the matrix-variate factors.
Under the setting that the largest eigenvalues of the covariance of the
vectorized idiosyncratic term diverge for large $p_1$ and $p_2$, we introduce a
two-way projected Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate the associated
loading matrices of the idiosyncratic terms to mitigate such diverging noise

  These steady flows correspond to a minimum of the Euler Hamiltonian as a
functional of the tangent discontinuity of the local velocity parametrized as
$\Delta \vec v_t =\vec \nabla \Gamma$. This observation means that the steady
flow represents the low-temperature limit of the Gibbs distribution for vortex
sheet dynamics. The normal displacement $\delta r_\perp$ of the vortex sheet as
a Hamiltonian coordinate and $\Gamma$ as a conjugate momentum.
  An infinite number of Euler conservation laws lead to a degenerate vacuum of
this system, which explains the complexity of turbulence statistics and
provides the relevant degrees of freedom (random surfaces). The simplest
example of a steady solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in the turbulent
limit is a spherical vortex sheet, which we investigate.
  This family of steady solutions provides an example of the Euler instanton
advocated in our recent work, which is supposed to be responsible for the
dissipation of the \NS{} equation in the turbulent limit. We further conclude
that one can obtain turbulent statistics from the Gibbs statistics of vortex
sheets by adding Lagrange multipliers for the conserved volume inside closed
surfaces, the rate of energy pumping, and energy dissipation. The effective
temperature in our Gibbs distribution goes to zero as
$\mbox{Re}^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ with Reynolds number in the turbulent limit.
  \textbf{The Gibbs statistics in this limit reduces to the solvable string

particularly the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-ray
power spectra. The solid-body regime of Lense-Thirring precession is one
prominent model invoked to explain the most common type of QPOs, Type C.
However, solid-body precession requires a specific structure that has not been
examined in light of constrained properties of accretion flows. We assume in
this paper, as solid-body precession requires, a disk separated into two flows
at a transition radius $r_t$: a cold outer flow and a hot inner flow (playing
the role of the corona). We explore the physical structure of both flows using
model-independent estimates of accretion parameters. We show that, in order to
reproduce the observed X-ray spectra during luminous hard states, the hot flow
must accrete at sonic to supersonic speeds, unreachable with typical viscous
torques. As a result of this extreme accretion speed (or high $\alpha$
parameter), no region of the disk during these states lies in the `wave-like'
regime required for solid-body precession. Furthermore, we expect the flow to
align with the black hole spin axis via the Bardeen-Petterson effect inside a
radius $r_{\rm break}>r_t$. As a consequence, the hot inner flow cannot exhibit
solid body precession -- as currently pictured in the literature -- during
luminous hard states. Since Type C QPOs are prevalent in these states, we
conclude that this mechanism is unlikely to be responsible for producing Type C
QPOs around stellar mass black holes.

work, we formulate it as the problem of Domain Concretization, an inverse
problem to domain abstraction. Based on an incomplete domain model provided by
the designer and teacher traces from human users, our algorithm searches for a
candidate model set under a minimalistic model assumption. It then generates a
robust plan with the maximum probability of success under the set of candidate
models. In addition to a standard search formulation in the model-space, we
propose a sample-based search method and also an online version of it to
improve search time. We tested our approach on IPC domains and a simulated
robotics domain where incompleteness was introduced by removing domain features
from the complete model. Results show that our planning algorithm increases the
plan success rate without impacting the cost much.

many intriguing optical properties, such as chirality-dependent optical
excitations and giant second harmonic generation (SHG). Linear and nonlinear
optics have been employed as tools to probe the Weyl physics in these crystals.
Here we extend these studies to address two important points: determining the
complete anisotropic dielectric response, and to explore if and how they can
reveal essential Weyl physics. For the first time, we determine the complete
anisotropic dielectric functions of TaAs and NbAs by combining spectroscopic
ellipsometry and density functional theory (DFT). Parameterized Lorentz
oscillators are reported from 1.2-6 eV (experiment) and 0-6 eV (DFT), and good
agreement is shown between them. Both linear and nonlinear optical properties
have been reported to reveal Weyl physics. We suggest that strong optical
resonances from trivial bands are the likely origin of the large optical second
harmonic generation previously reported at these energies. Furthermore, by
comparing the contribution of a small k-space centered around the Weyl cones to
the total linear dielectric function, we find that these contributions are
highly anisotropic and are <25% of the total dielectric function below 0.5 eV;
above 1eV, these contributions are negligible. Thus, the study of Weyl physics
using optical techniques requires very low energies and even there, a careful
assessment is required in distinguishing the much smaller contributions of the
Weyl bands from the dominant contributions of the trivial bands and Drude
response to the total dielectric function.

communication protocols. Prior work on session types has focused on
deterministic languages but many message-passing systems, such as Markov chains
and randomized distributed algorithms, are probabilistic. To model and analyze
such systems, this article introduces probabilistic session types and explores
their application in automatic expected resource analysis. Probabilistic
session types describe probability distributions over messages and are a
conservative extension of intuitionistic (binary) session types. To send on a
probabilistic channel, processes have to utilize internal randomness from a
probabilistic branching expression or external randomness from receiving on a
probabilistic channel. The analysis for expected resource bounds is integrated
with the type system and is a variant of automatic amortized resource analysis.
It can automatically derive symbolic bounds for different cost metrics by
reducing type inference to linear constraint solving. The technical
contributions include the meta theory that is based on a novel nested
multiverse semantics and a type-reconstruction algorithm that allows flexible
mixing of different sources of randomness without burdening the programmer with
type annotations. The type system has been implemented in the language PRast.
Experiments demonstrate that PRast is applicable in different domains such as
resource analysis of randomized distributed algorithms, verification of
limiting distributions in Markov chains, and analysis of probabilistic digital

we ask in this paper. While fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) strives
to arrive at the former, for the majority of us non-experts just ""bird"" would
probably suffice. The real question is therefore -- how can we tailor for
different fine-grained definitions under divergent levels of expertise. For
that, we re-envisage the traditional setting of FGVC, from single-label

this new problem, we first conduct a comprehensive human study where we confirm

coarse-level label prediction exacerbates fine-grained feature learning, yet
fine-level feature betters the learning of coarse-level classifier. This
discovery enables us to design a very simple albeit surprisingly effective
solution to our new problem, where we (i) leverage level-specific
classification heads to disentangle coarse-level features with fine-grained
ones, and (ii) allow finer-grained features to participate in coarser-grained
label predictions, which in turn helps with better disentanglement. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior performance in the new FGVC setting, and
performs better than state-of-the-art on traditional single-label FGVC problem
as well. Thanks to its simplicity, our method can be easily implemented on top

a classification task per pixel. However, in applications such as medical
imaging, this ""black-and-white"" approach is too constraining because the
contrast between two tissues is often ill-defined, i.e., the voxels located on
objects' edges contain a mixture of tissues. Consequently, assigning a single
""hard"" label can result in a detrimental approximation. Instead, a soft
prediction containing non-binary values would overcome that limitation. We
introduce SoftSeg, a deep learning training approach that takes advantage of
soft ground truth labels, and is not bound to binary predictions. SoftSeg aims
at solving a regression instead of a classification problem. This is achieved
by using (i) no binarization after preprocessing and data augmentation, (ii) a
normalized ReLU final activation layer (instead of sigmoid), and (iii) a
regression loss function (instead of the traditional Dice loss). We assess the
impact of these three features on three open-source MRI segmentation datasets
from the spinal cord gray matter, the multiple sclerosis brain lesion, and the
multimodal brain tumor segmentation challenges. Across multiple
cross-validation iterations, SoftSeg outperformed the conventional approach,
leading to an increase in Dice score of 2.0% on the gray matter dataset
(p=0.001), 3.3% for the MS lesions, and 6.5% for the brain tumors. SoftSeg
produces consistent soft predictions at tissues' interfaces and shows an
increased sensitivity for small objects. The richness of soft labels could
represent the inter-expert variability, the partial volume effect, and
complement the model uncertainty estimation. The developed training pipeline
can easily be incorporated into most of the existing deep learning
architectures. It is already implemented in the freely-available deep learning
toolbox ivadomed (https://ivadomed.org).

gravitational collapse in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and confirm that they lead
to the island rule for the entropy. The main technical challenge is that
replica wormholes rely on a Euclidean path integral, while the quantum extremal
islands of an evaporating black hole exist only in Lorentzian signature.
Furthermore, the Euclidean equations are non-local, so it is unclear how to
bridge the gap between the Euclidean path integral and the local, Lorentzian

use a cross-modal latent space (CMLS) architecture, where a shared latent space

different multi-modal losses to explicitly guide the acoustic embeddings to be
closer to the text embeddings, obtained from a semantically powerful

transfer, and novel view synthesis, within a unified framework. It means that
the model, once being trained, can be used to handle all these tasks. The
existing task-specific methods mainly use 2D keypoints to estimate the human
body structure. However, they only express the position information with no
abilities to characterize the personalized shape of the person and model the
limb rotations. In this paper, we propose to use a 3D body mesh recovery module
to disentangle the pose and shape. It can not only model the joint location and
rotation but also characterize the personalized body shape. To preserve the
source information, such as texture, style, color, and face identity, we
propose an Attentional Liquid Warping GAN with Attentional Liquid Warping Block
(AttLWB) that propagates the source information in both image and feature
spaces to the synthesized reference. Specifically, the source features are
extracted by a denoising convolutional auto-encoder for characterizing the
source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method can support a more
flexible warping from multiple sources. To further improve the generalization
ability of the unseen source images, a one/few-shot adversarial learning is
applied. In detail, it firstly trains a model in an extensive training set.
Then, it finetunes the model by one/few-shot unseen image(s) in a
self-supervised way to generate high-resolution (512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024)
results. Also, we build a new dataset, namely iPER dataset, for the evaluation
of human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis.

campaign demonstrated a missing piece in the structure of AGNs. For a two-month
period in the middle of the campaign, the spectral lines showed a deficit in
flux and a reduced response to the variations of the UV continuum. This was the
first time that this behavior was unequivocally observed in an AGN. Our
previous papers explained this as being due to a variable disk-wind which acts
as a shield and alters the SED. Here we use Cloudy to create an atlas of
photoionization models for a variety of disk-winds to study their effects on
the SED. We show that the winds have three different cases: Case 1 winds are
transparent, fully ionized and have minimal effects on the intrinsic SED,
although they can produce some line emission, especially HeIIor FeK{\alpha}. We
propose that this is the situation in most of the AGNs. Case 2 winds have a
He++-He+ionization-front, block part of the XUV continuum but transmit much of
the Lyman continuum. They lead to the observed abnormal behavior. Case 3 winds
have H+ionization-front and block much of the Lyman continuum. The results show
that the presence of the winds has important effects on the spectral lines of
AGNs. They will thus have an effect on the measurements of the black hole mass
and the geometry of the AGN. This atlas of spectral simulations can serve as a
guide to future reverberation campaigns

and accurate modeling of the feature distribution. The GM loss can be readily
used to distinguish abnormal inputs, such as the adversarial examples, based on
the discrepancy between feature distributions of the inputs and the training
set. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that a symmetric feature space can
be achieved by using the GM loss, which enables the models to perform robustly
against adversarial attacks. The proposed model can be implemented easily and
efficiently without using extra trainable parameters. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably not only on image

concomitant and maintenance phases) to improve patient outcomes. When the new
regimen provides meaningful benefit over the control therapy in such cases, it
proves difficult to separately assess the contribution of each phase to the
overall effect observed. This article provides an approach for assessing the
importance of a specific treatment phase in such a situation through tipping
point analyses of a time-to-event endpoint using
rank-preserving-structural-failure-time (RPSFT) modeling. A tipping-point
analysis is commonly used in situations where it is suspected that a
statistically significant difference between treatment arms could be a result
of missing or unobserved data instead of a real treatment effect.
Rank-preserving-structural-failure-time modeling is an approach for causal
inference that is typically used to adjust for treatment switching in clinical
trials with time to event endpoints. The methodology proposed in this article
is an amalgamation of these two ideas to investigate the contribution of a
treatment phase of interest to the effect of a regimen comprising multiple
treatment phases. We provide two different variants of the method corresponding
to two different effects of interest. We provide two different tipping point
thresholds depending on inferential goals. The proposed approaches are

structures, referred to as time domain structures (TDSs), often occur around
dipolarization fronts in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. They are considered
to be important because of their role in the dissipation of the injection
energy and their potential for significant particle scattering and
acceleration. Kinetic Alfv\'en waves are observed to be excited during
energetic particle injections, and are typically present in conjunction with
TDS observations. Despite the availability of a large number of spacecraft
observations, the origin of TDSs and their relation to kinetic Alfv\'en waves
remains poorly understood to date. Part of the difficulty arises from the vast
scale separations between kinetic Alfv\'en waves and TDSs. Here, we demonstrate
that TDSs can be excited by electrons in nonlinear Landau resonance with
kinetic Alfv\'en waves. These electrons get trapped by the parallel electric
field of kinetic Alfv\'en waves, form localized beam distributions, and
subsequently generate TDSs through beam instabilities. A big picture emerges as
follows: macroscale dipolarization fronts first transfer the ion flow (kinetic)
energy to kinetic Alfv\'en waves at intermediate scale, which further channel
the energy to TDSs at the microscale and eventually deposit the energy to the
thermal electrons in the form of heating. In this way, the ion flow energy
associated with dipolarization fronts is effectively dissipated in a cascade
from large to small scales in the inner magnetosphere.

computing because of their hardware flexibility, high computational throughput,
and low power consumption. However, the design flow of FPGAs often requires
specific knowledge of the underlying hardware, which hinders the wide adoption
of FPGAs by application developers. Therefore, the virtualization of FPGAs
becomes extremely important to create a useful abstraction of the hardware
suitable for application developers. Such abstraction also enables the sharing
of FPGA resources among multiple users and accelerator applications, which is
important because, traditionally, FPGAs have been mostly used in single-user,
single-embedded-application scenarios. There are many works in the field of
FPGA virtualization covering different aspects and targeting different
application areas. In this survey, we review the system architectures used in
the literature for FPGA virtualization. In addition, we identify the primary
objectives of FPGA virtualization, based on which we summarize the techniques
for realizing FPGA virtualization. This survey helps researchers to efficiently
learn about FPGA virtualization research by providing a comprehensive review of

architectures. Of particular interest are those systems that contain exoplanets
at a variety of star-planet separations, allowing direct comparison of
exoplanet evolution (comparative planetology). The Kepler-1649 system contains
two terrestrial planets similar both in size and insolation flux to Venus and
Earth, although their eccentricities remain largely unconstrained. Here we
present results of dynamical studies of the system and the potential effects on
climate. The eccentricities of the Kepler-1649 system are poorly constrained,
and we show that there are dynamically viable regions for further terrestrial
planets in between the two known planets for a limited range of eccentricities.
We investigate the effect of eccentricity of the outer planet on the dynamics
of both planets and show that this results in high-frequency (1000-3000 year)
eccentricity oscillations in long-term stable configurations. We calculate the
resulting effect of these eccentricity variations on insolation flux and
present the results of 3D climate simulations for the habitable zone planet.
Our simulations demonstrate that, despite large eccentricity variations, the
planet can maintain stable climates with relatively small temperature
variations on the substellar hemisphere for a variety of initial climate
configurations. Such systems thus provide key opportunities to explore
alternative Venus/Earth climate evolution scenarios.

algorithm for unweighted paging, and extends the recently studied model for
learning-augmented paging (Lykouris and Vassilvitskii, 2018) to the weighted

  For the case of perfect predictions, we provide an $\ell$-competitive
deterministic and an $O(\log \ell)$-competitive randomized algorithm, where
$\ell$ is the number of distinct weight classes. Both these bounds are tight,
and imply an $O(\log W)$- and $O(\log \log W)$-competitive ratio, respectively,
when the page weights lie between $1$ and $W$. Previously, it was not known how
to use these predictions in the weighted setting and only bounds of $k$ and
$O(\log k)$ were known, where $k$ is the cache size. Our results also
generalize to the interleaved paging setting and to the case of imperfect
predictions, with the competitive ratios degrading smoothly from $O(\ell)$ and
$O(\log \ell)$ to $O(k)$ and $O(\log k)$, respectively, as the prediction error
increases.
  Our results are based on several insights on structural properties of
Belady's algorithm and the sequence of page arrival predictions, and novel
potential functions that incorporate these predictions. For the case of

a better performance than baseline MusicVAE in capturing notes in a chord.

found to follow a power law, i.e., the number of papers having a certain level
of citation x are proportional to x raised to some negative power. The
distributional character of altmetrics has not been studied yet as altmetrics
are among the newest indicators related to scholarly publications. Here we
select a data sample from the altmetrics aggregator Altmetrics.com containing
records from the platforms Facebook, Twitter, News, Blogs, etc., and the
composite variable Alt-score for the period 2016. The individual and the
composite data series of 'mentions' on the various platforms are fit to a power
law distribution, and the parameters and goodness of fit determined using least
squares regression. The log-log plot of the data, 'mentions' vs. number of
papers, falls on an approximately linear line, suggesting the plausibility of a
power law distribution. The fit is not very good in all cases due to large
fluctuations in the tail. We show that fit to the power law can be improved by
truncating the data series to eliminate large fluctuations in the tail. We
conclude that altmetric distributions also follow power laws with a fairly good
fit over a wide range of values. More rigorous methods of determination may not
be necessary at present.

to use full spectrum (as high-dimensional data vector) with no cropping and no

key insights into tipping cascades. Here, we consider a specific example of a
simple model system that could have cascading tipping points. This model
consists of two interacting populations with underlying Allee effects and
stochastic dynamics, in separate patches connected by dispersal, which can
generate bistability. From an ecological standpoint, we look for rescue effects
whereby one population can prevent the collapse of a second population. As a
way to investigate the stochastic dynamics, we use an individual-based modeling
approach rooted in chemical reaction network theory. Then, using
continuous-time Markov chains and the theory of first passage times, we
essentially approximate, or emulate, the original high-dimensional model by a
Markov chain with just four states, where each state corresponds to a
combination of population thresholds. Analysis of this reduced model shows when
the system is likely to recover, as well as when tipping cascades through the

  Super-Linear Lower Bounds for Turing Machines","17 pages, ITCS 2021",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove that a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for a special
case of multiplayer (multiprover) games implies super-linear lower bounds for
multi-tape Turing machines with advice. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first connection between parallel repetition and lower bounds for time
complexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition
theorem with more than two players.
  Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block
rigidity, a weakening of Valiant's notion of rigidity. While rigidity was
originally defined for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear
functions, we extend and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general
(multi-output) functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemer\'edi and
Trotter, we show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape
Turing machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the
non-uniform setting, where the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape.
  We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that, a sufficiently
strong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit
block-rigid function. The games in that class have the following property that
may be of independent interest: for every random string for the verifier
(which, in particular, determines the vector of queries to the players), there
is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts if
and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent
games. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value
of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\Omega(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of
repetitions.
  As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional size-depth
tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions
over large sets.

we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to Unsupervisedly
Pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop
patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The
model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image.
During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning
and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization
preferences in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch
feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection.
(2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query
patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and
attention mask. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the
performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher average precision on

network that integrates radar sensing into communication. One major challenge
for realizing sensing in PMNs is how to deal with spatially-separated
asynchronous transceivers. The asynchrony between sensing receiver and
transmitter will cause both timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets
(CFOs) and lead to degraded sensing accuracy in both ranging and velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose an uplink sensing scheme for PMNs with
asynchronous transceivers, targeting at resolving the sensing ambiguity and
improving the sensing accuracy. We first adopt a cross-antenna
cross-correlation (CACC) operation to remove the sensing ambiguity associated
with both TOs and CFOs. Without sensing ambiguity, both actual propagation
delay and actual Doppler frequency of multiple targets can be obtained using
CACC outputs. To exploit the redundancy of the CACC outputs and reduce the
complexity, we then propose a novel mirrored-MUSIC algorithm, which halves the
number of unknown parameters to be estimated, for obtaining actual values of
delays and Doppler frequencies. Finally, we propose a high-resolution
angles-of-arrival (AoAs) estimation algorithm, which jointly processes all
measurements from spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. The proposed AoAs
estimation algorithm can achieve significantly higher estimation accuracy than
that of using samples from the spatial domain only. We also derive the
theoretical mean-square-error of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results are

exploiting this observation, the number of parameters in an expression
synthesis model can be significantly reduced. Therefore, we propose a
constrained version of ridge regression that exploits the local and sparse

for learning local receptive fields. In contrast to the existing approaches,
our proposed model can be efficiently trained on larger image sizes.
Experiments using three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model

in the number of parameters allows our method to generalize better even after
training on smaller datasets. The proposed algorithm is also compared with

known to guarantee positive expected value of the resulting gain-loss function
with respect to a large class of stock price dynamics. In the literature, this
is known as the Robust Positive Expectation(RPE)property. An obvious way to
extend this theory to the trading of two stocks is to trade each one of them
using its own independent SLS controller. Motivated by the fact that such a
scheme does not exploit any correlation between the two stocks, we study the
case when the relative sign between the drifts of the two stocks is known. The
main contributions of this paper are three-fold: First, we put forward a novel
architecture in which we cross-couple two SLS controllers for the two-stock
case. Second, we derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of the
gain-loss function. Third, we use this closed-form expression to prove that the
RPE property is guaranteed with respect to a large class of stock-price
dynamics. When more information over and above the relative sign is assumed,
additional benefits of the new architecture are seen. For example, when bounds
or precise values for the means and covariances of the stock returns are
included in the model, numerical simulations suggest that our new controller
can achieve lower trading risk than a pair of decoupled SLS controllers for the
same level of expected trading gain.

excited $D_s^+$ meson is observed decaying into the $D^+K^+\pi^-$ final state
with large statistical significance. The pole mass and width, and the
spin-parity of the new state are measured with an amplitude analysis to be
$m_R=2591\pm6\pm7\,{\rm MeV}$, $\Gamma_R=89\pm16\pm12\,{\rm MeV}$ and
$J^P=0^-$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second
systematic. Fit fractions for all components in the amplitude analysis are also
reported. The new resonance, denoted as $D_{s0}(2590)^+$, is a strong candidate
to be the $D_s(2^1{S}_0)^+$ state, the radial excitation of the pseudoscalar
ground-state $D_s^+$ meson.

  Distillation","Accepted in WACV 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge Distillation is an effective method to transfer the learning across
deep neural networks. Typically, the dataset originally used for training the
Teacher model is chosen as the ""Transfer Set"" to conduct the knowledge transfer
to the Student. However, this original training data may not always be freely
available due to privacy or sensitivity concerns. In such scenarios, existing
approaches either iteratively compose a synthetic set representative of the
original training dataset, one sample at a time or learn a generative model to
compose such a transfer set. However, both these approaches involve complex
optimization (GAN training or several backpropagation steps to synthesize one
sample) and are often computationally expensive. In this paper, as a simple
alternative, we investigate the effectiveness of ""arbitrary transfer sets"" such
as random noise, publicly available synthetic, and natural datasets, all of
which are completely unrelated to the original training dataset in terms of
their visual or semantic contents. Through extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets such as MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we discover
and validate surprising effectiveness of using arbitrary data to conduct
knowledge distillation when this dataset is ""target-class balanced"". We believe
that this important observation can potentially lead to designing baselines for
the data-free knowledge distillation task.

  Airlight and Scattering Coefficient Estimation","14 pages, extended version of our ACCV2020 paper",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) method in scattering
media, such as fog or smoke, with a novel cost volume, called the dehazing cost
volume. Images captured in scattering media are degraded due to light
scattering and attenuation caused by suspended particles. This degradation
depends on scene depth; thus, it is difficult for traditional MVS methods to
evaluate photometric consistency because the depth is unknown before
three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. The dehazing cost volume can solve this
chicken-and-egg problem of depth estimation and image restoration by computing
the scattering effect using swept planes in the cost volume. We also propose a
method of estimating scattering parameters, such as airlight, and a scattering
coefficient, which are required for our dehazing cost volume. The output depth
of a network with our dehazing cost volume can be regarded as a function of
these parameters; thus, they are geometrically optimized with a sparse 3D point
cloud obtained at a structure-from-motion step. Experimental results on
synthesized hazy images indicate the effectiveness of our dehazing cost volume
against the ordinary cost volume regarding scattering media. We also
demonstrated the applicability of our dehazing cost volume to real foggy
scenes.

accurately predict a person's age and whether they have Alzheimer's disease
(AD) from a structural brain MRI scan. Building on a 3D convolutional neural
network, we added two attention modules at different layers of abstraction, so
that features learned are spatially related to the global features for the
task. The attention layers allow the network to focus on brain regions relevant
to the task, while masking out irrelevant or noisy regions. In evaluations
based on 4,561 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scans from 4 phases of the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), salience maps for age and AD prediction
partially overlapped, but lower-level features overlapped more than
higher-level features. The brain age prediction network also distinguished AD
and healthy control groups better than another state-of-the-art method. The
resulting visual analyses can distinguish interpretable feature patterns that
are important for predicting clinical diagnosis. Future work is needed to test
performance across scanners and populations.

widely used in many fields including image-stitching and point cloud
registration. In RANSAC, data is uniformly sampled for hypothesis generation.
However, this uniform sampling strategy does not fully utilize all the
information on many problems. In this paper, we propose a method that samples
data with a L\'{e}vy distribution together with a data sorting algorithm. In
the hypothesis sampling step of the proposed method, data is sorted with a
sorting algorithm we proposed, which sorts data based on the likelihood of a
data point being in the inlier set. Then, hypotheses are sampled from the
sorted data with L\'{e}vy distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on
both simulation and real-world public datasets. Our method shows better results
compared with the uniform baseline method.

subroutine for collision detection by optimizing the exit conditions of our GJK

applications that only need binary results. We benchmark our methods along with
that of the well-known open-source collision detection libraries, such as

thus has been debated for a hundred years past or more. Numerous ideas have
been proposed to quantify income inequality, and the Gini coefficient is a
prevalent index. However, the concept of perfect equality in the Gini
coefficient is rather idealistic and cannot provide realistic guidance on
whether government interventions are needed to adjust income inequality. In
this paper, we first propose the concept of a more realistic and feasible
income equality that maximizes total social welfare. Then we show that an
optimal income distribution representing the feasible equality could be modeled
using the sigmoid welfare function and the Boltzmann income distribution.
Finally, we carry out an empirical analysis of four countries and demonstrate
how optimal income distributions could be evaluated. Our results show that the
feasible income equality could be used as a practical guideline for government

realistic tokamak X-point plasmas. It has become a widely used versatile code
for studying large-scale plasma instabilities and their control developed in an
international community. This article gives a comprehensive overview of the
physics models implemented, numerical methods applied for solving the equations
and physics studies performed with the code. A dedicated section highlights
some of the verification work done for the code. A hierarchy of different
physics models is available including a free boundary and resistive wall
extension and hybrid kinetic-fluid models. The code allows for flux-surface
aligned iso-parametric finite element grids in single and double X-point
plasmas which can be extended to the true physical walls and uses a robust
fully implicit time stepping. Particular focus is laid on plasma edge and
scrape-off layer (SOL) physics as well as disruption related phenomena. Among
the key results obtained with JOREK regarding plasma edge and SOL, are deep
insights into the dynamics of edge localized modes (ELMs), ELM cycles, and ELM
control by resonant magnetic perturbations, pellet injection, as well as by
vertical magnetic kicks. Also ELM free regimes, detachment physics, the
generation and transport of impurities during an ELM, and electrostatic
turbulence in the pedestal region are investigated. Regarding disruptions, the
focus is on the dynamics of the thermal quench and current quench triggered by
massive gas injection (MGI) and shattered pellet injection (SPI), runaway
electron (RE) dynamics as well as the RE interaction with MHD modes, and
vertical displacement events (VDEs). Also the seeding and suppression of
tearing modes (TMs), the dynamics of naturally occurring thermal quenches
triggered by locked modes, and radiative collapses are being studied.

propose a method to detect adversarial and out-distribution examples against a
pre-trained CNN without needing to retrain the CNN or needing access to a wide

each class using only one adversarial attack generation technique. We then wrap
a detector around the pre-trained CNN that applies the created adversarial
profile to each input and uses the output to decide whether or not the input is
legitimate. Our initial evaluation of this approach using MNIST dataset show
that adversarial profile based detection is effective in detecting at least 92
of out-distribution examples and 59% of adversarial examples.

painting's content are often missing. Recent research starts to apply the
computer graphic techniques to extract the information from the painting
content. Most of the research concentrates on the reading of the color
information from the painting images and analyzes how different color
compositions can affect the sales prices of paintings. This paper takes a
different approach, and tries to abstract away from the interpretation of the
content information, while only focus on measuring the quantity of information
contained. We extend the concept of Shannon entropy in information theory to
the painting's scenario, and suggest using the variances of a painting's
composing elements, i.e., line, color, value, shape/form and space, to measure
the amount of information in the painting. These measures are calculated at the
pixel level based on a picture's digital image. We include them into the
traditional hedonic regression model to test their significance based on the
auction samples from two famous artists (Picasso and Renoir). We find that all
the variance measurements can significantly explain the sales price either at
1% or 5% level. The adjusted R square is also increased by more than ten
percent. Our method greatly improves the traditional pricing models, and may
also find applications in other areas such as art valuation and authentication.

scene segmentation network based on local Deep Implicit Functions as a novel

completion, our method produces a continuous scene representation that is not

subsequently assembled from the localized function patches. We show that this
continuous representation is suitable to encode geometric and semantic
properties of extensive outdoor scenes without the need for spatial
discretization (thus avoiding the trade-off between level of scene detail and
the scene extent that can be covered).
  We train and evaluate our method on semantically annotated LiDAR scans from

powerful representation that can be decoded into a dense 3D description of a

proven to become a reliable intelligence tool to protect networks against
cyberattacks. Network data features has a great impact on the performances of
ML-based NIDSs. However, evaluating ML models often are not reliable, as each
ML-enabled NIDS is trained and validated using different data features that may
do not contain security events. Therefore, a common ground feature set from
multiple datasets is required to evaluate an ML model's detection accuracy and
its ability to generalise across datasets. This paper presents NetFlow features
from four benchmark NIDS datasets known as UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, and
CSE-CIC-IDS2018 using their publicly available packet capture files. In a

migration speed, which is essentially set by the planetary mass. Small mass
planets migrate in type I migration, while more massive planets migrate in type
II migration, which is thought to depend mostly on the viscous evolution rate
of the disc. A planet is most vulnerable to inward migration before it reaches
type II migration and can lose a significant fraction of its semi-major axis at
this stage. We investigated the influence of different disc viscosities, the
dynamical torque and gas accretion from within the horseshoe region as
mechanisms for slowing down planet migration. Our study confirms that planets
growing in low viscosity environments migrate less, due to the earlier gap
opening and slower type II migration rate. We find that taking the gas
accretion from the horseshoe region into account allows an earlier gap opening
and this results in less inward migration of growing planets. Furthermore, this
effect increases the planetary mass compared to simulations that do not take
the effect of gas accretion from the horseshoe region. Moreover, combining the
effect of the dynamical torque with the effect of gas accretion from the
horseshoe region, significantly slows down inward migration. Taking these
effects into account could allow the formation of cold Jupiters (a > 1 au)
closer to the water ice line region compared to previous simulations that did
not take these effects into account. We thus conclude that gas accretion from
within the horseshoe region and the dynamical torque play crucial roles in
shaping planetary systems.

overparameterized and being trained without explicit regularization. This
curious phenomenon has inspired extensive research activity in establishing its
statistical principles: Under what conditions is it observed? How do these
depend on the data and on the training algorithm? When does regularization
benefit generalization? While such questions remain wide open for deep neural
nets, recent works have attempted gaining insights by studying simpler, often
linear, models. Our paper contributes to this growing line of work by examining
binary linear classification under a generative Gaussian mixture model.
Motivated by recent results on the implicit bias of gradient descent, we study
both max-margin SVM classifiers (corresponding to logistic loss) and min-norm
interpolating classifiers (corresponding to least-squares loss). First, we
leverage an idea introduced in [V. Muthukumar et al., arXiv:2005.08054, (2020)]
to relate the SVM solution to the min-norm interpolating solution. Second, we
derive novel non-asymptotic bounds on the classification error of the latter.
Combining the two, we present novel sufficient conditions on the covariance
spectrum and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under which interpolating
estimators achieve asymptotically optimal performance as overparameterization
increases. Interestingly, our results extend to a noisy model with constant
probability noise flips. Contrary to previously studied discriminative data
models, our results emphasize the crucial role of the SNR and its interplay
with the data covariance. Finally, via a combination of analytical arguments
and numerical demonstrations we identify conditions under which the
interpolating estimator performs better than corresponding regularized
estimates.

of icy dust particles occur with much lower velocities than previously thought.
When these new velocities are considered from laboratory experiments in dust
evolution models, a growth to pebble sizes in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is
difficult. This may contradict (sub-)mm observations and challenge the
formation of planetesimals and planets. We investigate the conditions that are
required in dust evolution models for growing and trapping pebbles in PPDs when
the fragmentation speed is 1ms$^{-1}$ in the entire disk. We distinguish the
parameters controlling the effects of turbulent velocities, vertical stirring,
radial diffusion, and gas viscous evolution, always assuming that particles
cannot diffuse faster (radially or vertically) than the gas. To form pebbles
and produce effective particle trapping, the parameter that controls the
particle turbulent velocities must be small ($\delta_t\lesssim10^{-4}$). In
these cases, the vertical settling can limit the formation of pebbles, which
also prevents particle trapping. Therefore the parameter that sets the vertical
settling of the grains must be $\delta_z<10^{-3}$. Our results suggest that
different combinations of the particle and gas diffusion parameters can lead to
a large diversity of millimeter fluxes and dust-disk radii. When pebble
formation occurs and trapping is efficient, gaps and rings have higher contrast
at mm-emission than in the NIR. In the case of inefficient trapping, structures
are also formed at the two wavelengths, producing deeper and wider gaps in the
NIR. Our results highlight the importance of obtaining observational
constraints of gas and particle diffusion parameters and the properties of gaps
at short and long wavelengths to better understand basic features of PPDs and
the origin of the structures that are observed in these objects.

natural description for smooth stochastic processes when one neglects
stochastic velocity fluctuations. The Schr\""{o}dinger equation is shown to be
the natural exact equation for describing smooth stochastic processes. In
particular, processes with up to quadratic stochastic fluctuations are
electromagnetically coupled quantum point particles. The stochastic derivation
offers a clear geometric picture for Quantum Mechanics as a locally realistic
hidden variable theory. While that sounds paradoxical, we show that Bell's
formula for local realism is incomplete. If one includes smooth stochastic
fluctuations for the hidden variables, local realism is preserved and quantum
mechanics is obtained. Quantum mechanics should therefore be viewed as a
""nondeterministic, non-Bell locally realistic hidden variable theory"". Since
the description is simply a stochastic process, it should be relatively
straightforward to create mesoscopic analogue systems that show all the
hallmarks of Quantum Mechanics, including super-Bell correlations. In fact, any
system that can be described by the linear time evolution of a density matrix
is both a stochastic and a Quantum system from our point of view, since we show
that the existence of a transition probability density directly implies the
existence of a density matrix. Systems for which the stochastic degrees of
freedom vary smoothly over time have quantum Hamiltonians with standard kinetic

VX Sgr based on high-resolution observations combined with AAVSO light curve
data. Given the puzzling characteristics of VX Sgr, we explore three scenarios
for its nature: a massive red supergiant (RSG) or hypergiant (RHG), a Thorne
Zytkow object (TZO), and an extreme Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star.
  Methods. Sampling more than one whole cycle of photometric variability, we
derive stellar atmospheric parameters by using state-of-the-art PHOENIX
atmospheric models. We compare them to optical and near infrared spectral
types. We report on some key features due to neutral elemental atomic species
such as Li I, Ca I, and Rb I.
  Results. We provide new insights into its luminosity, evolutionary stage as
well as its pulsation period. Based on all the data, there are two strong
reasons to believe that VX Sgr is some sort of extreme AGB star. Firstly, its
Mira-like behaviour during active phases. VX Sgr shows light variations with
amplitudes much larger than any known RSG and clearly larger than all RHGs. In
addition, it displays Balmer line emission and, as shown here for the first
time, line doubling of its metallic spectrum at maximum light, both
characteristics typical of Miras. Secondly, unlike any known RSG or RHG, VX Sgr
displays strong Rb I lines. In addition to the photospheric lines that are
sometimes seen, it always shows circumstellar components whose expansion
velocity is compatible with that of the OH masers in the envelope,
demonstrating a continuous enrichment of the outer atmosphere with s-process
elements, a behaviour that can only be explained by third dredge up during the
thermal pulse phase.

{\tau} {\alpha} of fragile su percooled liquids. Using the information of the
configurational entropy and structure we calculate the number of dynamically
free, metastable, and stable neighbors around a central particle. In
supercooled liquids the cooperatively reorganizing clusters (CRCs) in which the
stable neighbors form stable nonchemical bonds with the central particle
emerge. For an event of relaxation to take place these bonds have to reorganize
irreversibly; the energy involved in the processes is the effective activation
energy of relaxation. The theory brings forth a temperature T a and a temper
ature dependent parameter {\psi}(T ) which characterize slowing down of
dynamics on cooling. It is shown that the value of {\psi}(T ) is equal to 1 for
T > T a indicating that the underlying microscopic mechanism of relaxation is
dominated by the entropy driven processes while for T < T a , {\psi}(T )
decreases on cooling indicating the emergence of the energy driven processes.
This crossover of {\psi}(T ) from high to low temperatures explains the
crossover seen in {\tau} {\alpha} . The dynamics of systems that may have
similar static structure but very different dynamics can be understood in terms
of {\psi}(T ). We present results for the Kob-Anderson model for three
densities and show that the calculated values of {\tau} {\alpha} are in
excellent agreement with simulation values for all densities. We also show that
when {\psi}(T ), {\tau} {\alpha} and other quantities are plotted as a function
of T /T a (or T a /T ) the data collapse on master curves.

the nonadiabatic couplings entirely -- the resulting ""quasidiabatic"" states are
still coupled by smaller but nonvanishing residual nonadiabatic couplings,
which are typically neglected. Here, we propose a general method for assessing
the validity of this potentially drastic approximation by comparing quantum
dynamics simulated either with or without the residual couplings. To make the
numerical errors negligible to the errors due to neglecting the residual

the implicit midpoint method. The usefulness of the proposed method is
demonstrated on nonadiabatic simulations in the cubic Jahn--Teller model of
nitrogen trioxide and in the induced Renner--Teller model of hydrogen cyanide.
We find that, depending on the system, initial state, and employed
quasidiabatization scheme, neglecting the residual couplings can result in
wrong dynamics. In contrast, simulations with the exact quasidiabatic
Hamiltonian, which contains the residual couplings, always yield accurate
results.

moment-to-moment interaction with games. In this paper we survey academic
research and publications by practitioners to give a complete overview of the
state of research concerning this aspect of game design, including context from
related areas. We analysed over 200 sources and categorised their content
according to the design purpose presented. This resulted in three different
domains of intended player experiences: physicality, amplification, and
support. In these domains, the act of polishing that determines game feel,
takes the shape of tuning, juicing, and streamlining respectively. Tuning the
physicality of game objects creates cohesion, predictability, and the resulting
movement informs many other design aspects. Juicing is the act of polishing
amplification and it results in empowerment and provides clarity of feedback by
communicating the importance of game events. Streamlining allows a game to act
on the intention of the player, supporting the execution of actions in the
game. These three design intents are the main means through which designers
control minute details of interactivity and inform the player's reaction. This
framework and its nuanced vocabulary can lead to an understanding of game feel
that is shared between practitioners and researchers as highlighted in the
concluding future research section.

randomness? If so, is it many-body Anderson localization? How about the
associated localization transition in the infinite-interaction limit? To tackle
these questions, we study many-body localization (MBL) in a spin-chain model
mimicking the Rydberg-blockade quantum simulator with both infinite-strength
projection and moderate quasiperiodic modulation. Employing exact
diagonalization, Krylov-typicality technique, and time-evolving block
decimation, we identify evidence for a constrained MBL phase stabilized by a
pure quasirandom transverse field. Remarkably, the constrained MBL transition
may embody a discontinuous eigenstate phase transition, whose discontinuity
nature significantly suppresses the finite-size drifts that plague most
numerical studies of conventional MBL transition. Through quantum dynamics, we
find that rotating the modulated field from parallel toward perpendicular to
the projection axis induces an eigenstate transition between the diagonal and
constrained MBL phases. Intriguingly, the entanglement-entropy growth in
constrained MBL follows a double-log form, whereas it changes to a power law in
approaching the diagonal limit. By unveiling the significance of confined
nonlocal effects in integrals of motion of constrained MBL, we show that this
newfound insulating state is not a many-body Anderson insulator. Our
predictions can be tested in Rydberg experiments.

inexpensive method for achieving angular resolutions on microarcsecond scales.
Its low sensitivity has limited intensity interferometric observations to
bright stars so far. Substantial improvements are possible by using avalanche
photodiodes (APDs) as light detectors. Several recent experiments used APDs in
single-photon detection mode; however, these either provide low electronic
bandwidths (few MHz) or require very narrow optical bandpasses. We present here
the results of laboratory measurements with a prototype astronomical intensity
interferometer using two APDs observing an artificial star in continuous
(""linear"") detection mode with an electronic bandwidth of 100~MHz. We find a
photon--photon correlation of about $10^{-6}$, as expected from the ratio of
the coherence times of the light source and the detectors. In a configuration
where both detectors are on the optical axis (zero baseline), we achieve a
signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$2700 after 10 minutes of integration. When
measuring the correlation as a function of baseline, we find a Gaussian
correlation profile with a standard deviation corresponding to an angular
half-width of the artificial star of $0.55''$, in agreement with the estimate
by the manufacturer. Our results demonstrate the possibility to construct large
astronomical intensity interferometers using linear-mode APDs.

strong sources of persistent gravitational wave radiation. HM Cnc and V407 Vul
are undergoing direct impact accretion in which matter transferred from their

of the three and is amongst the most luminous AM CVn stars, but it is not known

dwarfs show evidence for magnetism, none have been found amongst helium
accretors. We present the results of Magellan and VLT spectroscopic and
spectropolarimetric observing campaigns dedicated to ES Cet with the aim of
understanding its accretion structure. We find strong variability in our
spectra on the 620 s period. The lines show evidence for double-peaked
emission, characteristic for an accretion disc, with an additional component
associated with the outermost disc, rather than a direct impact, that is
broadly consistent with ""S""-wave emission from the gas stream/disc impact
region. This confirms beyond any doubt that 620\,s is the orbital period of ES
Cet. We find no significant circular polarisation (below 0.1 %). The trailed
spectra show that ES Cet's outer disc is eclipsed by the mass donor, revealing
at the same time that the photometric minimum coincides with the hitherto
unrecognised eclipse. ES Cet shows spectroscopic behaviour consistent with

prediction module uses 3D convolutional layers and depends on the number of
pose frames supplied, the time difference between each pose frame, and the

Location-based service providers must balance the value they extract from

utility and privacy. Current measurement approaches assume adversaries with
perfect knowledge, thus overestimate the privacy risk. To address this issue we
introduce a model of an adversary with imperfect knowledge about the target.
The model is based on equivalence areas, spatio-temporal regions with a

skill of the adversary. We then derive the standard privacy metrics of
k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness from the definition of equivalence
areas. These metrics can be computed on any dataset, irrespective of whether

long-sought-after collective many-body behavior, has been challenging due to
stringent constraints on the band properties. We argue that the flat bands in
moir\'e graphene fulfill the basic requirements for observing Bloch
oscillations, offering an appealing alternative to the stacked quantum wells
used in previous work aiming to access this regime. Bloch-oscillating moir\'e
superlattices emit a comb-like spectrum of incommensurate frequencies, a
property of interest for converting direct currents into high-frequency
currents and developing broad-band amplifiers in THz domain. The oscillations
can be synchronized through coupling to an oscillator mode in a photonic or
plasmonic resonator. Phase-coherent collective oscillations in the resonant
regime provide a realization of current-pumped THz lasing.

implements important new features: The code accounts for obscuring material in
the polars of the AGN and has the ability to fit X-ray fluxes. In this work, we
use ~2500 spectroscopic, X-ray AGN from the XMM-XXL-North field and examine the
improvements the new features bring in the SED modelling analysis. Based on our
results, X-CIGALE successfully connects the X-ray with the UV luminosity in the
whole range spanned by our sample (log Lx(2-10 keV) = (42 - 46) erg/s). The
addition of the new features globally improves the efficiency of X-CIGALE in
the estimation and characterization of the AGN component. The classification
into type 1 and type 2 based on their inclination angle is improved, especially
at redshifts lower than 1. The statistical significance of the AGN fraction,
fracAGN, measurements is increased, in particular for luminous X-ray sources
(log LX > 45 erg/s). These conclusions hold under the condition that (mid-) IR
photometry is available in the SED fitting process. The addition of polar dust
increases the AGN fraction and the efficiency of the SED decomposition to
detect AGN among X-ray selected sources. X-CIGALE estimates a strong AGN
(fracAGN > 0.3) in more than 90% of the infrared selected AGN and 75% of X-ray
detected AGN not selected by IR colour criteria. The latter drops to ~50% when
polar dust is not included. The ability of X-CIGALE to include X-ray
information in the SED fitting process can be instrumental in the optimal
exploitation of the wealth of data that current (eROSITA) and future (ATHENA)

minimum times has been a staple in eclipsing binary research for decades, due
its simplicity and the independence of external input parameters, which also
makes it well-suited to obtaining timings of exoplanet transits. However, its
estimates of the timing error have been known to have a low reliability. During
the analysis of very precise photometry of CM Draconis eclipses from TESS space
mission data, KvW's original equation for the timing error estimate produced
numerical errors, which evidenced a fundamental problem in this equation. This
contribution introduces an improved approach for calculating the timing error
with the KvW method. A code that implements this improved method, together with
several further updates of the original method, are presented. An example of
the application to CM Draconis light curves from TESS is given. The eclipse
minimum times are derived with the KvW method's three original light curve
folds, but also with five and seven folds. The use of five or more folds
produces minimum timings with a substantially better precision. The improved
method of error calculation delivers consistent timing errors which are in
excellent agreement with error estimates obtained by other means. In the case
of TESS data from CM Draconis, minimum times with an average precision of 1.1
seconds are obtained. Reliable timing errors are also a valuable indicator for
evaluating if a given scatter in an O-C diagram is caused by measurement errors
or by a physical period variation.

buoyancy and rotation generates a Coriolis forces in the fluid. However, due to
the curved surface of the bubble, the buoyancy and Coriolis forces vary with
latitude on the bubble, giving rise to rich flow behavior. We first explore the
single-point properties of the flow, including the Reynolds and Nusselt
numbers, mean fields, and Reynolds stresses, all as a function of latitude. For
a given Rayleigh number, we observe a non-monotonic dependence on the Rossby
number Ro, and large scale mean circulations that are strongly influenced by
rotation. We then consider quantities that reveal the multiscale nature of the
flow, including spectrums and spectral fluxes of kinetic and thermal energy,
and enstrophy, and structure functions of velocity and temperature. The fluxes
show that just a for nonbuoyant two-dimensional turbulence on a flat surface,
there is an upscale flux of kinetic energy at larger scales (fed by buoyancy
injection of turbulent kinetic energy at smaller scales), and a downscale flux
of enstrophy at smaller scales. The kinetic energy spectrum and velocity
structure functions are well described by Bolgiano-Obukhov (BO) scaling at
scales where the effects of rotation are weak. The temperature structure
functions do not, however, satisfy BO scaling in general, due to strong
intermittency in the temperature field.

  Science",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine Learning (ML) techniques for image classification routinely require
many labelled images for training the model and while testing, we ought to use
images belonging to the same domain as those used for training. In this paper,
we overcome the two main hurdles of ML, i.e. scarcity of data and constrained
prediction of the classification model. We do this by introducing a visual
classifier which uses a concept of transfer learning, namely Zero-Shot Learning
(ZSL), and standard Natural Language Processing techniques. We train a
classifier by mapping labelled images to their textual description instead of
training it for specific classes. Transfer learning involves transferring
knowledge across domains that are similar. ZSL intelligently applies the
knowledge learned while training for future recognition tasks. ZSL
differentiates classes as two types: seen and unseen classes. Seen classes are
the classes upon which we have trained our model and unseen classes are the
classes upon which we test our model. The examples from unseen classes have not
been encountered in the training phase. Earlier research in this domain focused
on developing a binary classifier but, in this paper, we present a multi-class
classifier with a Zero-Shot Learning approach.

autonomy implicitly. To address this research gap, we perform a comprehensive
literature review to extract 12 requirements for the design of autonomous

year expenditure (before the effect of limitations). We suggest a regressive
model to investigate the relation between this response variable and a set of
covariates, such as limitations and other rating factors related to health
risk. In this way a dependency structure between reimbursement and limitations
is provided. The density function of the ratio is a mixture distribution,
indeed it can continuously assume values mass at 0 and 1, in addition to the
probability density within (0, 1) . This random variable does not belong to the

GAMLSS introduces a probability structure compliant with the density of the

ferrofluid droplets, addition of polymers caused rebound suppression of the
droplets relatively at lower Bom for a fixed magnetic nanoparticle
concentration and We. We further observed that for a fixed polymer
concentration and We, increasing magnetic nanoparticle concentration also
triggers earlier rebound suppression with increasing Bom. In the absence of the
magnetic nanoparticles, the non-Newtonian droplets do not show rebound
suppression for the range of Bom investigated. Likewise, the Newtonian
ferrofluids show rebound suppression at large Bom. This intriguing interplay of
elastic effects of polymer chains and the magnetic nanoparticles, dubbed as the
magneto-elastic effect is noted to lead to the rebound suppression. We
establish a scaling relationship to show that the rebound suppression is
observed as manifestation of onset of magneto-elastic instability only when the
proposed magnetic Weissenberg number (Wim) exceeds unity. We also put forward a
phase map to identify the various regimes of impact ferrohydrodynamics of such
droplets, and the occurrence of the magneto-elastic effect.

non-equilibrium nature. This lack of stability is a serious issue in many
industrial applications. Here, we show by numerical simulations that the
devitrification of quasi-hard-sphere glasses is prevented by suppressing volume
fraction inhomogeneities. A monodisperse glass known to devitrify with
`avalanche'-like intermittent dynamics is subjected to small iterative
adjustments to particle sizes to make the local volume fractions spatially
uniform. We find that this entirely prevents structural relaxation and
devitrification over aging time scales, even in the presence of crystallites.
There is a dramatic homogenization in the number of load-bearing nearest
neighbors each particle has, indicating that ultra-stable glasses may be formed
via `mechanical homogenization'. Our finding provides a physical principle for
glass stabilization and opens a novel route to the formation of mechanically
stabilized glasses.

(PEs) in one cycle through the express bypass, is a high-performance NoC design
proposed recently. However, if contention occurs, flits with low priority would
not only be buffered but also could not fully utilize bypass. Although there
exist several routing algorithms that decrease contentions by rounding busy
routers and links, they cannot be directly applicable to SMART since it lacks
the support for arbitrary-turn (i.e., the number and direction of turns are
free of constraints) routing. Thus, in this article, to minimize contentions
and further utilize bypass, we propose an improved SMART NoC, called ArSMART,
in which arbitrary-turn transmission is enabled. Specifically, ArSMART divides
the whole NoC into multiple clusters where the route computation is conducted
by the cluster controller and the data forwarding is performed by the
bufferless reconfigurable router. Since the long-range transmission in SMART
NoC needs to bypass the intermediate arbitration, to enable this feature, we
directly configure the input and output ports connection rather than apply
hop-by-hop table-based arbitration. To further explore the higher communication
capabilities, effective adaptive routing algorithms that are compatible with
ArSMART are proposed. The route computation overhead, one of the main concerns
for adaptive routing algorithms, is hidden by our carefully designed control
mechanism. Compared with the state-of-the-art SMART NoC, the experimental
results demonstrate an average reduction of 40.7% in application schedule
length and 29.7% in energy consumption.

multiple parities to jointly train a powerful machine learning model without
sharing their private data. According to the form of collaboration, FL can be
further divided into horizontal federated learning (HFL) and vertical federated
learning (VFL). In HFL, participants share the same feature space and
collaborate on data samples, while in VFL, participants share the same sample
IDs and collaborate on features. VFL has a broader scope of applications and is
arguably more suitable for joint model training between large enterprises.
  In this paper, we focus on VFL and investigate potential privacy leakage in
real-world VFL frameworks. We design and implement two practical privacy
attacks: reverse multiplication attack for the logistic regression VFL
protocol; and reverse sum attack for the XGBoost VFL protocol. We empirically
show that the two attacks are (1) effective - the adversary can successfully
steal the private training data, even when the intermediate outputs are
encrypted to protect data privacy; (2) evasive - the attacks do not deviate
from the protocol specification nor deteriorate the accuracy of the target
model; and (3) easy - the adversary needs little prior knowledge about the data
distribution of the target participant. We also show the leaked information is
as effective as the raw training data in training an alternative classifier. We

Fennoscandian Lapland have been successfully analyzed for their average patch
size, total patch area, and number of patches as a function of event time,
typically 1-2 hr. An automatic routine has been developed to detect patches in
the all-sky camera images. In addition to events with decreasing and increasing
average patch size evolution over the course of the pulsating aurora, events
with no size trends and events with intermittently increasing and decreasing
patch size trends were also found. In this study, we have analyzed a subset of
events for which the average and total patch size systematically increase or
decrease. The events with increasing patch size trend do not experience a
decrease in the peak emission height, which was previously associated with the
behavior of pulsating aurora precipitation. Furthermore, the events with
increasing patch sizes have shorter lifetimes and twice as many
substorm-injected energetic electrons at geosynchronous orbit as the events
with decreasing patch sizes. Half of the events with increasing patch sizes
occur during substorm expansion phases, while a majority (64%) of the ones with
decreasing patch sizes take place during the recovery phase. These findings
suggest that the visual appearance of pulsating aurora may be used as an
indication of the pulsating aurora energy deposition to the atmosphere.

even for this consistent search, the searched cells often suffer from poor
performance, especially for the supernet with fewer layers, as current DARTS

sub-optimal searched cells. In this paper, we alleviate this issue by endowing
the cells with explicit stretchability, so the search can be directly
implemented on our stretchable cells for both operation type and topology
simultaneously. Concretely, we introduce a set of topological variables and a
combinatorial probabilistic distribution to explicitly model the target
topology. With more diverse and complex topologies, our method adapts well for
various layer numbers. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that
our stretchable cells obtain better performance with fewer layers and

hyperbolic Lorentzian spacetime $(M,g)$ with an unknown metric $g$. We consider
measurements done in a neighbourhood $V\subset M$ of a timelike path $\mu$ that
connects a point $x^-$ to a point $x^+$. The measurements are modelled by a
source-to-solution map, which maps a source supported in $V$ to the restriction
of the solution to the Boltzmann equation to the set $V$. We show that the
source-to-solution map uniquely determines the Lorentzian spacetime, up to an
isometry, in the set $I^+(x^-)\cap I^-(x^+)\subset M$. The set $I^+(x^-)\cap
I^-(x^+)$ is the intersection of the future of the point $x^-$ and the past of
the point $x^+$, and hence is the maximal set to where causal signals sent from
$x^-$ can propagate and return to the point $x^+$. The proof of the result is
based on using the nonlinearity of the Boltzmann equation as a beneficial
feature for solving the inverse problem.

Twelve AGB and post--AGB evolutionary sequences were computed with different
values of the parameter in the Blocker mass loss rate formula
($0.01\le\eta_B\le 0.12$). Selected models of evolutionary sequences with
masses $M=0.536M_\odot$, $0.530M_\odot$ and $0.526M_\odot$ that experience the
loop in the Hertzsprung--Russel diagram due to the final helium flash were used
as initial conditions for solution of the equations of hydrodynamics describing
radial stellar oscillations. The region of instability to radial fundamental
mode pulsations is shown to extend from the asymptotic giant branch to
effective temperatures as high as $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx 6\times 10^3$ K.
Pulsation periods of hydrodynamic models are in the range from 15 to 50 day and
agree with periods of W~Vir pulsating stars. The models of intermediate
spectral type fundamental mode pulsators with periods $\Pi > 50$ day locate in
the upper part of the Hertzsprung--Russel diagram in the region of semiregular
pulsating variables. We conclude that W~Vir pulsating variables are the
low--mass post--AGB stars that experience the final helium flash.

  Bayesian meta-analyses",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studies of word production often make use of picture naming tasks, including
the picture word interference task. In this task, participants name pictures
with superimposed distractor words. They typically need more time to name
pictures when the distractor word is semantically related to the picture than
when it is unrelated (the semantic interference effect). The present study
examines the distributional properties of this effect in a series of Bayesian
meta-analyses. Meta-analytic estimates of the semantic interference effect
first show that the effect is present throughout the reaction time distribution
and that it increases throughout the distribution. Second, we find a
correlation between a participant's mean semantic interference effect and the
change in the effect in the tail of the reaction time distribution, which has
been argued to reflect the involvement of selective inhibition in the naming
task. Finally, we show with simulated data that this correlation emerges even
when no inhibition is used to generate the data, which suggests that inhibition
is not needed to explain this relationship.

methods for Bayesian inference in state-space models. In their original
derivation, APFs operate in an extended state space using an auxiliary variable
to improve inference. In this work, we propose optimized auxiliary particle
filters, a framework where the traditional APF auxiliary variables are
interpreted as weights in an importance sampling mixture proposal. Under this
interpretation, we devise a mechanism for proposing the mixture weights that is
inspired by recent advances in multiple and adaptive importance sampling. In
particular, we propose to select the mixture weights by formulating a convex
optimization problem, with the aim of approximating the filtering posterior at
each timestep. Further, we propose a weighting scheme that generalizes previous
results on the APF (Pitt et al. 2012), proving unbiasedness and consistency of
our estimators. Our framework demonstrates significantly improved estimates on
a range of metrics compared to state-of-the-art particle filters at similar
computational complexity in challenging and widely used dynamical models.

system is well approximated by the linearized dynamics around the many body
ground state. In the large-$N$ limit, we compute the ground-state dispersion
relation in the absence of external harmonic potential exactly and use it to
arrive at analytical results for OTOC. We find excellent agreement between our
analytical results and the numerics. We further obtain analytical results in
the limit where only linear and leading nonlinear (in momentum) terms in the
dispersion relation are included. The resulting OTOC is in agreement with
numerics in the vicinity of the edge of the ""light cone"". We find remarkably
distinct features in OTOC below and above $k=3$ in terms of going from non-Airy
behaviour ($1<k<3$) to an Airy universality class ($k>3$). We present certain
additional rich features for the case $k=2$ that stem from the underlying

to utilize reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for the RSS based

adjusting the phase shifts of the signals reflected at the surface, the
localization accuracy in the RIS aided scheme can be improved by choosing the
proper phase shifts with significant differences of RSS values among adjacent

because the decision function for location estimation and the phase shifts are
coupled. To tackle this challenge, we formulate the optimization problem for
the RIS-aided localization, derive the optimal decision function, and design
the phase shift optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the formulated problem
efficiently. Analysis of the proposed RIS aided technique is provided, and the
effectiveness is validated through simulation.

between the polarization and static conductivity modulation caused by
inhomogeneous elastic strains coupled with deformation potential and strain
gradients, which evolve in TMD nanoflake due to the adhesion between the flake

unprecedented 123 sources. Of these, 41 do not have X-ray counterparts, of
which 34 also do not display near-infrared counterparts. Since these cannot be
explained by extragalactic background sources, this suggests a component of the
ONC population of young stellar objects that are too deeply embedded for even
X-rays to be detectable. We find pervasive variability and detect even most of
the highest-S/N sources in only one out of four epochs. Neither a negative
spectral index nor extreme variability in the VLA data is a good predictor of a
VLBA detection.

and deteriorate the quality of the results. Underground problems often involve
the motion of fluids where the fundamental governing equation is the Darcy law.
High quality velocity fields are of paramount importance for the successful
subsequent coupling with other physical phenomena such as transport. The
virtual element method, as solution scheme, is known to be applicable in
problems whose discretizations requires cells of general shape, and the mixed
formulation is here preferred to obtain accurate velocity fields. To overcome
the issues associated to the complex geometries and, at the same time,
retaining the quality of the solutions, we present here the virtual element
method to solve the Darcy problem, in mixed form, in presence of curved

Gaussian process (TGP) models to elucidate aircraft's approach and landing

strengths of sparse variational Gaussian process and polar Gaussian process to
learn from a large amount of data in cylindrical coordinates. We examine TGP
qualitatively and quantitatively by synthesizing three complex trajectory

Empirically, TGP demonstrates superior modeling performance. When applied to
operational A-SMGCS data, TGP provides the generative probabilistic description

Bennu in close proximity since December 2018. In this work, we investigate
spectral phase reddening -- that is, the variation of spectral slope with phase
angle -- on Bennu using spectra acquired by the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed
Spectrometer (OVIRS) covering a phase angle range of 8-130$^{o}$. We
investigate this process at the global scale and for some localized regions of
interest (ROIs), including boulders, craters, and the designated sample
collection sites of the OSIRIS-REx mission. Bennu has a globally negative
spectra slope, which is typical of B-type asteroids. The spectral slope gently
increases in a linear way up to a phase angle of 90$^{\circ}$, where it
approaches zero. The spectral phase reddening is monotonic and
wavelength-dependent with highest values in the visible range. Its coefficient
is 0.00044 $\mu$m$^{-1} ~deg^{-1}$ in the 0.55-2.5 $\mu$m range.
  For observations of Bennu acquired at high phase angle (130$^{\circ}$), phase
reddening increases exponentially. Similar behavior was reported in the
literature for the carbonaceous chondrite Mukundpura in spectra acquired at
extreme geometries. Some ROIs, including the sample collection site,
Nightingale, have a steeper phase reddening coefficient than the global
average, potentially indicating a surface covered by fine material with high
micro-roughness. The gentle spectral phase reddening effect on Bennu is similar
to that observed in ground-based measurements of other B-type asteroids, but
much lower than that observed for other low-albedo bodies such as Ceres or
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Monotonic reddening may be associated with the
presence of fine particles at micron scales and/or of particles with fractal
structure that introduce micro- and sub-micro roughness across the surface of
Bennu.

less is known about the genuine quantum correlations that can be exhibited by
temporal processes. Employing the quantum comb formalism, processes in time can
be mapped onto quantum states, with the crucial difference that temporal
correlations have to satisfy causal ordering, while their spatial counterpart
is not constrained in the same way. Here, we exploit this equivalence and use
the tools of multipartite entanglement theory to provide a comprehensive
picture of the structure of correlations that (causally ordered) temporal
quantum processes can display. First, focusing on the case of a process that is
probed at two points in time -- which can equivalently be described by a
tripartite quantum state -- we provide necessary as well as sufficient
conditions for the presence of bipartite entanglement in different splittings.
Next, we connect these scenarios to the previously studied concepts of quantum
memory, entanglement breaking superchannels, and quantum steering, thus
providing both a physical interpretation for entanglement in temporal quantum
processes, and a determination of the resources required for its creation.
Additionally, we construct explicit examples of W-type and GHZ-type genuinely
multipartite entangled two-time processes and prove that genuine multipartite
entanglement in temporal processes can be an emergent phenomenon. Finally, we
show that genuinely entangled processes across multiple times exist for any
number of probing times.

astrophysical sources. In particular, AMS-02 observations provide compelling
evidence for a new source of positrons and electrons whose origin is still
unknown. Plausible scenarios include either the contribution of dark matter or
unresolved astrophysical sources, such as nearby pulsars. It has been shown
that explanations based mostly on dark matter, tend to overproduce gamma-rays,
entering in conflict with measurements of the extra-galactic gamma-ray
background (EGB). Although this situation seems to be quite generic, it
ultimately depends on the properties of the dark matter candidate. In this work
we revisit a model in which the gravitino is a dark matter candidate decaying
to SM particles through R-parity violating couplings. We show that decay
channels allowed by trilinear couplings produce more electrons and positrons
and fewer photons in comparison to channels allowed by bilinear couplings.
Indeed, when considering AMS-02 data alone we find that the trilinear model is
compatible with EGB constraints. However, this result may change when DAMPE or
CALET measurements of the sum of electrons and positrons fluxes are considered
instead of AMS-02 data. Therefore, in order to evaluate this model further,
discrepancies between the data collected by these experiments need to be
clarified

the large size of the point spread function (PSF) compared to the astrometric

mass function of dark matter are chosen as exponential or power-law form or in
their product form. Using suitable dimensionless variables the Einstein field
equations and the conservation equations constitute an autonomous system. The
stability of the non-hyperbolic critical points are analyzed by using center
manifold theory. Finally, cosmological phase transitions have been detected
through bifurcation analysis which has been done by Poincar\'{e} index theory.

theologians, is now actively pursued by scientists of many stripes. This paper
studies consciousness from the perspective of theoretical computer science. It
formalizes the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) originated by cognitive
neuroscientist Bernard Baars and further developed by him, Stanislas Dehaene,
and others. Our major contribution lies in the precise formal definition of a
Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), also called a Conscious AI. We define the CTM
in the spirit of Alan Turing's simple yet powerful definition of a computer,
the Turing Machine (TM). We are not looking for a complex model of the brain
nor of cognition but for a simple model of (the admittedly complex concept of)
consciousness. After formally defining CTM, we give a formal definition of
consciousness in CTM. We then suggest why the CTM has the feeling of
consciousness. The reasonableness of the definitions and explanations can be
judged by how well they agree with commonly accepted intuitive concepts of
human consciousness, the breadth of related concepts that the model explains
easily and naturally, and the extent of its agreement with scientific evidence.

elements related to device reliability. For cohesive zone modelling,
traction-separation relations represent the adhesive interactions across
interfaces. However, existing theoretical models do not currently capture
traction-separation relations that have been extracted using direct methods,
particularly under mixed-mode conditions. Given the complexity of the problem,
models derived from the neural network approach are attractive. Although they
can be trained to fit data along the loading paths taken in a particular set of
mixed-mode fracture experiments, they may fail to obey physical laws for paths
not covered by the training data sets. In this paper, a thermodynamically
consistent neural network (TCNN) approach is established to model the
constitutive behavior of interfaces when faced with sparse training data sets.
Accordingly, three conditions are examined and implemented here: (i)
thermodynamic consistency, (ii) maximum energy dissipation path control and
(iii) J-integral conservation. These conditions are treated as constraints and
are implemented as such in the loss function. The feasibility of this approach
is demonstrated by comparing the modeling results with a range of physical
constraints. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is then adopted to
optimize the weight factors associated with each of the constraints in order to
overcome convergence issues that can arise when multiple constraints are
present. The resultant numerical implementation of the ideas presented here
produced well-behaved, mixed-mode traction separation surfaces that maintained
the fidelity of the experimental data that was provided as input. The proposed
approach heralds a new autonomous, point-to-point constitutive modeling concept
for interface mechanics.

sum-rate of all robots by jointly optimizing trajectories and NOMA decoding

of the AP, subject to the quality of service (QoS) of each robot. To tackle
this problem, a dueling double deep Q-network (D^{3}QN) based algorithm is
invoked for jointly determining the phase shift matrix and robots'
trajectories. Specifically, the trajectories for robots contain a set of local
optimal positions, which reveals that robots make the optimal decision at each
step. Numerical results demonstrated that the proposed D^{3}QN algorithm
outperforms the conventional algorithm, while the performance of IRS-NOMA

  Networks: Possible Configurations and Opportunities",,,,,"cs.IT cs.SY eess.SY math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Two emerging technologies, cognitive radio (CR) and free-space optical (FSO)
communication, have created much interest both in academia and industry
recently as they can fully utilize the spectrum while providing cost-efficient
secure communication. In this article, motivated by the mounting interest in CR
and FSO systems and by their ability to be rapidly deployed for civil and
military applications, particularly in emergency situations, we propose a CR
enabled radio frequency (RF)/FSO communication model for an aerial relay
network. In the proposed model, CR enabled RF communication is employed for a
ground-to-air channel to exploit the advantages of CR, including spectrum
efficiency, multi-user connectivity, and spatial diversity. For an air-to-air
channel, FSO communication is used, since the air-to-air path can provide
perfect line-of-sight connectivity, which is vital for FSO systems. Finally,
for an air-to-ground channel, a hybrid RF/FSO communication system is employed,
where the RF communication functions as a backup for the FSO communication in
the presence of adverse weather conditions. The proposed communication model is
shown to be capable of fully utilizing the frequency spectrum, while
effectively dealing with RF network problems of spectrum mobility and
underutilization, especially for emergency conditions when multiple unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed.

architecture inspired by the algorithmic unfolding of the iterative weighted

(UWMMSE). The learnable weights within UWMMSE are parameterized using graph
neural networks (GNNs), where the time-varying underlying graphs are given by
the fading interference coefficients in the wireless network. These GNNs are
trained through a gradient descent approach based on multiple instances of the
power allocation problem. Once trained, UWMMSE achieves performance comparable
to that of WMMSE while significantly reducing the computational complexity.
This phenomenon is illustrated through numerical experiments along with the
robustness and generalization to wireless networks of different densities and

essential task for multimodal assistants as it confirms whether they have
understood the object and scene in the images properly. The research in visual
question answering (VQA) and visual question generation (VQG) is a great step.
However, this research does not capture questions that a visually-abled person
would ask multimodal assistants. Recently published datasets such as KB-VQA,
FVQA, and OK-VQA try to collect questions that look for external knowledge
which makes them appropriate for multimodal assistants. However, they still
contain many obvious and common-sense questions that humans would not usually
ask a digital assistant. In this paper, we provide a new benchmark dataset that
contains questions generated by human annotators keeping in mind what they
would ask multimodal digital assistants. Large scale annotations for several
hundred thousand images are expensive and time-consuming, so we also present an
effective way of automatically generating questions from unseen images. In this
paper, we present an approach for generating diverse and meaningful questions
that consider image content and metadata of image (e.g., location, associated
keyword). We evaluate our approach using standard evaluation metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr to show the relevance of generated questions
with human-provided questions. We also measure the diversity of generated
questions using generative strength and inventiveness metrics. We report new
state-of-the-art results on the public and our datasets.

proximal algorithms, for example, the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), with advanced denoising priors. Over the past few years,
great empirical success has been obtained by PnP algorithms, especially for the
ones that integrate deep learning-based denoisers. However, a key challenge of
PnP approaches is the need for manual parameter tweaking as it is essential to
obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy in imaging conditions
and varying scene content. In this work, we present a class of tuning-free PnP
proximal algorithms that can determine parameters such as denoising strength,
termination time, and other optimization-specific parameters automatically. A
core part of our approach is a policy network for automated parameter search
which can be effectively learned via a mixture of model-free and model-based
deep reinforcement learning strategies. We demonstrate, through rigorous
numerical and visual experiments, that the learned policy can customize
parameters to different settings, and is often more efficient and effective
than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover, we discuss several practical
considerations of PnP denoisers, which together with our learned policy yield
state-of-the-art results. This advanced performance is prevalent on both linear
and nonlinear exemplar inverse imaging problems, and in particular shows
promising results on compressed sensing MRI, sparse-view CT, single-photon
imaging, and phase retrieval.
