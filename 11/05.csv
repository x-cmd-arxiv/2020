the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the identification of facial masks
can be imperative to ensure public safety. Detection of facial masks in video
footages is a challenging task primarily due to the fact that the masks
themselves behave as occlusions to face detection algorithms due to the absence
of facial landmarks in the masked regions. In this work, we propose an approach
for detecting facial masks in videos using deep learning. The proposed
framework capitalizes on the MTCNN face detection model to identify the faces
and their corresponding facial landmarks present in the video frame. These
facial images and cues are then processed by a neoteric classifier that
utilises the MobileNetV2 architecture as an object detector for identifying
masked regions. The proposed framework was tested on a dataset which is a
collection of videos capturing the movement of people in public spaces while
complying with COVID-19 safety protocols. The proposed methodology demonstrated
its effectiveness in detecting facial masks by achieving high precision,

vitro renal tubule models that allow manipulation of various mechanical
factors, facilitating studies of disease pathophysiology and drug discovery.
Here we report development of a novel in vitro assay system comprised of a
renal tubule within an elasto-plastic extracellular matrix microenvironment.
This in vitro tubule mimetic device consists of a container with two,
pipette-accessible ports, filament-deposition (3D-) printed into 35 mm cell
culture dishes. The container is filled with a hydrogel, such as a collagen I
or fibrin gel, while a narrow masking tube is threaded through the ports.
Following gelation, the masking material is pulled out leaving a tunnel within
the gel. Seeding of the tunnels with M1 or MDCK renal epithelial cells through
the side ports results in a monolayer with apical-basal polarity, such that
laminin and fibronectin are present on the basal surface, while primary cilia
project from the apical side of cells into the tubular lumen. The device is
optically accessible, and can be live-imaged by phase contrast or
epifluorescence microscopy. The lumen of the epithelial-lined tube can be
connected through the side ports to a circulatory flow. We demonstrate that
kidney epithelial cells are able to adjust the diameter of the model tubule by
myosin-II dependent contractility. Furthermore, cells of the tubule are also
able to remodel the surrounding hydrogel leading to budding from the main
tubule. We propose that this versatile in vitro model system can be developed
into a future pre-clinical tool to study pathophysiology of kidney diseases and
identify therapeutic compounds.

every task reward has equal influence on the final RL value function.
Additionally, we introduce a communication method that helps agents cooperate

an amplitude mis-match of around $35\%$ when assuming $\Lambda$CDM with Planck
Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB) constraints. This offset is independent
of halo mass and radial scale in the range $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{13.3} -

mass and scale independent places important constraints on the degree to which

functions dispatched over the nodes of a communication network. Previous works
on the subject either focus on synchronous algorithms, which can be heavily
slowed down by a few slow nodes (the straggler problem), or consider a model of
asynchronous operation (Boyd et al., 2006) in which adjacent nodes communicate
at the instants of Poisson point processes. We have two main contributions. 1)
We propose CACDM (a Continuously Accelerated Coordinate Dual Method), and for
the Poisson model of asynchronous operation, we prove CACDM to converge to
optimality at an accelerated convergence rate in the sense of Nesterov et
Stich, 2017. In contrast, previously proposed asynchronous algorithms have not
been proven to achieve such accelerated rate. While CACDM is based on discrete
updates, the proof of its convergence crucially depends on a continuous time
analysis. 2) We introduce a new communication scheme based on Loss-Networks,
that is programmable in a fully asynchronous and decentralized way, unlike the
Poisson model of asynchronous operation that does not capture essential aspects
of asynchrony such as non-instantaneous communications and computations. Under
this Loss-Network model of asynchrony, we establish for CDM (a Coordinate Dual
Method) a rate of convergence in terms of the eigengap of the Laplacian of the
graph weighted by local effective delays. We believe this eigengap to be a
fundamental bottleneck for convergence rates of asynchronous optimization.
Finally, we verify empirically that CACDM enjoys an accelerated convergence
rate in the Loss-Network model of asynchrony.

the condensation of Cooper pairs in a superconductor. It is expected to occur
in a semiconductor at thermodynamic equilibrium if the binding energy of the
excitons---electron (e) and hole (h) pairs interacting by Coulomb
force---overcomes the band gap, giving rise to a new phase: the 'excitonic
insulator' (EI). Transition metal dichalcogenides are excellent candidates for
the EI realization because of reduced Coulomb screening, and indeed a
structural phase transition was observed in few-layer systems. However,
previous work could not disentangle to which extent the origin of the
transition was in the formation of bound excitons or in the softening of a
phonon. Here we focus on bulk MoS2 and demonstrate theoretically that at high
pressure it is prone to the condensation of genuine excitons of finite
momentum, whereas the phonon dispersion remains regular. Starting from
first-principles many-body perturbation theory, we also predict that the
self-consistent electronic charge density of the EI sustains an out-of-plane
permanent electric dipole moment with an antiferroelectric texture in the layer
plane: At the onset of the EI phase, those optical phonons that share the
exciton momentum provide a unique Raman fingerprint for the EI formation.
Finally, we identify such fingerprint in a Raman feature that was previously
observed experimentally, thus providing direct spectroscopic confirmation of an
ideal excitonic insulator phase in bulk MoS2 above 30 GPa.

filters. The vertebra-phantom study contained high resolution peripheral and
clinical CT scans with simulated in vivo CT noise and nine repetitions of three
different tube currents (100, 250 and 360 mAs). Five-fold cross validation was
performed on 20466 purely spongy pairs of noisy and ground-truth patches.
Comparison of training and test errors revealed high robustness against
over-fitting. While not showing effects for the assessment of BMD and
voxel-wise densities, the filter improved thoroughly the computation of TMD and
BV/TV with respect to the unfiltered data. Root-mean-square and accuracy errors
of low resolution TMD and BV/TV decreased to less than 17% of the initial
values. Furthermore filtered low resolution scans revealed still more TMD- and
BV/TV-relevant information than high resolution CT scans, either unfiltered or
filtered with two state-of-the-art standard denoising methods. The proposed
architecture is threshold and rotational invariant, applicable on a wide range
of image resolutions at once, and likely serves for an accurate computation of
further micro-structural parameters. Furthermore, it is less prone for
over-fitting than neural networks that compute structural parameters directly.
In conclusion, the method is potentially important for the diagnosis of
osteoporosis and other bone diseases since it allows to assess relevant 3D
micro-structural information from standard low exposure CT protocols such as
100 mAs and 120 kVp.

quasi-dynamical limits are compared to mass estimates from modelling of X-ray

the 2011 modulation having a fractional period excess $< 0.6\%$ (3$\sigma$). We
propose that direct irradiation of the donor by the central X-ray source was
not possible due to its occultation by the disc outer regions. We argue that
disc shielding significantly weakens the donor star contribution to the optical
variability in systems with $q\lesssim0.07$, including neutron star
ultra-compact X-ray binaries.

exponential models to the radio images. From these flux densities, we determine
the cluster mass (M$_{500}$) and Compton Y parameter (Y$_{500}$) 150 MHz radio

halos. We find that the slopes of these relations are steeper than those
determined from the 1.4 GHz radio powers. However, considering the

After training the convolutional neural network with the hierarchical group

performance in computer vision tasks, while their enormous amount of parameters
results in increased computational cost and overfitting. Several methods have
been proposed to compress the size of the networks without reducing network
performance. Network pruning can reduce redundant and unnecessary parameters
from a network. Knowledge distillation can transfer the knowledge of deeper and
wider networks to smaller networks. The performance of the smaller network
obtained by these methods is bounded by the predefined network. Neural
architecture search has been proposed, which can search automatically the
architecture of the networks to break the structure limitation. Also, there is
a dynamic configuration method to train networks incrementally as sub-networks.
In this paper, we present a novel incremental training algorithm for deep
neural networks called planting. Our planting can search the optimal network
architecture with smaller number of parameters for improving the network
performance by augmenting channels incrementally to layers of the initial
networks while keeping the earlier trained parameters fixed. Also, we propose
using the knowledge distillation method for training the channels planted. By
transferring the knowledge of deeper and wider networks, we can grow the
networks effectively and efficiently. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on different datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 and STL-10. For the

patterns from human data for tackling the whether-when-what tasks is of
critical importance for AVs. There is, however, no clear definition and

component. To investigate the wind of lambda And, we use the derived magnetic
map to simulate two stellar wind scenarios, namely a polytropic wind
(thermally-driven) and an Alfven-wave driven wind with turbulent dissipation.
From our 3D magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we calculate the wind thermal
emission and compare it to previously published radio observations and more
recent VLA observations, which we present here. These observations show a basal
sub-mJy quiescent flux level at ~5 GHz and, at epochs, a much larger flux
density (>37 mJy), likely due to radio flares. By comparing our model results
with the radio observations of lambda And, we can constrain its mass-loss rate
Mdot. There are two possible conclusions. 1) Assuming the quiescent radio
emission originates from the stellar wind, we conclude that lambda And has Mdot
~ 3e-9 Msun/yr, which agrees with the evolving mass-loss rate trend for evolved

global minima of zero training error. We explain how common variants of the

explicit how the size of the initialization of a strongly overparameterized NN
affects the minimizer and can deteriorate its final test performance. We
propose a strategy to limit this effect. Then, we demonstrate that for adaptive
optimization such as AdaGrad, the obtained minimizer generally differs from the
gradient descent (GD) minimizer. This adaptive minimizer is changed further by
stochastic mini-batch training, even though in the non-adaptive case, GD and
stochastic GD result in essentially the same minimizer. Lastly, we explain that
these effects remain relevant for less overparameterized NNs. While
overparameterization has its benefits, our work highlights that it induces
sources of error absent from underparameterized models.

very different, and these two processes produce distinct abundance patterns.
Thus, the observational evidence of the double enhancement seen in CEMP-r/s

this work, we have critically analysed the observed abundances of heavy

is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. Using
German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates from
multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent
variations in effective IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different
methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged
IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and
time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of
confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected
individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark
figures of infections. Results show that effective IFRs in Germany are
estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions of confirmed cases and
estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In
particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and
autumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution
of confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR
estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is
estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and
time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs
indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in
observed mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of
infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective IFRs and observed
CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while a moderately increasing
gap can be observed during the second wave. Further research is warranted to
obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates.

Existence of a parallel spinor on $(M,g)$ induces a system of constraint

an exterior differential system involving a cohomological condition on the

  We prove that the $2$-Level Quasi-Planarity problem is NP-complete. This
answers an open question of Dujmovi\'c, P\'{o}r, and Wood. Furthermore, we show
that the problem becomes linear-time solvable if the ordering of the vertices

  Our linear-time algorithm exploits several ingredients, including a
combinatorial characterization of the positive instances of the problem in
terms of the existence of a planar embedding with a caterpillar-like structure,
and an SPQR-tree-based algorithm for testing the existence of such a planar

embeddings with respect to the structure of the portion of the caterpillar they
contain and performs a computation of the realizable embedding types based on a
succinct description of their features by means of constant-size gadgets.

transition, there are fluctuations of the order parameter, which reside beyond
the mean-field approximation. Such critical fluctuations usually occur in a
very narrow temperature window in contrast to Gaussian fluctuations. Here, we
report on a study of specific heat in graphite subject to high magnetic field
when all carriers are confined in the lowest Landau levels. The observation of
a BCS-like specific heat jump in both temperature and field sweeps establishes
that the phase transition discovered decades ago in graphite is of the
second-order. The jump is preceded by a steady field-induced enhancement of the
electronic specific heat. A modest (20 percent) reduction in the amplitude of
the magnetic field (from 33 T to 27 T) leads to a threefold decrease of T$_c$
and a drastic widening of the specific heat anomaly, which acquires a tail
spreading to two times T$_c$. We argue that the steady departure from the
mean-field BCS behavior is the consequence of an exceptionally large Ginzburg
number in this dilute metal, which grows steadily as the field lowers. Our fit
of the critical fluctuations indicates that they belong to the $3DXY$
universality class, similar to the case of $^4$He superfluid transition.

quality of the measured spectra of solar-like oscillators. Their $p$-mode line
profiles can now be resolved, and the asymmetries inferred for a variety of
stars other than the Sun. However, it has been known for a long time that the
asymmetries of solar $p$-modes are reversed between the velocity and the
intensity spectra. Understanding the origin of this reversal is necessary in
order to use asymmetries as a tool for seismic diagnosis. For stars other than
the Sun, only the intensity power spectrum is sufficiently resolved to allow
for an estimation of mode asymmetries. We recently developed an approach
designed to model and predict these asymmetries in the velocity power spectrum
of the Sun and to successfully compare them to their observationally derived
counterparts. In this paper we expand our model and predict the asymmetries
featured in the intensity power spectrum. We find that the shape of the mode
line profiles in intensity is largely dependent on how the oscillation-induced
variations of the radiative flux are treated, and that modelling it
realistically is crucial to understanding asymmetry reversal. Perturbing a
solar-calibrated grey atmosphere model, and adopting the quasi-adiabatic
framework as a first step, we reproduce the asymmetries observed in the solar
intensity spectrum for low-frequency modes. We conclude that, unlike previously
thought, it is not necessary to invoke an additional mechanism (e.g.
non-adiabatic effects, coherent non-resonant background signal) to explain
asymmetry reversal. This additional mechanism is necessary, however, to explain
asymmetry reversal for higher-order modes.

Weinberg has noted that some ease of calculation and insight can be achieved by
looking at the structure of the perturbed light cone on which the perturbed

specialized to fluctuations around the standard Robertson-Walker cosmological
model with vanishing spatial three-curvature. In this paper we generalize this
analysis by providing a gauge invariant treatment in which no choice of gauge
is made, and by considering geometries with non-vanishing spatial
three-curvature. By using the scalar, vector, tensor fluctuation basis we find
that the relevant gauge invariant combinations that appear in the light cone
temperature fluctuations have no explicit dependence on the spatial curvature
even if the spatial curvature of the background geometry is nonvanishing. We
find that a not previously considered, albeit not too consequential,
temperature fluctuation at the observer has to be included in order to enforce
gauge invariance. As well as working with comoving time we also work with
conformal time in which a background metric of any given spatial
three-curvature can be written as a time-dependent conformal factor (the
comoving time expansion radius as written in conformal time) times a static
Robertson-Walker geometry of the same spatial three-curvature. For temperature
fluctuations on the light cone this conformal factor drops out identically.
Thus the gauge invariant combinations that appear in the photon temperature
fluctuations have no explicit dependence on either the conformal factor or the
spatial three-curvature at all.

First we observe that the problem can be regarded as a special case of finding
a minimum-weight vertex cover in a $d$-partite hypergraph. Next, we study the
natural LP relaxation, which can be solved in polynomial time for fixed $d$ and
-- for time-cost tradeoff instances -- up to an arbitrarily small error in
general. Improving on prior work of Lov\'asz and of Aharoni, Holzman and
Krivelevich, we describe a deterministic algorithm with approximation ratio
slightly less than $\frac{d}{2}$ for minimum-weight vertex cover in $d$-partite
hypergraphs for fixed $d$ and given $d$-partition. This is tight and yields
also a $\frac{d}{2}$-approximation algorithm for general time-cost tradeoff
instances. We also study the inapproximability and show that no better
approximation ratio than $\frac{d+2}{4}$ is possible, assuming the Unique Games
Conjecture and $\text{P}\neq\text{NP}$. This strengthens a result of Svensson,

annealing and low-energy-fluence PLD, we obtain a two-dimensional growth mode
of the YMO films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with ultralow roughness
and devoid of misoriented nanocrystalline inclusions. By inserting a
sacrificial manganite layer capped with conducting indium-tin oxide between the
substrate and the final film, the latter is grown in a fully lattice-relaxed
mode and, thus, without any misfit dislocations while maintaining the
extraordinary flatness of the films grown directly on pre-annealed YSZ. This
provides a template for the fabrication of heterostructures based on hexagonal
manganites as promising class of multiferroics with improper room-temperature
ferroelectricity and the implementation of these into technologically relevant
epitaxial metal|ferroelectric-type multilayers.

varying the ratio $g=J_2/J_1$ of the intertrimer and intratrimer coupling

into to a similar continuum of width $\propto J_2$ when $g\to 0$. The

\emph{quartons} which fractionalize with increasing $g$ to form the

between the low-energy spinon branch and the high-energy band with mixed
doublons, quartons, and spinons closes. These features should be observable in
inelastic neutron scattering experiments if a quasi-one-dimensional quantum

technologies are not constrained by this shot-noise limit. In this regard, the
possibility of using every photon produced by quantum sources of light to
estimate small physical parameters, beyond the shot-noise limit, constitutes
one of the main goals of quantum optics. Here we experimentally demonstrate a
scalable protocol for quantum-enhanced optical phase estimation across a broad
range of phases, with neither pre- nor post-selected measurements. This is
achieved through the efficient design of a source of spontaneous parametric
down-conversion in combination with photon-number-resolving detection. The
robustness of two-mode squeezed vacuum states against loss allows us to
outperform schemes based on N00N states, in which the loss of a single photon
is enough to remove all phase information from a quantum state. In contrast to
other schemes that rely on N00N states or conditional measurements, the
sensitivity of our technique could be improved through the generation and
detection of high-order photon pairs. This unique feature of our protocol makes
it scalable. Our work is important for quantum technologies that rely on
multiphoton interference such as quantum imaging, boson sampling and quantum
networks.

a crucial element in the search for further multimessenger signals from these
cataclysmic events. The localization of these events in low-latency uses
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series from matched-filtered searches which
identify candidate events. Here we report on an improvement to the GstLAL-based
inspiral pipeline, the low-latency pipeline that identified GW170817 and
GW190425, which automates the use of SNRs from all detectors in the network in
rapid localization of GW events. This improvement was incorporated into the
detection pipeline prior to the recent third observing run of the Advanced LIGO
and Advanced Virgo detector network. Previously for this pipeline, manual
intervention was required to use SNRs from all detectors if a candidate GW
event was below an SNR threshold for any detector in the network. The use of
SNRs from subthreshold events can meaningfully decrease the area of the 90%
confidence region estimated by rapid localization. To demonstrate this, we
present a study of the simulated detections of $\mathcal{O}(2\times10^4)$
binary neutron stars using a network mirroring the second observational run of
the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. When incorporating subthreshold SNRs in
rapid localization, we find that the fraction of events that can be localized
down to $100~\mathrm{deg}^2$ or smaller increases by a factor 1.18.

although the phylogeny is fundamentally tree-like, horizontal transmission is
common and populations never become fully isolated from one another. In
addition, we found evidence that electronic music diversity has increased

diffraction patterns, which preserve the visual information upto a certain
extent determined by the size of the point spread functions, like airy disks in
some cases. A highly diverging beam can be exploited to reduce the spatial
extent of these point spread functions relatively in the transformed projective

principle has been experimentally validated by the lensless imaging of red

which is a short phase of outbursts and so comparatively rarely observed. Two
plateaus in flux are separated by a variable interval lasting ~10 ks, which
shows dipping then flaring stages. The variability is strongest (with
fractional variability up to $F_{\rm Var}\sim10\%$) at high energies and
reduces as the contribution from disc emission becomes stronger. Flux-resolved
spectra show that the variability is primarily due to the power law flux
changing. We also find a long soft lag of the thermal behind the power law
emission, which is $20_{-1.2}^{+1.6}$ s during the flaring phase. The lag
during the dipping stage has a different lag-energy spectrum, which may be due
to a wave passing outwards through the disc. Time resolved spectral fitting
suggests that the lag during the flaring stage may be due to the disc
re-filling after being disrupted to produce the power law flare, perhaps
related to the system settling after the jet ejection which occurred around 1
day before. The timescales of these phenomena imply a low viscosity parameter,
$\alpha\sim10^{-3}$, for the inner region of the disc.

normal Fermi liquid to a superconducting phase. Even while the former is
relatively simple and well understood, the superconducting state is not even
after 25 years of study. More recently it has been found that critical
temperatures can be enhanced by application of uniaxial strain, up to a
critical strain, after which it falls off. In this work, we take an
`instability' approach and seek for divergences in susceptibilities. This
provides an unbiased way to distinguish tendencies to competing ground states.
We show that in the unstrained compound the singlet and triplet instabilities
of the normal Fermi liquid phase are closely spaced. Under uniaxial strain
electrons residing on all orbitals contributing to the Fermiology become more
coherent while the electrons of Ru-$d_{xy}$ character become heavier and
electrons of Ru-$d_{xz,yz}$ characters become lighter. In the process,
Im\,$\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ increases rapidly around the incommensurate
vector $\mathbf{q}{=}(0.3,0.3,0)2\pi/a$ while it gets suppressed at all other
commensurate vectors, in particular at $q{=}0$, which is essential for
spin-triplet superconductivity. Thus the triplet superconducting instability
remains the lagging instability of the system and the singlet instability
enhances under strain, leading to a large energy-scale separation between these
competing instabilities. At large strain an instability to a spin density wave
overtakes the superconducting one. The analysis relies on a high-fidelity,
\emph{ab initio} description of the one-particle properties and two-particle
susceptibilities, based on the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent \emph{GW}
approximation augmented by Dynamical Mean Field theory. This approach is
described and its high fidelity confirmed by comparing to observed one- and
two-particle properties.

measured to sub-percent precision with upcoming surveys, enabling tight
constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and other cosmological parameters.
Measuring the lensing power spectrum involves the estimation of the connected
trispectrum of the four-point function of the CMB map, which requires the
subtraction of a large Gaussian disconnected noise bias. This reconstruction
noise bias receives contributions both from CMB and foreground fluctuations as
well as instrument noise (both detector and atmospheric noise for ground-based
surveys). The debiasing procedure therefore relies on the quality of
simulations of the instrument noise which may be expensive or inaccurate. We
propose a new estimator that makes use of at least four splits of the CMB maps
with independent instrument noise. This estimator makes the CMB lensing power
spectrum completely insensitive to any assumptions made in modeling or
simulating the instrument noise. We show that this estimator, in many practical
situations, leads to no substantial loss in signal-to-noise. We provide an
efficient algorithm for its computation that scales with the number of splits
$m$ as $\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ as opposed to a naive $\mathcal{O}(m^4)$ expectation.

the central stars with gas at a high accretion rate, but their growth may be
terminated in the middle due to the stellar ionizing radiation if the accretion
is intermittent and its quiescent periods are longer than the Kelvin-Helmholtz

the ionizing radiation feedback based on the accretion history in two possible
SMS-forming clouds extracted from cosmological simulations, following their
evolution with vertically-integrated two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
with detailed thermal and chemical models. The consistent treatment of the gas
thermal evolution is crucial for obtaining the realistic accretion history, as
we demonstrate by performing an additional run with a barotropic equation of
state, in which the fluctuation of the accretion rate is artificially
suppressed. We find that although the accretion becomes intermittent due to the
formation of spiral arms and clumps in gravitationally unstable disks, the
quiescent periods are always shorter than the KH timescales, implying that SMSs
can form without affected by the ionizing radiation.

elliptic noninteracting Fermi surface) by calculating the self-energy, the
spectral function, the scattering rate, and the effective mass within the
leading order dynamical self-energy approximation. We find novel anisotropic
features of quasiparticle properties that are not captured by the isotropic
approximation where the anisotropic effective mass is replaced by the isotropic
averaged density-of-states mass. Some of these interesting results are: (1) the
renormalization of the quasiparticle spectrum becomes highly anisotropic as the
quasiparticle energy increases away from the Fermi energy; (2) the inelastic
scattering rate features a strong anisotropy, exhibiting an abrupt jump at
different injected energies depending on the momentum direction of the injected
electron; (3) the effective mass anisotropy is reduced by interactions. Our
results and analysis show that the unjustified neglect of the mass anisotropy
can lead to an incorrect description of quasiparticle properties of the
anisotropic system although the use of an equivalent isotropic approximation
using the density-of-states effective mass works as a reasonable approximation
in many situations. We also provide a theory using the plasmon-pole

contributing to the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this paper,
we revisit the constraints affecting the neutrino and gamma-ray hadronuclear
emissions from this class of astrophysical objects. In particular, we go beyond
the standard prototype-based approach leading to a simple power-law neutrino
flux, and investigate a more realistic model based on a data-driven blending of
spectral indexes, thereby capturing the observed changes in the properties of
individual emitters. We then perform a multi-messenger analysis considering the
extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) measured by Fermi-LAT and different
IceCube data samples: the 7.5-year High-Energy Starting Events (HESE) and the
6-year high-energy cascade data. Along with starburst galaxies, we take into
account the contributions from blazars and radio galaxies as well as the
secondary gamma-rays from electromagnetic cascades. Remarkably, we find that,
differently from the highly-constrained prototype scenario, the spectral index
blending allows starburst galaxies to account for up to $40\%$ of the HESE
events at $95.4\%$ CL, while satisfying the limit on the non-blazar EGB
component. Moreover, values of $\mathcal{O}(100~\mathrm{PeV})$ for the maximal
energy of accelerated cosmic-rays by supernovae remnants inside the starburst
are disfavoured in our scenario. In broad terms, our analysis points out that a
better modeling of astrophysical sources could alleviate the tension between
neutrino and gamma-ray data interpretation.

dimensional structure of the complex can be explored. Here we test the

no self-pollution of young clusters by core-collapse supernovae from older
clusters; with a precision of 0.02 dex in relative alpha-elements abundance and
0.06 dex in oxygen abundance we would have been able to detect pollution from a
single supernova, given a fortunate location of the SN and favourable

that its mass ($10^8 \,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) and effective radius ($100$ pc) are

the initial inner density profile of the system ($\rho \propto r^{-2}$ or

expect that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna will be able to detect

of TD events from these systems amounts instead to a few $10^3$ per yr, a

neutrino mass from a common gravitational origin point of view. In this setup,
the quartic inflation is revived successfully via non-minimal coupling of
inflaton to gravity while the production of DM takes place from purely
gravitational effects through a misalignment mechanism. The generation of light
Majorana neutrino mass is aided by explicit breaking of global lepton number
symmetry through Planck suppressed operators involving non-zero vacuum
expectation value (VEV) of the inflaton field. We present a detailed study of
the DM yield in presence of non-minimal inflation, considering both the metric
and the Palatini formalisms of gravity wherever appropriate. We reach at some
interesting and different results in the DM sector compared to the earlier
works in the similar direction with minimal inflationary background.
Restricting to the light DM regime ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV- $\mathcal{O}(100)$
MeV) where classical production is expected to dominate over the quantum
production, we numerically predict the DM mass by varying the DM quartic and
non-minimal coupling, to be consistent with relic density requirements. We also
obtain some non-trivial dependence of DM phenomenology on some of the relevant
parameters of the inflation sector {\it e.g.} non minimal coupling and inflaton
VEV. To explore the dependence on inflationary parameters further, we also
estimate the DM relic using the same mechanism for two other inflationary
models consistent with latest data and observe that one of these models
predicts different range of DM mass upto hundreds of TeV.

of measurement. The gravitational potential was inferred under the assumption
of a steady state in the framework of a Bayesian hierarchical model. We
performed a joint fit of our stellar tracers' three-dimensional velocity
distribution, while fully accounting for the astrometric uncertainties of all
stars. The inferred gravitational potential is compared, post-inference, to a
model for the baryonic matter and halo dark matter components. We see an
unexpected but clear trend for all 40 spatially separate sub-regions: Compared
to the potential derived from the baryonic model, the inferred gravitational
potential is significantly steeper close to the Galactic mid-plane (<60 pc),
but flattens such that the two agree well at greater distances (~400 pc). The
inferred potential implies a total matter density distribution that is highly
concentrated to the Galactic mid-plane and decays quickly with height. Apart
from this, there are discrepancies between stellar samples, implying spatially
dependent systematic effects which are, at least in part, explained by
substructures in the phase-space distributions. In terms of the inferred matter
density distribution, the very low matter density that is inferred at greater
heights is inconsistent with the observed scale height and matter distribution
of the stellar disk, which cannot be explained by a misunderstood density of
cold gas or other hidden mass. Our interpretation is that these results must be
biased by a time-varying phase-space structure, possibly a breathing mode, that
is large enough to affect all stellar samples in the same manner.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at collider experiments, whose detailed internal
structure encodes valuable information about the interactions of high energy
quarks and gluons, and their confinement into color-neutral hadrons. The flow
of energy within jets is characterized by correlation functions of energy flow
operators, with the three-point correlator, being the first correlator with
non-trivial shape dependence, playing a special role in unravelling the
dynamics of QCD. In this Letter we initiate a study of the three-point energy

two of the detectors are squeezed together. We show that by rotating the two

and transport of galactic cosmic rays. For sub-GeV to ~1000GeV cosmic rays,
small-scale parallel Alfv\'en waves, which isotropize cosmic rays through
gyro-resonant interactions, are also gyro-resonant with charged grains. If the
dust is nearly stationary, as in the bulk of the interstellar medium, Alfv\'en
waves are damped by dust. This will reduce the amplitude of Alfv\'en waves
produced by the cosmic rays through the streaming instability, thus enhancing
cosmic-ray transport. In well-ionized regions, the dust damping rate is larger
by a factor of ~10 than other mechanisms that damp parallel Alfv\'en waves at
the scales relevant for ~GeV cosmic rays, suggesting that dust could play a key
role in regulating cosmic-ray transport. In astrophysical situations in which
the dust moves through the gas with super-Alfv\'enic velocities, Alfv\'en waves
are rendered unstable, which could directly scatter cosmic rays. This
interaction has the potential to create a strong feedback mechanism where dust,
driven through the gas by radiation pressure, then strongly enhances the
confinement of cosmic rays, increasing their capacity to drive outflows. This
mechanism may act in the circumgalactic medium around star-forming galaxies and
active galactic nuclei.

across the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946. We combine these with UV, IR, CO, and
H I data to compare [CII] emission to dust properties, star formation rate
(SFR), H$_2$, and HI at 560pc scales via stacking by environment (spiral arms,
interarm, and center), radial profiles, and individual, beam-sized
measurements. We attribute $73\%$ of the [CII] luminosity to arms, and $19\%$
and $8\%$ to the center and interarm region, respectively. [CII]/TIR, [CII]/CO,
and [CII]/PAH radial profiles are largely constant, but rise at large radii
($\gtrsim$8kpc) and drop in the center (""[CII] deficit""). This increase at
large radii and the observed decline with the 70${\mu}$m/100${\mu}$m dust color
are likely driven by radiation field hardness. We find a near proportional
[CII]-SFR scaling relation for beam-sized regions, though the exact scaling
depends on methodology. [CII] also becomes increasingly luminous relative to CO
at low SFR (interarm or large radii), likely indicating more efficient
photodissociation of CO and emphasizing the importance of [CII] as an H$_2$ and
SFR tracer in such regimes. Finally, based on the observed [CII] and CO radial
profiles and different models, we find ${\alpha}_{CO}$ to increase with radius,
in line with the observed metallicity gradient. The low ${\alpha}_{CO}$ (galaxy
average $\lesssim2\,M_{sun}\,pc^{-2}\,(K\,km\,s^{-1})^{-1}$) and low [CII]/CO
ratios ($\sim$400 on average) imply little CO-dark gas across NGC 6946, in
contrast to estimates in the Milky Way.

number density of dark matter is the key ingredient for creating chemical
imbalance prior to the usual thermal freeze-out. A degenerate/quasi-degenerate
dark sector can experience a different exponential suppression in the number
density analogous to the radioactive decay law leading to a delayed freeze-out
mechanism of dark matter known as the co-decaying dark matter. In this work, we
study the dynamics of a multicomponent dark matter from thermally decoupled
degenerate dark sector in a hidden U$(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model.
We compute the relic density of dark matter frozen-out through the co-decaying
mechanism by solving four coupled Boltzmann equations. We demonstrate how
temperature $T^\prime $ of the dark sector changes due to all types of
$3\rightarrow 2$ and $2\rightarrow 2$ interactions along with the eternal
expansion of the Universe. We find that $3\rightarrow 2$ interactions enhance
$T^\prime$ by producing energetic particles in the dark sector while the excess
heat is transferred by $2\rightarrow 2$ interactions to the entire dark sector.
As the direct detection is possible only through the feeble portal couplings,
we investigate the neutrino and $\gamma$-ray signals from dark matter
annihilation via one step cascade processes and compare our results with the
measured fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos by Super-Kamiokande and diffuse
$\gamma$-rays by Fermi-LAT, EGRET, INTEGRAL collaborations. We find that the
present scenario easily evades all the existing bounds from atmospheric
neutrino and diffuse $\gamma$-ray observations for degenerate dark sector.
However, the constraints are significant for quasi degenerate scenario.

intrinsic bandgaps of MATBG, we also demonstrate monolithic edge tunneling
spectroscopy within the same MATBG devices and measure the energy spectrum of
MATBG in the superconducting phase. Furthermore, by inducing a double barrier

dominate in some simulations at z<2. Whether the AGN or XRB emission dominates
in star-forming and quenched galaxies depends on the simulations. These

formation and dynamics as well as physical conditions during star formation.
Oscillation spectra of red giant stars exhibit mixed modes that have both a
gravity component from the radiative interior and a pressure component from the
convective envelope. Gravity-dominated (g-m) mixed modes split by rotation are
well separated inside frequency spectra, making possible accurate measurements
of stellar inclinations. This work aims at developing an automated and general
approach to measure stellar inclinations, that can be applied to any solar-type
pulsator for which oscillation modes are identified, and at validating it using
red giant branch stars observed by Kepler. We use the mean height-to-background
ratio of dipole mixed modes with different azimuthal orders to measure stellar
inclinations. The underlying statistical distribution of inclinations is
recovered in an unbiased way using a probability density function for the
stellar inclination angle. We derive stellar inclination measurements for 1139
stars on the red giant branch, for which Gehan et al. (2018) have identified
the azimuthal order of dipole g-m mixed modes. Raw measured inclinations
exhibit strong deviation with respect to isotropy which is expected for random
inclinations over the sky. When taking uncertainties into account, the
reconstructed distribution of inclinations actually follows the expected
isotropic distribution of the rotational axis. This work highlights the biases
that affect inclination measurements and provides the way to infer their
underlying statistical distribution. When the star is seen either pole-on or
equator-on, measurements are challenging and result in a biased distribution.
Correcting biases that appear at the low- and high inclination regimes allows
us to recover the underlying inclination distribution.

post-Newtonian corrections, and observational bias to determine the detected

total binary mass distribution of detected mergers is strongly tilted towards
higher masses. The distribution of initial peak GW frequency is remarkably high

rarely have identical topologies and dimensions. This work presents an
experimental study that utilizes reaction tests to compare the proposed joint
space mapping and the proposed task space mapping for dynamic teleoperation of
an anthropomorphic robotic arm that possesses human-level dynamic motion
capabilities. The experimental results suggest that the robot achieved similar
and, in some cases, human-level dynamic performances with both mappings for the
six participating human subjects. All subjects became proficient at
teleoperating the robot with both mappings after practice, despite that the
subjects and the robot differed in size and link length ratio and that the
teleoperation required the subjects to move unintuitively. Yet, most subjects
developed their teleoperation proficiencies more quickly with the task space
mapping than with the joint space mapping after similar amounts of practice.
This study also indicates the potential values of a three-dimensional task
space mapping, a teleoperation training simulator, and force feedback to the

vector-tensor Horndeski gravity and discuss their main features. Unlike the
analogous electric case, the field equations are linear in a simple (quite
standard) parametrization of the metric tensor and they can be solved
analytically even when a cosmological constant is added. The solutions are
presented in terms of hypergeometric functions which makes the analysis of the
black hole properties relatively straightforward. Some of the aspects of these
black holes are quite ordinary like the existence of extremal configurations
with maximal magnetic charge for a given mass, or the existence of a mass with
maximal temperature for a given charge, but others are somewhat unexpected,
like the existence of black holes with a repulsive gravitational field. We
perform our analysis for both signs of the non-minimal coupling constant and
find black hole solutions in both cases but with significant differences
between them. The most prominent difference is the fact that the black holes
for the negative coupling constant have a spherical surface of curvature
singularity rather than a single point. On the other hand, the gravitational
field produced around this kind of black holes is always attractive. Also, for
small enough magnetic charge and negative coupling constant, extremal black
holes do not exist and all magnetic black holes have a single horizon. In
addition we study the trajectories around these magnetic black holes for light
as well as massive particles either neutral or electrically charged. Finally,
we compare the main features of these black holes with their electric
counterparts, adding some aspects that have not been discussed before, like
temperature, particle trajectories and light deflection by electrically charged
Horndesky black holes.

the gradient measures of the unknown reference-to-output equilibrium map. We
show that the proposed ESC schemes achieve practical asymptotic convergence to
the extremum with a proper tuning of the parameters in the proposed schemes. As
the extremum is reached, and the magnitudes of the gradient measures become
small, the excitation signal amplitudes converge to zero. Thus, the proposed
schemes ensure that the excitation signal is attenuated as the system output
converges to a neighborhood of the extremum and the steady-state oscillations
about the extremum, typically observed for the classical ESC schemes, are
attenuated. Simulation examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed schemes.

exists in a spin-orbit torque system where a magnetic oscillator is resonantly
coupled to an electron reservoir. An instability mechanism necessary for mode
attraction can be provided by applying an electric field. The field excites
interband transitions between spin-orbit split bands leading to an instability
of the magnetic oscillator. Two exceptional points then appear in the

  Regression","34 pages",,,,"cs.LG math.OC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of empirical risk minimization (ERM)
of smooth, strongly convex loss functions using iterative gradient-based
methods. A major goal of this literature has been to compare different
algorithms, such as gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
by analyzing their rates of convergence to $\epsilon$-approximate solutions.
For example, the oracle complexity of GD is $O(n\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where
$n$ is the number of training samples. When $n$ is large, this can be expensive
in practice, and SGD is preferred due to its oracle complexity of
$O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Such standard analyses only utilize the smoothness of the
loss function in the parameter being optimized. In contrast, we demonstrate
that when the loss function is smooth in the data, we can learn the oracle at
every iteration and beat the oracle complexities of both GD and SGD in
important regimes. Specifically, at every iteration, our proposed algorithm
performs local polynomial regression to learn the gradient of the loss
function, and then estimates the true gradient of the ERM objective function.
We establish that the oracle complexity of our algorithm scales like
$\tilde{O}((p \epsilon^{-1})^{d/(2\eta)})$ (neglecting sub-dominant factors),
where $d$ and $p$ are the data and parameter space dimensions, respectively,
and the gradient of the loss function belongs to a $\eta$-H\""{o}lder class with
respect to the data. Our proof extends the analysis of local polynomial
regression in non-parametric statistics to provide interpolation guarantees in
multivariate settings, and also exploits tools from the inexact GD literature.
Unlike GD and SGD, the complexity of our method depends on $d$ and $p$.
However, when $d$ is small and the loss function exhibits modest smoothness in
the data, our algorithm beats GD and SGD in oracle complexity for a very broad
range of $p$ and $\epsilon$.

corresponding ground truth geometry. Our dataset: (1) relies exclusively on
publicly available 3D assets; (2) includes complete scene geometry, material

per-pixel semantic instance segmentations and complete camera information for
every image; and (4) factors every image into diffuse reflectance, diffuse

apply kinematic models with varying rotation properties and a novel tidal
expansion prescription to generate mock proper motion (PM) catalogs. When we
compare this series of mock catalogs to the observed RG data, we find a
combination of moderate rotation (with a magnitude of $\sim10-20$ km s$^{-1}$

predominantly north-to-south line of nodes position angle of $\sim180$ degrees)

required to explain the PM signatures. The exact best-fit parameters depend
somewhat on whether we assess only the PMs or include the RVs as a qualitative
check, leaving some small tension remaining between the PM and RV conclusions.
In either case, the parameter space preferred by our model is different both
from previously inferred rotational geometries, including from the SMC H{\small

that a rotation signature is not detectable. Taken together this underscores

uses two synergistic anomaly detectors trained on clean validation data: the
first is a novelty detector that checks for anomalous features, while the
second detects anomalous mappings from features to outputs by comparing with a
separate classifier trained on validation data. The approach is evaluated on a
wide range of backdoored networks (with multiple variations of triggers) that

moment (EDM) of nucleons in the nonrelativistic quark model. The CP-odd
interquark potential is modeled by the perturbative one-loop level gluon
exchange generated by the Weinberg operator with massive quarks and gluons. The
nucleon EDM is obtained by solving the nonrelativistic Schr\""{o}dinger equation
of the three-quark system using the Gaussian expansion method. It is found that
the resulting nucleon EDM, which may reasonably be considered as the
irreducible contribution, is smaller than the one obtained after
$\gamma_5$-rotating the anomalous magnetic moment using the CP-odd mass
calculated with QCD sum rules. We estimate the total contribution to be $d_n =

quasi-itinerancy and quantum order by disorder in pyrochlore iridates. Like
other Mott insulating iridates, the Ir$^{4+}$ ion in pyrochlore iridates
develops an effective ${J=1/2}$ moment from the on-site spin-orbit coupling. We
consider the generic symmetry-allowed exchange between these local moments on a
pyrochlore lattice and obtain the mean-field phase diagram. Assuming the
superexchange is mediated by direct and/or indirect electron hopping via
intermediate oxygens, we derive the exchange interactions in the strong
coupling regime from the Hubbard model. This exchange has a degenerate
classical ground state manifold and quantum fluctuation selects a non-coplanar
ground state, known as quantum order by disorder. Extending to the intermediate
coupling regime, the same non-coplanar order is selected from the degenerate
manifold by the kinetic energy, which is dubbed ""electron quasi-itinerancy"". We
discuss the experimental relevance of our results and electron quasi-itinerancy

According to our membership analysis based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, out of
the 226 potential clusters falling in the footprint of GALAH or APOGEE, we find
that 205 have secure members that were observed by at least one of the survey.
Furthermore, members of 134 clusters have high-quality spectroscopic data that
we use to determine their chemical composition. We leverage this information to
study the chemical distribution throughout the Galactic disk of 21 elements,
from C to Eu. The radial metallicity gradient obtained from our analysis is
$-$0.076$\pm$0.009 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with previous works
based on smaller samples. Furthermore, the gradient in the [Fe/H] - guiding
radius (r$_{\rm guid}$) plane is $-$0.073$\pm$0.008 dex kpc$^{-1}$. We show
consistently that open clusters trace the distribution of chemical elements
throughout the Galactic disk differently than field stars. In particular, at
given radius, open clusters show an age-metallicity relation that has less
scatter than field stars. As such scatter is often interpreted as an effect of
radial migration, we suggest that these differences are due to the physical
selection effect imposed by our Galaxy: clusters that would have migrated
significantly also had higher chances to get destroyed. Finally, our results
reveal trends in the [X/Fe]$-$r$_{\rm guid}$$-$age space, which are important
to understand production rates of different elements as a function of space and
time.

sets of genes connected to achieve specific tasks. However, such systems are
difficult to implement in single cells due to saturation in molecular
components and stochasticity in the limited intracellular space. Multicellular
implementations, on the other hand, outsource some of the components of
information-processing circuits to the extracellular space, and thereby might
escape those constraints. Here we develop a theoretical framework, based on a
trilinear coordinate representation, to study the collective behavior of a
cellular population composed of three cell types under stationary conditions.
This framework reveals that distributing different processes (in our case the
production, detection and degradation of a time-encoding signal) across
distinct cell types enables the robust implementation of a multicellular timer.
Our analysis also shows the circuit to be easily tunable by varying the

structure of gas as well as 1D chemical structure in the disc midplane. The
disc temperature profiles are calculated using fully physically consistent
radiative transfer models for stars between 0.5 and 3 Msun and ages up to 10
Myr. The resulting temperature profiles are used to determine how the chemical
conditions in the mid-plane change over time. We therefore obtain gas and
ice-phase abundances of the main carbon and oxygen carrier species. While the
temperature profiles produced are not markedly different for the stars of
different masses at early stages (<1 Myr), they start to diverge significantly
beyond 2 Myr. Discs around stars with mass >1.5 Msun become warmer over time as
the stellar luminosity increases, whereas low-mass stars decrease in luminosity
leading to cooler discs. This has an observable effect on the location of the
CO snowline, which is located >200 au in most models for a 3 Msun star, but is
always within 80 au for 0.5 Msun star. The chemical compositions calculated
show that a well defined stellar mass and age range exists in which high C/O
gas giants can form. In the case of the exoplanet HR8799b, our models show it

theory. Most of the existing works, however, focus on \emph{very small or even

where the learning rate is \emph{moderate and annealing}. In this paper, we
make an initial attempt to characterize the particular regularization effect of
SGD in the moderate learning rate regime by studying its behavior for
optimizing an overparameterized linear regression problem. In this case, SGD
and GD are known to converge to the unique minimum-norm solution; however, with
the moderate and annealing learning rate, we show that they exhibit different
\emph{directional bias}: SGD converges along the large eigenvalue directions of
the data matrix, while GD goes after the small eigenvalue directions.
Furthermore, we show that such directional bias does matter when early stopping
is adopted, where the SGD output is nearly optimal but the GD output is
suboptimal. Finally, our theory explains several folk arts in practice used for
SGD hyperparameter tuning, such as (1) linearly scaling the initial learning
rate with batch size; and (2) overrunning SGD with high learning rate even when
the loss stops decreasing.

free charged particles. To date, all experimental and theoretical studies of
super- and subradiance in these systems involved the classical correlations
between the emitters. However, dependence on quantum correlations, such as
entanglement between different emitting particles, has not been studied. Recent
advances in coherent-shaping of free-electron wavefunctions motivate the
investigation of such quantum regimes of super- and subradiance. In this
Letter, we show how a pair of coincident path-entangled electrons can
demonstrate either super- or subradiant light emission, depending on the
two-particle wavefunction. By choosing different free-electron Bell-states, the
spectrum and emission pattern of the light can be reshaped, in a manner that
cannot be accounted for by a classical mixed state. We show these results for
light emission in any optical medium, and discuss their generalization to
many-body quantum states. Our findings suggest that light emission can be
sensitive to the explicit quantum state of the emitting matter wave, and
possibly serve as a non-destructive measurement scheme for measuring the
quantum state of many-body systems.

Ly$\alpha$ escape and have large peak separations. To isolate the effects of
outflow kinematics, we restricted our testing set to galaxies with spherical
outflows and found that $f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$ and the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity both
increase with the extent of the galactic winds. A simple estimate suggests that
the collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen by free electrons in the cool
gas of the winds can account for the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity observed in these
objects. Finally, we speculate on the relationship between outflows and the
escape of ionizing radiation from the CGM.

show that in a model of $\mathrm{RCA}^*_0 + \neg \mathrm{I}\Sigma^0_1$,
$\mathrm{RT}^n_k$ is equivalent to its own relativization to any proper

  We give an axiomatization of the first-order consequences of
$\mathrm{RCA}^*_0 + \mathrm{RT}^n_k$ for $n \ge 3$. We show that they form a
non-finitely axiomatizable subtheory of PA whose $\Pi_3$ fragment is

contained in $\mathrm{I}\Sigma_1$.
  Additionally, we consider a principle $\Delta^0_2$-$\mathrm{RT}^2_2$, defined

Participants interacted directly with an instrumented task-guidance WCA as
delays were introduced into the system in a controllable fashion. System and
task state were tracked in real time, and biometric data from wearable sensors
on the participants were recorded. Our results show that periods of extended
system delay cause users to correspondingly (and substantially) slow down in
their guided task execution, an effect that persists for a time after the
system returns to a more responsive state. Furthermore, the slow-down in task
execution is correlated with a personality trait, neuroticism, associated with
intolerance for time delays. We show that our results implicate impaired
cognitive planning, as contrasted with resource depletion or emotional arousal,
as the reason for slowed user task executions under system delay. The findings
have several implications for the design and operation of WCA applications as

Individual Pitch Control (FTIPC) scheme is developed to accommodate these
faults in Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs), based on a Subspace
Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC) approach. To fulfill this goal, an online
subspace identification paradigm is implemented to derive a linear
approximation of the FOWT system dynamics. Then, a repetitive control law is
formulated to attain load mitigation under operational conditions, both in
healthy and faulty conditions. Since the excitation noise used for the online
subspace identification may interfere with the nominal power generation of the
wind turbine, a novel excitation technique is developed to restrict excitation
at specific frequencies. Results show that significant load reductions are
achieved by FTIPC, while effectively accommodating blade and actuator faults
and while restricting the energy of the persistently exciting control action.

important problem for a variety of vision and graphics applications. Owing to
their limited resolution, classical discrete shape representations using point
clouds, voxels and meshes produce low quality results when used in these
applications. Several implicit 3D shape representation approaches using deep
neural networks have been proposed leading to significant improvements in both
quality of representations as well as the impact on downstream applications.
However, these methods can only be used to represent topologically closed
shapes which greatly limits the class of shapes that they can represent. As a
consequence, they also often require clean, watertight meshes for training. In
this work, we propose DUDE - a Deep Unsigned Distance Embedding method which
alleviates both of these shortcomings. DUDE is a disentangled shape
representation that utilizes an unsigned distance field (uDF) to represent
proximity to a surface, and a normal vector field (nVF) to represent surface
orientation. We show that a combination of these two (uDF+nVF) can be used to
learn high fidelity representations for arbitrary open/closed shapes. As
opposed to prior work such as DeepSDF, our shape representations can be
directly learnt from noisy triangle soups, and do not need watertight meshes.
Additionally, we propose novel algorithms for extracting and rendering
iso-surfaces from the learnt representations. We validate DUDE on benchmark 3D
datasets and demonstrate that it produces significant improvements over the

content understanding. In this dense prediction task, the parsing model assigns
every pixel to a categorical label, which requires the contextual information
of adjacent image patches. So the challenge for this learning task is to
simultaneously describe the geometric and semantic properties of objects or a
scene. In this paper, we explore the effective use of multi-layer feature
outputs of the deep parsing networks for spatial-semantic consistency by
designing a novel feature aggregation module to generate the appropriate global
representation prior, to improve the discriminative power of features. The
proposed module can auto-select the intermediate visual features to correlate
the spatial and semantic information. At the same time, the multiple skip
connections form a strong supervision, making the deep parsing network easy to
train. Extensive experiments on four public scene parsing datasets prove that
the deep parsing network equipped with the proposed feature aggregation module
can achieve very promising results.

extra injection of energy from supernova explosions plays a key role in
establishing the global turbulent field and the local dynamics and morphology
of molecular clouds. Additionally, we characterise structure function scaling
parameters as a result of cloud environmental conditions: some of the complexes
are immersed in diffuse (inter-arm) or dense (spiral-arm) environments, and
others are influenced by embedded or external supernovae. In quiescent regions,
we obtain time-evolving trajectories of scaling parameters driven by
gravitational collapse and supersonic turbulent flows. Our findings suggests
that a PCA-based statistical study is a robust method to diagnose the physical
mechanisms that drive the gravoturbulent properties of molecular clouds. Also,

susceptibility to persuasion -- the extent to which they are willing to modify
their opinions on a topic. This body of literature suggests an interesting
perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation by interacting parties
in a network: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify
people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider interventions that
modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. In this work, motivated by this
fact we propose a new framework for social influence. Specifically, we adopt a
popular model for social opinion dynamics, where each agent has some fixed
innate opinion, and a resistance that measures the importance it places on its
innate opinion; agents influence one another's opinions through an iterative
process. Under non-trivial conditions, this iterative process converges to some
equilibrium opinion vector. For the unbudgeted variant of the problem, the goal
is to select the resistance of each agent (from some given range) such that the
sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. We prove that the objective
function is in general non-convex. Hence, formulating the problem as a convex
program as in an early version of this work (Abebe et al., KDD'18) might have
potential correctness issues. We instead analyze the structure of the objective
function, and show that any local optimum is also a global optimum, which is
somehow surprising as the objective function might not be convex. Furthermore,
we combine the iterative process and the local search paradigm to design very
efficient algorithms that can solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem
optimally on large-scale graphs containing millions of nodes. Finally, we
propose and evaluate experimentally a family of heuristics for the budgeted
variation of the problem.

convection heat transfer coefficients, air flowrate, and thermoelectric

thickness, module fill factor, and input current. Both constant material
properties and graded properties are considered for the TE materials, and they
are compared in terms of the degree of cooling, coefficient of performance
(COP), and power consumption. For graded materials, we employ one-dimensional
finite element methods to solve the coupled electrical and thermal current
equations with arbitrary profile of material properties varying with position
along the TE legs. We find that graded materials can enhance the degree of
cooling, but only at the expense of COP, compared to the case of constant

low electric current, the power consumption of TE cooler can be lower than
those of conventional air conditioners at an equivalent cooling capacity.

edge-on (i=86 degrees) disk galaxy (G1547) where the CGM is probed by a
background quasar at a distance of 84 kpc and within 10 degrees of the galaxy
major axis. G1547 does not have any detectable CGM absorption down to stringent
limits, covering HI (EW$_r$<0.02A, log(N(HI)/cm$^{-2}$)<12.6) and a range of
low and high ionisation absorption lines (OI, CII, NII, SiII, CIII, NIII,
SiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI). This system is rare, given the covering fraction
of $1.00_{-0.04}^{+0.00}$ for sub-L* galaxies within 50-100 kpc of quasar
sightlines. G1547 has a low SFR (1.1 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), SSFR
($1.5\times10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$) and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ (0.06
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and does not exhibit AGN or star-formation
driven outflows. Compared to the general population of galaxies, G1547 is in
the green valley and has an above average metallicity with a negative gradient.
When compared to other HI absorption-selected galaxies, we find that quiescent
galaxies with log(SSFR/yr$^{-1})<-11$ have a low probability (4/12) of
possessing detectable HI in their CGM, while all galaxies (40/40) with
log(SSFR/yr$^{-1})>-11$ have HI absorption. We conclude that SSFR is a good
indicator of the presence of HI CGM. Interestingly however, G1547 is the only
galaxy with log(SSFR/yr$^{-1})>-11$ that has no detectable CGM. Given the
properties of G1547, and its absent CGM, it is plausible that G1547 is
undergoing quenching due to a lack of accreting fuel for star-formation, with
an estimated quenching timescale of $4\pm1$ Gyr. G1547 provides a unique
perspective into the external mechanisms that could explain the migration of
galaxies into the green valley.

taking into consideration inter-cell interference. First, we briefly review the
vector quantization (VQ) approach and related single user throughput-optimal
formulations for AP placement. Then, we investigate the small-cell case with
multiple users and expose the limitations of mean squared error based VQ for
solving this problem. While the Lloyd algorithm from the VQ approach is found
not to strictly solve the small-cell case, based on the tractability and
quality of resulting AP placement, we deem it suitable as a simple and
appropriate framework to solve more complicated problems. Accordingly, to
minimize ICI and consequently enhance achievable throughput, we design two
Lloyd-type algorithms, namely, the Interference Lloyd algorithm and the
Inter-AP Lloyd algorithm, both of which incorporate ICI in their distortion
functions. Simulation results show that both of the proposed algorithms provide
superior 95\%-likely rate over the traditional Lloyd algorithm and the Inter-AP
Lloyd algorithm yields a significant increase of up to 36.34\% in achievable
rate over the Lloyd algorithm.

practical optimization based classification models in machine learning because
of its interpretability and flexibility to produce high quality results.
However, the big data imposes a certain difficulty to the most sophisticated
but relatively slow versions of SVM, namely, the nonlinear SVM. The complexity
of nonlinear SVM solvers and the number of elements in the kernel matrix
quadratically increases with the number of samples in training data. Therefore,
both runtime and memory requirements are negatively affected. Moreover, the
parameter fitting has extra kernel parameters to tune, which exacerbate the
runtime even further. This paper proposes an adaptive multilevel learning
framework for the nonlinear SVM, which addresses these challenges, improves the
classification quality across the refinement process, and leverages
multi-threaded parallel processing for better performance. The integration of
parameter fitting in the hierarchical learning framework and adaptive process
to stop unnecessary computation significantly reduce the running time while
increase the overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate reduced
variance on prediction over validation and test data across levels in the
hierarchy, and significant speedup compared to state-of-the-art nonlinear SVM
libraries without a decrease in the classification quality. The code is

knowledge from a labeled source domain to a similar but unlabeled target
domain. Recent study reveals that knowledge can be transferred from one source
domain to another unknown target domain, called Universal Domain Adaptation
(UDA). However, in the real-world application, there are often more than one
source domain to be exploited for domain adaptation. In this paper, we formally
propose a more general domain adaptation setting, universal multi-source domain
adaptation (UMDA), where the label sets of multiple source domains can be
different and the label set of target domain is completely unknown. The main
challenges in UMDA are to identify the common label set between each source
domain and target domain, and to keep the model scalable as the number of
source domains increases. To address these challenges, we propose a universal
multi-source adaptation network (UMAN) to solve the domain adaptation problem
without increasing the complexity of the model in various UMDA settings. In
UMAN, we estimate the reliability of each known class in the common label set
via the prediction margin, which helps adversarial training to better align the
distributions of multiple source domains and target domain in the common label
set. Moreover, the theoretical guarantee for UMAN is also provided. Massive
experimental results show that existing UDA and multi-source DA (MDA) methods
cannot be directly applied to UMDA and the proposed UMAN achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in various UMDA settings.

accelerated conic tip sharpening with runaway field self-enhancement. Zubarev
(2001) first predicted from an inviscid model that the electric stresses at the
liquid apex undergo self-similar divergent growth in finite time. The inviscid
assumption is appropriate to liquid metals since the viscous boundary layer
extends only a few tens of nanometers from the moving interface. In this work,
we examine in more depth a two-parameter family of far-field self-similar
solutions incorporating inertial, electrical and capillary effects, which to
leading order describe electric and velocity potential fields corresponding to
a rapidly accelerating \textit{dynamic} Taylor cone. These far field solutions
are incorporated self-consistently into boundary integral simulations which
reveal the entire liquid shape in the near field. By invoking time reversal
symmetry inherent to inviscid flow, we unmask an entire family of novel
self-similar conic modes exhibiting features such as inertial recoil, tip
bulging from accelerated advance and tip counter-current flow as well as
multiple interface stagnation points. These dynamic configurations help explain
for the first time the origin of decades old experimental observations that

first-order spatial derivatives with central-difference stencils often have
spurious unresolved numerical wave-modes in their computed solutions. Recently
derived high order accurate upwind SBP operators based upwind FD stencils have
the potential to suppress these poisonous spurious wave-modes on marginally
resolved computational grids. In this paper, we demonstrate that not all high
order upwind SBP FD operators are applicable. Numerical dispersion relation
analysis shows that odd-order upwind SBP FD operators also support spurious
unresolved high-frequencies on marginally resolved meshes. Meanwhile,
even-order upwind SBP FD operators (of order 2, 4, 6) do not support spurious
unresolved high frequency wave modes and also have better numerical dispersion
properties. We discretise the three space dimensional (3D) elastic wave
equation on boundary-conforming curvilinear meshes. Using the energy method we
prove that the semi-discrete approximation is stable and energy-conserving. We
derive a priori error estimate and prove the convergence of the numerical

is more pronounced when the dimensionality of the context is large relative to
the post hoc context or when the post hoc context model is particularly easy to

amounts, resulted from solving optimal P2P energy management problems, might
not be satisfactory for peers/agents. This is because peers/agents in practice
do not know how to set their cost function parameters when participating into
P2P energy markets. To resolve such drawback, this paper proposes a novel
approach, in which an inverse optimization problem is formulated for
peers/agents to cooperatively learn to choose their objective function
parameters, given their intervals of desired energy prices and amounts. The
result is that peers/agents can set their objective function parameters in the
intervals computed analytically from the lower and upper bounds of their energy
price and amounts, if the ratio of their maximum total buying and selling
energy amounts lies in a certain interval subject to be learned by them. A case
study is then carried out, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

that the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin may increase from 60 to 400
TWh between 2020 and 2100. The future carbon footprint of Bitcoin strongly
depends on the decarbonization pathway of the electricity sector. If the
electricity sector achieves carbon neutrality by 2050, Bitcoin's carbon
footprint has peaked already. However, in the business-as-usual scenario,
emissions sum up to 2 gigatons until 2100, an amount comparable to 7% of global
emissions in 2019. The Bitcoin price spike at the end of 2020 shows, however,
that progressive development of market capitalization could yield an
electricity consumption of more than 100 TWh already in 2021, and lead to
cumulative emissions of over 5 gigatons by 2100. Therefore, we also discuss

structures dynamic. It is used extensively in geometric settings and in the
guise of so-called merge (or compaction) policies in big-data databases such as
Google Bigtable and LevelDB (our focus). Previous theoretical work is based on
worst-case analyses for uniform inputs -- insertions of one item at a time and
constant read rate. In practice, merge policies must not only handle batch
insertions and varying read/write ratios, they can take advantage of such
non-uniformity to reduce cost on a per-input basis.
  To model this, we initiate the study of data-structure dynamization through
the lens of competitive analysis, via two new online set-cover problems. For
each, the input is a sequence of disjoint sets of weighted items. The sets are
revealed one at a time. The algorithm must respond to each with a set cover
that covers all items revealed so far. It obtains the cover incrementally from
the previous cover by adding one or more sets and optionally removing existing
sets. For each new set the algorithm incurs build cost equal to the weight of
the items in the set. In the first problem the objective is to minimize total
build cost plus total query cost, where the algorithm incurs a query cost at
each time $t$ equal to the current cover size. In the second problem, the
objective is to minimize the build cost while keeping the query cost from
exceeding $k$ (a given parameter) at any time. We give deterministic online
algorithms for both variants, with competitive ratios of $\Theta(\log^* n)$ and
$k$, respectively. The latter ratio is optimal for the second variant.

one vehicle in platoons inevitably suffers from a disturbance resulting from
the leader vehicle acceleration/deceleration, wind gust and uncertainties in a
platoon control system, i.e., aerodynamics drag and rolling resistance moment
etc. Disturbances acting on one vehicle may inevitably affect the following
vehicles and cause that the spacing error is propagated or even amplified
downstream along the platoon, i.e., platoon string instability. In this case,
the connectivity among vehicles is dynamic, resulting in the performance of
802.11p in terms of packet delay and packet delivery ratio being time-varying.
The effect of the string instability would be further deteriorated once the

information but not the full information in the video. In many cases, such as
professional paid videos or video meetings, users would like to observe some

their requirements in daily life. Aiming at this demand, this paper proposes a
multi-level encryption scheme that is composed of lightweight encryption,
medium encryption and heavyweight encryption, where each encryption level can
obtain a different amount of visual information. It is found that both
encrypting the luma intraprediction model (IPM) and scrambling the syntax

both of them can implement the intensity of encryption and one cannot gain any

Wigner function formulism. The chiral and spin kinetic equations can be derived
from equations for Wigner functions. A general Wigner function has 16
components which satisfy 32 coupled equations. For massless fermions, the
number of independent equations can be significantly reduced due to the
decoupling of left-handed and right-handed particles. It can be proved that out
of many components of Wigner functions and their coupled equations, only one
kinetic equation for the distribution function is independent. This is called
the disentanglement theorem for Wigner functions of chiral fermions. For
massive fermions, it turns out that one particle distribution function and
three spin distribution functions are independent and satisfy four kinetic
equations. Various chiral and spin effects such as chiral magnetic and votical
effects, the chiral seperation effect, spin polarization effects can be
consistently described in the formalism.

feature detection only, and none can process sparse GPR measurements to
successfully reconstruct a very fine and detailed 3D model of underground
objects for better visualization. To address this problem, this paper presents
a novel robotic system to collect GPR data, localize the underground utilities,
and reconstruct the underground objects' dense point cloud model. This system
is composed of three modules: 1) visual-inertial-based GPR data collection
module, which tags the GPR measurements with positioning information provided
by an omnidirectional robot; 2) a deep neural network (DNN) migration module to
interpret the raw GPR B-scan image into a cross-section of object model; 3) a
DNN-based 3D reconstruction module, i.e., GPRNet, to generate underground
utility model with the fine 3D point cloud. In this paper, both the
quantitative and qualitative experiment results verify our method that can
generate a dense and complete point cloud model of pipe-shaped utilities based
on a sparse input, i.e., GPR raw data incompleteness and various noise. The
experiment results on synthetic data and field test data further support the
effectiveness of our approach.

space which makes it very difficult to independently control a specific
attribute without affecting the others. Supervised attribute editing requires
annotated training data which is difficult to obtain and limits the editable
attributes to those with labels. Therefore, unsupervised attribute editing in
an disentangled latent space is key to performing neat and versatile semantic
face editing. In this paper, we present a new technique termed
Structure-Texture Independent Architecture with Weight Decomposition and
Orthogonal Regularization (STIA-WO) to disentangle the latent space for
unsupervised semantic face editing. By applying STIA-WO to GAN, we have
developed a StyleGAN termed STGAN-WO which performs weight decomposition
through utilizing the style vector to construct a fully controllable weight
matrix to regulate image synthesis, and employs orthogonal regularization to
ensure each entry of the style vector only controls one independent feature
matrix. To further disentangle the facial attributes, STGAN-WO introduces a
structure-texture independent architecture which utilizes two independently and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) latent vectors to control the synthesis of the
texture and structure components in a disentangled way. Unsupervised semantic
editing is achieved by moving the latent code in the coarse layers along its
orthogonal directions to change texture related attributes or changing the
latent code in the fine layers to manipulate structure related ones. We present
experimental results which show that our new STGAN-WO can achieve better
attribute editing than state of the art methods.

frequency and frequency derivative are determined. The fluctuation in the spin
frequency is obvious with an amplitude of 1.94(7)*10 -9 Hz. Variations of the
integrated profile at 1369 MHz are detected with the changes occur in the
relative peak intensity from the right profile component. From analysis of the
single pulse data at 1382 MHz, we detect weak emission states that account for
63% of the whole data, and its duration distribution can be fitted with a power
law. The pulsar also exhibits strong emission states, during which the emission
shows multiple modes. This includes the normal mode, left mode and the right
mode, with the time scales spanning between one and seventeen pulse periods.
Such short term variability in pulses contributes to the variation of the
integrated profile. Examination of the correlations between the spin parameters

reveals that there is probably no obvious relationship between spin-down rate

Support Vector Machines, provides greater robustness when the measurements are
biased and very noisy as the algorithm tolerates small errors in prediction
which in turn makes the estimates less sensitive to measurement noises. Apart
from $\epsilon$ insensitive quadratic loss function, estimation algorithms are
also derived for $\epsilon$ insensitive Huber M loss function which provides
robustness in presence of both small noises as well as outliers. Robustness in

the error penalty function switches from quadratic to linear for errors beyond

weighted. Now, the question is how social networks evolve to reduce the number
of unbalanced triangles when they are weighted? Are the results foreseeable
based on what we have already learned from the unweighted balance? To find the
solution, we consider a fully connected network in which triads are assigned
with different random weights. Weights are coming from Gaussian probability
distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$. We study this system in two
regimes : (\RN{1}) the ratio of $\frac{\mu}{\sigma} \ge 1 $ corresponds to weak
disorder (small variance) that triads' weight are approximately the same,
(\RN{2}) $\frac{\mu}{\sigma} < 1 $ counts for strong disorder (big variance)
and weights are remarkably diverse. Investigating the structural evolution of
such a network is our intention. We see disorder plays a key role in
determining the critical temperature of the system. Using the mean-field method
to present an analytic solution for the system represents that the system
undergoes a first-order phase transition. For weak disorder, our simulation
results display the system reaches the global minimum as temperature decreases
whereas for high disorder we manage to see a seudo-Kondo effect in triadic
interactions. The Kondo effect explains the anomalous increase in electrical
resistivity of metals due to magnetic impurities at low temperatures. Similar
behavior is seen in the energy versus temperature in our work for the second
regime and the system does not reach a global minimum.

deterministic and Bernoulli activations over cyclic schemes, and Kaczmarz-type
random activations. The almost sure convergence of the algorithm is obtained by
means of properties of stochastic Quasi-Fej\'er sequences. We also recover
several primal-dual algorithms for monotone inclusions in the context without a
priori information and classical algorithms for solving convex feasibility
problems and linear systems. In the context of convex optimization with
inequality constraints, any selection of the constraints defines the a priori
information set, in which case the operators involved are simply projections
onto half spaces. By incorporating random projections onto a selection of the

Spatial Power of two (sPOT) policy in which each user is allocated to the least
loaded server among its two geographically nearest servers sequentially. When

high order finite volume (FV) weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)

the case of the non-smooth, weakly hyperbolic test problem, notable
improvements are observed in predicting the location and height of the finite

from a single in-falling system, the so-called Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GSE).
One exciting feature of this result is that it gives astronomers for the first
time a large sample of easily observable unevolved stars that formed in an
extra-Galactic environment, which can be compared to stars that formed within
our Milky Way. Here we use these stars to investigate the ""Spite Plateau"" --
the near-constant lithium abundance observed in metal-poor dwarf stars across a
wide range of metallicities (-3<[Fe/H]<-1). In particular our aim is to test
whether the stars that formed in the GSE show a different Spite Plateau to
other Milky Way stars that inhabit the disk and halo. Individual galaxies could
have different Spite Plateaus -- e.g., the ISM could be more depleted in
lithium in a lower galactic mass system due to it having a smaller reservoir of
gas. We identified 76 GSE dwarf stars observed and analyzed by the GALactic
Archeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey as part of its Third Data Release.
Orbital actions were used to select samples of Gaia-Enceladus stars, and
comparison samples of halo and disk stars. We find that the Gaia-Enceladus
stars show the same lithium abundance as other likely accreted stars and in
situ Milky Way stars, strongly suggesting that the ""lithium problem"" is not a
consequence of the formation environment. This result fits within the growing
consensus that the Spite Plateau, and more generally the ""cosmological lithium
problem"" -- the observed discrepancy between the amount of lithium in warm,
metal-poor dwarf stars in our Galaxy, and the amount of lithium predicted to
have been produced by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis -- is the result of lithium
depletion processes within stars.

existing approaches learn embeddings of text and network structure by enforcing
embeddings of connected nodes to be similar. Then for achieving a modality
fusion they use the similarities between text embedding of a node with the
structure embedding of its connected node and vice versa. This implies that
these approaches require edge information for learning embeddings and they
cannot learn embeddings of unseen nodes. In this paper we propose an approach
that achieves both modality fusion and the capability to learn embeddings of
unseen nodes. The main feature of our model is that it uses an adversarial
mechanism between text embedding based discriminator, and structure embedding
based generator to learn efficient representations. Then for learning
embeddings of unseen nodes, we use the supervision provided by the text
embedding based discriminator. In addition this, we propose a novel
architecture for learning text embedding that can combine both mutual attention
and topological attention mechanism, which give more flexible text embeddings.

algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptively utilizing a
given shaping reward function. We formulate the utilization of shaping rewards
as a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower level is to optimize policy
using the shaping rewards and the upper level is to optimize a parameterized
shaping weight function for true reward maximization. We formally derive the
gradient of the expected true reward with respect to the shaping weight
function parameters and accordingly propose three learning algorithms based on
different assumptions. Experiments in sparse-reward cartpole and MuJoCo
environments show that our algorithms can fully exploit beneficial shaping
rewards, and meanwhile ignore unbeneficial shaping rewards or even transform
them into beneficial ones.

construction of a constant round zero-knowledge argument for NP secure against
quantum attacks. However, their construction has several drawbacks compared to
the classical counterparts. Specifically, their construction only achieves
computational soundness, requires strong assumptions of quantum hardness of
learning with errors (QLWE assumption) and the existence of quantum fully
homomorphic encryption (QFHE), and relies on non-black-box simulation. In this
paper, we resolve these issues at the cost of weakening the notion of
zero-knowledge to what is called $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge. Concretely, we
construct the following protocols:
  - We construct a constant round interactive proof for NP that satisfies
statistical soundness and black-box $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge against quantum
attacks assuming the existence of collapsing hash functions, which is a quantum
counterpart of collision-resistant hash functions. Interestingly, this
construction is just an adapted version of the classical protocol by Goldreich
and Kahan (JoC '96) though the proof of $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge property
against quantum adversaries requires novel ideas.
  - We construct a constant round interactive argument for NP that satisfies
computational soundness and black-box $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge against quantum
attacks only assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions.
  At the heart of our results is a new quantum rewinding technique that enables
a simulator to extract a committed message of a malicious verifier while
simulating verifier's internal state in an appropriate sense.

hardly produced by recent identity swapping methods, the detection algorithm
may fail in this situation. In this work, we provide a new identity swapping

appearance gaps mainly arise from the large discrepancies in illuminations and
skin colors that widely exist in real-world scenarios. However, due to the
difficulties of modeling the complex appearance mapping, it is challenging to
transfer fine-grained appearances adaptively while preserving identity traits.
This paper formulates appearance mapping as an optimal transport problem and
proposes an Appearance Optimal Transport model (AOT) to formulate it in both
latent and pixel space. Specifically, a relighting generator is designed to
simulate the optimal transport plan. It is solved via minimizing the
Wasserstein distance of the learned features in the latent space, enabling
better performance and less computation than conventional optimization. To
further refine the solution of the optimal transport plan, we develop a
segmentation game to minimize the Wasserstein distance in the pixel space. A
discriminator is introduced to distinguish the fake parts from a mix of real

gain. Competent statistical practice thus integrates logic, context, and
probability into scientific inference and decision using narratives filled with
causality. This reality was seen and accounted for intuitively by the founders
of modern statistics, but was not well recognized in the ensuing statistical
theory (which focused instead on the causally inert properties of probability
measures). Nonetheless, both statistical foundations and basic statistics can
and should be taught using formal causal models. The causal view of statistical
science fits within a broader information-processing framework which
illuminates and unifies frequentist, Bayesian, and related probability-based
foundations of statistics. Causality theory can thus be seen as a key component
connecting computation to contextual information, not extra-statistical but

enhancement of both $\sigma_{\rm el}$ and $\kappa$ and reduction in specific

than one, which defies physical interpretation. Finally, quasiparticle
description in the absence of strong B impedes the transport of charge and

does noticeable observations: conductivities now gets reduced to physically
plausible values, T-dependence of $\sigma_{\rm el}$ gets reversed, {\em i.e.}
it now decreases with T, effect of collision integral gets smeared in $\kappa$

decisions, or different organizations are ruled differently. Many research
questions important to political scientists concern choice behavior, which
involves dealing with nominal-scale dependent variables. Drawing on the
principle of maximum random utility, we propose a flexible and general
heterogeneous multinomial logit model for studying differences in choice
behavior. The model systematically accounts for heterogeneity that is not
captured by classical models, indicates the strength of heterogeneity, and
permits examining which explanatory variables cause heterogeneity. As the
proposed approach allows incorporating theoretical expectations about
heterogeneity into the analysis of nominal dependent variables, it can be
applied to a wide range of research problems. Our empirical example uses data

make an RS vulnerable to attacks, where the goal of the attacker is to unfairly
promote certain pushed items. Specifically, we demonstrate how a new visual
attack model can effectively influence the item scores and rankings in a
black-box approach, i.e., without knowing the parameters of the model. The main
underlying idea is to systematically create small human-imperceptible
perturbations of the pushed item image and to devise appropriate gradient
approximation methods to incrementally raise the pushed item's score.
Experimental evaluations on two datasets show that the novel attack model is
effective even when the contribution of the visual features to the overall

we propose a simple yet effective modification to the gradient calculation of

of an attack is directly calculated for the given data point. This approach is
sensitive to noise and small local optima of the loss function. Inspired by
gradient sampling techniques from non-convex optimization, we propose
Dynamically Sampled Nonlocal Gradient Descent (DSNGD). DSNGD calculates the
gradient direction of the adversarial attack as the weighted average over past
gradients of the optimization history. Moreover, distribution hyperparameters
that define the sampling operation are automatically learned during the
optimization scheme. We empirically show that by incorporating this nonlocal
gradient information, we are able to give a more accurate estimation of the
global descent direction on noisy and non-convex loss surfaces. In addition, we
show that DSNGD-based attacks are on average 35% faster while achieving 0.9% to

propose the Dual Attention Generative Adversarial Network (DTGAN) which can
synthesize high-quality and semantically consistent images only employing a
single generator/discriminator pair. The proposed model introduces
channel-aware and pixel-aware attention modules that can guide the generator to
focus on text-relevant channels and pixels based on the global sentence vector
and to fine-tune original feature maps using attention weights. Also,
Conditional Adaptive Instance-Layer Normalization (CAdaILN) is presented to
help our attention modules flexibly control the amount of change in shape and
texture by the input natural-language description. Furthermore, a new type of
visual loss is utilized to enhance the image resolution by ensuring vivid shape
and perceptually uniform color distributions of generated images. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
method compared to the state-of-the-art models with a multi-stage framework.
Visualization of the attention maps shows that the channel-aware attention
module is able to localize the discriminative regions, while the pixel-aware
attention module has the ability to capture the globally visual contents for
the generation of an image.

abbreviated as DTN, does not order at zero field down to $T=0$: due to the
strong single-ion anisotropy of the ""easy plane"" type acting on $S=1$ Ni$^{2+}$
ions, the $S_z=0$ ground state is separated from $S_z=\pm 1$ excitations by an
energy gap. Once the magnetic field is applied along the main anisotropy axis,
the gap closes at $B_{c1}=2.18$ T and the field-induced antiferromagnetic order
arises. The low-energy excitations spectrum of this field-induced ordered state
includes two branches of excitations, one of them have to be a gapless
Goldstone mode. Recent studies of excitations spectrum in a field-induced
ordered state of DTN (T.Soldatov et.al, Phys.Rev.B 101, 104410 (2020)) have
revealed that Goldstone mode became gapped as magnetic field deviates from the
main symmetry axis. This paper proposes simple description of antiferromagnetic
resonance modes of quasi-one-dimensional quantum $S=1$ magnet with strong
single-ion anisotropy. The approach used is based on a combination of the
strong coupling model for the anisotropic spin chain with the conventional
mean-field model of antiferromagnetic resonance. The resulting model fits to

simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances and signal duration, for
the future networks of 2nd/2.5th/3rd-generation GW detectors. BH-NSs tend to
produce brighter kilonovae and afterglows if the BH has a higher aligned-spin,
and a less massive NS with a stiffer EoS. The detectability of kilonova is
especially sensitive to the BH spin. If BHs typically have low spins, the BH-NS
EM counterparts are hard to discover. For the 2nd generation GW detector
networks, a limiting magnitude of $m_{\rm limit}\sim23-24\,{\rm mag}$ is
required to detect the kilonovae even if BH high spin is assumed. Thus, a
plausible explanation for the lack of BH-NS associated kilonova detection
during LIGO/Virgo O3 is that either there is no EM counterpart (plunging
events), or the current follow-ups are too shallow. These observations still
have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with an sGRB or
an orphan afterglow. Follow-up observations can detect possible associated sGRB
afterglows, from which kilonova signatures may be studied. For time-domain
observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect
more BH-NS associated kilonovae and afterglows.

softening spring is observed, with growing hysteresis as the driving amplitude
increases. At large amplitudes, complex wave patterns emerge (including
wave-breaking and run up at the tank walls), competition between flow states is
observed and the dynamics departs progressively from Duffing. We also provide a

phase-lag reflects precisely the onset of deviations from Duffing dynamics and
- most importantly - at resonance the sloshing motion always lags the driving
by 90{\deg} (independently of the wave pattern). This confirms the theoretical

sputtering. Structural and ferroelectric characterizations reveal that the
(111)-oriented ZrO2 films are under epitaxial compressive strain and display a
switchable ferroelectric polarization of about 20.2 {\mu}C/cm2 with a coercive
field of 1.5 MV/cm. Moreover, the time dependent polarization reversal
characteristics of Nb:STO/ZrO2/Au film capacitors exhibit bell-shape curves, a
typical feature of ferroelectric films associated with domains reversal. The
estimated activation field is comparable to the coercive field obtained from
polarization-electric field hysteresis loops. Interestingly, the studied films
show ferroelectric behavior per se, i.e., there is no need to apply the wake-up
cycle that is essential to induce ferroelectricity in the conventional
(orthorhombic) ferroelectric phase of ZrO2. Therefore, the present films have a
technologically advantage over the previously studied ferroelectric ZrO2 films,
and may be attractive for nanoscale ferroelectric devices.

jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service.
Unfortunately, most conventional technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks
due to their inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable
anchor geometry. Thanks to the high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) could fly close to users to enhance signal strength while
maintaining a satisfactory geometry, making it a potential solution to the
above challenges. In this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming
positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize
time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations
and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links
to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as
anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the
presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the
proposed system, we first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV
self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and
synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled,
and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is
further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a
promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are
disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that
it is fully compatible with existing user equipment (UE) and positioning
methods.

changing data over time, which is often described with the term concept drift.
Due to their nature, concept drifts can severely affect the prediction
performance of a machine learning system. In this work, we analyze the effects
of concept drift in the context of a real-world data set. For efficient concept
drift handling, we introduce the switching scheme which combines the two
principles of retraining and updating of a machine learning model. Furthermore,
we systematically analyze existing regular adaptation as well as triggered
adaptation strategies. The switching scheme is instantiated on New York City
taxi data, which is heavily influenced by changing demand patterns over time.
We can show that the switching scheme outperforms all other baselines and
delivers promising prediction results.

analytical approaches are scarce and most often update strategies are employed
in numerical simulations of repeated games on networks until convergence is
reached. As a result, correlations between the choices of the players emerge.
Our approach is to study these correlations with a generalized Ising model.
Using the response strategy framework, we describe how the actions of the
players can bring the network into a steady configuration, starting from an
out-of-equilibrium one. We obtain these configurations using game-theoretical
tools, and describe the results using Ising parameters. We exhaust the
two-player case, giving a detailed account of all the equilibrium
possibilities. Going to three players, we generalize the Ising model and
compare the equilibrium solutions of three representative types of network. We
find that players that are not directly linked retain a degree of correlation
that is proportional to their initial correlation. We also find that the local
network structure is the most relevant for small values of the magnetic field
and the interaction strength of the Ising model. Finally, we conclude that
certain parameters of the equilibrium states are network independent, which
opens up the possibility of an analytical description of asymmetric games
played on networks.

about the source and distortion measure, the rate ratio Rindependent(K)/Rjoint
goes to one in the limit of small rate/high distortion. Moreover, we consider
the excess rate with respect to the rate-distortion function, Rindependent(K,

D. We provide two examples - a Gaussian source with mean-squared error and an
exponential source with one-sided error - for which the excess rate vanishes in
the limit as the number of rounds M goes to infinity, for any fixed D and K.

  Matrix Multiplication","6 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT cs.DC math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale machine learning and data mining methods routinely distribute
computations across multiple agents to parallelize processing. The time
required for computation at the agents is affected by the availability of local
resources giving rise to the ""straggler problem"" in which the computation
results are held back by unresponsive agents. For this problem, linear coding
of the matrix sub-blocks can be used to introduce resilience toward straggling.
The Parameter Server (PS) utilizes a channel code and distributes the matrices
to the workers for multiplication. It then produces an approximation to the
desired matrix multiplication using the results of the computations received at
a given deadline. In this paper, we propose to employ Unequal Error Protection
(UEP) codes to alleviate the straggler problem. The resiliency level of each
sub-block is chosen according to its norm as blocks with larger norms have
higher effects on the result of the matrix multiplication. We validate the
effectiveness of our scheme both theoretically and through numerical
evaluations. We derive a theoretical characterization of the performance of UEP
using random linear codes, and compare it the case of equal error protection.
We also apply the proposed coding strategy to the computation of the
back-propagation step in the training of a Deep Neural Network (DNN), for which
we investigate the fundamental trade-off between precision and the time
required for the computations.

the network take their dedicated roles and collaborate to generate future

  Circuit Switches",,,,,"math.OC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data centers are increasingly using high-speed circuit switches to cope with
the growing demand and reduce operational costs. One of the fundamental tasks
of circuit switches is to compute a sparse collection of switching
configurations to support a traffic demand matrix. Such a problem has been
addressed in the literature with variations of the approach proposed by
Birkhoff in 1946 to decompose a doubly stochastic matrix exactly. However, the
existing methods are heuristic and do not have theoretical guarantees on how
well a collection of switching configurations (i.e., permutations) can
approximate a traffic matrix (i.e., a scaled doubly stochastic matrix).
  In this paper, we revisit Birkhoff's approach and make three contributions.
First, we establish the first theoretical bound on the sparsity of Birkhoff's
algorithm (i.e., the number of switching configurations necessary to
approximate a traffic matrix). In particular, we show that by using a subset of
the admissible permutation matrices, Birkhoff's algorithm obtains an
$\epsilon$-approximate decomposition with at most $O( \log(1 / \epsilon))$
permutations. Second, we propose a new algorithm, Birkhoff+, which combines the
wealth of Frank-Wolfe with Birkhoff's approach to obtain sparse decompositions
in a fast manner. And third, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm numerically and study how this affects the performance of a circuit
switch. Our results show that Birkhoff+ is superior to previous algorithms in
terms of throughput, running time, and number of switching configurations.

demanding detection of terahertz radiation. Thus, either coherent
time-domain-spectroscopy schemes employing ultrafast pulsed lasers or
continuous-wave detection with photomixers requiring two laser systems are used
to circumvent the challenge to detect such low-energetic radiation without
using cooled detectors. Here, we report on the first demonstration of terahertz
spectroscopy, in which the sample interacts with terahertz idler photons, while
only correlated visible signal photons are detected - a concept inspired by
quantum optics. To generate these correlated signal-idler photon pairs, a
periodically poled lithium niobate crystal and a 660 nm continuous-wave pump
source are used. After propagating through a single-crystal nonlinear
interferometer, the pump photons are separated from the signal radiation by
highly efficient and narrowband volume Bragg gratings. An uncooled scientific
CMOS camera detects the frequency-angular spectra of the remaining visible
signal and reveals terahertz-spectral information in the Stokes as well as the
anti-Stokes part of collinear forward generation. Neither cooled detectors nor
expensive pulsed lasers for coherent detection are required. We demonstrate

not vary with PA separation. However, $\vert\gamma\vert$ increases with PA

different edge conditions. The high-f AE is detected throughout the transition
from limiter to X-point configuration, though its damping rate increases; the

state cannot be reproduced classically. Such correlations are called Nonlocal.
They are the elementary manifestation of a broader phenomenon called Network
Nonlocality, where several entangled states shared in a network create Network
Nonlocal correlations. In this paper, we provide the first class of strategies
producing nonlocal correlations in generic networks. In these strategies,
called Color-Matching (CM), any source takes a color at random or in
superposition, where the colors are labels for a basis of the associated
Hilbert space. A party (besides other things) checks if the color of
neighboring sources match. We show that in a large class of networks without
input, well-chosen quantum CM strategies result in nonlocal correlations that
cannot be produced classically. For our construction, we introduce the graph
theoretical concept of rigidity of classical strategies in networks, and using
the Finner inequality, establish a deep connection between network nonlocality
and graph theory. In particular, we establish a link between CM strategies and
the graph coloring problem. This work is extended in a longer paper, Network
Nonlocality via Rigidity of Token-Counting and Color-Matching, where we
introduce a second family of rigid strategies called Token-Counting, leading to
network nonlocality.

which restricts their application for viable spintronic devices. We propose a
novel type of photonic-crystal (PC) based structures for efficient and tunable
optically-induced spin current generation via the Spin Seebeck and inverse spin
Hall effects. It is experimentally demonstrated that optical surface modes
localized at the PC surface covered by ferromagnetic layer and materials with
giant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) notably increase the efficiency of the
optically-induced spin current generation and provides its tunability by
modifying light wavelength or angle of incidence. Up to 100% of the incident
light power can be transferred to heat within the SOC layer and, therefore, to
spin current. Importantly, high efficiency becomes accessible even for
ultra-thin SOC layers. Moreover, surface patterning of the PC-based spintronic
nanostructure allows local generation of spin currents at the pattern scales
rather than diameter of the laser beam.

produce GWs as a function of redshift. The gravitational lensing of GWs by PBHs
can also enhance the amplitude of the strain. We simulate GWs sourced by binary
PBHs, with the detection threshold of $S/N>10$ for both Livingston and Hanford

baseline model and accent-specific adaptation, AST-G achieves 9.8% and 1.9%

propose the multi-task learning with gate mechanism (MTL-G). As the accent

nanocrystals synthesized in a glass matrix are investigated using polarized
photoluminescence in high magnetic fields up to 30 Tesla. The dynamics are
accelerated by increasing temperature and magnetic field, confirming the dark
exciton nature of the low-temperature photoluminescence (PL). The circularly
polarized PL in magnetic fields reveals several unusual appearances: (i) a
spectral dependence of the polarization degree, (ii) its low saturation value,
and (iii) a stronger intensity of the Zeeman component which is higher in
energy. The latter feature is the most surprising being in contradiction with
the thermal population of the exciton spin sublevels. The same contradiction
was previously observed in the ensemble of wet-chemically synthesized CdSe
nanocrystals, but was not understood. We present a theory which explains all
the observed features and shows that the inverted ordering of the circular
polarized PL maxima from the ensemble of nanocrystals is a result of
competition between the zero phonon (ZPL) and one optical phonon (1PL) assisted
emission of the dark excitons. The essential aspects of the theoretical model
are different polarization properties of the dark exciton emission via ZPL and
1PL recombination channels and the inhomogeneous broadening of the PL spectrum

a universal phenomenon in nature, but the underlying mathematical mechanism
remains unclear. In this study, a relaxation algorithm based on a simple
geometrical rule was developed to simulate the equilibration. The proposed
algorithm was implemented in Python language. The simulated relaxation changed
the polygonal cell of the Voronoi network from an ellipse's inscribed polygon
toward the ellipse's maximal inscribed polygon. Meanwhile, the Aboav-Weaire's
law, which describes the neighboring relationship between cells, still holds
statistically. The succeed of simulation strongly supports the ellipse packing
hypothesis that was proposed to explain the dynamic behaviors of a trivalent 2D

tends to be shorter than edges of small cells, and vice versa. In addition, the
relaxation increases the area and edge length of large cells, and it decreases
the area and edge length of small cells. The pattern of changes in the area of
different-edged cells due to relaxation is almost the same as the growth
pattern described by the von-Neumann-Mullins law. The results presented in this

a challenging topic in communication systems. Indeed, although an exact

analysis of the associated symbol error rate (SER) is still open. So far, the
analytical SER expressions available in the literature approximate the
time-domain impulsive noise, as Gaussian distributed in the discrete frequency
domain. Conversely, this work presents an accurate analysis of the distortion
noise at the nonlinearity output exploiting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). By
using GMMs we unified the approach of SER prediction for unmitigated systems,
as well as for the mitigated ones, equipped by non-linear impulsive noise
suppressors, including blanking, clipping, clipping-blanking and attenuating

their potential of being versatile helpers in our everyday environments.
Bipedal walking is, however, a complex motion that requires the coordination of
many degrees of freedom while it is also inherently unstable and sensitive to
disturbances. The balance of a walking biped has to be constantly maintained.
The most effective way of controlling balance are well timed and placed
recovery steps -- capture steps -- that absorb the expense momentum gained from
a push or a stumble. We present a bipedal gait generation framework that
utilizes step timing and foot placement techniques in order to recover the
balance of a biped even after strong disturbances. Our framework modifies the
next footstep location instantly when responding to a disturbance and generates
controllable omnidirectional walking using only very little sensing and
computational power. We exploit the open-loop stability of a central pattern
generated gait to fit a linear inverted pendulum model to the observed center
of mass trajectory. Then, we use the fitted model to predict suitable footstep
locations and timings in order to maintain balance while following a target
walking velocity. Our experiments show qualitative and statistical evidence of

artificial intelligence. It allows multiple participants to collaboratively
train a better global model and offers a privacy-aware paradigm for model
training since it does not require participants to release their original
training data. However, existing FL solutions for vertically partitioned data
or decision trees require heavy cryptographic operations. In this paper, we
propose a framework named FederBoost for private federated learning of gradient
boosting decision trees (GBDT). It supports running GBDT over both vertically
and horizontally partitioned data. Vertical FederBoost does not require any
cryptographic operation and horizontal FederBoost only requires lightweight
secure aggregation. The key observation is that the whole training process of
GBDT relies on the ordering of the data instead of the values. We fully
implement FederBoost and evaluate its utility and efficiency through extensive
experiments performed on three public datasets. Our experimental results show
that both vertical and horizontal FederBoost achieve the same level of accuracy
with centralized training, where all data are collected in a central server;
and they are 4-5 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art solutions
for federated decision tree training; hence offering practical solutions for
industrial application.

by a Cooper logarithm in the internal energy but the order parameter is not

distortional instabilities. Moreover, we discuss the instability using an
effective single-band model. This framework reveals a duality mapping of the
effective model which maps the distortional order parameter onto a
superconducting one, providing a natural explanation for the Cooper logarithm

possibility of a pair-density wave state when inversion symmetry is broken. We

attractive technique to engage a diverse and large pool of subjects in

completion times that would otherwise not be feasible in lab settings. However,
the scale and flexibility comes at the cost of multiple and sometimes unknown
sources of bias and confounding factors that arise from technical limitations

systematic evaluations of task design as a motivating example to explore,
describe, and quantify the potential impact of running uncontrolled

challenges identified, we can mention sampling bias, controlling the assignment
of subjects to experimental conditions, learning effects, and reliability of
crowdsourcing results. According to our empirical studies, the impact of
potential biases and confounding factors can amount to a 38\% loss in the
utility of the data collected in uncontrolled settings; and it can
significantly change the outcome of experiments. These issues ultimately
inspired us to implement CrowdHub, a system that sits on top of major

Maximum likelihood. estimation (MLE) of ECD leads to a system of non-linear

the computation time required for these methods is unacceptably long, for
large-scale or high-dimensional datasets. To overcome this difficulty, the
present work introduces a Riemannian optimisation method, the information
stochastic gradient (ISG). The ISG is an online (recursive) method, which
achieves the same performance as MLE, for large-scale datasets, while requiring
modest memory and time resources. To develop the ISG method, the Riemannian
information gradient is derived taking into account the product manifold
associated to the underlying parameter space of the ECD. From this information
gradient definition, we define also, the information deterministic gradient
(IDG), an offline (batch) method, which is an alternative, for moderate-sized
datasets. The present work formulates these two methods, and demonstrates their
performance through numerical simulations. Two applications, to image
re-colorization, and to texture classification, are also worked out.

the shot-noise limit (SNL) for sensing spatially distributed parameters. To
date, distributed quantum sensing experiments have been mostly accomplished in
laboratory environments without a real space separation for the sensors. In
addition, the post-selection is normally assumed to demonstrate the sensitivity
advantage over the SNL. Here, we demonstrate distributed quantum sensing in
field and show the unconditional violation (without post-selection) of SNL up
to 0.916 dB for the field distance of 240 m. The achievement is based on a
loophole free Bell test setup with entangled photon pairs at the averaged
heralding efficiency of 73.88%. Moreover, to test quantum sensing in real life,
we demonstrate the experiment for long distances (with 10-km fiber) together
with the sensing of a completely random and unknown parameter. The results
represent an important step towards a practical quantum sensing network for
widespread applications.

predict a single specific outcome such as a particular objective, (remaining)
time, or next activity/remaining sequence. Recently, a longer-horizon,
model-wide approach has been proposed in the form of process model forecasting,
which predicts the future state of a whole process model through the
forecasting of all activity-to-activity relations at once using time series
forecasting.
  This paper introduces the concept of \emph{predictive process model
monitoring} which sits in the middle of both predictive process monitoring and
process model forecasting. Concretely, by modelling a process model as a set of
constraints being present between activities over time, we can capture more
detailed information between activities compared to process model forecasting,
while being compatible with typical predictive process monitoring objectives
which are often expressed in the same language as these constraints. To achieve
this, Processes-As-Movies (PAM) is introduced, i.e., a novel technique capable
of jointly mining and predicting declarative process constraints between
activities in various windows of a process' execution. PAM predicts what
declarative rules hold for a trace (objective-based), which also supports the
prediction of all constraints together as a process model (model-based).
Various recurrent neural network topologies inspired by video analysis tailored
to temporal high-dimensional input are used to model the process model
evolution with windows as time steps, including encoder-decoder long short-term
memory networks, and convolutional long short-term memory networks. Results
obtained over real-life event logs show that these topologies are effective in
terms of predictive accuracy and precision.

consistently with their phase alignment with the radio profile. In deciding
whether a fitted curve is reasonable or not, we employed a least-square method

reasonable parameters in agreement with observations for ten millisecond

distributed state estimation problem, where all sensor nodes are required to
achieve a consensus estimation. The weighted least squares (WLS) estimator is
an appealing way to handle this problem since it does not need any prior
distribution information. To this end, we first exploit the equivalent relation
between the information filter and WLS estimator. Then, we establish an
optimization problem under the relation coupled with a consensus constraint.
Finally, the consensus-based distributed WLS problem is tackled by the
alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Numerical simulation
together with theoretical analysis testify the convergence and consensus
estimations between nodes.

on the submanifold, we first update the state using a non-reversible stochastic
differential equation which takes the state away from the submanifold, and in
the second step we project the state back onto the manifold using the long-time
limit of an ordinary differential equation. We prove the consistency of this

set of collocation points cannot penetrate multiple layers of media, thus
necessitating domain decomposition and the use of multiple sets of collocation
points. The solution process of this method proceeds entirely in physical

established at the collocation points; thus, a dense matrix eigenvalue system
is formed, from which the solution for the horizontal wavenumbers and modes can
be directly obtained. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the
validity and applicability of this method. A comparison with other methods
shows that the LCM proposed in this article is more accurate than the FDM and
offers roughly the same accuracy as but a faster calculation speed than other

role in the chemical evolution of the Universe and the origin of life. Nebular
phase spectroscopy constrains such metal yields, for example through forbidden
line emission associated with OI, CaII, FeII, or FeIII. Fluid instabilities
during the explosion produce a complex 3D ejecta structure, with considerable
macroscopic, but no microscopic, mixing of elements. This structure sets a
formidable challenge for detailed nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative
transfer modeling, which is generally limited to 1D in grid-based codes. Here,
we present a novel and simple method that allows for macroscopic mixing without
any microscopic mixing, thereby capturing the essence of mixing in SN
explosions. With this new technique, the macroscopically mixed ejecta is built
by shuffling in mass space, or equivalently in velocity space, the shells from
the unmixed coasting ejecta. The method requires no change to the radiative
transfer, but necessitates high spatial resolution to resolve the rapid
variation in composition with depth inherent to this shuffled-shell structure.
We show results for a few radiative-transfer simulations for a Type II SN
explosion from a 15Msun progenitor star. Our simulations capture the strong
variations in temperature or ionization between the various shells that are
rich in H, He, O, or Si. Because of nonlocal energy deposition, gamma rays
permeate through an extended region of the ejecta, making the details of the
shell arrangement unimportant. The greater physical consistency of the method
delivers spectral properties at nebular times that are more reliable, in
particular in terms of individual emission line strengths, which may serve to
constrain the SN yields and, for core collapse SNe, the progenitor mass. The
method works for all SN types.

which a test image ""looks like"" a prototype. However, perceptual similarity for
humans can be different from the similarity learned by the classification
model. Hence, only visualising prototypes can be insufficient for a user to
understand what a prototype exactly represents, and why the model considers a
prototype and an image to be similar. We address this ambiguity and argue that
prototypes should be explained. We improve interpretability by automatically
enhancing visual prototypes with textual quantitative information about visual
characteristics deemed important by the classification model. Specifically, our
method clarifies the meaning of a prototype by quantifying the influence of
colour hue, shape, texture, contrast and saturation and can generate both
global and local explanations. Because of the generality of our approach, it
can improve the interpretability of any similarity-based method for
prototypical image recognition. In our experiments, we apply our method to the
existing Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet). Our analysis confirms that the
global explanations are generalisable, and often correspond to the visually
perceptible properties of a prototype. Our explanations are especially relevant
for prototypes which might have been interpreted incorrectly otherwise. By
explaining such 'misleading' prototypes, we improve the interpretability and
simulatability of a prototype-based classification model. We also use our

expand, which explains its low colour temperature. Our calculations show that
the circumstellar material in LIN 358 is nearly completely ionized except for a
narrow cone around the donor star, and that the WD emission is freely escaping
the system. However, due to its low colour temperature, this emission can be
easily attenuated by even moderate amounts of neutral ISM. We speculate that
other symbiotic systems may be operating in a similar regime, thus explaining
the paucity of observed systems.

their natal protostellar disks, residual gas continues to diffuse onto
horseshoe streamlines under effect of viscous dissipation, and meander in and
out of the planets' Hill sphere. Within the Hill sphere, the horseshoe
streamlines intercept gas flow in circumplanetary disks. The host stars' tidal
perturbation induces a barrier across the converging streamlines' interface.
Viscous transfer of angular momentum across this tidal barrier determines the
rate of mass diffusion from the horseshoe streamlines onto the circumplanetary
disks, and eventually the accretion rate onto the protoplanets. We carry out a
series of numerical simulations to test the influence of this tidal barrier on
super thermal planets. In weakly viscous disks, protoplanets' accretion rate
steeply decreases with their masses above the thermal limit. As their growth
timescale exceeds the gas depletion time scale, their masses reach asymptotic
values comparable to that of Jupiter. In relatively thick and strongly viscous
disks, protoplanets' asymptotic masses exceed several times that of Jupiter.
Two dimensional numerical simulations show that such massive protoplanets
strongly excite the eccentricity of nearby horseshoe streamlines, destabilize
orderly flow, substantially enhance the diffusion rate across the tidal
barrier, and elevate their growth rate until their natal disk is severely
depleted. In contrast, eccentric streamlines remain stable in three dimensional
simulations. Based on the upper falloff in the observe mass distribution of
known exoplanets, we suggest their natal disks had relatively low viscosity
alpha sim 0.001, modest thickness H/R sim 0.03 to 0.05, and limited masses
comparable to that of minimum mass solar nebula model.

including pairs trading and other statistical arbitrage strategies, may be
characterized in terms of excursions of the market price of a portfolio away
from a reference level. We propose a mathematical framework for the risk
analysis of such strategies, based on a description in terms of price
excursions, first in a pathwise setting, without probabilistic assumptions,
then in a Markovian setting.
  We introduce the notion of delta-excursion, defined as a path which deviates
by delta from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that
every continuous path has a unique decomposition into delta-excursions, which
is useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to
simple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss and
drawdown. As delta is decreased to zero, properties of this decomposition
relate to the local time of the path.
  When the underlying asset follows a Markov process, we combine these results
with Ito's excursion theory to obtain a tractable decomposition of the process
as a concatenation of independent delta-excursions, whose distribution is
described in terms of Ito's excursion measure. We provide analytical results
for linear diffusions and give new examples of stochastic processes for
flexible and tractable modeling of excursions. Finally, we describe a
non-parametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion
properties match those observed in empirical data.

any interacting condensed-matter mixture of a charged and a neutral component,
we focus on nuclear matter in neutron star cores, where proton and neutron
condensates are coupled via non-dissipative entrainment. We employ the Skyrme
interaction to determine the neutron star's equilibrium composition, and hence
obtain realistic coefficients for our Ginzburg-Landau model at each depth

superconducting phase diagrams for six representative Skyrme models, revealing
the microphysical magnetic flux distribution throughout the neutron star core.
The phase diagrams are rather complex and the locations of most of the phase
transitions can only be determined through numerical calculations. Nonetheless,
we find that for all equations of state considered in this work, much of the
outer core exhibits type-1.5 superconductivity, rather than type-II
superconductivity as is generally assumed. For local magnetic field strengths
$\lesssim 10^{14} \, {\rm G}$, the magnetic flux is distributed
inhomogeneously, with bundles of magnetic fluxtubes separated by flux-free
Meissner regions. We provide an approximate criterion to determine the

Given an
overlap detector and a speaker embedding extractor, our method performs
spectral clustering of segments informed by the output of the overlap detector.
This is achieved by transforming the discrete clustering problem into a convex
optimization problem which is solved by eigen-decomposition. Thereafter, we
discretize the solution by alternatively using singular value decomposition and
a modified version of non-maximal suppression which is constrained by the
output of the overlap detector. Furthermore, we detail an HMM-DNN based overlap
detector which performs frame-level classification and enforces duration
constraints through HMM state transitions. Our method achieves a test
diarization error rate (DER) of 24.0% on the mixed-headset setting of the AMI
meeting corpus, which is a relative improvement of 15.2% over a strong
agglomerative hierarchical clustering baseline, and compares favorably with
other overlap-aware diarization methods. Further analysis on the LibriCSS data

contemporary non-invasive modalities for probing tissue structure at the
microscopic scale. The majority of dMRI techniques employ standard single
diffusion encoding (SDE) measurements, covering different sequence parameter
ranges depending on the complexity of the method. Although many signal
representations and biophysical models have been proposed for SDE data, they
are intrinsically limited by a lack of specificity. Advanced dMRI methods have
been proposed to provide additional microstructural information beyond what can
be inferred from SDE. These enhanced contrasts can play important roles in
characterizing biological tissues, for instance upon diseases (e.g.
neurodegenerative, cancer, stroke), aging, learning, and development.
  In this review we focus on double diffusion encoding (DDE), which stands out
among other advanced acquisitions for its versatility, ability to probe more
specific diffusion correlations, and feasibility for preclinical and clinical
applications. Various DDE methodologies have been employed to probe compartment
sizes (Section 3), decouple the effects of microscopic diffusion anisotropy
from orientation dispersion (Section 4), probe displacement correlations, study
exchange, or suppress fast diffusing compartments (Section 6). DDE measurements
can also be used to improve the robustness of biophysical models (Section 5)
and study intra-cellular diffusion via magnetic resonance spectroscopy of
metabolites (Section 7). This review discusses all these topics as well as
important practical aspects related to the implementation and contrast in
preclinical and clinical settings (Section 9) and aims to provide the readers a
guide for deciding on the right DDE acquisition for their specific application.

performance advantage when categories at inference time match those at training

where out-of-domain object categories are involved. To overcome this issue, we
introduce a novel ""imagination"" module based on Regularized Auto-Encoders, that
learns context-aware and category-aware latent embeddings without relying on

the United States. As part of their marketing communication strategy, an
increasing number of politicians adopt social media to inform their
constituencies. This study documents the returns from adopting a new
technology, namely Twitter, for politicians running for Congress by focusing on
the change in campaign contributions received. We compare weekly donations
received just before and just after a politician opens a Twitter account in
regions with high and low levels of Twitter penetration, controlling for
politician-month fixed effects. Specifically, over the course of a political
campaign, we estimate that the differential effect of opening a Twitter account
in regions with high vs low levels of Twitter penetration amounts to an
increase of 0.7-2% in donations for all politicians and 1-3.1% for new
politicians, who were never elected to the Congress before. In contrast, the
effect of joining Twitter for experienced politicians remains negligibly small.
We find some evidence consistent with the explanation that the effect is driven
by new information about the candidates, e.g., the effect is primarily driven
by new donors rather than past donors, by candidates without Facebook accounts
and tweeting more informatively. Overall, our findings imply that social media
can intensify political competition by lowering costs of disseminating
information for new entrants to their constituents and thus may reduce the
barriers to enter politics.

design practices within 73 most visited Arabic websites in Saudi Arabia

exhaustive analysis showed discrepancies between the international design
recommendations and the actual design of Arabic websites. There was a
considerable variation and inconsistency in using font types and sizes between
and within the Arabic websites. Arabic Droid Kufi was used mostly for styling
page titles and navigation menus, whilst Tahoma was used for styling
paragraphs. The font size of the Arabic text ranged from 12 to 16 pixels, which
may lead to poor readability. Images were used heavily in the Arabic websites
causing prolonged site loading times. Moreover, the images strongly reflected
the dimensions of the Saudi culture, especially collectivism and masculinity.
Current Arabic web design practices are compared against the findings from past
studies about international designs and lessons aiming at ameliorating the

at home, which brings greater challenge to recognize activities. In addition,
many conventional approaches rely on manual time series data segmentation
ignoring the inherent characteristics of events and their heuristic
hand-crafted feature generation algorithms are difficult to exploit distinctive
features to accurately classify different activities. To address these issues,
we propose an end-to-end Tree-Structure Convolutional neural network based
framework for Multi-Resident Activity Recognition (TSC-MRAR). First, we treat
each sample as an event and obtain the current event embedding through the
previous sensor readings in the sliding window without splitting the time
series data. Then, in order to automatically generate the temporal features, a
tree-structure network is designed to derive the temporal dependence of nearby
readings. The extracted features are fed into the fully connected layer, which
can jointly learn the residents labels and the activity labels simultaneously.
Finally, experiments on CASAS datasets demonstrate the high performance in
multi-resident activity recognition of our model compared to state-of-the-art
techniques.

different security lattices and information flow policies. We propose a
connection framework that permits different organisations to exchange

their autonomy in formulating and maintaining security policies. Our
prescriptive framework is based on the rigorous mathematical framework of
Lagois connections proposed by Melton, together with a simple operational model
for transferring object data between domains. The merit of this formulation is
that it is simple, minimal, adaptable and intuitive. We show that our framework
is semantically sound, by proving that the connections proposed preserve
standard correctness notions such as non-interference. We then illustrate how
Lagois theory also provides a robust framework and methodology for negotiating
and maintaining secure agreements on information flow between autonomous
organisations, even when either or both organisations change their security
lattices. Composition and decomposition properties indicate support for a
modular approach to secure flow frameworks in complex organisations. We next
show that this framework extends naturally and conservatively to the
Decentralised Labels Model of Myers et al. - a Lagois connection between the
hierarchies of principals in two organisations naturally induces a Lagois
connection between the corresponding security label lattices, thus extending
the security guarantees ensured by the decentralised model to encompass
bidirectional inter-organisational flows.

performance of a machine learning model should occur at an intermediate model
complexity, with simpler models exhibiting high bias and more complex models
exhibiting high variance of the predictive function. However, such a simple
trade-off does not adequately describe deep learning models that simultaneously
attain low bias and variance in the heavily overparameterized regime. A primary
obstacle in explaining this behavior is that deep learning algorithms typically
involve multiple sources of randomness whose individual contributions are not
visible in the total variance. To enable fine-grained analysis, we describe an
interpretable, symmetric decomposition of the variance into terms associated
with the randomness from sampling, initialization, and the labels. Moreover, we
compute the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of this decomposition for
random feature kernel regression, and analyze the strikingly rich phenomenology
that arises. We find that the bias decreases monotonically with the network
width, but the variance terms exhibit non-monotonic behavior and can diverge at
the interpolation boundary, even in the absence of label noise. The divergence
is caused by the \emph{interaction} between sampling and initialization and can
therefore be eliminated by marginalizing over samples (i.e. bagging) \emph{or}
over the initial parameters (i.e. ensemble learning).

popular in online messaging apps, and some works are dedicated to automatically
select sticker response by matching the stickers image with previous
utterances. However, existing methods usually focus on measuring the matching
degree between the dialog context and sticker image, which ignores the user
preference of using stickers. Hence, in this paper, we propose to recommend an
appropriate sticker to user based on multi-turn dialog context and sticker
using history of user. Two main challenges are confronted in this task. One is
to model the sticker preference of user based on the previous sticker selection
history. Another challenge is to jointly fuse the user preference and the
matching between dialog context and candidate sticker into final prediction
making. To tackle these challenges, we propose a \emph{Preference Enhanced
Sticker Response Selector} (PESRS) model. Specifically, PESRS first employs a
convolutional based sticker image encoder and a self-attention based multi-turn
dialog encoder to obtain the representation of stickers and utterances. Next,
deep interaction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the
sticker and each utterance. Then, we model the user preference by using the
recently selected stickers as input, and use a key-value memory network to
store the preference representation. PESRS then learns the short-term and
long-term dependency between all interaction results by a fusion network, and
dynamically fuse the user preference representation into the final sticker
selection prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale
real-world dialog dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art
performance for all commonly-used metrics. Experiments also verify the
effectiveness of each component of PESRS.

seismic signals whose detection, identification, and authentication
traditionally call for laborious analyses. Machine learning (ML) has grown in
recent years to be a powerful efficiency-boosting tool in geophysical analyses,
including the detection of specific signals in time series. However, detecting
weak signals that are buried in noise challenges ML algorithms, in part because
ubiquitous training data is not always available. Under these circumstances, ML
can be as ineffective as human experts are inefficient. At this intersection of
effectiveness and efficiency, we leverage a third tool that has grown in
popularity over the past decade: Citizen science. Citizen science project
Earthquake Detective leverages the eyes and ears of volunteers to detect and
classify weak signals in seismograms from potentially dynamically triggered
(PDT) events. Here, we present the Earthquake Detective data set - A
crowd-sourced set of labels on PDT earthquakes and tremor. We apply Machine
Learning to classify these PDT seismic events and explore the challenges faced
in segregating and classifying such weak signals. We confirm that with an
image- and wavelet-based algorithm, machine learning can detect signals from
small earthquakes. In addition, we report that our ML algorithm can also detect
signals from PDT tremor, which has not been previously demonstrated. The
citizen science data set of classifications and ML code are available online.

interrupt operations, reduce efficiency, and may contaminate the subsurface.
When a drilled borehole intercepts conductive faults or fractures, lost
circulation manifests as a partial or total escape of drilling, workover, or
cementing fluids, into the surrounding rock formations. Loss control materials
(LCM) are often used in the mitigation process. Understanding the fracture
effective hydraulic properties and fluid leakage behavior is crucial to
mitigate this problem. Analytical modeling of fluid flow in fractures is a tool
that can be quickly deployed to assess lost circulation and perform
diagnostics, including leakage rate decline, effective fracture conductivity,
and selection of the LCM. Such models should be applicable to Newtonian and
non-Newtonian yield-stress fluids, where the fluid rheology is a nonlinear
function of fluid flow and shear stress. In this work, a new semi-analytical
solution is developed to model the flow of non-Newtonian drilling fluid in a
fractured medium. The solution model is applicable for various fluid types
exhibiting yield-power-law (Herschel-Bulkley). We use high-resolution
finite-element simulations based on the Cauchy equation to verify our
solutions. We also generate type-curves and compare them to others in the
literature. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model for two
field cases encountering lost circulations. To address the subsurface
uncertainty, we combine the developed solutions with Monte-Carlo and generate
probabilistic predictions. The solution method can estimate the range of
fracture conductivity, parametrized by the fracture hydraulic aperture, and
time-dependent fluid loss rate that can predict the cumulative volume of lost
fluid. The proposed approach is accurate and efficient enough to support
decision-making for real-time drilling operations.

respondents. However, despite researchers' best efforts in designing
questionnaires, respondents may experience difficulty understanding questions'
intent and therefore may struggle to respond appropriately. If it were possible
to detect such difficulty, this knowledge could be used to inform real-time
interventions through responsive questionnaire design, or to indicate and
correct measurement error after the fact. Previous research in the context of
web surveys has used paradata, specifically response times, to detect
difficulties and to help improve user experience and data quality. However,
richer data sources are now available, in the form of the movements respondents
make with the mouse, as an additional and far more detailed indicator for the
respondent-survey interaction. This paper uses machine learning techniques to
explore the predictive value of mouse-tracking data with regard to respondents'
difficulty. We use data from a survey on respondents' employment history and
demographic information, in which we experimentally manipulate the difficulty
of several questions. Using features derived from the cursor movements, we
predict whether respondents answered the easy or difficult version of a
question, using and comparing several state-of-the-art supervised learning
methods. In addition, we develop a personalization method that adjusts for
respondents' baseline mouse behavior and evaluate its performance. For all
three manipulated survey questions, we find that including the full set of
mouse movement features improved prediction performance over response-time-only
models in nested cross-validation. Accounting for individual differences in
mouse movements led to further improvements.

Neural Network (DNN) end-to-end driving model to match the direction and speed
of a target pedestrian. The model uses a classifier DNN to determine if the
pedestrian is within the field of view of the camera sensor. If the pedestrian
is present, the image stream from the camera is fed to a regression DNN which
simultaneously adjusts the autonomous vehicle's steering and throttle to keep
cadence with the pedestrian. If the pedestrian is not visible, the vehicle uses
a straightforward exploratory search strategy to reacquire the tracking
objective. The classifier and regression DNNs incorporate grouped convolutions
to boost model performance as well as to significantly reduce parameter count
and compute latency. The models are trained on the Intelligence Processing Unit
(IPU) to leverage its fine-grain compute capabilities in order to minimize
time-to-train. The results indicate very robust tracking behavior on the part
of the autonomous vehicle in terms of its steering and throttle profiles, while
requiring minimal data collection to produce. The throughput in terms of
processing training samples has been boosted by the use of the IPU in
conjunction with grouped convolutions by a factor ~3.5 for training of the
classifier and a factor of ~7 for the regression network. A recording of the
vehicle tracking a pedestrian has been produced and is available on the web.

learning, estimators of the relative frequency (also called ``prevalence'') of
sentiment-related classes (such as \textsf{Positive}, \textsf{Neutral},
\textsf{Negative}) in a sample of unlabelled texts. This task is especially
important when these texts are tweets, since the final goal of most sentiment
classification efforts carried out on Twitter data is actually quantification
(and not the classification of individual tweets). It is well-known that
solving quantification by means of ``classify and count'' (i.e., by classifying
all unlabelled items by means of a standard classifier and counting the items
that have been assigned to a given class) is less than optimal in terms of
accuracy, and that more accurate quantification methods exist. Gao and
Sebastiani (2016) carried out a systematic comparison of quantification methods
on the task of tweet sentiment quantification. In hindsight, we observe that
the experimental protocol followed in that work was weak, and that the
reliability of the conclusions that were drawn from the results is thus
questionable. We now re-evaluate those quantification methods (plus a few more
modern ones) on exactly the same same datasets, this time following a now
consolidated and much more robust experimental protocol (which also involves
simulating the presence, in the test data, of class prevalence values very
different from those of the training set). This experimental protocol (even
without counting the newly added methods) involves a number of experiments
5,775 times larger than that of the original study. The results of our
experiments are dramatically different from those obtained by Gao and
Sebastiani, and they provide a different, much more solid understanding of the
relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification
methods.
