enables complex recommendations models. We evaluate the effect of different
parts of a HIN on the accuracy and the diversity of recommendations, then
investigate if these effects are only due to the semantic content encoded in
the network. We use recently-proposed diversity measures which are based on the
network structure and better suited to the HIN formalism. Finally, we randomly
shuffle the edges of some parts of the HIN, to empty the network from its
semantic content, while leaving its structure relatively unaffected. We show
that the semantic content encoded in the network data has a limited importance
for the performance of a recommender system and that structure is crucial.

However, the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same

Given simple constraints on relation representations, PairRE can encode

bottleneck layer which possesses both geometry and associated feature
attributes. Then, the geometric occupancy is losslessly compressed using an
octree codec and the feature attributes are lossy compressed using a learned
probabilistic context model.Compared to state-of-the-art Video-based Point

alternative to the conventional codec through the implementation of a
keypoint-centric encoder relying on the transmission of keypoint information
from within a video feed. The decoder uses the streamed keypoints to generate a
reconstruction preserving the semantic features in the input feed. Focusing on
video calling applications, we detect and transmit the body pose and face mesh
information through the network, which are displayed at the receiver in the
form of animated puppets. Using efficient pose and face mesh detection in
conjunction with skeleton-based animation, we demonstrate a prototype requiring
lower than 35 kbps bandwidth, an order of magnitude reduction over typical
video calling systems. The added computational latency due to the mesh
extraction and animation is below 120ms on a standard laptop, showcasing the

leptons in electron and neutrino quasielastic and pion production processes on
nuclear targets in the region of the $\Delta$ resonance depends on several
parameters. These parameters include the removal energy of the initial state
nucleon from the nucleus $\epsilon^{P,N}$, the potentials of electrons,
nucleons and pions in the Coulomb field of the nucleus $|V_{eff}|$, and the
kinetic energy dependent nuclear potential for final state nucleons
($U^{QE}_{opt}$) and ""nucleon plus pion"" final states in the region of the
$\Delta$ resonance which we refer to as $U^{\Delta}_{opt}$. We extract these
parameters from electron scattering data.
  Previous studies have shown that real part of the optical potential for a
nucleon bound in $_{6}^{12}C$ at zero kinetic energy
$U^{P,N}_{opt}(T=0)\approx$ 44 MeV is larger than that for the $\Delta$(1232)
resonance $U^{\Delta}_{opt}(T=0)\approx$ 30 MeV. We find the reverse at higher
kinetic energies. For example at T=100 MeV we find a nucleon potential
$U^{P,N}_{opt}(T=100 MeV)$=20$\pm$5 MeV and $U^{\Delta}_{opt}(T=100 MeV)$=
30$\pm$5 MeV. The two results are consistent for two reasons. First,
theoretically the kinetic energy dependence of the $\Delta$ potential is
flatter than that of the nucleon. Secondly, in our analysis the extracted
$U^{\Delta}_{opt}$ values are the nuclear potential for {\it""nucleon plus
pion""} final states in the region of the $\Delta$ resonances and therefore
includes contributions from both resonance and non resonance pion production
processes. For Monte Carlo generators that only include the effects of Fermi

readings, where the readings are not transmitted when there is no enough change

analyzing the transmission pattern of an SM, sensitive information on the house
dwellers can be inferred. For instance, since the transmission pattern is
distinguishable when dwellers are on travel, attackers may analyze the pattern
to launch a presence-privacy attack (PPA) to infer whether the dwellers are
absent from home. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called ""STDL"", for
efficient collection of power consumption readings in AMI networks while
preserving the consumers' privacy by sending spoofing transmissions (redundant
real readings) using a deep-learning approach. We first use a clustering
technique and real power consumption readings to create a dataset for
transmission patterns using the CAT approach. Then, we train an attacker model
using deep-learning, and our evaluations indicate that the success rate of the
attacker is about 91%. Finally, we train a deep-learning-based defense model to
send spoofing transmissions efficiently to thwart the PPA. Extensive
evaluations are conducted, and the results indicate that our scheme can reduce
the attacker's success rate, to 13.52% in case he knows the defense model and
to 3.15% in case he does not know the model, while still achieving high
efficiency in terms of the number of readings that should be transmitted. Our

  applied to the UK",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic has been accompanied by accumulating
evidence on the underlying epidemiological parameters. Hence there is potential
for models providing mid-term forecasts of the epidemic trajectory using such
information. The effectiveness of lockdown interventions can also be assessed
by modelling later epidemic stages, possibly using a multiphase epidemic model.
Commonly applied methods to analyze epidemic trajectories include
phenomenological growth models (e.g. the Richards), and variants of the
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment model. Here we focus on a
practical forecasting approach, applied to interim UK COVID data, using a
bivariate Reynolds model (cases and deaths). We show the utility of informative
priors in developing and estimating the model, and compare error densities
(Poisson-gamma, Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-logStudent) for overdispersed data
on new cases and deaths. We use cross-validation to assess medium term
forecasts. We also consider the longer term post-lockdown epidemic profile to
assess epidemic containment, using a two phase model. Fit to mid-epidemic data
shows better fit to training data and better cross validation performance for a
Poisson-logStudent model. Estimation of longer term epidemic data after
lockdown relaxation, characterised by protracted slow downturn and then upturn
in cases, casts doubt on effective containment. Many applications of
phenomenological models have been to complete epidemics. However, evaluation of
such models based simply on their fit to observed data may give only a partial
picture, and cross-validation against actual trends is also useful. Similarly,
it may be preferable to model incidence rather than cumulative data, though
this raises questions about suitable error densities for modelling often
erratic fluctuations. Hence there may be utility in evaluating alternative
error assumptions.

integers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ and a target integer $t$ with $t > a_i$ for all $i$,
determine if there is an $S \subseteq [n]$ such that $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = t$.
The well-known pseudopolynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm [Bellman,
1957] solves Subset Sum in $O(nt)$ time, while requiring $\Omega(t)$ space.
  In this paper we present algorithms for Subset Sum with $\tilde O(nt)$
running time and much lower space requirements than Bellman's algorithm, as
well as that of prior work. We show that Subset Sum can be solved in $\tilde
O(nt)$ time and $O(\log(nt))$ space with access to $O(\log n \log \log n+\log
t)$ random bits. This significantly improves upon the $\tilde O(n
t^{1+\varepsilon})$-time, $\tilde O(n\log t)$-space algorithm of Bringmann
(SODA 2017). We also give an $\tilde O(n^{1+\varepsilon}t)$-time,
$O(\log(nt))$-space randomized algorithm, improving upon previous
$(nt)^{O(1)}$-time $O(\log(nt))$-space algorithms by Elberfeld, Jakoby, and
Tantau (FOCS 2010), and Kane (2010). In addition, we also give a $\mathrm{poly}

  We also study time-space trade-offs for Subset Sum. For parameter $1\le k\le
\min\{n,t\}$, we present a randomized algorithm running in $\tilde O((n+t)\cdot
k)$ time and $O((t/k) \mathrm{polylog} (nt))$ space.
  As an application of our results, we give an
$\tilde{O}(\min\{n^2/\varepsilon, n/\varepsilon^2\})$-time and
$\mathrm{polylog}(nt)$-space algorithm for ""weak"" $\varepsilon$-approximations

impurity scattering as a benchmark example. We predict the onset in the mixed
inter-intraband regime of novel incoherent features driven by the interaction

conductivity with a spectral weight proportional to the scattering rate.We show
also that, in spite of the complex many-body physics, the purely intraband term
governing the limit $\omega \to 0$ resembles the constraints of the
phenomenological model. We ascribe this agreement to the fulfilling of the

equations in the vicinity of an unstable equilibrium solution, by means of a
`minimal' and `least' invasive feedback strategy which consists of a control
pair $\{ v,u \}$ \cite{LT2:2015}. Here $v$ is a tangential boundary feedback
control, acting on an arbitrary small part $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of the boundary
$\Gamma$; while $u$ is a localized, interior feedback control, acting
tangentially on an arbitrarily small subset $\omega$ of the interior supported
by $\widetilde{\Gamma}$. The ideal strategy of taking $u = 0$ on $\omega$ is
not sufficient. A question left open in the literature was: Can such feedback
control $v$ of the pair $\{ v, u \}$ be asserted to be finite dimensional also
in the dimension $d = 3$? We here give an affirmative answer to this question,
thus establishing an optimal result. To achieve the desired finite
dimensionality of the feedback tangential boundary control $v$, it is here then
necessary to abandon the Hilbert setting of past literature and replace it with
a Besov setting which are `close' to $L^3(\Omega)$ for $d=3$. It is in line
with recent critical well-posedness in the full space of the non-controlled N-S
equations. A key feature of such Besov spaces with tight indices is that they
do not recognize compatibility conditions. The proof is constructive and is
""optimal"" also regarding the ""minimal"" number of tangential boundary
controllers needed. The new setting requires establishing maximal regularity in
the required critical Besov setting for the overall closed-loop linearized
problem with tangential feedback control applied on the boundary. Finally, the
minimal amount of tangential boundary action is linked to the issue of unique
continuation of over-determined Oseen eigenproblems.

Recalling the results of the striking GW170817 event, we demand that the
velocity of the gravitational waves is equated to unity in natural units,
meaning that $c_T^2=1$. This is a powerful restriction since it leads to a
decrease in the degrees of freedom and subsequently reveals a connection
between the scalar functions of the theory which presumably have different
origins. In this framework, we shall assume that a scalar potential is present
and can be extracted easily from the equations of motion by simply designating
the scalar coupling functions. Obviously, a different approach is feasible but
such choice will prove to be extremely convenient. Afterwards, we impose
certain approximations in order to facilitate our study. Each assumption is
capable of producing different phenomenology so a summary of all the possible
configurations for Hubble's parameter, its derivative and the scalar potential
along with the corresponding assumptions are present at the end of the paper.
We show that compatibility under the constant-roll assumption can be achieved
for a variety of model functions and different approaches, although one must
always be aware of the imposed approximations since the possibility of a model
producing viable results while simultaneously violating even a single
approximation exists. Finally, in the end, a new formalism which leads to a
plethora of convenient coupling functions according to the readers choice is
presented. Utilizing such formalism may lead to new cases for coupling
functions which have not been used yet, but are in fact able of producing
viable phenomenology for the inflationary era.

improve the performance by learning the graph structure at each layer of the
network using a spatial attention applied on a predefined graph Adjacency

manner. In this paper, we analyze the spatial attention used in spatio-temporal
GCN layers and propose a symmetric spatial attention for better reflecting the
symmetric property of the relative positions of the human body joints when
executing actions. We also highlight the connection of spatio-temporal GCN
layers employing additive spatial attention to bilinear layers, and we propose
the spatio-temporal bilinear network (ST-BLN) which does not require the use of
predefined Adjacency matrices and allows for more flexible design of the model.
Experimental results show that the three models lead to effectively the same

heterojunctions, but for van der Waals (vdW) vertical heterostructures they
have shown only very limited success. Using the group-IV monochalcogenide
vertical heterostructures as a prototypical system, we propose a linear
response model and compare the effectiveness of these models in predicting
density functional theory (DFT) band alignments, band types and bandgaps. We
show that the DFT band alignment is best predicted by the linear response
model, which falls in between the Anderson and midgap models. Our proposed
model can be characterized by an interface dipole
$\alpha\times(E_{m2}-E_{m1})$, where the linear response coefficient $\alpha$ =
0 and 1 corresponds to the Anderson and midgap model respectively, and $E_{m}$
is the midgap energy of the monolayer, which can be viewed as an effective
electronegativity. For group-IV monochalcogenides, we show that $\alpha$ = 0.34
best captures the DFT band alignment of the vdW heterostructure, and we discuss
the viability of the linear response model considering other effects such as
strains and band hybridization, and conclude with an application of the model
to predict experimental band alignments.

Services (LBS) which have become part of our digitally informed daily lives.
Navigation services, however, have generally been designed for drivers rather
than other users such as pedestrians or wheelchair users. For these users the
directed networks of streets and roads do not limit their movements, but their
movements may have other limitations, including lower speed of movement, and
being more dependent on weather and the pavement surface conditions. This paper
proposes and implements a novel path finding algorithm for open areas, i.e.
areas with no network of pathways such as grasslands and parks where the
conventional graph-based algorithms fail to calculate a practically traversable
path. The new method provides multimodality, a higher level of performance,
efficiency, and user satisfaction in comparison with currently available
solutions. The proposed algorithm creates a new graph in the open area, which
can consider the obstacles and barriers and calculate the path based on the
factors that are important for wheelchair users. Factors, including slope,
width, and surface condition of the routes, are recognised by mining the actual
trajectories of wheelchairs users using trajectory mining and machine learning
techniques. Unlike raster-based techniques, a graph-based open area path
finding algorithm allows the routing to be fully compatible with current
transportation routing services, and enables a full multimodal routing service.
The implementations and tests show at least a 76.4% similarity between the
proposed algorithm outputs and actual wheelchair users trajectories.

borus02 model, which enables us to accurately characterize the physical and
geometrical properties of AGN obscuring tori. We also compare our results
obtained from the unbiased Compton thin AGN with those of Compton-thick AGN. We
find that Compton thin and Compton-thick AGN may possess similar tori, whose
average column density is Compton thick (N$\rm _{H,tor,ave}$
$\sim$1.4$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$), but they are observed through different
(under-dense or over-dense) regions of the tori. We also find that the
obscuring torus medium is significantly inhomogeneous, with the torus average
column densities significantly different from their line-of-sight column
densities (for most of the sources in the sample). The average torus covering
factor of sources in our unbiased sample is c$_f$=0.67, suggesting that the

gradient method, called GT-SAGA. GT-SAGA is computationally efficient as it
evaluates one component gradient per node per iteration and achieves provably
fast and robust performance by leveraging node-level variance reduction and
network-level gradient tracking. For general smooth non-convex problems, we
show the almost sure and mean-squared convergence of GT-SAGA to a first-order
stationary point and further describe regimes of practical significance where
it outperforms the existing approaches and achieves a network
topology-independent iteration complexity respectively. When the global
function satisfies the Polyak-Lojaciewisz condition, we show that GT-SAGA
exhibits linear convergence to an optimal solution in expectation and describe
regimes of practical interest where the performance is network
topology-independent and improves upon the existing methods. Numerical
experiments are included to highlight the main convergence aspects of GT-SAGA
in non-convex settings.

idiosyncrasies in the data collection process. For example, sentence entailment
datasets can have spurious word-class correlations if nearly all contradiction
sentences contain the word ""not"", and image recognition datasets can have
tell-tale object-background correlations if dogs are always indoors. In this
paper, we propose a method that can automatically detect and ignore these kinds
of dataset-specific patterns, which we call dataset biases. Our method trains a
lower capacity model in an ensemble with a higher capacity model. During
training, the lower capacity model learns to capture relatively shallow
correlations, which we hypothesize are likely to reflect dataset bias. This
frees the higher capacity model to focus on patterns that should generalize
better. We ensure the models learn non-overlapping approaches by introducing a
novel method to make them conditionally independent. Importantly, our approach
does not require the bias to be known in advance. We evaluate performance on
synthetic datasets, and four datasets built to penalize models that exploit
known biases on textual entailment, visual question answering, and image
recognition tasks. We show improvement in all settings, including a 10 point

two-dimensional carrier gases formed at the surfaces or interfaces of STO-based
heterostructures: a finite transverse resistance observed in Hall bars in zero
external magnetic field. This transverse resistance depends on the local domain
wall configuration and hence changes with temperature, gate voltage, thermal
cycling and position along the sample, and can even change sign as a function
of these parameters. The transverse resistance is observed below $\simeq$ 70 K
but grows and changes significantly below $\simeq$40 K, the temperature at
which the domain walls become increasingly polar. Surprisingly, the transverse
resistance is much larger in (111) oriented heterostructures in comparison to
(001) oriented heterostructures. Measurements of the capacitance between the
conducting interface and an electrode applied to the substrate, which reflect
the dielectric constant of the STO, indicate that this difference may be
related to the greater variation of the temperature dependent dielectric
constant with electric field when the electric field is applied in the [111]
direction. The finite transverse resistance can be explained inhomogeneous
current flow due to the preferential transport of current along domain walls
that are not collinear with the nominal direction of the injected current.

access to a parameter $p \in [0,1]$ means the algorithm does not know $p$, but

equal to $p$. In this paper, we study the problem of Bernoulli factories for
polytopes: given Bernoulli access to a vector $x\in \mathcal{P}$ for a given
polytope $\mathcal{P}\subset [0,1]^n$, output a randomized vertex such that the
expected value of the $i$-th coordinate is \emph{exactly} equal to $x_i$. For
example, for the special case of the perfect matching polytope, one is given
Bernoulli access to the entries of a doubly stochastic matrix $[x_{ij}]$ and
asked to sample a matching such that the probability of each edge $(i,j)$ be
present in the matching is exactly equal to $x_{ij}$.
  We show that a polytope $\mathcal{P}$ admits a Bernoulli factory if and and
only if $\mathcal{P}$ is the intersection of $[0,1]^n$ with an affine subspace.
Our construction is based on an algebraic formulation of the problem, involving
identifying a family of Bernstein polynomials (one per vertex) that satisfy a
certain algebraic identity on $\mathcal{P}$. The main technical tool behind our
construction is a connection between these polynomials and the geometry of
zonotope tilings. We apply these results to construct an explicit factory for
the perfect matching polytope. The resulting factory is deeply connected to the
combinatorial enumeration of arborescences and may be of independent interest.
For the $k$-uniform matroid polytope, we recover a sampling procedure known in

the volume between the electrodes is filled with dielectric/catalytic pellets

In this work, we investigate the discharge formation and propagation at
different length scales as a function of applied voltage in a simplified design
of PBPRs, a patterned dielectric barrier discharge (p-DBD), operated in helium
at atmospheric pressure, using phase and space resolved optical emission
spectroscopy (PROES). The p-DBD is based on an array of plasma facing glass
hemispheres implemented into one of two electrodes and regularly arranged in a
hexagonal pattern. The plasma is initiated as filamentary microdischarges at
the positions of minimum gap followed by radial acceleration of electrons over
the dielectric surface as surface ionization waves to finally form surface
microdischarges at the voids between the pellets, i.e. at the contact points.
With the increase of the voltage amplitude, subsequent pulses of surface
microdischarges are generated at the contact points. The plasma emission of
each of the surface micro-discharges (S-MD) is found to consist of microscopic
structures whose emission intensity increases as a function of the driving
voltage amplitude. Adjacent microdischarges interact to generate a wave-like
emission intensity propagation from the center of the array to the edges.

increasing expenditure for under-funded schools. Gains are driven by mitigation
of the negative externalities generated by excessive spending among wealthier

neuralODE to infer arbitrarily complex continuous-time latent dynamics.
Experiments on motion capture, spring system, and charged particle datasets

distribution of a swarm formation on either side of an obstacle, when evading
the obstacle, to avoid overpopulation on the sides to reduce the agents'

consumption. To handle this, the problem is divided into two main parts: 1) the
disturbance phase: how to morph the formation optimally to avoid the obstacle
in the least possible time in the situation at hand, and 2) the convergence
phase: how to optimally resume the intended formation shape once the threat of

methodology which tests different formation morphing combinations and finds the
optimal one, by utilizing trajectory, velocity, and coordinate information, to
bypass the obstacle. For the second problem, we utilize a thin-plate splines

back from the distorted formation into the desired formation in an optimal
manner, after collision avoidance has been successfully performed. Experimental

approximation algorithms for Diameter are desired.
  There is a folklore algorithm that gives a $2$-approximation for Diameter in
$\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Additionally, a line of work concludes with a
$3/2$-approximation algorithm for Diameter in weighted directed graphs that
runs in $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time. The $3/2$-approximation algorithm is known
to be tight under SETH: Roditty and Vassilevska W. proved that under SETH any
$3/2-\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for Diameter in undirected unweighted
graphs requires $m^{2-o(1)}$ time, and then Backurs, Roditty, Segal,
Vassilevska W., and Wein and the follow-up work of Li proved that under SETH
any $5/3-\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for Diameter in undirected
unweighted graphs requires $m^{3/2-o(1)}$ time.
  Whether or not the folklore 2-approximation algorithm is tight, however, is
unknown, and has been explicitly posed as an open problem in numerous papers.
Towards this question, Bonnet recently proved that under SETH, any
$7/4-\epsilon$ approximation requires $m^{4/3-o(1)}$, only for directed
weighted graphs.
  We completely resolve this question for directed graphs by proving that the
folklore 2-approximation algorithm is conditionally optimal. In doing so, we
obtain a series of conditional lower bounds that together with prior work, give
a complete time-accuracy trade-off that is tight with all known algorithms for
directed graphs. Specifically, we prove that under SETH for any $\delta>0$, a
$(\frac{2k-1}{k}-\delta)$-approximation algorithm for Diameter on directed
unweighted graphs requires $m^{\frac{k}{k-1}-o(1)}$ time.

reliably, and react quickly. Multiagent trajectory prediction is NP-hard
whereas the sample complexity of existing data-driven approaches limits their
applicability. Our key insight is that the geometric structure of the
intersection and the incentive of agents to move efficiently and avoid
collisions (rationality) reduces the space of likely behaviors, effectively
relaxing the problem of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we collapse the
space of multiagent trajectories at an intersection into a set of modes
representing different classes of multiagent behavior, formalized using a
notion of topological invariance. Based on this formalism, we design Multiple
Topologies Prediction (MTP), a data-driven trajectory-prediction mechanism that
reconstructs trajectory representations of high-likelihood modes in multiagent
intersection scenes. We show that MTP outperforms a state-of-the-art multimodal
trajectory prediction baseline (MFP) in terms of prediction accuracy by 78.24%

techniques$\text{---}$that is, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and
the so-called color impedance spectroscopy (CIS). This was done at different
bias potentials, which can be associated with different intercalation levels.
Equivalent circuit fitting to the EIS spectra was used to extract the Faradaic

assigned to an intermediate adsorption step before the intercalation and to the
diffusion of the electron-ion couple in the film. A quantity denoted complex
optical capacitance is compared to the complex electrical
capacitance$\text{---}$in particular, their expressions are related to the
Faradaic processes. The coloration at low intercalation levels followed both
the adsorption and diffusion phenomena. Conversely, the diffusion contribution
was dominant at high intercalation levels and the adsorption one seemed to be
negligible in this case. For perfectly synchronized electrical and optical
responses, their complex spectra are expected to differ only by a multiplying
factor. This was the case at low intercalation levels, apart from small
deviations at high frequencies. A clear departure from this behavior was
observed as the intercalation level increased. A combination of

are expected to exhibit 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relation, thereby
resulting in doubled Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation. We performed
numerical calculations of dynamical properties of topological JJs using a
modified resistively and capacitively shunted junction model and extensively
investigated the progressive evolution of Shapiro steps as a function of the
junction parameters and microwave power and frequency. Our calculation results
indicate that the suppression of odd-integer Shapiro steps, i.e., evidence of
the fractional ac Josephson effect, is enhanced significantly by the increase
in the junction capacitance and IcRn product as well as the decrease in the
microwave frequency even for the same portion of the 4$\pi$-periodic
supercurrent. Our study provides the optimal conditions for observing the
fractional ac Josephson effect; furthermore, our new model can be used to
precisely quantify the topological supercurrent from the experimental data of
topological JJs.

relations between neurons according to their activity and interactions. When
these relations are causal, the functional connectome maps how neural activity
flows within neural circuits and provides the possibility for inference of
functional neural pathways, such as sensory-motor-behavioral pathways. While
there exist various information approaches for non-causal estimations of the
functional connectome, approaches that characterize the causal functional
connectivity - the causal relationships between neuronal time series, are
scarce. In this work, we develop the Neuro-PC algorithm which is a novel
methodology for inferring the causal functional connectivity between neurons
from multi-dimensional time series, such as neuronal recordings. The core of
our methodology relies on a novel adaptation of the PC algorithm, a
state-of-the-art method for statistical causal inference, to the
multi-dimensional time-series of neural dynamics. We validate the performance
of the method on network motifs with various interactions between their neurons
simulated using continuous-time artificial network of neurons. We then consider
the application of the method to obtain the causal functional connectome for
recent multi-array electrophysiological recordings from the mouse visual cortex
in the presence of different stimuli. We show how features of the mapping can
be used for quantification of the similarities between neural responses subject

originates in the singularity of the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium distribution
and it is characterized by the macroscopic population of the fundamental mode
of the system. Several recent experiments revealed a phenomenon of spatial beam
cleaning of an optical field that propagates through a graded-index multimode
optical fiber (MMF). Our aim in this article is to provide physical insight
into the mechanism underlying optical beam self-cleaning through the analysis
of wave condensation in the presence of structural disorder inherent to MMFs.
We consider experiments of beam cleaning where long pulses are injected in the
and populate many modes of a 10-20 m MMF, for which the dominant contribution
of disorder originates from polarization random fluctuations (weak disorder).
On the basis of the wave turbulence theory, we derive nonequilibrium kinetic
equations describing the random waves in a regime where disorder dominates
nonlinear effects. The theory reveals that the presence of a conservative weak
disorder introduces an effective dissipation in the system, which is shown to
inhibit wave condensation in the usual continuous wave turbulence approach. On
the other hand, the experiments of beam cleaning are described by a discrete
wave turbulence approach, where the effective dissipation induced by disorder
modifies the regularization of wave resonances, which leads to an acceleration
of condensation that can explain the effect of beam self-cleaning. The
simulations are in quantitative agreement with the theory. The analysis also
reveals that the effect of beam cleaning is characterized by a repolarization
as a natural consequence of the condensation process. In addition, the discrete
wave turbulence approach explains why optical beam self-cleaning has not been
observed in step-index multimode fibers.

attention. However, there are three main difficulties in incorporating the gaze
data in an attention mechanism of deep neural networks: 1) the gaze fixation
points are likely to have measurement errors due to blinking and rapid eye
movements; 2) it is unclear when and how much the gaze data is correlated with
visual attention; and 3) gaze data is not always available in many real-world
situations. In this work, we introduce an effective probabilistic approach to
integrate human gaze into spatiotemporal attention for egocentric activity
recognition. Specifically, we represent the locations of gaze fixation points
as structured discrete latent variables to model their uncertainties. In
addition, we model the distribution of gaze fixations using a variational
method. The gaze distribution is learned during the training process so that
the ground-truth annotations of gaze locations are no longer needed in testing
situations since they are predicted from the learned gaze distribution. The
predicted gaze locations are used to provide informative attentional cues to
improve the recognition performance. Our method outperforms all the previous
state-of-the-art approaches on EGTEA, which is a large-scale dataset for
egocentric activity recognition provided with gaze measurements. We also
perform an ablation study and qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our

exploring novel quantum phenomena, which can be realized through the proximity
coupling in forming moir\'e pattern with another layer. This approach, however,
is invasive, material-specific, and requires small lattice mismatch and
suitable band alignment, largely limited to graphene and transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) of anti-parallel (AA')
stacking order has been an indispensable building block, as dielectric
substrates and capping layers for realizing high quality van der Waals devices.
There is also emerging interest on parallelly aligned h-BN of Bernal (AB)
stacking, where the broken inversion and mirror symmetries lead to out-of-plane
electrical polarization with sign controlled by interlayer translation. Here we
show that the laterally patterned electrical polarization at a nearly parallel
interface within the h-BN substrate or capping layer can be exploited to create
non-invasively a universal superlattice potential in general 2D materials. The
feasibility is demonstrated by first principle calculations for monolayer
MoSe2, black phosphorus, and antiferromagnetic MnPSe3 on such h-BN substrate.
The potential strength can reach 200 meV, customizable in this range through
choice of vertical distance of target material from the interface in h-BN. We
also find sizable out-of-plane electric field at the h-BN surface, which can
realize superlattice potential for interlayer excitons in TMD bilayers as well
as dipolar molecules. The idea is further generalized to AB stacked h-BN film
subject to torsion with adjacent layers all twisted with an angle, which allows
the potential and field strength to be scaled up with film thickness,
saturating to a quasi-periodic one with chiral structure.

paper introduces a complexity reduction scheme that exploits the constellations
symmetry to reduce the number of possible calculations and the number of

a new transmission technique that jointly optimizes the transmit symbol-level
precoding and the constellation rotation of the data stream for each user. The
purpose is to increase the probability of having constructive interference, and
thus better performance. We focus on improving the energy efficiency by
reducing the required power to satisfy certain quality of service constraints
through solving a symbol-level precoding problem and finding the optimal phase
by which each user constellation should be rotated. This problem is non-convex,
therefore, we propose an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm combined with
semidefinite relaxation to solve the problem and find an efficient solution.
Numerical results are presented in a comparative fashion to show the
effectiveness of the proposed technique, which outperforms the state-of-the-art
symbol-level precoding schemes in terms of energy efficiency, and power

public health interventions to be more effective. Moreover, the use of
spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context,
facilitates estimating newly demanded epidemiological indicators, such as the
instantaneous reproduction number (R_t), even for small areas. This, in turn,
allows to adapt traditional disease mapping models to these new circumstancies

found that supraglacial debris is characterised by more stable colder and
wetter conditions than the surrounding debris slopes and by a shorter snow-free
period. The populations found on supraglacial debris were spring breeders,
differently from those documented in the 1980s on Dolomitic high alpine

exact effective action when introducing the Wilson line. The Wilson line in the
pure AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity is equivalent to entanglement entropy in the
boundary theory up to classical gravity. The U(1) Chern-Simons theory deviates
by a self-interaction term from the gauge formulation on the boundary. We also
compare the Hayward term in the SL(2) Chern-Simons formulation to the Wilson

for a single interval at the classical level. We propose quantum generalization
by combining the bulk and Hayward terms. The quantum correction of the
partition function vanishes. In the end, we calculate the entanglement entropy
for a single interval. The pure AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity theory shows a shift
of central charge by 26 at the one-loop level. The U(1) Chern-Simons theory

from input degraded acoustic features. To achieve this, the DNR-ASP first
predicts the noisy and reverberant LAS, noise LAS related to the noise
information, and room impulse response related to the reverberation information
then performs initial denoising and dereverberation. The initial processed LAS
are then enhanced by another neural network as the final clean LAS. To further
improve the quality of the generated clean LAS, we also introduce a bandwidth
extension model and frequency resolution extension model in the DNR-ASP. The
experimental results indicate that the DNR-HiNet vocoder was able to generate a
denoised and dereverberated waveform given noisy and reverberant acoustic
features and outperformed the original HiNet vocoder and a few other neural
vocoders. We also applied the DNR-HiNet vocoder to speech enhancement tasks,

side into a system of ODEs with at most quadratic right-hand side via the
introduction of new variables. It has been recently used as a pre-processing
step for new model order reduction methods, so it is important to keep the
number of new variables small. Several algorithms have been designed to search
for a quadratization with the new variables being monomials in the original
variables. To understand the limitations and potential ways of improving such
algorithms, we study the following question: can quadratizations with not
necessarily monomial new variables produce a model of substantially smaller
dimension than quadratization with only monomial new variables?
  To do this, we restrict our attention to scalar polynomial ODEs. Our first
result is that a scalar polynomial ODE
$\dot{x}=p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots + a_0$ with $n\geqslant 5$ and
$a_n\neq0$ can be quadratized using exactly one new variable if and only if
$p(x-\frac{a_{n-1}}{n\cdot a_n})=a_nx^n+ax^2+bx$ for some $a, b \in
\mathbb{C}$. In fact, the new variable can be taken
$z:=(x-\frac{a_{n-1}}{n\cdot a_n})^{n-1}$. Our second result is that two
non-monomial new variables are enough to quadratize all degree $6$ scalar
polynomial ODEs. Based on these results, we observe that a quadratization with
not necessarily monomial new variables can be much smaller than a monomial
quadratization even for scalar ODEs.

produced by propagation effects in the magnetosphere of fast spinning

light cylinder, suggesting that wave mode coupling effects are unlikely to
produce strong circular polarisation for fast spinning magnetars. Cyclotron
absorption could be significant if the secondary plasma density is high.
However, high degrees of circular polarisation can only be produced with large
asymmetries in electrons and positrons. We draw attention to the non-detection
of circular polarisation in current observations of known repeating FRBs. We
suggest that the circular polarisation of FRBs could provide key information on
their origins and help distinguish different radiation mechanisms.

unmeasurable latent input. The unmeasurable latent input refers to intrinsic
system signal and extrinsic environment interference. Considering the

context-free languages (CFLs) has been found to be quite weak. Given that CFLs
are believed to capture important phenomena such as hierarchical structure in
natural languages, this discrepancy in performance calls for an explanation. We
study the performance of recurrent models on Dyck-n languages, a particularly
important and well-studied class of CFLs. We find that while recurrent models
generalize nearly perfectly if the lengths of the training and test strings are
from the same range, they perform poorly if the test strings are longer. At the
same time, we observe that recurrent models are expressive enough to recognize
Dyck words of arbitrary lengths in finite precision if their depths are
bounded. Hence, we evaluate our models on samples generated from Dyck languages
with bounded depth and find that they are indeed able to generalize to much
higher lengths. Since natural language datasets have nested dependencies of
bounded depth, this may help explain why they perform well in modeling
hierarchical dependencies in natural language data despite prior works
indicating poor generalization performance on Dyck languages. We perform
probing studies to support our results and provide comparisons with
Transformers.

the relaxation time of the polymer, surpasses a critical value. The effect of
internal friction on the transition is studied by means of Brownian dynamics
simulations of the elastic dumbbell model in a homogeneous and isotropic,
incompressible, turbulent flow and analytical calculations for a stochastic
velocity gradient. The results are explained by adapting the large deviations
theory of Balkovsky et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 2000, 84, 4765] to an elastic
dumbbell with internal viscosity. In turbulent flows, a distinctive feature of
the probability distribution of polymer extensions is its power-law behaviour
for extensions greater than the equilibrium length and smaller than the contour
length. It is shown that although internal friction does not modify the
critical Weissenberg number for the coil-stretch transition, it makes the slope
of the probability distribution steeper, thus rendering the transition sharper.
Internal friction therefore provides a possible explanation for the steepness

typically do not generalize well when deployed in heterogeneous scenarios where
the base stations (BSs) are equipped with different numbers of transmit

Specifically, we consider the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem in

of the optimal beamforming solution, our constructed neural network can be made

  Long-term Forecasting","19 pages, 34 figures",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Long-term forecasting involves predicting a horizon that is far ahead of the
last observation. It is a problem of high practical relevance, for instance for
companies in order to decide upon expensive long-term investments. Despite the
recent progress and success of Gaussian processes (GPs) based on spectral
mixture kernels, long-term forecasting remains a challenging problem for these
kernels because they decay exponentially at large horizons. This is mainly due
to their use of a mixture of Gaussians to model spectral densities.
Characteristics of the signal important for long-term forecasting can be
unravelled by investigating the distribution of the Fourier coefficients of
(the training part of) the signal, which is non-smooth, heavy-tailed, sparse,
and skewed. The heavy tail and skewness characteristics of such distributions
in the spectral domain allow to capture long-range covariance of the signal in
the time domain. Motivated by these observations, we propose to model spectral
densities using a skewed Laplace spectral mixture (SLSM) due to the skewness of
its peaks, sparsity, non-smoothness, and heavy tail characteristics. By
applying the inverse Fourier Transform to this spectral density we obtain a new
GP kernel for long-term forecasting. In addition, we adapt the lottery ticket
method, originally developed to prune weights of a neural network, to GPs in
order to automatically select the number of kernel components. Results of
extensive experiments, including a multivariate time series, show the
beneficial effect of the proposed SLSM kernel for long-term extrapolation and
robustness to the choice of the number of mixture components.

quantum computing, but gate performance in quantum processor with transmons is
often insufficient to support running complex algorithms for practical
applications. It is thus highly desirable to further improve gate performance.
Due to the weak anharmonicity of transmon, a static ZZ interaction between
coupled transmons commonly exists, undermining the gate performance, and in
long term, it can become performance limiting. Here we theoretically explore a
previously unexplored parameter region in an all-transmon system to address
this issue. We show that an feasible parameter region, where the ZZ interaction
is heavily suppressed while leaving XY interaction with an adequate strength to
implement two-qubit gates, can be found for all-transmon systems. Thus,
two-qubit gates, such as cross-resonance gate or iSWAP gate, can be realized
without the detrimental effect from static ZZ interaction. To illustrate this,
we demonstrate that an iSWAP gate with fast gate speed and dramatically lower
conditional phase error can be achieved. Scaling up to large-scale transmon
quantum processor, especially the cases with fixed coupling, addressing error,
idling error, and crosstalk that arises from static ZZ interaction could also
be strongly suppressed.

control the size of the arctic and antarctic circles. These Milankovitch cycles
have generally been calculated by numerical integration of Newtons equations of
motion, and there is some controversy over the results because they are
sensitive to numerical drift over the very long computer simulations involved.
In this paper the cycles are calculated from first principles, without any
reliance on computer simulation. The problem is one of planetary precession,
and is solvable by the methods used to study the precession of a spinning top.
It is shown that the main component of Milankovitch cycles has a period of
41,000 years and is due to one of the modes of precession of the Earth-Venus
system. The other mode of this system produces a component of period 29,500
years, and a third component of period 54,000 years results from the influence
of the precession of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.
  These results agree closely with several of the numerical simulations in the
literature, and strongly suggest that other different results in the literature
are incorrect.

version which allows us for the first time to compute precise turbulence
characteristic parameters from a single observational map without the need for
averages in a grand ensemble of statistical observables. We focus on studying
the 250 mu-m Herschel map of the Musca filament and make use of MHD
simulations. We find a clear signature of a multiplicative cascade in Musca
with an inertial range from 0.05 to 0.65 pc. We show that the proposed
microcanonical approach provides singularity spectra which are truly scale
invariant as required to validate any method to analyze multifractality. The
obtained, for the first time precise enough, singularity spectrum of Musca is
clearly not as symmetric as usually observed in log-normal behavior. We claim
that the ISM towards Musca features more a log-Poisson shape of its singularity
spectrum. Since log-Poisson behavior is claimed to exist when dissipation is
stronger for rare events in turbulent flows in contrast to more homogeneous (in
volume and time) dissipation events, we suggest that this deviation from
log-normality could trace enhanced dissipation in rare events at small scales,
which may explain or is at least consistent with the dominant filamentary
structure in Musca. Moreover we find that sub-regions in Musca tends to show
different multifractal properties. It strongly suggests that different types of
dynamics exist inside the Musca cloud. These differences between sub-regions
appear only after eliminating noise features which have the tendency to
""log-normalize"" an observational map. Our study sets up fundamental tools which
will be applied to other galactic clouds and simulations in forthcoming

propose a tightly-coupled Visual-Inertial-Dynamics (VID) system that
simultaneously estimates the external force applied to the quadrotor along with
the 6 DoF pose. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art optimization-based
Visual-Inertial system, with a novel deduction of the dynamics and external
force factor extended from VIMO. Utilizing the proposed dynamics and external
force factor, our estimator robustly and accurately estimates the external
force even when it varies widely. Moreover, since we explicitly consider the
influence of the external force, when compared with VIMO and VINS-Mono, our
method shows comparable and superior pose accuracy, even when the external

of the proposed method are validated by extensive real-world experiments and

governments to conduct manual contact-tracing, there has been much interest in
using the power of mobile phones to automate the contact-tracing process
through the development of exposure notification applications. The rough idea
is simple: use Bluetooth or other data-exchange technologies to record contacts
between users, enable users to report positive diagnoses, and alert users who
have been exposed to sick users. Of course, there are many privacy concerns
associated with this idea. Much of the work in this area has been concerned
with designing mechanisms for tracing contacts and alerting users that do not
leak additional information about users beyond the existence of exposure
events. However, although designing practical protocols is of crucial
importance, it is essential to realize that notifying users about exposure
events may itself leak confidential information (e.g. that a particular contact
has been diagnosed). Luckily, while digital contact tracing is a relatively new
task, the generic problem of privacy and data disclosure has been studied for
decades. Indeed, the framework of differential privacy further permits provable
query privacy by adding random noise. In this article, we translate two results
from statistical privacy and social recommendation algorithms to exposure
notification. We thus prove some naive bounds on the degree to which accuracy
must be sacrificed if exposure notification frameworks are to be made more
private through the injection of noise.

such a quantity, one needs first to estimate the price elasticity from the
product demand. Regression methods usually fail to recover such elasticities
due to confounding effects and price endogeneity. Therefore, randomized
experiments are typically required. However, elasticities can be highly
heterogeneous depending on the location of stores, for example. As the
randomization frequently occurs at the municipal level, standard
difference-in-differences methods may also fail. Possible solutions are based
on methodologies to measure the effects of treatments on a single (or just a
few) treated unit(s) based on counterfactuals constructed from artificial
controls. For example, for each city in the treatment group, a counterfactual
may be constructed from the untreated locations. In this paper, we apply a
novel high-dimensional statistical method to measure the effects of price

public awareness rising, testing and tracing, information on local incidence,
and high temperature. Immunity after infection, school and restaurant closures,
stay-at-home orders, and mandatory face covering were associated with a smaller
reduction in transmission. The data suggests that public distancing rules
increased transmission in young adults. Information on local incidence was

access to a shared channel. In modern networks, BEB plays an important role in
WiFi (IEEE 802.11) and other wireless communication standards.
  Despite this track record, well-known theoretical results indicate that under
bursty traffic BEB yields poor makespan, and superior algorithms are possible.
To date, the degree to which these findings impact performance in wireless
networks has not been examined.
  To address this issue, we investigate one of the strongest cases against BEB:
a single burst batch of packets that simultaneously contend for access to a
wireless channel. Using Network Simulator 3, we incorporate into IEEE 802.11g
several newer algorithms that, while inspired by BEB, possess makespan
guarantees that are theoretically superior. Surprisingly, we discover that
these newer algorithms underperform BEB.
  Investigating further, we identify as the culprit a common abstraction
regarding the cost of collisions. Our experimental results are complemented by
analytical arguments that the number of collisions - and not solely makespan -

being performed by individual robots in a multirobot system. In our previous
work, we derived necessary conditions based on persistency of excitation
analysis for the exact identification of these parameters. We concluded that
depending on the robot's task, the dynamics of individual robots may fail to
satisfy these conditions, thereby preventing exact inference. As an extension
to that work, this paper focuses on estimating bounds on task parameters when
such conditions are not satisfied. Each robot in the team uses
optimization-based controllers for mediating between task satisfaction and
collision avoidance. We use KKT conditions of this optimization and SVD of
active collision avoidance constraints to derive explicit relations between
Lagrange multipliers, robot dynamics, and task parameters. Using these
relations, we are able to derive bounds on each robot's task parameters.
Through numerical simulations, we show how our proposed region based
identification approach generates feasible regions for parameters when a
conventional estimator such as a UKF fails. Additionally, empirical evidence
shows that this approach generates contracting sets which converge to the true
parameters much faster than the rate at which a UKF based estimate converges.

spectral break that divides the so called inertial and kinetic ranges. Large
scale magnetic fluctuations are dominated by non-linear MHD wave-wave
interactions following a -5/3 or -2 slope power-law spectrum. After the break,
at scales in which kinetic effects take place, the magnetic spectrum follows a
steeper power-law $k^{-\alpha}$ shape given by a spectral index $\alpha > 5/3$.
Despite its ubiquitousness, the possible effects of a turbulent background
spectrum in the quasilinear relaxation of solar wind temperatures are usually
not considered. In this work, a quasilinear kinetic theory is used to study the
evolution of the proton temperatures in an initially turbulent collisionless
plasma composed by cold electrons and bi-Maxwellian protons, in which
electromagnetic waves propagate along a background magnetic field. Four wave
spectrum shapes are compared with different levels of wave intensity. We show
that a sufficient turbulent magnetic power can drive stable protons to
transverse heating, resulting in an increase in the temperature anisotropy and
the reduction of the parallel proton beta. Thus, stable proton velocity
distribution can evolve in such a way as to develop kinetic instabilities. This
may explain why the constituents of the solar wind can be observed far from
thermodynamic equilibrium and near the instability thresholds.
