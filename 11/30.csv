teaching Software Engineering (SE) courses. However, there are several
limitations of existing studies that limit the wide adaptation of open-source
projects in a classroom setting, including (1) the selected project is limited
to one particular project, (2) most studies only investigated on its effect on
teaching a specific SE concept, and (3) students may make mistakes in their
contribution which leads to poor quality code. Meanwhile, software companies
have successfully launched programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and
FindBugs ""fixit"" to contribute to open-source projects. Inspired by the success
of these programs, we propose GitHub-OSS Fixit, a course project where students
are taught to contribute to open-source Java projects by fixing bugs reported
in GitHub. We described our course outline to teach students SE concepts by
encouraging the usages of several automated program analysis tools. We also
included the carefully designed instructions that we gave to students for
participating in GitHub-OSS Fixit. As all lectures and labs are conducted
online, we think that our course design could help in guiding future online SE
courses. Overall, our survey results show that students think that GitHub-OSS
Fixit could help them to improve many skills and apply the knowledge taught in
class. In total, 154 students have submitted 214 pull requests to 24 different
Java projects, in which 59 of them have been merged, and 82 have been closed by
developers.

  Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods","Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2020",,,,"cs.MA cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study the global convergence of model-based and model-free
policy gradient descent and natural policy gradient descent algorithms for
linear quadratic deep structured teams. In such systems, agents are partitioned
into a few sub-populations wherein the agents in each sub-population are
coupled in the dynamics and cost function through a set of linear regressions
of the states and actions of all agents. Every agent observes its local state
and the linear regressions of states, called deep states. For a sufficiently
small risk factor and/or sufficiently large population, we prove that
model-based policy gradient methods globally converge to the optimal solution.
Given an arbitrary number of agents, we develop model-free policy gradient and
natural policy gradient algorithms for the special case of risk-neutral cost
function. The proposed algorithms are scalable with respect to the number of
agents due to the fact that the dimension of their policy space is independent
of the number of agents in each sub-population. Simulations are provided to
verify the theoretical results.

receiving nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases around a string develop vacuum
expectation values (VEVs). We illustrate this in an $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge
theory with charged triplet complex scalar fields admitting Alice strings and
monopoles, by introducing charged doublet scalar fields receiving nontrivial AB
phases around the Alice string. The Alice string carries a half $U(1)$ magnetic
flux and $1/4$ $SU(2)$ magnetic flux taking a value in two of the $SU(2)$
generators characterizing the $U(1)$ modulus. This string is not confined in
the absence of a doublet VEV in the sense that the $SU(2)$ magnetic flux can be
detected at large distance by an AB phase around the string. When the doublet
field develops VEVs, there appear two kinds of phases that we call deconfined
and confined phases. When a single Alice string is present in the deconfined
phase, the $U(1)$ modulus of the string and the vacuum moduli are locked (the
bulk-soliton moduli locking). In the confined phase, the Alice string is
inevitably attached by a domain wall that we call an AB defect and is confined
with an anti-Alice string or another Alice string with the same $SU(2)$ flux.
Depending on the partner, the pair annihilates or forms a stable doubly-wound
Alice string having an $SU(2)$ magnetic flux inside the core, whose color
cannot be detected at large distance by AB phases, implying the ""color""
confinement. The theory also admits stable Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string and
a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ string in the absence of the doublet VEVs, and each decays
into two Alice strings in the presence of the doublet VEVs. A monopole in this
theory can be constructed as a closed Alice string with the $U(1)$ modulus
twisted once, and we show that with the doublet VEVs, monopoles are also
confined to monopole mesons of the monopole charge two.

provide the most intriguing opportunity for more accessible, safe, and
efficient transportation. CAVs are expected to significantly improve safety by
eliminating the human factor and ensure transportation efficiency by allowing
users to monitor transportation network conditions and make better operating
decisions. However, CAVs could alter the users' tendency-to-travel, leading to
a higher traffic demand than expected, thus causing rebound effects (e.g.,
increased vehicle-miles-traveled). In this chapter, we focus on tackling social
factors that could drive an emerging mobility system to unsustainable
congestion levels. We propose a mobility market that models the economic
in-nature interactions of the travelers in a smart city network with roads and
public transit infrastructure. Using techniques from mechanism design, we
introduce appropriate monetary incentives (e.g., tolls, fares, fees) and show
how a mobility system consisting of selfish travelers that seek to travel
either with a CAV or use public transit can be socially efficient. Furthermore,
the proposed mobility market ensures that travelers always report their true
travel preferences and always benefit from participating in the market; lastly,
we also show that the market generates enough revenue to potentially cover its
operating costs.

observed the total PM2.5 concentrations to rise to 16 times the pre-firework
levels, while each of the elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of
ambient PM2.5 increased by a factor of 46.1, 3.7, and 5.6, respectively. The
concentration of species like K, Al, Sr, Ba, S, and Bi displayed distinct peaks
during the firework event and were identified as tracers. The average
concentrations of potential carcinogens, like As, exceeded US EPA screening
levels for industrial air by a factor of ~9.6, while peak levels reached up to
16.1 times the screening levels. The source apportionment study, undertaken
using positive matrix factorization, revealed the fireworks to account for 95%
of the total elemental PM2.5 during Diwali. The resolved primary organic
emissions, too, were enhanced by a factor of 8 during Diwali. Delhi has
encountered serious haze events following Diwali in recent years; this study
highlights that biomass burning emissions rather than the fireworks drive the
poor air quality in the days following Diwali.

used for solving differential equations. Theoretical results have been obtained
during the last six decades regarding the accuracy, stability, and convergence

  The local truncation error is defined by applying the difference operator to
the exact solution $u$. In the classical FD method, the orders of the global
error and the truncation error are the same.
  Block Finite Difference methods (BFD) are finite difference methods in which
the domain is divided into blocks, or cells, containing two or more grid points
with a different scheme used for each grid point, unlike the standard FD
method. In this approach, the interaction between the different truncation
errors and the dynamics of the scheme may prevent the error from growing, hence
error reduction is obtained. The phenomenon in which the order of the global
error is smaller than the one of the truncation error is called {\em error
inhibition}
  It is worth noting that the structure of the BFD method is similar to the
structure of the DG method as far as the linear algebraic system to be solved
is concerned. In this method as well, the phenomenon of error inhibition may be
observed.
  We first show that our BFD scheme can be viewed as a DG scheme, proving
stability during the process. Then, performing a Fourier like analysis, we
prove optimal convergence of the BFD scheme.

local graph aggregation on the backbone feature map, to learn associations of
local information and hence improve feature learning as well as reduce the

aggregation network considers spatial regions of the feature map as nodes and
builds a local neighborhood graph that performs local feature aggregation
before the global average pooling layer. We further utilize a batch
normalization layer to improve the system effectiveness. Additionally, we
introduce a class balanced loss to compensate for the imbalance in the sample

pandemic, it is important to know the disease prevalence in a population. There
are two intertwined difficulties in estimating this prevalence based on testing
results from a group of subjects. First, the test is prone to measurement error
with unknown sensitivity and specificity. Second, the prevalence tends to be
low at the initial stage of the pandemic and we may not be able to determine if
a positive test result is a false positive due to the imperfect specificity of
the test. The statistical inference based on large sample approximation or
conventional bootstrap may not be sufficiently reliable and yield confidence
intervals that do not cover the true prevalence at the nominal level. In this
paper, we have proposed a set of 95% confidence intervals, whose validity is
guaranteed and doesn't depend on the sample size in the unweighted setting. For
the weighted setting, the proposed inference is equivalent to a class of hybrid
bootstrap methods, whose performance is also more robust to the sample size
than those based on asymptotic approximations. The methods are used to
reanalyze data from a study investigating the antibody prevalence in Santa
Clara county, California, which was the motivating example of this research, in
addition to several other seroprevalence studies where authors had tried to
correct their estimates for test performance. Extensive simulation studies have
been conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed

on Wasserstein distance, and it leads to two main contributions which improve
on the existing literature of PCRs. The first contribution exploits the dynamic
formulation of Wasserstein distance, for short referred to as Wasserstein
dynamics, in order to establish PCRs under dominated Bayesian statistical
models. As a novelty with respect to existing approaches to PCRs, Wasserstein
dynamics allows us to circumvent the use of sieves in both stating and proving
PCRs, and it sets forth a natural connection between PCRs and three well-known
classical problems in statistics and probability theory: the speed of mean
Glivenko-Cantelli convergence, the estimation of weighted Poincar\'e-Wirtinger
constants and Sanov large deviation principle for Wasserstein distance. The
second contribution combines the use of Wasserstein distance with a suitable
sieve construction to establish PCRs under full Bayesian nonparametric models.
As a novelty with respect to existing literature of PCRs, our second result
provides with the first treatment of PCRs under non-dominated Bayesian models.
Applications of our results are presented for some classical Bayesian
statistical models, e.g., regular parametric models, infinite-dimensional
exponential families, linear regression in infinite dimension and nonparametric

two salient features of experience replay and target network that enhance the
efficiency, convergence, and stability of DRL training. More importantly, this
paper makes three methodological contributions: 1) presenting a comprehensive
and novel characterization of crowdshipping system states that encompasses
spatial-temporal and capacity information of crowdsourcees and requests; 2)
embedding heuristics that leverage the information offered by the state
representation and are based on intuitive reasoning to guide specific actions
to take, to preserve tractability and enhance efficiency of training; and 3)
integrating rule-interposing to prevent repeated visiting of the same routes
and node sequences during routing improvement, thereby further enhancing the
training efficiency by accelerating learning. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is demonstrated through extensive numerical analysis. The results show
the benefits brought by the heuristics-guided action choice and
rule-interposing in DRL training, and the superiority of the proposed approach

Besides the potential to improve the efficiency of crowdshipping operation

equivalent to two free massless scalar fields, one with Dirichlet and one with

When turning on a chemical potential for suitably adapted spin angular

an Eisenstein series. It coincides with that for photons. At high temperature,
the result provides in closed form all subleading finite-size corrections to

shock fronts generated during cluster mergers. The massive merging galaxy
cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 hosts one of the more complex relics known to date.
We present upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope band 3 (300-500 MHz) and
band 4 (550-850 MHz) observations. These new observations, combined with
published VLA and the new LOFAR HBA data, allow us to carry out a detailed,
high spatial resolution spectral analysis of the relic over a broad range of
frequencies. The integrated spectrum of the relic closely follows a power-law
between 144 MHz and 5.5 GHz with a mean spectral slope $\alpha=-1.16\pm0.03$.
Despite its complex morphology, the subregions of the relic and the other
isolated filaments also follow power-law behaviors, and show similar spectral
slopes. Assuming Diffusive Shock Acceleration, we estimate a dominant Mach
number of $\sim 3.7$ for the shocks that make up the relic. Comparison with
recent numerical simulations suggests that in the case of radio relics, the
slopes of the integrated radio spectra are determined by the Mach number of the
accelerating shock, with $\alpha$ nearly constant, namely between $-1.13$ and
$-1.17$, for Mach numbers $3.5 - 4.0$. The spectral shapes inferred from
spatially resolved regions show curvature, we speculate that the relic is
inclined along the line-of-sight. The locus of points in the simulated
color-color plots changes significantly with the relic viewing angle. We
conclude that projection effects and inhomogeneities in the shock Mach number
dominate the observed spectral properties of the relic in this complex system.
Based on the new observations we raise the possibility that the relic and a
narrow-angle-tailed radio galaxy are two different structures projected along
the same line-of-sight.

of paramount importance for mobile app developers. Across the mobile Internet

thousands of performance metrics in order to understand how app performance
causally impacts user retention and to guard against service or app regressions
that degrade user experiences. To capture certain characteristics particular to
performance metrics, such as enormous observation volume and high skewness in
distribution, an industry-standard practice is to construct a performance
metric as a quantile over all performance events in control or treatment
buckets in A/B tests. In our experience with thousands of A/B tests provided by
Snap, we have discovered some pitfalls in this industry-standard way of
calculating performance metrics that can lead to unexplained movements in
performance metrics and unexpected misalignment with user engagement metrics.
In this paper, we discuss two major pitfalls in this industry-standard practice
of measuring performance for mobile apps. One arises from strong heterogeneity
in both mobile devices and user engagement, and the other arises from
self-selection bias caused by post-treatment user engagement changes. To remedy
these two pitfalls, we introduce several scalable methods including user-level
performance metric calculation and imputation and matching for missing metric
values. We have extensively evaluated these methods on both simulation data and
real A/B tests, and have deployed them into Snap's in-house experimentation
platform.

  Vienna. It is also permanently available at:
  https://othes.univie.ac.at/49160/",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new proof for the embedded resolution of surface singularities in a
three-dimensional smooth ambient space over algebraically closed fields of
arbitrary characteristic. The proof makes use of an upper semicontinuous
resolution invariant which prescribes the center in each step of the resolution
algorithm. The resolution invariant strictly decreases under each blowup. The
definition of the resolution invariant is inspired by the proofs of resolution
of singularities in arbitrary dimension over fields of characteristic zero. It
was developed in an attempt to generalize these proofs to the setting of
arbitrary characteristic. The usual resolution invariant which is used in
characteristic zero behaves very badly over fields of positive characteristic.
It is not upper semicontinuous. Further, the invariant may increase under
blowup which destroys the induction argument. It is shown how these problems
can be overcome in the case of surface singularities which are embedded in a
three-dimensional smooth ambient space. Analogous to the proofs of resolution
of singularities in characteristic zero, coefficient ideals are used to enable
induction on the dimension of the ambient space. Since hypersurfaces of maximal
contact need not exist over fields of positive characteristic, coefficient
ideals are considered instead with respect to all regular hypersurfaces. The
associated invariants are then maximized over all local flags of smooth
subspaces. To construct flags which realize this maximum, techniques are
introduced to maximize invariants of coefficient ideals over all coordinate
changes. These so-called ""cleaning techniques"" form a core part of the proof.
They can be seen as a characteristic-free generalization of the Tschirnhausen
transformation, a classical technique to construct hypersurfaces of maximal
contact.

Fully-supervised methods on real data are impossible due to the large amount of
data needed. Hence, the current state of the art deep learning models are
trained on fully or partially synthetic images. However, document shadow or
shading removal results still suffer because: (a) prior methods rely on
uniformity of local color statistics, which limit their application on
real-scenarios with complex document shapes and textures and; (b) synthetic or
hybrid datasets with non-realistic, simulated lighting conditions are used to
train the models. In this paper we tackle these problems with our two main
contributions. First, a physically constrained learning-based method that
directly estimates document reflectance based on intrinsic image formation
which generalizes to challenging illumination conditions. Second, a new dataset
that clearly improves previous synthetic ones, by adding a large range of
realistic shading and diverse multi-illuminant conditions, uniquely customized
to deal with documents in-the-wild. The proposed architecture works in a
self-supervised manner where only the synthetic texture is used as a weak
training signal (obviating the need for very costly ground truth with
disentangled versions of shading and reflectance). The proposed approach leads
to a significant generalization of document reflectance estimation in real
scenes with challenging illumination. We extensively evaluate on the real
benchmark datasets available for intrinsic image decomposition and document
shadow removal tasks. Our reflectance estimation scheme, when used as a
pre-processing step of an OCR pipeline, shows a 26% improvement of character
error rate (CER), thus, proving the practical applicability.

many generic corruptions.
  Instead, we focus especially on the details of egomotion induced blur. We
explore five classes of remedies, where each targets different potential causes
for the performance gap between sharp and blurred images. For example, first
deblurring an image changes its human interpretability, but at present, only
partly improves object detection. The other four classes of remedies address
multi-scale texture, out-of-distribution testing, label generation, and
conditioning by blur-type. Surprisingly, we discover that custom label
generation aimed at resolving spatial ambiguity, ahead of all others, markedly
improves object detection. Also, in contrast to findings from classification,
we see a noteworthy boost by conditioning our model on bespoke categories of

augmentations. Data augmentations encourage models to learn desired
invariances, such as invariance to horizontal flipping or small changes in
color. Recent work has shown that arbitrary style transfer can be used as a
form of data augmentation to encourage invariance to textures by creating
painting-like images from photographs. However, a stylized photograph is not
quite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually
meaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in
scenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer. Therefore, we
study how style transfer and paintings differ in their impact on model
robustness. First, we investigate the role of paintings as style images for
stylization-based data augmentation. We find that style transfer functions well
even without paintings as style images. Second, we show that learning from
paintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can improve model
robustness. Finally, we investigate the invariances learned from stylization
and from paintings, and show that models learn different invariances from these
differing forms of data. Our results provide insights into how stylization
improves model robustness, and provide evidence that artist-created paintings
can be a valuable source of data for model robustness.

the collection and annotation of training data are still quite laborious, which
mainly lies in two aspects: (1) the amount of required annotated data is large;
(2) temporally annotating the location of each action is time-consuming. Works
such as few-shot learning or untrimmed video recognition have been proposed to
handle either one aspect or the other. However, very few existing works can
handle both issues simultaneously. In this paper, we target a new problem,
Annotation-Efficient Video Recognition, to reduce the requirement of

problem is challenging due to two aspects: (1) the untrimmed videos only have
weak supervision; (2) video segments not relevant to current actions of
interests (background, BG) could contain actions of interests (foreground, FG)
in novel classes, which is a widely existing phenomenon but has rarely been
studied in few-shot untrimmed video recognition. To achieve this goal, by
analyzing the property of BG, we categorize BG into informative BG (IBG) and
non-informative BG (NBG), and we propose (1) an open-set detection based method

distinguish NBG in a self-supervised way, and (3) a self-weighting mechanism

sufficient to measure the relation between features, especially in a certain

when dominant objects of different scales exist in a complex background. To
address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multi-scale Adaptive Task
Attention Network (MATANet) for few-shot learning. Specifically, we first use a
multi-scale feature generator to generate multiple features at different

important LRs among the entire task. Afterwards, a similarity-to-class module

We
analyze flux-calibrated VLT/MUSE spectra of 361 stars to simultaneously measure

find that the extinction law from Cardelli et al. (1989) with a
total-to-selective extinction value of $R_{\rm V}=$5.5 is more suitable for
this cluster. For 68% of the sample the new spectral types are consistent with
literature spectral types within 2 subclasses, but as expected, we derive
systematically later types than the literature by one to two subclasses for the
sources with significant accretion levels. Here we present an improved
Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram of the Trapezium cluster, in which the
contamination by optical veiling on spectral types and stellar luminosities has
been properly removed. A comparison of the locations of the stars in the H-R
diagram with the non-magnetic and magnetic pre-main sequence evolutionary
tracks indicates an age of 1--2~Myr. The magnetic pre-main sequence
evolutionary tracks can better explain the luminosities of the low-mass stars.
In the H-R diagram, the cluster exhibits a large luminosity spread
($\sigma$(Log~$L_{\star}/L_{\odot})\sim$0.3). By collecting a sample of 14
clusters/groups with different ages, we find that the luminosity spread tends
to be constant ($\sigma$(Log~$L_{\star}/L_{\odot})\sim$0.2--0.25) after 2~Myr,
which suggests that age spread is not the main cause of the spread. There are
$\sim$0.1~dex larger luminosity spreads for the younger clusters, e.g., the
Trapezium cluster, than the older clusters, which can be explained by the
starspots, accretion history and circumstellar disk orientations.

i) the amount of the transitions is usually small, and ii) the value assignment

To keep the constructed transitions authentic, we also develop a discriminator

Subtracting DM contributions from the Milky Way and host galaxy for localized
FRBs, the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ value is close to the derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$
relation. We also show the capability to constrain the cosmic reionization
history with the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs in the IllustrisTNG
universe. The derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation at high redshifts can be well
fitted by a $tanh$ reionization model with the reionization redshift $z=5.95$,
which is compatible with the reionization model used by the IllustrisTNG
simulation. The $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs also provides an
independent way to measure the optical depth of cosmic microwave background
(CMB). Our result can be used to derive the pseudo-redshifts of non-localized
FRBs for $DM_{\rm IGM}<4000$ \ \ pc cm$^{-3}$.

framework, we can easily investigate the similarity and difference among
different word embeddings. We conducted extensive empirical study on word2vec,
FastText and GLoVE trained on different corpus and with different dimensions.
We compared the performance of different decomposed components based on
sentiment analysis on Twitter and Stanford sentiment treebank. We found that by
mapping different word embeddings into the joint component, sentiment
performance can be greatly improved for the original word embeddings with lower
performance. Moreover, we found that by concatenating different components
together, the same model can achieve better performance. These findings provide
great insights into the word embeddings and our work offer a new of generating

indicates that the dynamic heterogeneity decreases with increasing k whereas
the non-Gaussian parameter is independent of it. Thus we conclude that with the

for solving quantum Hamiltonians, each having their own advantages. Here we
detail the Variational Discrete Action Theory (VDAT), which exploits the
advantages of both paradigms in order to approximately solve the ground state
of quantum Hamiltonians. VDAT consists of two central components: the
sequential product density matrix (SPD) ansatz and a discrete action associated
with the SPD. The SPD is a variational ansatz inspired by the Trotter
decomposition and characterized by an integer $\mathcal{N}$, recovering many
well known variational wave functions, in addition to the exact solution for
$\mathcal{N}=\infty$. The discrete action describes all dynamical information
of an effective integer time evolution with respect to the SPD. We generalize
the path integral to our integer time formalism, which converts a dynamic
correlation function in integer time to a static correlation function in a
compound space. We also generalize the usual many-body Green's function
formalism to integer time, which results in analogous but distinct mathematical
structures, yielding integer time versions of the generating functional, Dyson
equation, and Bethe-Salpeter equation. We prove that the SPD can be exactly
evaluated in the multi-band Anderson impurity model (AIM) by summing a finite
number of diagrams. For the multi-band Hubbard model, we prove that the
self-consistent canonical discrete action approximation (SCDA), which is the
integer time analogue of the dynamical mean-field theory, exactly evaluates the
SPD for $d=\infty$. VDAT within the SCDA provides an efficient yet reliable
method for capturing the local physics of quantum lattice models, which will
have broad applications for strongly correlated electron materials. More

$X=\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{S}^1$ which are near the continuous spectrum are
approximated by the resonances of $-\Delta +V_0$ on $X$, where the potential
$V_0$ given by averaging $V$ over the unit circle. These resonances are, in
turn, given in terms of the resonances of a Schr\""odinger operator on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ which lie in a bounded set. If the potential is smooth, we
obtain improved localization of the resonances, particularly in the case of
simple, rank one poles of the corresponding scattering resolvent on
$\mathbb{R}^d$. In that case, we obtain the leading order correction for the
location of the corresponding high energy resonances. In addition to direct
results about the location of resonances, we show that at high energies away
from the resonances, the resolvent of the model operator $-\Delta+V_0$ on $X$
approximates that of $-\Delta+V$ on $X$. If $d=1$, in certain cases this
implies the existence of an asymptotic expansion of solutions of the wave
equation. Again for the special case of $d=1$, we obtain a resonant rigidity

length $L$=50-500 Mm, temperature $T$=5-30 MK, and density

compressive viscosity along with thermal conductivity significantly enhances
the damping of fundamental mode oscillations in shorter (e.g., $L$=50 Mm) and
super-hot ($T>$10 MK) loops. However, role of the viscosity in damping is
insignificant in longer (e.g., $L$=500 Mm) and hot loops (T$\leq$10 MK) where,
instead, thermal conductivity along with the presence of heating cooling
imbalance plays a dominant role. For the shorter loops at the super-hot regime
of the temperature, increment in loop density substantially enhances damping of
the fundamental modes due to thermal conductivity when the viscosity is absent,
however, when the compressive viscosity is added the increase in density
substantially weakens damping. Thermal conductivity alone is found to play a
dominant role in longer loops at lower temperatures (T$\leq$10 MK), while
compressive viscosity dominates in damping at super-hot temperatures ($T>$10
MK) in shorter loops. The predicted scaling law between damping time ($\tau$)

they generate, can be used to encode computational effects. An important
insight of Power and Shkaravska is that comodels of an algebraic theory T --
i.e., models in the opposite category Set^op -- provide a suitable environment
for evaluating the computational effects encoded by T. As already noted by
Power and Shkaravska, taking comodels yields a functor from accessible monads
to accessible comonads on Set. In this paper, we show that this functor is part
of an adjunction -- the ""costructure-cosemantics adjunction"" of the title --
and undertake a thorough investigation of its properties.
  We show that, on the one hand, the cosemantics functor takes its image in
what we term the presheaf comonads induced by small categories; and that, on
the other, costructure takes its image in the presheaf monads induced by small
categories. In particular, the cosemantics comonad of an accessible monad will
be induced by an explicitly-described category called its behaviour category
that encodes the static and dynamic properties of the comodels. Similarly, the
costructure monad of an accessible comonad will be induced by a behaviour
category encoding static and dynamic properties of the comonad coalgebras. We
tie these results together by showing that the costructure-cosemantics
adjunction is idempotent, with fixpoints to either side given precisely by the
presheaf monads and comonads. Along the way, we illustrate the value of our
results with numerous examples drawn from computation and mathematics.

the network weights and architecture weights alternatively in a differential

to whether or not their predecessor edges are in the same cell. While the
architecture weights of outer edges are optimized independently, those of inner
edges are derived sequentially based on the architecture weights of their
predecessor edges and the learnable transition matrices in an attentive

triggered by the failure of a transmission line, which can lead to substantial
economic losses and serious negative social impacts. Therefore, it is very
important to identify the critical lines under various types of attacks that
may initiate a cascading failure and deploy defense resources to protect them.
Since coordinated multistage line attacks can lead to larger negative impacts
compared with a single-stage attack or a multistage attack without
coordination, this paper intends to identify the critical lines under
coordinated multistage attacks that may initiate a cascading failure and deploy
limited defense resources optimally. To this end, we first formulate a total
generation loss maximization problem with the consideration of multiple
attackers and multiple stages. Due to the large size of solution space, it is
very challenging to solve the formulated problem. To overcome the challenge, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov game and design its components, e.g.,
state, action, and reward. Next, we propose a scalable algorithm to solve the
Markov game based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and prioritized
experience replay, which can determine the optimal attacking line sequences.
Then, we design a defense strategy to decide the optimal defense line set.
Extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm

dataset and additionally applied to new settings. Towards model external
validation and model updating in the new setting, one procedure is model
modification learning that involves the dual goals of recalibrating overall
predictions as well as revising individual feature effects. Modification
learning generally requires the collection of an adequate sample of true
outcome labels from the new setting, which is frequently an expensive and
time-consuming process, as it involves abstraction by human clinical experts.
To reduce the abstraction burden for such new data collection, we propose a
class of designs based on original model scores and their associated outcome
predictions. We provide mathematical justification that the general predictive
score sampling class results in valid samples for analysis. Then, we focus
attention specifically on a stratified sampling procedure that we call
predictive case control (PCC) sampling, which allows the dual modification
learning goals to be achieved at a smaller sample size compared to simple
random sampling (SRS). PCC sampling intentionally over-represents subjects with
informative scores, where we suggest using the D-optimality and Binary Entropy
information functions to summarize sample information. For design evaluation
within the PCC class, we provide a computational framework to estimate and
visualize empirical response surfaces of the proposed information functions. We
demonstrate the benefit of using PCC designs for modification learning,
relative to SRS, through Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, using radiology
report data from the Lumbar Imaging with Reporting of Epidemiology (LIRE)
study, we illustrate the application of PCC for new outcome label abstraction
and subsequent modification learning across imaging modalities.

have applied the open-source Python package PRISM to the galaxy formation model
Meraxes. Meraxes is a semi-analytic model, purposefully built to study the
growth of galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Constraining such
models is however complicated by the scarcity of observational data in the EoR.
PRISM's ability to rapidly construct accurate approximations of complex
scientific models using minimal data is therefore key to performing this
analysis well.
  This paper provides an overview of our analysis of Meraxes using measurements
of galaxy stellar mass densities; luminosity functions; and color-magnitude
relations. We demonstrate the power of using PRISM instead of a full Bayesian
analysis when dealing with highly correlated model parameters and a scarce set
of observational data. Our results show that the various observational data
sets constrain Meraxes differently and do not necessarily agree with each
other, signifying the importance of using multiple observational data types
when constraining such models. Furthermore, we show that PRISM can detect when
model parameters are too correlated or cannot be constrained effectively. We
conclude that a mixture of different observational data types, even when they
are scarce or inaccurate, is a priority for understanding galaxy formation and
that emulation frameworks like PRISM can guide the selection of such data.

a subset $E \subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper density intersects the
image set of any polynomial $P \in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ for which $P(0)=0$.
Furstenberg's approach relies on a correspondence principle and a polynomial
version of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem, which is derived from the
ergodic-theoretic result that for any measure-preserving system
$(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and set $A \in \mathcal{B}$ with $\mu(A) > 0$, one has
$c(A):= \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \mu(A \cap T^{-P(n)}A) >
0.$ The limit $c(A)$ will have its optimal value of $\mu(A)^2$ when $T$ is
totally ergodic. Motivated by the possibility of new combinatorial
applications, we define the notion of asymptotic total ergodicity in the
setting of modular rings $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. We show that a sequence of
modular rings $\mathbb{Z}/N_m\mathbb{Z}$, $m \in \mathbb{N},$ is asymptotically
totally ergodic if and only if $\mathrm{lpf}(N_m)$, the least prime factor of
$N_m$, grows to infinity. From this fact, we derive some combinatorial
consequences, for example the following. Fix $\delta \in (0,1]$ and a (not
necessarily intersective) polynomial $Q \in \mathbb{Q}[n]$ such that
$Q(\mathbb{Z}) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, and write $S = \{ Q(n) : n \in
\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}\}$. For any integer $N > 1$ with $\mathrm{lpf}(N)$
sufficiently large, if $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ such
that $|A||B| \geq \delta N^2$, then $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z} = A + B + S$.

store significant volumes of digital data. While DNA as a storage medium has
enormous potential because of its high storage density, its practical use is
currently severely limited because of the high cost and low throughput of
available DNA synthesis technologies. We study the role of batch optimization
in reducing the cost of large scale DNA synthesis, which translates to the
following algorithmic task. Given a large pool $\mathcal{S}$ of random
quaternary strings of fixed length, partition $\mathcal{S}$ into batches in a
way that minimizes the sum of the lengths of the shortest common supersequences
across batches. We introduce two ideas for batch optimization that both improve
(in different ways) upon a naive baseline: (1) using both $(ACGT)^{*}$ and its
reverse $(TGCA)^{*}$ as reference strands, and batching appropriately, and (2)
batching via the quantiles of an appropriate ordering of the strands. We also
prove asymptotically matching lower bounds on the cost of DNA synthesis,
showing that one cannot improve upon these two ideas. Our results uncover a
surprising separation between two cases that naturally arise in the context of
DNA data storage: the asymptotic cost savings of batch optimization are
significantly greater in the case where strings in $\mathcal{S}$ do not contain
repeats of the same character (homopolymers), as compared to the case where
strings in $\mathcal{S}$ are unconstrained.

underlying RW in the VC unfolds in 3D space, now with isotropic steps since
extinction is scaled back to account for forward scattering. We show that the
VC optical thickness controls cloud-scale brightness contrast between the

cosine similarity scores and independence measurements between domain-invariant

initial and final states during the learning procedure. Similar to the final
condition of heuristic search, we further derive a constraint enforcing the
final range of heuristic network output to be small. Accordingly, we propose
Heuristic Domain Adaptation Network (HDAN), which explicitly learns the

relation and the scatter around it using over one billion lines-of-sight
between redshifts $0<z<3$. We investigated two techniques to estimate
line-of-sight DM: `pixel scrambling' and `box transformations'. We find that
using box transformations (a technique from the literature) causes strong
correlations due to repeated replication of structure. Comparing a linear and
non-linear model, we find that the non-linear model with cosmological
parameters, provides a better fit to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation. The
differences between these models are the most significant at low redshifts
($z<0.5$). The scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation is highly
asymmetric, especially at low redshift $\left(z<0.5\right)$, and becomes more
Gaussian as redshift approaches $z\sim3$, the limit of this study. The increase
in Gaussianity with redshift is indicative of the large scale structures that
is better probed with longer lines-of-sight. The minimum simulation size

  Selection","44 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of regularized loss minimization with polyhedral gauges, we
show that for a broad class of loss functions (possibly non-smooth and
non-convex) and under a simple geometric condition on the input data it is
possible to efficiently identify a subset of features which are guaranteed to
have zero coefficients in all optimal solutions in all problems with loss
functions from said class, before any iterative optimization has been performed
for the original problem. This procedure is standalone, takes only the data as
input, and does not require any calls to the loss function. Therefore, we term
this procedure as a persistent reduction for the aforementioned class of
regularized loss minimization problems. This reduction can be efficiently
implemented via an extreme ray identification subroutine applied to a
polyhedral cone formed from the datapoints. We employ an existing
output-sensitive algorithm for extreme ray identification which makes our
guarantee and algorithm applicable in ultra-high dimensional problems.

using a two-dimensional (2D) linear shallow water model with a specified
uniform zonal flow. We find that the degree of the phase shift is a monotonic
but nonlinear function of the strength of the mean flow, and the phase shift
has two limits of -$\pi$ and +$\pi$. The existence of these limits can be
explained using the energy balance of the whole system. We further show that a
resonance between the Rossby wave and the mean flow occurs when the speed of an
eastward jet approaches to the westward phase speed of the Rossby wave, or a
resonance between the Kelvin wave and the mean flow happens when the speed of a
westward jet approaches to the eastward phase speed of the Kelvin wave. The
resonance mechanism is the same as that found in the previous studies on Earth

when it can be implemented efficiently, we provide an additive FPTAS whose
running time is independent of the number of actions. On the other hand, we
provide a family of problems, where it is computationally intractable to
construct a best response oracle, and we show that it is NP-hard to get even a
constant fraction of the optimal revenue. Moreover, we investigate a
generalization of the original model by Bergemann et al. [BBS18] that allows
multiple agents to compete for useful information. We leverage techniques
developed in the study of auction design (see e.g. [CDW12a], [AFHHM12],
[CDW12b], [CDW13a], [CDW13b]) to design a polynomial time algorithm that
computes the revenue-optimal mechanism for selling information.

privacy noise on performance of private machine learning models. To this aim,
we employ compressed sensing and additive Laplace noise to evaluate
differentially-private gradients. Noisy privacy-preserving gradients are used
to perform stochastic gradient descent for training machine learning models.
Sparsification, achieved by setting the smallest gradient entries to zero, can
reduce the convergence speed of the training algorithm. However, by
sparsification and compressed sensing, the dimension of communicated gradient
and the magnitude of additive noise can be reduced. The interplay between these
effects determines whether gradient sparsification improves the performance of
differentially-private machine learning models. We investigate this
analytically in the paper. We prove that, for small privacy budgets,
compression can improve performance of privacy-preserving machine learning
models. However, for large privacy budgets, compression does not necessarily
improve the performance. Intuitively, this is because the effect of
privacy-preserving noise is minimal in large privacy budget regime and thus
improvements from gradient sparsification cannot compensate for its slower
convergence.

initialize and refine the motion of grids via a novel multi-homography

trajectory smoothing, which can well adapt to trajectories with different

symmetry-based model Hamiltonian is employed to extract orbital parameters and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from the low-energy Dirac bands of proximitized
graphene. While commensurate hBN induces a staggered potential of about 10 meV
into the Dirac bands, less lattice-matched hAlN and hGaN disrupt the Dirac
point much less, giving a staggered gap below 100 $\mu$eV. Proximitized
intrinsic SOC surprisingly does not increase much above the pristine graphene
value of 12 $\mu$eV; it stays in the window of (1-16) $\mu$eV, depending
strongly on stacking. However, Rashba SOC increases sharply when increasing the
atomic number of the boron group, with calculated maximal values of 8, 15, and
65 $\mu$eV for B, Al, and Ga-based nitrides, respectively. The individual
Rashba couplings also depend strongly on stacking, vanishing in
symmetrically-sandwiched structures, and can be tuned by a transverse electric
field. The extracted spin-orbit parameters were used as input for spin
transport simulations based on Chebyshev expansion of the time-evolution of the
spin expectation values, yielding interesting predictions for the electron spin
relaxation. Spin lifetime magnitudes and anisotropies depend strongly on the
specific (hXN)/graphene/hXN system, and they can be efficiently tuned by an
applied external electric field as well as the carrier density in the graphene
layer. A particularly interesting case for experiments is graphene/hGaN, in
which the giant Rashba coupling is predicted to induce spin lifetimes of 1-10
ns, short enough to dominate over other mechanisms, and lead to the same spin
relaxation anisotropy as observed in conventional semiconductor
heterostructures: 50\%, meaning that out-of-plane spins relax twice as fast as

spectrum of $p\eta (\pi)$ around $1.56387$ GeV, which is far away from both the
threshold and relative resonances. In these processes, all the involved
vertices are constrained by the experimental data. Thus, we can make a precise
model independent prediction here. It turns out that the peak in the $p\eta$
invariant mass spectrum is visible, while it is very small in the $p\pi^0$
invariant mass spectrum. We expect this effect shown in $p \bar{p} \eta$ final
state can be observed by the Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) and Super Tau-Charm

geometric property of Banach space, the Ball Huskable Property ($BHP$), namely,
the unit ball has relatively weakly open subsets of arbitrarily small diameter.
We compare this property to two related geometric properties, $BSCSP$ namely,
the unit ball has convex combination of slices of arbitrarily small diameter
and $BDP$ namely, the closed unit ball has slices of arbitrarily small
diameter. We show $BDP$ implies $BHP$ which in turn implies $BSCSP$ and none of
the implications can be reversed. We prove similar results for the
$w^*$-versions. We prove that all these properties are stable under $l_p$ sum

context of ideals of Banach spaces. We prove that $BSCSP$ (respectively $BHP$,
$BDP$) can be lifted from an M-Ideal to the whole space. We also show similar
results for strict ideals. We note that the space $C(K,X)^*$ has $w^*$-$BSCSP$

elusive. Here, we study the pathways of spindle self-organization using
cell-free Xenopus egg extracts and computer-based automated shape analysis. Our
microscopy assay allows us to simultaneously record the growth of hundreds of
spindles in the bulk cytoplasm and systematically analyze the shape of each
structure over the course of self-organization. We find that spindles that are
maturing into a bipolar shape take a route that is distinct from those ending
up with faulty structures, such as those of a tripolar shape. Moreover, matured
structures are highly stable with little occasions of transformation between
different shape phenotypes. Visualizing the movement of microtubules further
reveals a fraction of microtubules that assemble between extra poles and push
the poles apart, suggesting the presence of active extensile force that
prevents pole coalescence. Together, we propose that a proper control over the
magnitude and location of the extensile, pole-pushing force is crucial for
establishing spindle bipolarity while preventing multipolarity.

studied. Simple strategies such as using a fixed threshold on classification
scores are adopted, yielding undesirable tracking mistakes and limiting the
overall performance. In this paper, a conditional random field (CRF) based
framework is put forward to tackle the tracklet inactivation issue in online
MOT problems. A discrete CRF which exploits the intra-frame relationship
between tracking hypotheses is developed to improve the robustness of tracklet
inactivation. Separate sets of feature functions are designed for the unary and
binary terms in the CRF, which take into account various tracking challenges in
practical scenarios. To handle the problem of varying CRF nodes in the MOT
context, two strategies named as hypothesis filtering and dummy nodes are
employed. In the proposed framework, the inference stage is conducted by using
the loopy belief propagation algorithm, and the CRF parameters are determined
by utilizing the maximum likelihood estimation method followed by slight manual
adjustment. Experimental results show that the tracker combined with the
CRF-based framework outperforms the baseline on the MOT16 and MOT17 benchmarks.
The extensibility of the proposed framework is further validated by an

focus on a short period of a video and magnify it along the temporal dimension

properties of both scales. The xGPN component further exploits the cross-scale
correlations by a pyramid of cross-scale graph networks, each containing a
hybrid module to aggregate features from across scales as well as within the

generates more positive anchors for short actions and more short training

the observation that attacks affect the performance of the victim application.
As such, all detection tools monitor the potential victim and raise an alarm if
the witnessed performance (in terms of runtime, enclave interruptions, cache
misses, etc.) is out of the ordinary.
  In this paper, we show that monitoring the performance of enclaves to detect
side-channel attacks may not be effective. Our core intuition is that all
monitoring tools are geared towards an adversary that interferes with the
victim's execution in order to extract the most number of secret bits (e.g.,
the entire secret) in one or few runs. They cannot, however, detect an
adversary that leaks smaller portions of the secret - as small as a single bit
- at each execution of the victim. In particular, by minimizing the information
leaked at each run, the impact of any side-channel attack on the application's
performance is significantly lowered - ensuring that the detection tool does
not detect an attack. By repeating the attack multiple times, each time on a
different part of the secret, the adversary can recover the whole secret and
remain undetected. Based on this intuition, we adapt known attacks leveraging
page-tables and L3 cache to bypass existing detection mechanisms. We show
experimentally how an attacker can successfully exfiltrate the secret key used
in an enclave running various cryptographic routines of libgcrypt. Beyond
cryptographic libraries, we also show how to compromise the predictions of
enclaves running decision-tree routines of OpenCV. Our evaluation results
suggest that performance-based detection tools do not deter side-channel
attacks on SGX enclaves and that effective detection mechanisms are yet to be
designed.

coherent control of quantum states. The rotating wave approximation (RWA) is a
good approximation technique for weak and nearly-resonance driven fields.
However, these experiments sometimes require large detuning and strong driving
fields, for which the RWA may not hold. In this work, we experimentally,
numerically, and analytically explore strongly driven two-mode Josephson
circuits in the regime of strong driving and large detuning. Specifically, we
investigate beam-splitter and two-mode squeezing interaction between the two
modes induced by driving a two-photon sideband transition. Using numerical
simulations, we observe that the RWA is unable to correctly capture the
amplitude of the sideband transition rates. We verify this finding using an
analytical model that is based on perturbative corrections. We find that the
breakdown of the RWA in the regime studied does not lead to qualitatively
different dynamics, but gives the same results as the RWA theory at higher
drive strengths, enhancing the coupling rates compared to what one would
predict. This is an interesting consequence compared to the carrier transition
case, where the breakdown of the RWA results in qualitatively different time
evolution of the quantum state. Our work provides an insight into the behavior
of time-periodically driven systems beyond the RWA. We also provide a robust
theoretical framework for including these findings in the calculation and
calibration of quantum protocols in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

  Multiple Different Lenses",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has demonstrated its power in image rectification by leveraging
the representation capacity of deep neural networks via supervised training
based on a large-scale synthetic dataset. However, the model may overfit the
synthetic images and generalize not well on real-world fisheye images due to
the limited universality of a specific distortion model and the lack of
explicitly modeling the distortion and rectification process. In this paper, we
propose a novel self-supervised image rectification (SIR) method based on an
important insight that the rectified results of distorted images of a same
scene from different lens should be the same. Specifically, we devise a new
network architecture with a shared encoder and several prediction heads, each
of which predicts the distortion parameter of a specific distortion model. We
further leverage a differentiable warping module to generate the rectified
images and re-distorted images from the distortion parameters and exploit the
intra- and inter-model consistency between them during training, thereby
leading to a self-supervised learning scheme without the need for ground-truth
distortion parameters or normal images. Experiments on synthetic dataset and
real-world fisheye images demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or
even better performance than the supervised baseline method and representative
state-of-the-art methods. Self-supervised learning also improves the
universality of distortion models while keeping their self-consistency.

introducing an additional topology-aware UV-mask for the UV-position map.
Second, to further enable garment reconstruction and editing, we contribute a
method to embed the UV-based representations into a continuous feature space,

control in the latent space, respectively. Finally, we propose a garment
animation method by unifying our neural garment representation with body shape

dynamic information encoded by our shape and style representation, even under

any machine learning algorithm while still provably controlling the expected
proportion of false discoveries. To apply model-X knockoffs, one must construct
synthetic variables, called knockoffs, which effectively act as controls during
feature selection. The gold standard for constructing knockoffs has been to
minimize the mean absolute correlation (MAC) between features and their
knockoffs, but, surprisingly, we prove this procedure can be powerless in
extremely easy settings, including Gaussian linear models with correlated
exchangeable features. The key problem is that minimizing the MAC creates
strong joint dependencies between the features and knockoffs, which allow
machine learning algorithms to partially or fully reconstruct the effect of the
features on the response using the knockoffs. To improve the power of
knockoffs, we propose generating knockoffs which minimize the
reconstructability (MRC) of the features, and we demonstrate our proposal for
Gaussian features by showing it is computationally efficient, robust, and
powerful. We also prove that certain MRC knockoffs minimize a natural
definition of estimation error in Gaussian linear models. Furthermore, in an
extensive set of simulations, we find many settings with correlated features in
which MRC knockoffs dramatically outperform MAC-minimizing knockoffs and no
settings in which MAC-minimizing knockoffs outperform MRC knockoffs by more
than a very slight margin. We implement our methods and a host of others from

for a cold dense atomic cloud. The shift, sometimes called collective Lamb
shift, results from resonant dipole-dipole interaction mediated by real and
virtual photon exchange, forming many-body states displaying various super- and
subradiant spectral behavior. The scattering spectrum reflects the overall
radiative behavior from these states. However, it also averages out the
radiative details associated with a single collective state, causing ambiguity
in explaining the origin of the spectral shift and raising controversy on its
scaling property. We employ a Monte-Carlo simulation to study how the
collective states are occupied and contribute to emission. We thus distinguish
two kinds of collective shift that follow different scaling laws. One results
from dominant occupation of the near-resonant collective states. This shift is
usually small and insensitive to the density or the number of participating
atoms. The other comes from large spatial correlation of dipoles, associated
with the states of higher degree of emission. This corresponds to larger
collective shift that is approximately linearly dependent on the optical depth.
Our analysis provides not only a novel perspective for the spectral features in
collective scattering, but also a possible resolution to the controversy on the
scaling property that has been reported elsewhere because of different origins.

efficiency of transportation systems and preventing emergencies. Due to the
highly non-linearity and intricate evolutionary patterns of short-term and
long-term traffic flow, existing methods often fail to take full advantage of
spatial-temporal information, especially the various temporal patterns with
different period shifting and the characteristics of road segments. Besides,
the globality representing the absolute value of traffic status indicators and
the locality representing the relative value have not been considered
simultaneously. This paper proposes a neural network model that focuses on the
globality and locality of traffic networks as well as the temporal patterns of
traffic data. The cycle-based dilated deformable convolution block is designed
to capture different time-varying trends on each node accurately. Our model can
extract both global and local spatial information since we combine two graph
convolutional network methods to learn the representations of nodes and edges.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that the model can scrutinize the
spatial-temporal correlation of traffic data, and its performance is better
than the compared state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis indicates that the
locality and globality of the traffic networks are critical to traffic flow
prediction and the proposed TSSRGCN model can adapt to the various temporal
traffic patterns.

allows for a better integration of the two key components is thus highly
desirable. Here we introduce a hybrid model combining the quantum-inspired
tensor networks (TN) and the variational quantum circuits (VQC) to perform
supervised learning tasks, which allows for an end-to-end training. We show
that a matrix product state based TN with low bond dimensions performs better
than PCA as a feature extractor to compress data for the input of VQCs in the
binary classification of MNIST dataset. The architecture is highly adaptable
and can easily incorporate extra quantum resource when available.

necessarily increase the model capacity. However, the performance of a network

we argue that increasing the number of networks (ensemble) can achieve better
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than purely increasing the width. To prove it,
one large network is divided into several small ones regarding its parameters
and regularization components. Each of these small networks has a fraction of
the original one's parameters. We then train these small networks together and
make them see various views of the same data to increase their diversity.
During this co-training process, networks can also learn from each other. As a
result, small networks can achieve better ensemble performance than the large
one with few or no extra parameters or FLOPs, \ie, achieving better
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Small networks can also achieve faster
inference speed than the large one by concurrent running. All of the above
shows that the number of networks is a new dimension of model scaling. We

flow dynamics of swirl-stabilized flames, such as those in modern power
generation gas turbine engines. In this study, we characterize the interaction
between the precessing vortex core (PVC), which is the consequence of a global
hydrodynamic instability, and thermoacoustic instabilities, which are the
result of a resonant coupling between combustor acoustics and the unsteady heat
release rate of combustion. This characterization is performed using
experimental data obtained from a model gas turbine combustor system employing
two concentric swirling nozzles of air, separated by a ring of fuel injectors,
operating at 5 bar pressure. The flow split between the two streams is
systematically varied to observe the impact of flow structure variation on the
flow and flame dynamics. High-speed sPIV, OH-PLIF, and acetone PLIF are used to
obtain information about the velocity fields, flame, and fuel flow behavior,
respectively. Spectral POD and spatial frequency analysis are used to identify
and characterize the dominant oscillation mechanisms driving the system. Three
dominant modes are seen: two thermoacoustic modes and the precessing vortex
core. Our results show that in the cases where the frequency of the PVC
overlaps with either of the thermoacoustic modes, the thermoacoustic modes are
suppressed. A weakly nonlinear asymptotic analysis shows that the suppression
of the axisymmetric shear layer shedding, and hence thermoacoustic mode, is the
result of a nonlinear coupling between the PVC and the axisymmetric mode of the
swirling jet. Evolution equations for both the symmetric and PVC modes are
derived to show the controlling parameters that drive this suppression. We
conclude by discussing ways in which thermoacoustic instability suppression can
be achieved through combustor flow field design.

the requirement of base class labels and learn generalizable embeddings via
Unsupervised Meta-Learning (UML). Specifically, episodes of tasks are
constructed with data augmentations from unlabeled base classes during
meta-training, and we apply embedding-based classifiers to novel tasks with
labeled few-shot examples during meta-test. We observe two elements play
important roles in UML, i.e., the way to sample tasks and measure similarities
between instances. Thus we obtain a strong baseline with two simple
modifications -- a sufficient sampling strategy constructing multiple tasks per
episode efficiently together with a semi-normalized similarity. We then take
advantage of the characteristics of tasks from two directions to get further
improvements. First, synthesized confusing instances are incorporated to help
extract more discriminative embeddings. Second, we utilize an additional
task-specific embedding transformation as an auxiliary component during
meta-training to promote the generalization ability of the pre-adapted

  Empirical Support",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It has been repeatedly observed that convolutional architectures when applied
to image understanding tasks learn oriented bandpass filters. A standard
explanation of this result is that these filters reflect the structure of the
images that they have been exposed to during training: Natural images typically
are locally composed of oriented contours at various scales and oriented
bandpass filters are matched to such structure. We offer an alternative
explanation based not on the structure of images, but rather on the structure
of convolutional architectures. In particular, complex exponentials are the
eigenfunctions of convolution. These eigenfunctions are defined globally;
however, convolutional architectures operate locally. To enforce locality, one
can apply a windowing function to the eigenfunctions, which leads to oriented
bandpass filters as the natural operators to be learned with convolutional
architectures. From a representational point of view, these filters allow for a
local systematic way to characterize and operate on an image or other signal.
We offer empirical support for the hypothesis that convolutional networks learn
such filters at all of their convolutional layers. While previous research has
shown evidence of filters having oriented bandpass characteristics at early
layers, ours appears to be the first study to document the predominance of such
filter characteristics at all layers. Previous studies have missed this
observation because they have concentrated on the cumulative compositional
effects of filtering across layers, while we examine the filter characteristics
that are present at each layer.

impressive performance, they suffer from a poor generalization capability on

attention. Many existing methods have employed an instance normalization

generalizable Re-ID framework, named Meta Batch-Instance Normalization
(MetaBIN). Our main idea is to generalize normalization layers by simulating
unsuccessful generalization scenarios beforehand in the meta-learning pipeline.
To this end, we combine learnable batch-instance normalization layers with
meta-learning and investigate the challenging cases caused by both batch and
instance normalization layers. Moreover, we diversify the virtual simulations
via our meta-train loss accompanied by a cyclic inner-updating manner to boost
generalization capability. After all, the MetaBIN framework prevents our model
from overfitting to the given source styles and improves the generalization
capability to unseen domains without additional data augmentation or
complicated network design. Extensive experimental results show that our model
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale domain

for the human body by estimating several parameters. However, learning the
abstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model
misalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint
estimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation
to achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body
structure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap
between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel
hybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms
accurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh
reconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is
analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the
visual cues through the neural network. We show that HybrIK preserves both the
accuracy of 3D pose and the realistic body structure of the parametric human
model, leading to a pixel-aligned 3D body mesh and a more accurate 3D pose than
the pure 3D keypoint estimation methods. Without bells and whistles, the
proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on
various 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. As an illustrative example, HybrIK
outperforms all the previous methods by 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on 3DPW

measurement outcomes which underly both problem-solving and quantum
nonlocality. In the former case the two outcomes are the setting and the
solution of the problem, in the latter those of measuring a pair of maximally
entangled observables whose subsystems are space separate. We argue that the
quantum description of these processes mathematically describes the correlation
but leaves the causal structure that physically ensures it free, also of
violating the time-symmetry required of the description of a reversible
process. It would therefore be incomplete and could be completed by
time-symmetrizing it. This is done by assuming that the two measurements evenly
contribute to selecting the pair of correlated measurement outcomes.
Time-symmetrization leaves the ordinary quantum description unaltered but shows
that it is the quantum superposition of unobservable time-symmetrization
instances whose causal structure is completely defined. Each instance is a
causal loop: causation goes from the initial to the final measurement outcome
and then back from the final to the initial outcome. In the speedup, all is as
if the problem solver knew in advance half of the information about the
solution she will produce in the future and could use this knowledge to produce
the solution with fewer computation steps. In nonlocality, the measurement on
either subsystem retrocausally and locally changes the state of both subsystems
when the two were not yet spatially separate. This locally causes the
correlation between the two future measurement outcomes.

identify which modes are Raman and/or infrared active, and to provide diagrams

r > 0\right\}$ grows approximately as a power of $r$. Also, the tails of the
passage time distributions for distance $r$ satisfy an exponential bound on a

$\lesssim6$ Gyr have high $f_{T}$ of $\sim0.7$ compared to their less compact
or old counterparts with ages $\gtrsim9$ Gyr that have $f_{T}\lesssim0.1$.
Among compact young ETGs, those with blue cores have $\sim3$ times higher

$\sim4$ times higher $f_{T}$ than those without dust lanes. Our results provide
direct evidence that compact young ETGs especially with blue cores and ETGs

linear systems. The randomized Kaczmarz method (RK) greatly improves the
convergence rate of the Kaczmarz method, by using the rows of the coefficient
matrix in random order rather than in their given order. An obvious
disadvantage of the randomized Kaczmarz method is its probability criterion for
selecting the active or working rows in the coefficient matrix. In [{\sc Z.Z.
Bai, W. Wu}, {\em On greedy randomized Kaczmarz method for solving large sparse

the authors proposed a greedy randomized Kaczmarz method (GRK). However, this
method may suffer from heavily computational cost when the size of the matrix
is large, and the overhead will be prohibitively large for big data problems.
The contribution of this work is as follows. First, from the probability
significance point of view, we present a partially randomized Kaczmarz method,
which can reduce the computational overhead needed in greedy randomized
Kaczmarz method. Second, based on Chebyshev's law of large numbers and Z-test,
we apply a simple sampling approach to the partially randomized Kaczmarz
method. The convergence of the proposed method is established. Third, we apply
the new strategy to the ridge regression problem, and propose a partially
randomized Kaczmarz method with simple random sampling for ridge regression.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the new algorithms over
many state-of-the-art randomized Kaczmarz methods for large linear systems
problems and ridge regression problems.

it is possible that meaningful patterns for classifying EEG signals are deeply
hidden. State-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms are successful in learning
hidden, meaningful patterns. However, the quality and the quantity of the
presented inputs is pivotal. Here, we propose a novel feature extraction method

is not only an augmentation method but is also used to harness adversarial
inputs in EEG data, which not only improves the classification accuracy but
also enhances the robustness of the classifier. In addition, we also propose a

The proposed pipeline outperforms all state-of-the-art methods and yields an

quite a complex task from an observational point of view, a better probe of
MTMG would be the halo abundances. In this case, MTMG creates a larger amount
of massive halos, while there is a suppression in the abundance of small halos.

along various axial stations within an engine. Given limited sensor
measurements both along and between axial stations, we require a statistically
principled approach to inferring these profiles. In this paper we detail a
Bayesian methodology for interpolating the spatial temperature or pressure
profile at axial stations within an aeroengine. The profile at any given axial
station is represented as a spatial Gaussian random field on an annulus, with
circumferential variations modelled using a Fourier basis and radial variations
modelled with a squared exponential kernel. This Gaussian random field is
extended to ingest data from multiple axial measurement planes, with the aim of
transferring information across the planes. To facilitate this type of transfer
learning, a novel planar covariance kernel is proposed, with hyperparameters
that characterise the correlation between any two measurement planes. In the
scenario where precise frequencies comprising the temperature field are
unknown, we utilise a sparsity-promoting prior on the frequencies to encourage
sparse representations. This easily extends to cases with multiple engine
planes whilst accommodating frequency variations between the planes. The main
quantity of interest, the spatial area average is readily obtained in closed
form. We term this the Bayesian area average and demonstrate how this metric
offers far more precise averages than a sector area average -- a widely used
area averaging approach. Furthermore, the Bayesian area average naturally
decomposes the posterior uncertainty into terms characterising insufficient
sampling and sensor measurement error respectively. This too provides a
significant improvement over prior standard deviation based uncertainty
breakdowns.

used to infer the governing force balance of a system. The key to a successful
approach is to measure length scales that are representative of the energy
contained in the solution (energetically relevant) and indicative of the
established force balance (dynamically relevant). In numerical simulations of
rotating convection and magneto-hydrodynamic dynamos in spherical shells, it
has remained difficult to measure length scales that are both energetically and
dynamically relevant, which has led to conflicting interpretations of the
underlying force balance. By analysing an extensive set of magnetic and
non-magnetic models, we focus on two length scales that achieve both energetic
and dynamical relevance. The first one is the peak of the poloidal kinetic
energy spectrum, which we successfully compare to crossover points on spectral
representations of the force balance. In most dynamo models, this result
confirms that the dominant length scale of the system is controlled by a
quasi-geostrophic (QG-) MAC (Magneto-Archimedean-Coriolis) balance. In
non-magnetic convection models, the analysis favours a QG-CIA
(Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedean) balance. In dynamo models, we introduce a second
energetically relevant length scale associated with the loss of axial
invariance in the flow. We again relate this length scale to a crossover point
in scale-dependent force balance diagrams, which marks the transition between
large-scale geostrophy (the equilibrium of Coriolis and pressure forces) and
small-scale magnetostrophy, where the Lorentz force overtakes the Coriolis
force. Scaling analysis of these two energetically and dynamically relevant
length scales suggests that the Earth's dynamo is controlled by a QG-MAC
balance at a dominant scale of about 200 km, while magnetostrophic effects are
deferred to scales smaller than 50 km.

confirm using orbital angular momentum (OAM) as an example for topological
charges of l = 1 and l = 10 in a turbulent atmosphere. A consequence is that
the well-known cylindrical vector vortex beams are sufficient to predict the
behaviour of all vector OAM states through the channel, and find that the rate

logarithmic negativity (WLN), while quantum correlations are measured in terms

two-mode state corresponds to the sum of the single-mode nonclassicality as

analyze two different thermal processes within a realistic mixed
hot-dark-matter scenario which includes also massive neutrinos. Considering the
axion-gluon thermalization channel we derive our most constraining bounds on
the hot relic masses $m_a < 7.46$ eV and $\sum m_\nu< 0.114$ eV both at 95 per

Interestingly, in both cases, the total neutrino mass lies very close to the
inverted neutrino mass ordering prediction. If future terrestrial double beta

in closed loop or even more importantly in forward control. This calibration
usually takes the form of an interaction matrix and is a measure of the
response on the wavefront sensor to wavefront corrector stimulus. If this
matrix is sufficiently well conditioned, it can be inverted to produce a
control matrix, which allows to compute the optimal commands to apply to the
wavefront corrector for a given wavefront sensor measurement vector.
Interaction matrices are usually measured by means of an artificial source at
the entrance focus of the adaptive optics system; however, adaptive secondary
mirrors on Cassegrain telescopes offer no such focus and the measurement of
their interaction matrices becomes more challenging and needs to be done on-sky
using a natural star. The most common method is to generate a theoretical or

decenter, magnification, rotation) using on-sky measurements. We propose a

about service computing of the delay-sensitive applications remarkably besides
enabling the location awareness and mobility support. Load balancing is an
important aspect of fog networks that avoids a situation with some under-loaded
or overloaded fog nodes. Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as resource
utilization, throughput, cost, response time, performance, and energy
consumption can be improved with load balancing. In recent years, some
researches in load balancing techniques in fog networks have been carried out,
but there is no systematic review to consolidate these studies. This article
reviews the load-balancing mechanisms systematically in fog computing in four
classifications, including approximate, exact, fundamental, and hybrid methods
(published between 2013 and August 2020). Also, this article investigates load
balancing metrics with all advantages and disadvantages related to chosen load
balancing mechanisms in fog networks. The evaluation techniques and tools
applied for each reviewed study are explored as well. Additionally, the
essential open challenges and future trends of these mechanisms are discussed.

by the difference in chemical bond strength of the inner and outer layer
leading to steric effects. From our pool of candidate structures we have

simulations of low temperature plasmas used for many technological applications

theoretical calculations of cross sections are challenging. Since the 1960s
researchers have attempted to solve the inverse swarm problem of obtaining
cross sections from swarm data; but the solutions are not necessarily unique.
To address this issues, we examine the use of deep learning models which are
trained using the previous determinations of elastic momentum transfer,
ionization and excitation cross sections for different gases available on the
LXCat website and their corresponding swarm parameters calculated using the
BOLSIG+ solver for the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation for

is no study exploring the use of CNN and DenseNet for the inverse swarm
problem. We test the validity of predictions by all these trained networks for
a broad range of gas species and we deduce that DenseNet effectively extracts
both long and short term features from the swarm data and hence, it predicts
cross sections with significantly higher accuracy compared to ANN. Further, we
apply Monte Carlo dropout as Bayesian approximation to estimate the probability

research topic. However, most existing methods are non-real-time, which may
fall short in intelligent systems. Although a few real-time text methods are
proposed, the detection accuracy is far behind non-real-time methods. To
improve the detection accuracy and speed simultaneously, we propose a novel
fast and accurate text detection framework, namely CM-Net, which is constructed
based on a new text representation method and a multi-perspective feature (MPF)
module. The former can fit arbitrary-shaped text contours by concentric mask
(CM) in an efficient and robust way. The latter encourages the network to learn
more CM-related discriminative features from multiple perspectives and brings
no extra computational cost. Benefiting the advantages of CM and MPF, the
proposed CM-Net only needs to predict one CM of the text instance to rebuild
the text contour and achieves the best balance between detection accuracy and
speed compared with previous works. Moreover, to ensure that multi-perspective
features are effectively learned, the multi-factor constraints loss is
proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed CM is efficient and
robust to fit arbitrary-shaped text instances, and also validate the
effectiveness of MPF and constraints loss for discriminative text features
recognition. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed CM-Net is
superior to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) real-time text detection methods

the sensitivity where the quantum noise of the meter is significant or even
dominant. In particular, the sensitivity of the best optomechanical devices has
reached the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which directly follows from the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation and corresponds to balancing the measurement
imprecision and the perturbation of the probe by the quantum back action of the
meter. The SQL is not truly fundamental and several methods for its overcoming
have been proposed and demonstrated. At the same time, two quantum sensitivity
constraints which are more fundamental are known. The first limit arises from
the finiteness of the probing strength (in the case of optical interferometers
- of the circulating optical power) and is known as the Energetic Quantum Limit
or, in a more general context, as the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound (QCRB). The
second limit arises from the dissipative dynamics of the probe, which prevents
full efficacy of the quantum back action evasion techniques developed for
overcoming the SQL. No particular name has been assigned to this limit; we
propose the term Dissipative Quantum Limit (DQL) for it. Here we develop a
unified theory of these two fundamental limits by deriving the general
sensitivity constraint from which they follow as particular cases. Our analysis
reveals a phase transition occurring at the boundary between the QCRB-dominated
and the DQL regimes, manifested by the discontinuous derivatives of the optimal
spectral densities of the meter field quantum noise. This leads to the
counter-intuitive (but favorable) finding that quantum-limited sensitivity can
be achieved with certain lossy meter systems. Finally, we show that the DQL
originates from the non-autocommutativity of the internal thermal noise of the
probe and that it can be overcome in non-stationary measurements.

exploiting consumption patterns of past load demand. However, such techniques
cannot assess intrinsic uncertainties in load demand, and cannot capture
dynamic changes in consumption patterns. To address these problems, this paper
presents a method for probabilistic load forecasting based on the adaptive

Ants lay a volatile pheromone on edges as they traverse them. At each vertex,
the next edge to traverse is chosen using a decision rule based on the current
pheromone level. There is a bidirectional flow of ants around the network. In a
field study, Chandrasekhar et al. (2021) observed that trail networks
approximately minimize the number of vertices, solving a variant of the popular
shortest path problem without any central control and with minimal
computational resources. We propose a biologically plausible model, based on a
variant of reinforced random walk on a graph, that explains this observation,
and suggests surprising algorithms for the shortest path problem and its
variants. Through simulations and analysis, we show that when the rate of flow
of ants does not change, the dynamics of our model converges to the path with
the minimum number of vertices, explaining the field observations. The dynamics
converges to the shortest path when the rate of flow increases with time,
showing that an ant colony can solve the shortest path problem just by varying
the flow rate. We also show that to guarantee convergence to the shortest path,
bidirectional flow and a decision rule dividing the flow in proportion to the
pheromone level are necessary, but convergence to approximately short paths is
possible with other decision rules.

(condensational) growth in particulate systems such as atmospheric clouds. It
focuses on the Eulerian modeling approach, in which the evolution of the
particle size spectrum is carried out using a fixed-bin discretization
associated with inherent numerical diffusion. Focus is on the applications of
MPDATA numerical schemes (variants explored include: infinite-gauge,
non-oscillatory, third-order-terms and recursive antidiffusive correction).
Methodology for handling coordinate transformations associated with both
particle size distribution variable choice and numerical grid layout are
expounded. Analysis of the performance of the scheme is performed using: (i) an
analytically solvable box-model test case, and (ii) the single-column ""KiD""
test case in which the size-spectral advection due to condensation is solved
simultaneously with the spatial advection in the vertical physical coordinate,
and in which the supersaturation evolution is coupled with the droplet growth
through water mass budget. The single-column problem involves numerical
solution of a two-dimensional advection problem (spectral and spatial
dimensions). The box-model simulations demonstrate that, for the problem
considered, even a tenfold decrease of the spurious numerical spectral
broadening can be obtained by a proper choice of the MPDATA variant
(maintaining the same spatial and temporal resolution), yet at an increased
computational cost. Analyses using the single-column test case reveal that the
width of the droplet size spectrum is affected by numerical diffusion pertinent
to both spatial and spectral advection. Application of even a single corrective
iteration of MPDATA robustly decreases the relative dispersion of the droplet
spectrum, roughly by a factor of two at the levels of maximal liquid water
content.

identified recently as an appealing candidate system for realizing chiral
$p$-wave topological superconductivity [Nat. Phys. 15, 796 (2019)]. We first
show that our phenomenological model can capture the two main features of the
electronic band structures obtained from first-principles calculations, namely,
the giant Rashba splitting and type-II van Hove singularity. Next, when the
$s$-wave superconducting property of the parent Pb system is explicitly
considered, we find the alloyed system can be tuned into a chiral topological
superconductor with Chern number $\mathcal{C} = -2$, resulting from the
synergistic effect of a sufficiently strong Zeeman field and the inherently
large Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The nontrivial topology with $\mathcal{C} =
-2$ is further shown to be detectable as two chiral Majorana edge modes
propagating along the same direction of the system with proper boundaries. We
finally discuss the physically realistic conditions to establish the predicted
topological superconductivity and observe the corresponding Majorana edge
modes, including the influence of the superconducting gap, Land\'{e}
$g$-factor, and critical magnetic field. The present study provides useful
guides in searching for effective $p$-wave superconductivity and Majorana
fermions in two-dimensional or related interfacial systems.

high-mass star-forming regions. We aim to increase the number of known radio
jets in high-mass star forming regions by searching for radio jet candidates at
radio continuum wavelengths. We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA) to observe 18 high-mass star-forming regions in the C band (6 cm, ~1.0
arcsec resolution) and K band (1.3 cm, ~0.3 arcsec resolution). We have
searched for radio jet candidates by studying the association of radio
continuum sources with shock activity signposts. We have identified 7 as the
most probable radio jets. The radio luminosity of the radio jet candidates is
correlated with the bolometric luminosity and the outflow momentum rate. About
7-36% of the radio jet candidates are associated with non-thermal emission. The
radio jet candidates associated with 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser emission are
preferentially thermal winds and jets, while a considerable fraction of radio
jet candidates associated with H2O masers show non-thermal emission, likely due
to strong shocks. Our sample of 18 regions is divided in 8 less evolved,
infrared-dark regions and 10 more evolved, infrared-bright regions. We have
found that ~71% of the identified radio jet candidates are located in the more
evolved regions. Similarly, 25% of the less evolved regions harbor one of the
most probable radio jets, while up to 50% of the more evolved regions contain
one of these radio jet candidates. This suggests that the detection of radio
jets in high-mass star forming regions is larger in slightly more evolved
regions.

an isolated piece of cortex can produce SOs, the brain-wide propagation of
these oscillations are thought to be mediated by the long-range axonal
connections. We address the mechanism of how SOs emerge and recruit large parts
of the brain using a whole-brain model constructed from empirical connectivity
data in which SOs are induced independently in each brain area by a local
adaptation mechanism. Using an evolutionary optimization approach, good fits to
human resting-state fMRI data and sleep EEG data are found at values of the
adaptation strength close to a bifurcation where the model produces a balance
between local and global SOs with realistic spatiotemporal statistics. Local
oscillations are more frequent, last shorter, and have a lower amplitude.
Global oscillations spread as waves of silence across the brain, traveling from
anterior to posterior regions. These traveling waves are caused by
heterogeneities in the brain network in which the connection strengths between
brain areas determine which areas transition to a down-state first, and thus
initiate traveling waves across the cortex. Our results demonstrate the utility
of whole-brain models for explaining the origin of large-scale cortical
oscillations and how they are shaped by the connectome.

of various new trial designs and analysis methods in the fields of personalized
medicine and targeted therapies. In this paper, subpopulations are defined in
terms of an accumulation of disjoint population subsets and will therefore be
called composite populations. The proposed trial design is applicable to any
set of composite populations, considering normally distributed endpoints and
random baseline covariates. Treatment effects for composite populations are
tested by combining $p$-values, calculated on the subset levels, using the
inverse normal combination function to generate test statistics for those
composite populations. The family-wise type I error rate for simultaneous
testing is controlled in the strong sense by the application of the closed
testing procedure. Critical values for intersection hypothesis tests are
derived using multivariate normal distributions, reflecting the joint
distribution of composite population test statistics under the null hypothesis.
For sample size calculation and sample size re-calculation multivariate normal
distributions are derived which describe the joint distribution of composite
population test statistics under an assumed alternative hypothesis. Simulations
demonstrate the strong control of the family-wise type I error rate in fixed
designs and re-calculation designs with blinded sample size re-calculation. The
target power after sample size re-calculation is typically met or close to
being met.

the points reflect only a sparse set of the underlying 3D geometry. Previous
works often convert point cloud into regular grids (e.g. voxels or bird-eye
view images), and resort to grid-based convolutions for scene understanding. In
this work, we introduce RfD-Net that jointly detects and reconstructs dense
object surfaces directly from raw point clouds. Instead of representing scenes
with regular grids, our method leverages the sparsity of point cloud data and
focuses on predicting shapes that are recognized with high objectness. With
this design, we decouple the instance reconstruction into global object
localization and local shape prediction. It not only eases the difficulty of
learning 2-D manifold surfaces from sparse 3D space, the point clouds in each
object proposal convey shape details that support implicit function learning to
reconstruct any high-resolution surfaces. Our experiments indicate that
instance detection and reconstruction present complementary effects, where the
shape prediction head shows consistent effects on improving object detection
with modern 3D proposal network backbones. The qualitative and quantitative
evaluations further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-arts and improves over 11 of mesh IoU in object reconstruction.

Universe, in particular to study the star formation rate up to very high
redshift ($z \sim 9$). Since LGRBs are produced by only a small fraction of
massive stars, it is paramount to have a good understanding of their underlying
intrinsic population in order to use them as cosmological probes without
introducing any unwanted bias. The goal of this work is to constrain and
characterise this intrinsic population. We developed a Monte Carlo model where
each burst is described by its redshift and its properties at the peak of the
lightcurve. We derived the best fit parameters by comparing our synthetic
populations to carefully selected observational constraints based on the
CGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT samples with appropriate flux thresholds.
We explored different scenarios in terms of cosmic evolution of the luminosity
function and/or of the redshift distribution as well as including or not the
presence of intrinsic spectral-energetics (Ep-L) correlations. We find that the
existence of an intrinsic Ep-L correlation is preferred but with a shallower
slope than observed($\alpha_A \sim 0.3$) and a larger scatter ($\sim 0.4$ dex).
We find a strong degeneracy between the cosmic evolution of the luminosity and
of the LGRB rate, and show that a sample both larger and deeper than SHOALS by
a factor of three is needed to lift this degeneracy. The observed We conclude
that Ep-L correlation cannot be explained only by selection effects although
these do play a role in shaping the observed relation. The degeneracy between
cosmic evolution of the luminosity function and of the redshift distribution of
LGRBs should be included in the uncertainties of star formation rate estimates;
these amount to a factor of 10 at $z=6$ and up to a factor of 50 at $z=9$.

the limited channel feedback scheme by proposing a novel cascaded codebook and
an adaptive bit partitioning strategy. The RIS segments the channel between the
BS and mobile station into two sub-channels, each with line-of-sight (LoS) and
non-LoS (NLoS) paths. To quantize the path gains, the cascaded codebook is
proposed to be synthesized by two sub-codebooks whose codeword is cascaded by
LoS and NLoS components. This enables the proposed cascaded codebook to cater
the different distributions of LoS and NLoS path gains by flexibly using
different feedback bits to design the codeword structure. On the basis of the
proposed cascaded codebook, we derive an upper bound on ergodic rate loss with
maximum ratio transmission and show that the rate loss can be cut down by
optimizing the feedback bit allocation during codebook generation. To minimize
the upper bound, we propose a bit partitioning strategy that is adaptive to
diverse environment and system parameters. Extensive simulations are presented

production network is affected by a devastating but localized conflict. Using
unique transaction-level data on Ukrainian railway shipments around the start
of the 2014 Russia-Ukraine crisis, we uncover several novel indirect effects of
conflict on firms. First, we document substantial propagation effects on
interfirm trade--trade declines even between partners outside the conflict
areas if one of them had traded with those areas before the conflict events.
The magnitude of such second-degree effect of conflict is one-fifth of the
first-degree effect. Ignoring this propagation would lead to an underestimate
of the total impact of conflict on trade by about 67\%. Second, war induces
sudden changes in the production-network structure that influence firm
performance. Specifically, we find that firms that exogenously became more
central--after the conflict practically cut off certain regions from the rest
of Ukraine--received a relative boost to their revenues. Finally, in a
production-network model, we separately estimate the effects of the exogenous
firm removal and the subsequent endogenous network adjustment on firm revenue
distribution. For a median firm, network adjustment compensates for 80\% of the
network destruction a year after the conflict onset.

promising modulation scheme for high mobility wireless communications. To
enable efficient OTFS detection in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the DD domain
channels need to be acquired accurately. To achieve the low latency requirement
in future wireless communications, the time duration of the OTFS block should
be small, therefore fractional Doppler shifts have to be considered to avoid
significant modelling errors due to the assumption of integer Doppler shifts.
However, there lack investigations on the estimation of OTFS channels with
fractional Doppler shifts in the literature. In this work, we develop a high
performing channel estimator for OTFS with the bi-orthogonal waveform or the
rectangular waveform. Instead of estimating the DD domain channel directly, we
estimate the channel gains and (fractional) Doppler shifts that parameterize
the DD domain channel. The estimation is formulated as a structured signal
recovery problem with a Bayesian treatment. Based on a factor graph
representation of the problem, an efficient message passing algorithm is
developed to recover the structured sparse signal (thereby the OTFS channel).
The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation is developed and the
effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulations.

class). In the literature, many different approaches have been proposed, such
as under- or oversampling, to counter class imbalance. In the current work, we
introduce a novel method, which addresses the issues of class imbalance. To
this end, we first transfer the binary classification task to an equivalent
regression task. Subsequently, we generate a set of negative and positive
target labels, such that the corresponding regression task becomes balanced,
with respect to the redefined target label set. We evaluate our approach on a
number of publicly available data sets in combination with Support Vector
Machines. Moreover, we compare our proposed method to one of the most popular
oversampling techniques (SMOTE). Based on the detailed discussion of the
presented outcomes of our experimental evaluation, we provide promising ideas

phase-resolved light-curves and spectra assuming that curvature radiation
operates from inside the magnetosphere of a rotating vacuum magnet. Radio
emission arises from the polar caps whereas gamma-ray energy emanates from the
slot gaps in the vicinity of the separatrix between closed and open field
lines. Methods. By integrating particle trajectories within the slot gaps, we
compute energy dependent photon sky maps in the radio band (MHz-GHz) and in the
gamma-ray band (MeV/GeV) for mono-energetic distribution functions of leptons.
Results. We obtained many details of the energy dependent light curves and

Choosing Lorentz factors of {\gamma} = 30 for radio emitting particles and
{\gamma} = 10^7 for gamma-ray emitting particles, we found realistic spectra

field. This ambient field is known to drive magneto-rotational turbulence in
the disk bulk but is also responsible for the launching of magnetized outflows
at the origin of astrophysical jets. The vertical structure and long-term
(secular) evolution of such a system lack quantitative predictions. It is
nevertheless this secular evolution that is proposed to explain time
variability in many accreting systems such as X-ray binaries. We compute and
analyze global 3D ideal-MHD simulations of an accretion disk threaded by a
large-scale magnetic field. We evaluate the role of the turbulent terms in the
equilibrium of the system. We then compute the transport of mass, angular
momentum, and magnetic fields in the disk to characterize its secular
evolution. We perform a parameter survey to characterize the influence of disk
properties on secular transport.
  We find that weakly magnetized disks drive jets that carry away a small
fraction of the disk angular momentum. The mass-weighted accretion speed
remains subsonic although, there is always an upper turbulent atmospheric
region where transonic accretion takes place. We show that a strongly
magnetized version of the magneto-rotational instability drives this
turbulence. The disk structure is drastically different from the conventional
hydrostatic picture. The magnetic field is always dragged inwards in the disk,
at a velocity that increases with the disk magnetization. Beyond a threshold on
the latter, the disk undergoes a profound radial readjustment. It leads to the
formation of an inner accretion-ejection region with a supersonic mass-weighted
accretion speed and where the magnetic field distribution becomes steady, near
equipartition with the thermal pressure. This inner structure shares many
properties with the Jet Emitting Disk model described by Ferreira (1997).

truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to study many-body effects and quantum
fluctuations on the formation of a discrete time crystal (DTC) in a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) bouncing resonantly on an atom mirror, driven at
period T. Our theoretical approach avoids the restrictions both of mean-field
theory, where all bosons are assumed to remain in a single mode, and of
time-dependent Bogoliubov theory, which assumes boson depletion from the
condensate mode is small. For realistic initial conditions corresponding to a
harmonic trap condensate mode function, our TWA calculations performed for
period-doubling agree broadly with recent mean-field calculations for times out
to at least 2000 T, except at interaction strengths very close to the threshold
value for DTC formation where the position probability density differs
significantly from that determined from mean-field theory. For typical
attractive interaction strengths above the threshold value for DTC formation
and for the chosen trap and driving parameters, the TWA calculations indicate a
quantum depletion due to quantum many-body fluctuations of less than about two
atoms out of 600 atoms at times corresponding to 2000 T, in agreement with
time-dependent Bogoliubov theory calculations. On the other hand, for
interaction strengths very close to the threshold value for DTC formation, the
TWA calculations predict a large quantum depletion - as high as about 260 atoms
out of 600. We also show that the mean energy of the DTC does not increase
significantly for times out to at least 2000 mirror oscillations, so TWA theory
predicts that thermalisation is absent. Finally, we find that the dynamical
behaviour is similar for attractive or repulsive boson-boson interactions, and
that a stable DTC based on repulsive interactions can be created.

especially when the di-lepton invariant mass of the final state is close to the
EWIMP threshold, namely twice the EWIMP mass. In such a mass region, however,
we have to carefully take non-perturbative effects into account, because the
EWIMPs become non-relativistic and the prediction may be significantly affected
by e.g., bound states of the EWIMPs caused by the electroweak interaction. We
study such non-perturbative effects using the non-relativistic effective field

sufficiently many messages, e.g., at least $t+1$; (3) the number $n$ of
processes in the system is a parameter, as well as the number $t$ of faults;
and (4) the parameters are restricted by a resilience condition, e.g., $n >
3t$. Traditionally, these algorithms were implemented in distributed systems
with up to ten participating processes. Nowadays, they are implemented in
distributed systems that involve hundreds or thousands of processes. To make
sure that these algorithms are still correct for that scale, it is imperative
to verify them for all possible values of the parameters.

classified into two types, each favoring the narrowing of either the conduction
or valence bands on average, and obtain the evolution of the bands as a
function of the interlayer sliding vectors and electric fields. Finite valley
Chern numbers $\pm 1$ are found in a wide range of parameter space when the
moire bands are isolated through gaps, while the local density of states
associated to the flat bands are weakly affected by the BN substrate invariably
concentrating around the AA-stacked regions of tBG. We illustrate the impact of
the BN substrate for a particularly pronounced electron-hole asymmetric band
structure by calculating the optical conductivities of twisted bilayer graphene
near the magic angle as a function of carrier density. The band structures
corresponding to other $N$-multiple commensurate moire period ratios indicate
it is possible to achieve narrow width $W \lesssim 30$ meV isolated folded band

spectrometers, telescopes, augmented and virtual reality headsets or
lithography platforms. Reflective optics provide unparalleled spectral
performance and can be used to reduce overall volume and weight. So far, most
reflective designs have focused on two or three reflections, while
four-reflection freeform designs can deliver a higher light throughput (faster
F-number) as well as a larger field-of-view (FOV). However, advanced optical
design strategies for four-reflection freeform systems have been rarely
reported in literature. This is due to the increased complexity in solution
space but also the fact that additional mirrors hinder a cost-effective
realization (manufacture, alignment, etc.).
  Recently, we have proposed a novel design method to directly calculate the
freeform surface coefficients while merely knowing the mirror positions and
tilts. Consequently, this method allows laymen with basic optical design
knowledge to calculate 'first time right' freeform imaging systems in a matter
of minutes. This contrasts with most common freeform design processes, which
requires considerable experience, intuition or guesswork. Firstly, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a four-mirror
high-throughput telescope with 250mm-focal-length, F/2.5 and a wide rectangular
FOV of 8.5{\deg} x 25.5{\deg}. In a subsequent step, we propose an effective
three-mirror but four-reflection imaging system, which consists of two freeform
mirrors and one double-reflection spherical mirror. Compared with common
three-mirror and three-reflection imagers, our novel multi-reflection system
shows unprecedented possibilities for an economic implementation while

only authorized subsets, specified by an access structure, can reconstruct the

However, their scheme assumes semi-honest parties and supports only restricted
access structures. We address these shortcomings by constructing an access
structure hiding verifiable secret sharing scheme that supports all monotone
access structures. It is the first secret sharing scheme to support cheater
identification and share verifiability in malicious-majority settings. The
verification procedure of our scheme incurs no communication overhead. As the
building blocks of our scheme, we introduce and construct: (i) a set-system
with $> \exp\left(c\frac{2(\log h)^2}{(\log\log

where $m$ is a non-prime-power. The size of each set in $\mathcal{H}$ is
divisible by $m$ but the sizes of their pairwise intersections are not, unless
one set is a subset of another, (ii) a new variant of the learning with errors
(LWE) problem, called PRIM-LWE, wherein the secret matrix is sampled such that
its determinant is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_q^*$, where $q$ is the LWE
modulus. The security of our scheme relies on the hardness of the LWE problem,

q^{\varrho + 0.5} + \sqrt{q} + \mathrm{\Theta}(h)),$$ where $\varrho \leq 1$ is
a constant and $\ell$ is the total number of parties. We also provide

through different connected/automated vehicle technologies. This includes
optimal vehicle routing, eco-arrival/departure at intersections, platooning,
speed trajectory optimization, predictive driveline disengagement, predictive
gear shifting, and predictive powertrain accessory control. This survey shows
that the ability to shape vehicle speed trajectories collaboratively plays a
dominant role in reducing urban/suburban fuel consumption, while platooning
plays a dominant role in influencing the attainable fuel savings on the

aspects remain poorly understood. Here we define the time-varying efficiency of
stock markets by calculating the permutation entropy within sliding
time-windows of log-returns of stock market indices. We show that major world
stock markets can be hierarchically classified into several groups that display
similar long-term efficiency profiles. However, we also show that efficiency
ranks and clusters of markets with similar trends are only stable for a few
months at a time. We thus propose a network representation of stock markets
that aggregates their short-term efficiency patterns into a global and coherent

having a modular structure that consists of two distinct groups of stock

phenomenon that can drive its operation at a high level of informational
efficiency, but also places the entire system under risk of failure.

5\times10^{10}$), $S$ is almost independent of $Ra$; In the newly identified
regime II ($5\times10^{10} \lesssim Ra \lesssim 10^{13}$), $S$ first increases
with increasing $Ra$ (regime ${\rm{II}}_a$), reaches its maximum and then
decreases again (regime ${\rm{II}}_b$); In regime III ($Ra\gtrsim10^{13}$), $S$
again becomes only weakly dependent on $Ra$, being slightly smaller than in
regime I. The transitions between diffeereent regimes are discussd. In the
three different regimes, significantly different flow organizations are

horizontal velocity is close to the top and bottom walls; However, in regime
${\rm{II}}_b$ and regime III, banded zonal flow structures develop and the
maximal horizontal velocity now is in the bulk region.
  The different flow organizations in the three regimes are also reflected in
the scaling exponents in the effective power law scalings $Nu\sim Ra^\beta$ and
$Re\sim Ra^\gamma$. In regime I, the fitted scaling exponents
($\beta\approx0.26$ and $\gamma\approx0.51$) are in excellent agreement with

gains of a matrix may be defined by its singular values, there is no widely
accepted definition for its phases. In this work, we consider sectorial
matrices, whose numerical ranges do not contain the origin, and adopt the
canonical angles of such matrices as their phases. Similarly to the rank of a
matrix defined to be the number of its nonzero singular values, we define the
phase-rank of a sectorial matrix as the number of its nonzero phases. While a
low-rank approximation problem is associated with matrix arithmetic means, as a
natural parallel we formulate a low phase-rank approximation problem using
matrix geometric means to measure the approximation error. A characterization
of the solutions to the proposed problem is then obtained, when both the
objective matrix and the approximant are restricted to be positive-imaginary.
Moreover, the obtained solution has the same flavor as the Schmidt-Mirsky
theorem on low-rank approximation problems. In addition, we provide an
alternative formulation of the low phase-rank approximation problem using
geodesic distances between sectorial matrices. The two formulations give rise
to the exact same set of solutions when the involved matrices are additionally

long-range nature of gravity means that in reality large numbers of stars can
behave collectively. In stable systems this collective behaviour (i) amplifies
the noisy fluctuations in the system's gravitational potential, effectively
'dressing' the two-body (star-star) encounters, and (ii) allows the system to
support large-scale density waves (a.k.a. normal modes) which decay through
resonant wave-star interactions. If the relaxation of the system is dominated
by effect (i) then it is described by the Balescu-Lenard (BL) kinetic theory.
Meanwhile if (ii) dominates, one must describe relaxation using quasilinear
(QL) theory, though in the stellar-dynamical context the full set of QL
equations has never been presented. Moreover, in some systems like open
clusters and galactic disks, both (i) and (ii) might be important. Here we
present for the first time the equations of a unified kinetic theory of stellar
systems in angle-action variables that accounts for both effects (i) and (ii)
simultaneously. We derive the equations in a heuristic, physically-motivated
fashion and work in the simplest possible regime by accounting only for very
weakly damped waves. This unified theory is effectively a superposition of BL
and QL theories, both of which are recovered in appropriate limits. The theory
is a first step towards a comprehensive description of those stellar systems
for which neither the QL or BL theory will suffice.

prove that the initial perturbation or the boundary of the compact support of

down, and the degenerate diffusion causes the loss of regularity for the

to traditional Byzantine agreement protocols, there is no global knowledge of

connectivity measures whose computation in the frequency domain often relies on
the evaluation of the cross-power spectrum of the neural time-series estimated
by solving the MEG inverse problem. Recent studies have focused on the optimal
determination of the cross-power spectrum in the framework of regularization
theory for ill-posed inverse problems, providing indications that, rather
surprisingly, the regularization process that leads to the optimal estimate of
the neural activity does not lead to the optimal estimate of the corresponding
functional connectivity. Along these lines, the present paper utilizes
synthetic time series simulating the neural activity recorded by an MEG device
to show that the regularization of the cross-power spectrum is significantly
correlated with the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements and that, as a
consequence, this regularization correspondingly depends on the spectral
complexity of the neural activity.

fast and high-quality image reconstruction and is often based on sparse-view
(few) projections. The conventional filtered back projection (FBP) method is
fast but it produces low-quality images dominated by noise and artifacts in
sparse-view CT. Iterative methods with, e.g., total variation regularizers can
circumvent that but they are computationally expensive, as the computational
load proportionally increases with the number of spectral channels. Instead, we
propose an approach for fast reconstruction of sparse-view spectral CT data
using a U-Net convolutional neural network architecture with multi-channel
input and output. The network is trained to output high-quality CT images from
FBP input image reconstructions. Our method is fast at run-time and because the
internal convolutions are shared between the channels, the computational load
increases only at the first and last layers, making it an efficient approach to
process spectral data with a large number of channels. We have validated our
approach using real CT scans. Our results show qualitatively and quantitatively
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art iterative methods.
Furthermore, the results indicate that the network can exploit the coupling of
the channels to enhance the overall quality and robustness.

filling this gap in the literature. Our first result shows that

sufficient conditions for the classical Edgeworth expansion. It turns out that
there are two possible obstructions for the validity of the Edgeworth expansion

partial sums modulo some $h\in \bbN$ and the uniform distribution could fail to
be $o(\sigma_N^{1-r})$, where $\sigma_N$ is the standard deviation of the

this closeness is unstable, in the sense that it could be destroyed by removing
finitely many terms. In the first case, the expansion of order $r$ fails. In
the second case it may or may not hold depending on the behavior of the

these transformations, as well as closely matching upper bounds. It is shown
that making an $n$-state GWA traversing $k$-ary graphs halt on every input

by first constructing an affinity matrix between data points and then applying
spectral clustering to this affinity. Most of the research into these methods
focuses on the first step of generating the affinity, which often exploits the
self-expressive property of linear subspaces, with little consideration
typically given to the spectral clustering step that produces the final
clustering. Moreover, existing methods often obtain the final affinity that is
used in the spectral clustering step by applying ad-hoc or arbitrarily chosen
postprocessing steps to the affinity generated by a self-expressive clustering
formulation, which can have a significant impact on the overall clustering
performance. In this work, we unify these two steps by learning both a
self-expressive representation of the data and an affinity matrix that is
well-normalized for spectral clustering. In our proposed models, we constrain
the affinity matrix to be doubly stochastic, which results in a principled
method for affinity matrix normalization while also exploiting known benefits
of doubly stochastic normalization in spectral clustering. We develop a general
framework and derive two models: one that jointly learns the self-expressive
representation along with the doubly stochastic affinity, and one that
sequentially solves for one then the other. Furthermore, we leverage sparsity
in the problem to develop a fast active-set method for the sequential solver

  We formally introduced infinite PDBs in (Grohe and Lindner, PODS 2019) with a

with the measurability of events and queries and ultimately with the question
whether queries have a well-defined semantics.
  We argue that finite point processes are an appropriate model from

gratings with constant bar spacing. However, new technology development brings
chirped gratings in reach. Using chirped gratings where the grating bar spacing
varies over a grating allows us to fill the aperture with larger gratings
because the chirp can compensate for some aberrations caused by the deviation
of large flat gratings from the Rowland torus. This reduces the area blocked by
grating support structures. Using larger gratings also carries potential cost
savings. We use ray-tracing to study an XGS design with chirped grating and
find that using chirped gratings of $80 * 160$ mm size allows us to reduce the

increasing the effective area by 25% and keeping the resolving power constant.
Bending those gratings to maintain a constant blaze angle over the entire

outer core suggest the presence of a stably-stratified region known as the
F-layer. This raises an important question: how can light elements that drive
the geodynamo pass through the stably-stratified layer without disturbing it?
We consider the F-layer as a slurry containing solid particles dispersed within
the liquid iron alloy that snow under gravity towards the inner core. We
present a regime diagram showing how the dynamics of the slurry F-layer change
upon varying the key parameters: P\'eclet number ($Pe$), the ratio between
advection and chemical diffusion; Stefan number ($St$), the ratio between
sensible and latent heat; and Lewis number ($Le$), the ratio between thermal
and chemical diffusivity. We obtain four regimes corresponding to stable,
partially stable, unstable and no slurries. No slurry is found when the heat
flow at the base of the layer exceeds the heat flow at the top, while a
stably-stratified slurry arises when advection overcomes thermal diffusion ($Pe
\gtrsim Le$) that exists over a wide range of parameters relevant to the
Earth's core. Our results estimate that a stably-stratified F-layer gives a
maximum inner-core boundary (ICB) body wave density jump of $\Delta
\rho_\textrm{bod} \leq 534 \ \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ which is compatible
with the lower end of the seismic observations where $280 \leq \Delta
\rho_\textrm{bod} \leq 1,100 \ \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ is reported in the
literature. With high thermal conductivity the model predicts an inner core age
between $0.6$ and $1.2 \ \mathrm{Ga}$, which is consistent with other core
evolution models. Our results suggest that a slurry model with high core
conductivity predicts geophysical properties of the F-layer and core that are
consistent with independent seismic and geodynamic calculations.

iterative estimation process when finding maximum likelihood estimates. Firth's
correction (FC) was proposed as a solution, providing estimates also in
presence of separation. In this paper we evaluate whether ridge regression (RR)
could be considered instead, specifically, if it could reduce the mean squared
error (MSE) of coefficient estimates in comparison to FC. In RR the tuning
parameter determining the penalty strength is usually obtained by minimizing
some measure of the out-of-sample prediction error or information criterion.
However, in presence of separation tuning these measures can yield an optimized
value of zero (no shrinkage), and hence cannot provide a universal solution. We
derive a new bootstrap based tuning criterion $B$ that always leads to
shrinkage. Moreover, we demonstrate how valid inference can be obtained by
combining resampled profile penalized likelihood functions. Our approach is
illustrated in an example from oncology and its performance is compared to FC
in a simulation study. Our simulations showed that in analyses of small and
sparse datasets and with many correlated covariates $B$-tuned RR can yield
coefficient estimates with MSE smaller than FC and confidence intervals that
approximately achieve nominal coverage probabilities.

profile that will be observed with future high-resolution X-ray spectrographs
to retrieve the characteristics of the stellar winds generating them. We
considered a grid of 780 O-type binaries and computed, for each of them, the
wind velocity distribution of each star, taking the impact of the radiation
pressure and gravity force of the companion star into account. We then computed
the characteristics of the wind shock region and followed the emitted photons
towards the observer to compute their absorption. Finally, the Fe K line
profiles near 6.7keV were constructed from the distribution of the photons as a
function of the radial velocities of their emitting region. LIFELINE can be
used to compare the theoretical line profiles to the observed ones or to
compute theoretical profiles for a new binary system. We highlight the results
for three systems. While the line profiles created in adiabatic wind collision
regions are quite simple, the line profiles arising from regions in the
radiative regime, as found in short-period binaries, are more sophisticated
notably because of the Coriolis effect on the shape of the shock. The predicted
differences in line morphology between systems with different wind properties

these two challenges, in this work, we introduce a lightweight optimization
process at the testing phase on top of any existing DL-based denoisers to
generate multiple image candidates with different noise-resolution tradeoffs
suitable for different clinical tasks in real-time. Consequently, our method
allows the users to interact with the denoiser to efficiently review various
image candidates and quickly pick up the desired one, and thereby was termed as
deep interactive denoiser (DID). Experimental results demonstrated that DID can
deliver multiple image candidates with different noise-resolution tradeoffs,
and shows great generalizability regarding various network architectures, as
well as training and testing datasets with various noise levels.

  Endogenous Uncertainty",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In robust optimization one seeks to make a decision under uncertainty, where
the goal is to find the solution with the best worst-case performance. The set
of possible realizations of the uncertain data is described by a so-called
uncertainty set. In many scenarios, a decision maker may influence the
uncertainty regime she is facing, for example, by investing in market research,
or in machines which work with higher precision. Recently, this situation was
addressed in the literature by introducing decision dependent uncertainty sets
(endogenous uncertainty), i.e., uncertainty sets whose structure depends on
(typically discrete) decision variables. In this way, one can model the
trade-off between reducing the cost of robustness versus the cost of the
investment necessary for influencing the uncertainty. However, there is another
trade-off to be made here. With different uncertainty regimes, not only do the
worst-case optimal solutions vary, but also other aspects of that solutions
such as max-regret, best-case performance or predictability of the performance.
A decision maker may still be interested in having a performance guarantee, but
at the same time be willing to forgo superior worst-case performance if those
other aspects can be enhanced by switching to a suitable uncertainty regime. We
introduce the notion of uncertainty preference in order to capture such
stances. We present three ways to formalize uncertainty preferences and study
the resulting mathematical models. The goal is to have
reformulations/approximations of these models which can be solved with standard
methods. The workhorse is mixed-integer linear and conic optimization. We apply
our framework to the uncertain shortest path problem and conduct numerical
experiments for the resulting models. We can demonstrate that our models can be
handled very well by standard mixed-integer linear solvers.

Repeater protocols that encode information in single- or multi-photon states
are limited by transmission losses and the cost of implementing entangling
gates or Bell measurements. In this work, we consider implementing a quantum
repeater protocol using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits. These qubits
are natural elements for quantum repeater protocols, because they allow for
deterministic Gaussian entangling operations and Bell measurements, which can
be implemented at room temperature. The GKP encoding is also capable of
correcting small displacement errors. At the cost of additional Gaussian noise,
photon loss can be converted into a random displacement error channel by
applying a phase-insensitive amplifier. Here we show that a similar conversion
can be achieved in two-way repeater protocols by using phase-sensitive
amplification applied in the post-processing of the measurement data, resulting
in less overall Gaussian noise per (sufficiently short) repeater segment. We
also investigate concatenating the GKP code with higher level qubit codes while
leveraging analog syndrome data, post-selection, and path-selection techniques
to boost the rate of communication. We compute the secure key rates and find
that GKP repeaters can achieve a comparative performance relative to methods
based on photonic qubits while using orders-of-magnitude fewer qubits.

splitting is not of the Rashba-type. We instead propose that (1) the large
splitting of the metallic branches is a $m_j=\pm1/2$-$m_j=\pm3/2$ splitting and
(2) the spin texture observed for the metallic branches may only occur because
the almost unaltered strong covalent bonds retained by Bi(111) surface atoms
cannot afford magnetic polarization. We emphasize that degeneracy at the
$M$-point of the SBZ of Bi(111) -- implied by the translational symmetry of the

centers. We show that the magnetic-moment discontinuity at $M$ does not exist,
which also explains why the measured spin-polarization of the metallic branches
vanishes near $M$. We induce the Rashba effect on the band structure of Bi(111)
via different structural/electronic perturbations to reveal the actual lifting

System and in star forming system whose origin is still unclear. Chemical
reactions in the gas phase are one of the possible processes that could modify
the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio. We aim at investigating if and how the passage of
a shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of
nitrogen isotopes. The ideal place for such a study is the L1157 outflow, where
several shocked clumps are present. We present the first measurement of the
$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in the two shocked clumps, B1 and B0, of the
protostellar outflow L1157, derived from the interferomteric maps of the
H$^{13}$CN(1-0) and the HC$^{15}$N(1-0) lines. In B1, we find that the
H$^{13}$CN(1-0) and HC$^{15}$N(1-0) emission traces the front of the clump,
with averaged column density of $N$(H$^{13}$CN) $\sim$ 7$\times$10$^{12}$
cm$^{-2}$ and $N$(HC$^{15}$N) $\sim$ 2$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this
region the ratio H$^{13}$CN(1-0)/HC$^{15}$N(1-0) is quite uniform with an
average value of $\sim$ 5$\pm$1. The same average value is also measured in the
smaller clump B0e. Assuming the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 68, we obtain
$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N = 340$\pm$70, similar to those usually found in prestellar
cores and protostars. We analysed the prediction of a chemical shock model for
several shock conditions and we found that the nitrogen and carbon
fractionations do not vary much for the first period after the shock. The
observed H$^{13}$CN/HC$^{15}$N can be reproduced by a non-dissociative, C-type
shock with parameters in agreement with previous modelling of L1157-B1. Both
observations and chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not
affect the nitrogen isotopic ratio that remains similar to that measured in
lower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar envelopes.

the parity violation for the electroweak neutrino-electron interaction. Our

operator in the electroweak plasma allow us to significantly improve some
previous estimates of such effect in astrophysics. We estimate the rotary power
for EM waves propagating in a non-relativistic plasma in the intergalactic

We show that, in presence of a plasma, the EM wave birefringence effect in a

empty space considered earlier. These previous treatments of the birefringence
relied on the calculations of the refraction index for on-shell photons in

virtual charged leptons in Feynman diagrams. The possibility to observe

kinematic properties of an ejected companion provide an opportunity to closer
examination of the properties of an SN progenitor system. However, with the
number of observed objects not matching predictions by theory, the viability of
this mechanism is called into question. In this study, we first synthesize a
population of companion stars ejected by the aforementioned mechanism, taking
into account predicted ejection velocities, inferred population density in the
Galactic (Gal.) mass distribution and subsequent kinematics in the Gal.
potential. We then discuss the astrometric properties of this population. We
present $10^{6}$ individual ejection trajectories, numerically computed with a
newly developed, lightweight simulation framework. A peak in the density
distribution for close objects is expected in the direction of the Gal. center.
If the entire considered mass range is realized, the radial velocity
distribution should show a peak at 500\kms. If only close US\,708 analogues are

Below the first threshold, the system is disordered in large time: the rotation

behaviour of the system is to concentrate around a given rotation matrix. When
the intensity is between the two thresholds, both situations may occur. We then
study the mean-field limit of this model, as the number of particles tends to
infinity, which takes the form of a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation. We
describe the complete classification of the steady states of this equation,

were shown to perform better numerically than traditional methods such as the
basic kernel method and the boundary modified version from Tenreiro (2013). In
the present paper, we complement their study by introducing five new asymmetric
kernel c.d.f. estimators, namely the Gamma, inverse Gamma, lognormal, inverse
Gaussian and reciprocal inverse Gaussian kernel c.d.f. estimators. For these
five new estimators, we prove the asymptotic normality and we find asymptotic
expressions for the following quantities: bias, variance, mean squared error
and mean integrated squared error. A numerical study then compares the
performance of the five new c.d.f. estimators against traditional methods and
the Birnbaum-Saunders and Weibull kernel c.d.f. estimators from Mombeni et al.
(2019). By using the same experimental design, we show that the lognormal and
Birnbaum-Saunders kernel c.d.f. estimators perform the best overall, while the
other asymmetric kernel estimators are sometimes better but always at least
competitive against the boundary kernel method.

synthetic images of various astrophysical objects. In the case of complex
three-dimensional geometries, a Monte Carlo-based method that simulates photon
packages as they move through and interact with their environment is often
used. Previous studies have shown, in the regime of high optical depths, that
the required number of simulated photon packages strongly rises and estimated
fluxes may be severely underestimated. In this paper we identify two problems
that arise for Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations that hinder a proper
determination of flux: first, a mismatch between the probability and weight of
the path of a photon package and second, the necessity of simulating a wide
range of high scattering orders. Furthermore, we argue that the peel-off method
partly solves these problems, and we additionally propose an extended peel-off
method. Our proposed method improves several shortcomings of its basic variant
and relies on the utilization of precalculated sphere spectra. We then combine
both peel-off methods with the Split method and the Stretch method and
numerically evaluate their capabilities as opposed to the pure
Split$\,\&\,$Stretch method in an infinite plane-parallel slab setup. We find
that the peel-off method greatly enhances the performance of these simulations;
in particular, at a transverse optical depth of $\tau_{\rm max}=75$ our method
achieved a significantly lower error than previous methods while simultaneously
saving ${>}95\%$ computation time. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of
polarization and Mie-scattering in the extended peel-off method, and argue that
it may be necessary to equip future Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations

These two models have different initial stellar mass functions: Kroupa 1993
(D1-R7-IMF93) and Kroupa 2001 (D2-R7-IMF01); and different initial mass ratio
distributions: random paring (D1-R7-IMF93) and a power-law (D1-R7-IMF93). In
general, the mass ratio of a population of binaries increases over time due to
stellar evolution, which is less significant in D2-R7-IMF01. In D1-R7-IMF93,
primordial binaries with mass ratio $q \approx$ 0.2 are most common, and the
frequency linearly declines with increasing $q$ at all times. Dynamical
binaries of both models have higher eccentricities and larger semi-major axes
than primordial binaries. They are preferentially located in the inner part of
the star cluster. Secular evolution of binary orbital parameters does not
depend on the initial mass-ratio distribution, but is sensitive to the initial
binary distribution of the system. At t = 12 Gyr, the binary fraction decreases
radially outwards, and mass segregation is present. A color difference of 0.1
mag in $F330W-F814W$ and 0.2 mag in $NUV-y$ between the core and the outskirts
of both clusters is seen, which is a reflection of the binary radial
distribution and the mass segregation in the cluster. The complete set of data

is found to suddenly increase, by a factor $\simeq 5$, when the doping is
reduced below $p^{\star} = 0.23$, the critical doping for the onset of the

reduction of the carrier density $n$, consistent with a drop from $n = 1 + p$
above $p^{\star}$ to $n = p$ below $p^{\star}$, as previously inferred from
measurements of the Hall coefficient, resistivity and thermal conductivity.
When the doping is reduced below $p = 0.19$, a qualitative change is observed
whereby $S/T$ decreases as $T \to 0$, eventually to reach negative values at
$T=0$. In prior work on other cuprates, negative values of $S/T$ at $T \to 0$

charge-density-wave (CDW) order. We therefore identify $p_{\rm CDW} \simeq

reconstruction. The fact that $p_{\rm CDW}$ is well separated from $p^{\star}$
reveals that there is a doping range below $p^{\star}$ where the transport
signatures of the pseudogap phase are unaffected by CDW correlations, as

communications has achieved great success owing to the employment of deep
learning (DL). However, the existing work on DL based JSCC usually trains the
designed network to operate under a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime, without taking into account that the SNR level during the deployment
stage may differ from that during the training stage. A number of networks are
required to cover the scenario with a broad range of SNRs, which is
computational inefficiency (in the training stage) and requires large storage.
To overcome these drawbacks our paper proposes a novel method called Attention
DL based JSCC (ADJSCC) that can successfully operate with different SNR levels
during transmission. This design is inspired by the resource assignment
strategy in traditional JSCC, which dynamically adjusts the compression ratio
in source coding and the channel coding rate according to the channel SNR. This
is achieved by resorting to attention mechanisms because these are able to
allocate computing resources to more critical tasks. Instead of applying the
resource allocation strategy in traditional JSCC, the ADJSCC uses the
channel-wise soft attention to scaling features according to SNR conditions. We
compare the ADJSCC method with the state-of-the-art DL based JSCC method
through extensive experiments to demonstrate its adaptability, robustness and
versatility. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method takes less
storage and is more robust in the presence of channel mismatch.

two-dimensional compressed sensing problem is formulated by approximately
linearizing the channel as a product of an overcomplete dictionary with a
sparse vector, in which the Doppler effect caused by the high mobility channel
is considered. To solve the problem that the traditional compressed sensing
algorithms have too many iterations and are time consuming, we propose an
unfolded deep neural network (UDNN) as the fast solver, which is inspired by
the structure of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA). All the
parameters in UDNN (e.g. nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds,

hand-crafted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UDNN performs better
than ISTA for OFDM high mobility channel estimation, while maintaining
extremely fast computational speed.

for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of patients for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of
individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput
of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known
and studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on
unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only
objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the
case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of
this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently
repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a
computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR
tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of
false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests,
especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001
the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing
the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of
individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more
than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests
in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the
expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the proposed
procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case of diseases
like COVID-19.

instrument to complexify real-valued signals since the notion of phase arises
most naturally in the complex domain. The proposed nonlinear system phase,
serving as a counterpart of $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain, quantifies the passivity and
is highly related to the dissipativity. It also possesses a nice physical
interpretation which quantifies the tradeoff between the real energy and
reactive energy. A nonlinear small phase theorem is then established for
feedback stability analysis of semi-sectorial systems. Additionally, its
generalized version is proposed via the use of multipliers. These nonlinear
small phase theorems generalize a version of the classical passivity theorem
and a recently appeared linear time-invariant small phase theorem.

first-principles study on the electronic, linear, and nonlinear optical (NLO)
properties of atomically thin selenium and tellurium films within the
density-functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation plus
scissors correction using the band gaps from the relativistic hybrid
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional calculations. Interestingly, we find that
few-layer Se and Te possess large second-harmonic generation (SHG), linear
electro-optic effect, and bulk photovoltaic effect. In particular, trilayer
(TL) Te possesses large SHG coefficient, being more than 65 times larger than
that of GaN, a widely used NLO material. Bilayer (BL) Te has huge static SHG
coefficient, being more than 100 times larger than that of GaN. Furthermore,
monolayer (ML) Se possesses large SHG coefficient. Moreover, we predict that TL
Te exhibits strong bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), being greater than that of
GeS, a polar system with the largest BPVE found so far. Although the shift
current conductivities of bulk and 2D Se are comparable, the shift current
conductivities of TL Te are five times larger than those of bulk Te. Finally,
an analysis of the calculated electronic band structures indicates that the
strong NLO responses of 2D Se and Te materials are primarily derived from their
low-dimensional structures with high anisotropy, directional covalent bonding,
lone-pair electrons, and relatively small band gaps. These findings provide a
practical strategy to search for excellent NLO and BPVE materials.

the classifications established for occupations or economic activities. The
classifications usually include hundreds of codes and titles. Manual coding of
raw data may result in misclassification and be time consuming. The goal was to
develop and test a web-tool, named Procode, for coding of free-texts against
classifications and recoding between different classifications. Methods. Three
text classifiers, i.e. Complement Naive Bayes (CNB), Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC), were investigated using a k-fold
cross-validation. 30 000 free-texts with manually assigned classification codes
of French classification of occupations (PCS) and French classification of
activities (NAF) were available. For recoding, Procode integrated a workflow
that converts codes of one classification to another according to existing
crosswalks. Since this is a straightforward operation, only the recoding time
was measured. Results. Among the three investigated text classifiers, CNB
resulted in the best performance, where the classifier predicted accurately
57-81% and 63-83% classification codes for PCS and NAF, respectively. SVM lead
to somewhat lower results (by 1-2%), while RFC coded accurately up to 30% of
the data. The coding operation required one minute per 10 000 records, while
the recoding was faster, i.e. 5-10 seconds. Conclusion. The algorithm
integrated in Procode showed satisfactory performance, since the tool had to
assign the right code by choosing between 500-700 different choices. Based on
the results, the authors decided to implement CNB in Procode. In future, if
another classifier shows a superior performance, an update will include the
required modifications.

in polarized skylight navigation to describe skylight polarization patterns,
does not contain three-dimensional (3D) attitude information [1]. However, it
is still necessary to further explore whether the skylight polarization
patterns contain 3D attitude information. So, in this paper, a social spider
optimization (SSO) method is proposed to estimate three Euler angles, which
considers the difference of each pixel among polarization images based on
template matching (TM) to make full use of the captured polarization
information. In addition, to explore this problem, we not only use angle of
polarization (AOP) and degree of polarization (DOP) information, but also the
light intensity (LI) information. So, a sky model is established, which
combines Berry model and Hosek model to fully describe AOP, DOP, and LI
information in the sky, and considers the influence of four neutral points,
ground albedo, atmospheric turbidity, and wavelength. The results of simulation
show that the SSO algorithm can estimate 3D attitude and the established sky
model contains 3D attitude information. However, when there are measurement
noise or model error, the accuracy of 3D attitude estimation drops
significantly. Especially in field experiment, it is very difficult to estimate
3D attitude. Finally, the results are discussed in detail.

image recognition. Although the internal patterns of the input images are
effectively learned by the CNNs, these patterns only constitute a small
proportion of useful patterns contained in the input images. This can be
attributed to the fact that the CNNs will stop learning if the learned patterns
are enough to make a correct classification. Network regularization methods
like dropout and SpatialDropout can ease this problem. During training, they
randomly drop the features. These dropout methods, in essence, change the
patterns learned by the networks, and in turn, forces the networks to learn
other patterns to make the correct classification. However, the above methods
have an important drawback. Randomly dropping features is generally inefficient
and can introduce unnecessary noise. To tackle this problem, we propose
SelectScale. Instead of randomly dropping units, SelectScale selects the

power demand in the building sector is still remarkably growing due to
teleworking and e-learning triggered by the COVID-19 movement restrictions.
This is highlighted by the inefficiency of energy saving measures that have
recently been set owing to the the marketability failure and unsuccessful
design integration of existing ICT based solutions. Specifically, the factors
that affect energy efficiency comprise natural and socio-economic restrictions,
technological advances, and last but not least the human behavior. Energy
efficiency based on behavioral change has attracted an increasing interest in
the recent years, unfortunately, solutions in this area suffer from the lack of
marketability because of the absence of both prospective studies and consumer
awareness. This work, focuses on a key cost-effective technology for monitoring
power consumption and for contributing to the behavioral change through smart,
personalized, and on the moment, action recommendations. In order to examine
the marketability of the proposed solution, we begin with a market and research
analysis of the domain of energy efficiency systems in the building sector that
target behavioral change. Moving forward, various factors that affect the
commercialization of the final product are considered before proceeding with
recommended actions to ensure its successful marketability via conducting a
Go/No-Go analysis. Finally, based on the comprehensive commercialization study,
a GO decision is concluded for the subject technology.
