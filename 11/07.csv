search task, cross-modal hashing methods have attracted considerable attention.
For the supervised cross-modal hashing methods, how to make the learned hash
codes preserve semantic information sufficiently contained in the label of
datapoints is the key to further enhance the retrieval performance. Hence,
almost all supervised cross-modal hashing methods usually depends on defining a
similarity between datapoints with the label information to guide the hashing
model learning fully or partly. However, the defined similarity between
datapoints can only capture the label information of datapoints partially and
misses abundant semantic information, then hinders the further improvement of
retrieval performance. Thus, in this paper, different from previous works, we
propose a novel cross-modal hashing method without defining the similarity
between datapoints, called Deep Cross-modal Hashing via
\textit{Margin-dynamic-softmax Loss} (DCHML). Specifically, DCHML first trains
a proxy hashing network to transform each category information of a dataset
into a semantic discriminative hash code, called proxy hash code. Each proxy
hash code can preserve the semantic information of its corresponding category
well. Next, without defining the similarity between datapoints to supervise the
training process of the modality-specific hashing networks , we propose a novel
\textit{margin-dynamic-softmax loss} to directly utilize the proxy hashing
codes as supervised information. Finally, by minimizing the novel
\textit{margin-dynamic-softmax loss}, the modality-specific hashing networks
can be trained to generate hash codes which can simultaneously preserve the
cross-modal similarity and abundant semantic information well.

  with Demand Awareness",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to accessible big data collections from consumers, products, and stores,
advanced sales forecasting capabilities have drawn great attention from many
companies especially in the retail business because of its importance in
decision making. Improvement of the forecasting accuracy, even by a small
percentage, may have a substantial impact on companies' production and
financial planning, marketing strategies, inventory controls, supply chain
management, and eventually stock prices. Specifically, our research goal is to
forecast the sales of each product in each store in the near future. Motivated
by tensor factorization methodologies for personalized context-aware
recommender systems, we propose a novel approach called the Advanced Temporal
Latent-factor Approach to Sales forecasting (ATLAS), which achieves accurate
and individualized prediction for sales by building a single
tensor-factorization model across multiple stores and products. Our
contribution is a combination of: tensor framework (to leverage information
across stores and products), a new regularization function (to incorporate
demand dynamics), and extrapolation of tensor into future time periods using
state-of-the-art statistical (seasonal auto-regressive integrated
moving-average models) and machine-learning (recurrent neural networks) models.
The advantages of ATLAS are demonstrated on eight product category datasets
collected by the Information Resource, Inc., where a total of 165 million
weekly sales transactions from more than 1,500 grocery stores over 15,560
products are analyzed.

  climb by the vacancy mechanism",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we examine the driving force for edge dislocations to climb in
$\alpha$-Fe from atomistic and mesoscale viewpoints. We study the bias for the
climb process depending on the dislocation orientation and the applied stress
as coming from both the gradient of the chemical potential and the transport
coefficients. Both terms are modified by the applied stress and therefore
contribute to climb. Surprisingly, even though the vacancy migration barrier
distribution is modified by the external stress as obtained by nudged-elastic
band calculations, the mobilities resulting from a kinetic Monte Carlo model
applied on the obtained energy landscape are indistinguishable, independently
of the stress. Moreover, an object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) model including
the effect of the dislocation strain field to first order shows indeed a slight
anisotropic component in the diffusion in more complex dislocation
configurations. However, the OKMC results highlight the fact that the
thermodynamic component is the dominant driving force. We conclude that in
$\alpha$-Fe under thermal conditions, the main source of bias is given by the
difference in vacancy chemical potentials, which is small enough to hinder the
process for dynamic atomistic simulations.

the max objective. We initiate the study of Minmax $k$-cut by showing that it
is NP-hard and W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k$, and design a parameterized
approximation scheme when parameterized by $k$. The main ingredient of our
parameterized approximation scheme is an exact algorithm for Minmax $k$-cut

the optimum and $n$ is the number of vertices. Our algorithmic technique builds
on the technique of Lokshtanov, Saurabh, and Surianarayanan (FOCS, 2020) who
showed a similar result for Minsum $k$-cut. Our algorithmic techniques are more
general and can be used to obtain parameterized approximation schemes for

Eight sources have very steep radio spectral index alpha <-1.5, which are most
likely to be pulsars and will be followed up for periodicity search. Such a
significant number of pulsar candidates within the error circle of HE/VHE

wind nebulae in this context.

challenge due to the inherent coupling of the modeling and numerical errors. An
attempt to address the challenge first requires a comprehensive assessment and
then the development of error estimators to highlight regions that require
refinement. Following the work of Schranner et al., a novel approach to
estimate the numerical dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
equations is proposed. The presented approach allows the computation of the
local numerical dissipation for arbitrary curvilinear grids through a
post-processing procedure. This method, as well as empirical and
kinetic-energy-based approaches, are employed to estimate the inherent
numerical TKE. We incorporate the numerical TKE to evaluate an effective eddy
viscosity, an effective Kolmogorov length scale, and an effective TKE to build
a family of Index Quality (IQ) based error estimators. The proposed IQ based
estimators are then assessed and utilized to show their effectiveness through
an application of grid adaptation for the periodic hill test case and
transitional flow over the SD 7003 airfoil. Numerical results are validated
through a comparison against reference LES and experimental data. Flow over the
adapted grids appear better abled to capture pertinent flow features and
integrated functions, such as the lift and drag coefficients.

HD3167c obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 infrared
spectrograph. We combine these data, which span the 1.125-1.643 micron
wavelength range, with broadband transit measurements made using Kepler/K2
(0.6-0.9 micron) and Spitzer/IRAC (4-5 micron). We find evidence for absorption
by at least one of H2O, HCN, CO2, and CH4 (Bayes factor 7.4; 2.5-sigma
significance), although the data precision does not allow us to unambiguously
discriminate between these molecules. The transmission spectrum rules out
cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with metallicities <100x solar at
>5.8-sigma confidence. In contrast, good agreement with the data is obtained
for cloud-free models assuming metallicities >700x solar. However, for
retrieval analyses that include the effect of clouds, a much broader range of
metallicities (including subsolar) is consistent with the data, due to the
degeneracy with cloud-top pressure. Self-consistent chemistry models that
account for photochemistry and vertical mixing are presented for the atmosphere
of HD3167c. The predictions of these models are broadly consistent with our
abundance constraints, although this is primarily due to the large
uncertainties on the latter. Interior structure models suggest the core mass
fraction is >40%, independent of a rock or water core composition, and
independent of atmospheric envelope metallicity up to 1000x solar. We also
report abundance measurements for fifteen elements in the host star, showing
that it has a very nearly solar composition.

exponentially many constraints. This paper proposes a new formalization needing
only a polynomial number of constraints, and characterizes these constraints in
three different forms: nonlinear, linear, and conjunctive normal form.
Empirical results show that constraints in conjunctive normal form capture the
problem most effectively, leading to a method that outperforms the others.
Further examination indicates that a substantial proportion of constraints
remain inactive during iterative filter reduction. To leverage this
observation, we introduce just-in-time generation of such constraints, which
yields improvements in efficiency and has the potential to minimize large
filters.

alternating diffusions of the signed distance function to the interface and a
redistanciation step, and with careful choice of the applied diffusions, end up
moving the zero level-set of the distance function by some geometrical quantity
without resorting to any explicit transport equation. The constraints are
enforced between the diffusion and redistanciation steps via a simple rescaling
method. The energy globally decreases at the end of each global step. The
algorithms feature the computational efficiency of thresholding methods without
requiring any adaptive remeshing thanks to the use of a signed distance

validated by computing the equilibrium shapes of two- and three-dimensional

Many elements of the method are generic to CMB polarimetry experiments and can
be adapted for other datasets. As a first demonstration, we process data from
the 2012 observing season to set upper limits on the axion-photon coupling
constant in the mass range $10^{-21}$-$10^{-18}~\mathrm{eV}$, which corresponds
to oscillation periods on the order of hours to months. We find no

larger than $24~\mathrm{hr}$ (mass $m < 4.8 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$), the
median 95%-confidence upper limit is equivalent to a rotation amplitude of

approximations in which a smooth evolution of the expectation values of
elementary geometry operators replaces the classical and singular dynamics. The
advantage of such descriptions is that they are relatively simple and display
the classical behavior for large universes. However, they may smooth out an
important inner structure and to include it a more detailed treatment is
needed. The purpose of the present work is to investigate quantum uncertainty
in the basic background variables and its influence on primordial gravitational
waves. To this end we quantize a model of the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe filled with a linear barotropic
cosmological fluid and with gravitational waves. We carefully derive the
dynamical equations for the perturbations in quantum spacetime. The
quantization yields an equation of motion for the Fourier modes of
gravitational radiation, which is a quantum extension to the usual parametric
oscillator equation for gravitational waves propagating in an expanding
universe. The two quantum effects from the cosmological background that enter
the enhanced equation of motion are (i) a repulsive potential resolving the big
bang singularity and replacing it with a big bounce and (ii) uncertainties in
the numerical values for the background spacetime dynamical variables. First we
study the former effect and its consequences for the primordial amplitude
spectrum and carefully discuss the relation between the bounce scale and the
physical predictions of the model. Next we investigate the latter effect, in
particular the extent to which it may affect the primordial amplitude of
gravitational waves. Making use of the WKB approximation we find an analytical
formula for the amplitude spectrum as a function of the quantum dispersion of

resolve a prominent azimuthal asymmetry in the continuum, and Keplerian
rotation of a circumbinary disk in the $^{12}$CO line. The asymmetry is located
at a radius of $155^{+11}_{-7}$ AU, consistent with the edge of the scattered

circumbinary companion, responsible for the cavity in scattered light and
creating a vortex at the cavity edge that manifests in dust trapping. The disk
mass has limitations imposed by the detection of $^{12}$CO and non-detection of

common in large area surveys (e.g., ZTF and LSST), and that some of them have a
point-like appearance, confounding searches for fast transients such as Fast
Radio Burst counterparts and Gamma-ray bursts. By observing in the direction of
the Earth's shadow we are able to put an upper limit on the rate of fast
astrophysical transients of 0.052deg^{-2}day^{-1} (95\% confidence limit) for

distort the observed positions of galaxies along the line of sight away from

dependence not only on each triangle's shape, but also on its orientation with
respect to the line of sight. Consequently, different choices for the line of
sight will affect the measured 3PCF. Up to now, the line of sight has been
taken as the direction to a single triplet member (STM), but which triplet
member is used impacts the 3PCF by ~20% of the statistical error for a
BOSS-like survey. For DESI (2019-24), which is 5X more precise, this would
translate to 100% of the statistical error, increasing the total error bar by
40%. We here propose a new method that is fully symmetric between the triplet
members, and uses either the average of the three galaxy position vectors
(which we show points to the triangle centroid), or the average of their unit
(direction) vectors. Naively, these approaches would seem to require triplet
counting, scaling as $N^3$, with $N$ the number of objects in the survey. By
harnessing the solid harmonic shift theorem, we here show how these methods can
be evaluated scaling as $N^2$. We expect that they can be used to make a
robust, systematics-free measurement of the anisotropic 3PCF of upcoming

component to building intelligent reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The
common practice is to separate the learning of the model from its use, by
constructing a model of the environment's dynamics that correctly predicts the
observed state transitions. In this paper we argue that the limited
representational resources of model-based RL agents are better used to build
models that are directly useful for value-based planning. As our main
contribution, we introduce the principle of value equivalence: two models are
value equivalent with respect to a set of functions and policies if they yield
the same Bellman updates. We propose a formulation of the model learning
problem based on the value equivalence principle and analyze how the set of
feasible solutions is impacted by the choice of policies and functions.
Specifically, we show that, as we augment the set of policies and functions
considered, the class of value equivalent models shrinks, until eventually
collapsing to a single point corresponding to a model that perfectly describes
the environment. In many problems, directly modelling state-to-state
transitions may be both difficult and unnecessary. By leveraging the
value-equivalence principle one may find simpler models without compromising
performance, saving computation and memory. We illustrate the benefits of
value-equivalent model learning with experiments comparing it against more
traditional counterparts like maximum likelihood estimation. More generally, we
argue that the principle of value equivalence underlies a number of recent
empirical successes in RL, such as Value Iteration Networks, the Predictron,
Value Prediction Networks, TreeQN, and MuZero, and provides a first theoretical
underpinning of those results.

tidal effects during a binary inspiral, leading to a potentially measurable
effect in the gravitational-wave signal. We take an important step towards
incorporating these effects in waveform models by developing a relativistic
effective action for the gravitomagnetic dynamics that clarifies a number of
subtleties. Working in the slow-rotation limit, we first consider the
post-Newtonian approximation and explicitly derive the effective action from
the equations of motion. We demonstrate that this formulation opens a way to
compute mode frequencies, yields insights into the relevant matter variables,
and elucidates the role of a shift symmetry of the fluid properties under a
displacement of the gravitomagnetic mode amplitudes. We then construct a fully
relativistic action based on the symmetries and a power counting scheme. This
action involves four coupling coefficients that depend on the internal
structure of the neutron star and characterize the key matter parameters
imprinted in the gravitational waves. We show that, after fixing one of the
coefficients by normalization, the other three directly involve the two kinds
of gravitomagnetic Love numbers (static and irrotational), and the mode
frequencies. We discuss several interesting features and dynamical consequences
of this action, and analyze the frequency-domain response function (the
frequency-dependent ratio between the induced flux quadrupole and the external
gravitomagnetic field), and a corresponding Love operator representing the
time-domain response. Our results provide the foundation for deriving precision
predictions of gravitomagnetic effects, and the nuclear physics they encode,
for gravitational-wave astronomy.

accompanied by bursts of radiation at metre wavelengths. Some of these bursts
have a long duration and extend over a wide frequency band, namely, type IV
radio bursts. However, the association of type IV bursts with coronal mass
ejections is still not well understood. In this article, we perform the first
statistical study of type IV solar radio bursts in the solar cycle 24. Our
study includes a total of 446 type IV radio bursts that occurred during this
cycle. Our results show that a clear majority, $\sim 81 \%$ of type IV bursts,
were accompanied by CMEs, based on a temporal association with white-light CME
observations. However, we found that only $\sim 2.2 \%$ of the CMEs are
accompanied by type IV radio bursts. We categorised the type IV bursts as
moving or stationary based on their spectral characteristics and found that
only $\sim 18 \%$ of the total type IV bursts in this study were moving type IV
bursts. Our study suggests that type IV bursts can occur with both `Fast'
($\geq 500$ km/s) and `Slow' ($< 500$ km/s), and also both `Wide' ($\geq
60^{\circ}$) and `Narrow' ($< 60^{\circ}$) CMEs. However, the moving type IV
bursts in our study were mostly associated with `Fast' and `Wide' CMEs ($\sim
52 \%$), similar to type II radio bursts. Contrary to type II bursts,
stationary type IV bursts have a more uniform association with all CME types.

turbulence by fast tracking in the way that falling inertial particles do. Mean
airspeed increases relative to flight through quiescent fluid when turbulent
eddies sweep particles and vehicles along in a productive way. Once swept,
inertia tends to carry a vehicle into tailwinds more often than headwinds. We
introduce a forcing that rescales the effective inertia of rotorcraft in
computer simulations. Given a certain thrust and effective inertia, we find
that flight energy consumption can be calculated from measurements of mean
particle settling velocities and acceleration variances alone, without need for
other information. In calculations using a turbulence model, we optimize the
balance between the work performed to generate the forcing and the advantages
induced by fast tracking. The results show net energy reductions of up to about
10% relative to flight through quiescent fluid and mean velocities up to 40%
higher. The forcing expands the range of conditions under which fast tracking
operates by a factor of about ten. We discuss how the mechanism can operate for
any vehicle, how it may be even more effective in real turbulence and for
fixed-wing aircraft, and how modifications might yield yet greater performance.

systems typically respond reactively by creating surge capacity at facilities
that are at or approaching their baseline capacity. However, creating
individual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach,
and redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce
the total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly
distributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to
create surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is
this inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at
over-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal
demand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and
resource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze
a series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of
the demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand
uncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also
incorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers
may need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated
retrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and
Miami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative
to the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are
operationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In
summary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a
practical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly
care for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.

of the Standard Model (SM) is an ever-growing mystery. It is possible that the
existence of new `dark sector' forces, yet undiscovered, are the key to solving
this fundamental problem. In this paper, we construct a model in which a dark
photon mediates interactions with the SM via kinetic mixing. Unlike traditional
models, in which the dark photon, which couples to a dark charge, $Q_D$, mixes
with the hypercharge boson, our model effectively mixes the dark photon
directly with the photon after electroweak symmetry is broken, but remains
unmixed until the symmetry breaks. The kinetic mixing is generated at one loop
by fields which satisfy $\sum Q_D Q_{em} = 0$, a condition which guarantees a
finite result at one loop. In the literature, this has been traditionally
obtained via heavy fermions, which may lie out of the reach of current
accelerators. In this model, by contrast, this process is mediated by scalar
`portal matter' fields, which are charged under the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ of
the standard model as well as the dark gauge group $U(1)_D$ and acquire
GeV-scale vevs which give mass to the dark Higgs and dark photon. The
additional scalar fields are relatively light, at or below the weak scale, yet
may remain undetected by current experiments since their couplings to SM
fermions come only through percent level mixing with the SM Higgs. At
colliders, these models are typified by relatively low MET due the BSM states
decaying into MET and SM bosons, with MET which is balanced by the decay of the
associated production object. Nevertheless, the higher statistics of HL-LHC may
be able to probe the entirety of the model space.

With
the introduction of technology and the synthesis of personalized medicines,
doctors have been successful in treating even the deadliest of the diseases.
Though surgeries, which have been flourishing with a good success rate in the
past, have become feasible and they are being regularly performed to reach out
for internal infected areas that cannot be treated from the outside, there
still are areas in the body that are physically beyond the reach of a doctor.
Internal blood clots are one such problem that has been prolonging for a very
long time and sometimes can be located in certain areas that are too deep
inside, which makes them virtually impossible to reach, deep arteries or veins,
narrow internal sections of brain or lungs. In this paper, we propose an
approach which puts Nano-robotics into use to deal with the problem of internal
blood clots. This method looks at introducing swamps of nanobots in ones
bloodstream which acts as carriers of medicines to the sites which are
difficult to access for treatment physically. This will not just ease the
process but it promises to be far more efficient, precise and less invasive
than the currently existing techniques.

focused on pricing options without considering the effects of counterparties'
defaults, illiquidity problems, and the role of the sale and repurchase
agreement (Repo) market. Recently, models were proposed to address this by
computing a total valuation adjustment (XVA) of derivatives; however without
considering a potential crisis in the market. In this article, we include a
possible crisis by using an alternating renewal process to describe the
switching between a normal financial regime and a financial crisis. We develop
a framework to price the XVA of a European claim in this state-dependent
situation. The price is characterized as a solution to a backward stochastic
differential equation (BSDE), and we prove the existence and uniqueness of this
solution. In a numerical study based on a deep learning algorithm for BSDEs, we
compare the effect of different parameters on the valuation of the XVA.

iterative DNA synthesis method that utilizes endonucleases to synthesize a
query sequence from a reference sequence. In this work, the reference sequence
is built from shorter subsequences by classifying them as applicable or
inapplicable for the synthesis method using three different machine learning
methods: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), random forest, and Convolution Neural
Networks (CNNs). Before applying these methods to the data, a series of feature
selection, curation, and reduction steps are applied to create an accurate and
representative feature space. Following these preprocessing steps, three
different pipelines are proposed to classify subsequences based on their
nucleotide sequence and other relevant features corresponding to the
restriction sites of over 200 endonucleases. The sensitivity using SVMs, random
forest, and CNNs are 94.9%, 92.7%, 91.4%, respectively. Moreover, each method
scores lower in specificity with SVMs, random forest, and CNNs resulting in
77.4%, 85.7%, and 82.4%, respectively. In addition to analyzing these results,
the misclassifications in SVMs and CNNs are investigated. Across these two
models, different features with a derived nucleotide specificity visually
contribute more to classification compared to other features. This observation
is an important factor when considering new nucleotide sensitivity features for
future studies.

carbon-oxygen (CO) core white dwarfs (WDs). With total masses in the range $1-2
{\rm M_\odot}$, these remnants may either leave behind a single massive WD or
undergo a merger-induced collapse to a neutron star (NS). On the way to their
final fate, these objects generally experience a $\sim 10$ kyr luminous giant
phase, which may be extended if sufficient helium remains to set up a stable
shell-burning configuration. The uncertain, but likely significant, mass loss
rate during this phase influences the final remnant mass and fate (WD or NS).
We find that the initial CO core composition of the WD is converted to
oxygen-neon (ONe) in remnants with final masses $\gtrsim 1.05 {\rm M_\odot}$.
This implies that the CO core / ONe core transition in single WDs formed via
mergers occurs at a similar mass as in WDs descended from single stars, and
thus that WD-WD mergers do not naturally provide a route to producing
ultra-massive CO-core WDs. As the remnant contracts towards a compact
configuration, it experiences a ""bottleneck"" that sets the characteristic total
angular momentum that can be retained. This limit predicts single WDs formed
from WD-WD mergers have rotational periods of $\approx 10-20$ min on the WD
cooling track. Similarly, it predicts remnants that collapse can form NSs with
rotational periods $\sim 10$ ms.

remains an open question. To investigate this, we look at the Orion A and B
molecular clouds, home to most of the protostars within 500 pc. At ~400 pc,
Orion is close enough to distinguish individual protostars across a range of
environments in terms of both the stellar and gas projected densities. As part
of the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS), we used the Photodetector Array
Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) to map 108 partially overlapping square fields
with edge lengths of 5 arcmin or 8 arcmin and measure the 70 micron and 160
micron flux densities of 338 protostars within them. In this paper we examine
how these flux densities and their ratio depend on evolutionary state and
environment within the Orion complex. We show that Class 0 protostars occupy a
region of the 70 micron flux density versus 160 micron to 70 micron flux
density ratio diagram that is distinct from their more evolved counterparts. We
then present evidence that the Integral-Shaped Filament (ISF) and Orion B
contain protostars with more massive envelopes than those in the more sparsely
populated LDN 1641 region. This can be interpreted as evidence for increasing
star formation rates in the ISF and Orion B or as a tendency for more massive
envelopes to be inherited from denser birth environments. We also provide

Hubble Space Telescope slitless spectroscopy. The observations include 12-orbit
depth Hubble/WFC3 G102 grism spectra taken as a part of the CANDELS Lya
Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) survey, and archival WFC3 G102+G141 grism
spectra overlapping the CLEAR footprint. The majority of galaxies (84%) in this
sample are consistent with a zero or slightly positive metallicity gradient
across the full mass range probed (8.5 < log M_*/M_sun < 10.5). We measure the
intrinsic population scatter of the metallicity gradients, and show that it
increases with decreasing stellar mass---consistent with previous reports in
the literature, but confirmed here with a much larger sample. To understand the
physical mechanisms governing this scatter, we search for correlations between
the observed gradient and various stellar population properties at fixed mass.
However, we find no evidence for a correlation with the galaxy properties we
consider---including star-formation rates, sizes, star-formation rate surface
densities, and star-formation rates per gravitational potential energy. We use
the observed weakness of these correlations to provide material constraints for
predicted intrinsic correlations from theoretical models.

the constraints from the cosmological cold dark matter density, $\Omega_{CDM}
h^2$, the Higgs mass, $M_h$, and the experimental lower limit on the lifetime
for $p \to K^+ \bar \nu$, the dominant proton decay mode in these super-GUT
models. Reconciling this limit with $\Omega_{CDM} h^2$ and $M_h$ requires the
Higgs field responsible for the charge-2/3 quark masses to be twisted, and
possibly also that responsible for the charge-1/3 and charged-lepton masses,
with model-dependent soft supersymmetry-breaking masses. We consider six
possible models for the super-GUT initial conditions, and two possible choices
for quark flavor mixing, contrasting their predictions for proton decay with
versions of the models in which mixing effects are neglected. We find that
$\tau\left(p\rightarrow K^+ \bar{\nu}\right)$ may be accessible to the upcoming
Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, whereas all the models predict
$\text{BR}(\mu\rightarrow e\gamma)$ and $d_e$ below the current and prospective
future experimental sensitivities or both flavor choices, when the dark matter
density, Higgs mass and current proton decay constraints are taken into
account. However, there are limited regions with one of the flavor choices in
two of the models where $\mu \to e$ conversion on a heavy nucleus may be
observable in the future. Our results indicate that there is no supersymmetric
flavor problem in the class of no-scale models we consider.

5.7,\ 6.6$). The VPF measures the zero-point correlation function (i.e. places
devoid of galaxies) and naturally connects to higher order correlation
functions while being computationally simple to calculate. We explore the
Poissonian and systematic errors on the VPF, specify its accuracy as a function
of average source density and the volume probed, and provide the appropriate
size scales to measure the VPF. At small radii the accuracy of the VPF is
limited by galaxy density, while at large radii the VPF is limited by the
number of independent volumes probed. We also offer guidelines for
understanding and quantifying the error in the VPF. We approximate the error in
the VPF by using independent sub-volumes of the catalogs, after finding that
jackknife statistics underestimate the uncertainty. We use the VPF to probe the
strength of higher order correlation functions by measuring and examining the
hierarchical scaling between the correlation functions using count-in-cells.
The negative binomial model (NBM) has been shown to best describe the scaling
between the two point correlation function and VPF for low-redshift galaxy
observations. We further test the fit of the NBM by directly deriving the
volume averaged two-point correlation function from the VPF and vice versa. We
find the NBM best describes the $z=3.1, 4.5, 5.7$ simulated LAEs, with a
1$\sigma$ deviation from the model in the $z=6.6$ catalog. This suggests that
LAEs show higher order clustering terms similar to those of normal low redshift
galaxies.

fluctuations, with the most extreme astrophysical models on the verge of being
ruled out by observations from radio interferometers. It is therefore vital
that we understand not only the astrophysical processes governing this signal,
but also other inherent processes impacting the signal itself, and in
particular line-of-sight effects. Using our suite of fully numerical radiative
transfer simulations, we investigate the impact on the redshifted 21-cm from
the CD from one of these processes, namely the redshift-space distortions
(RSDs). When RSDs are added, the resulting boost to the power spectra makes the
signal more detectable for our models at all redshifts, further strengthening
hopes that a power spectra measurement of the CD will be possible. RSDs lead to
anisotropy in the signal at the beginning and end of the CD, but not while
X-ray heating is underway. The inclusion of RSDs, however, decreases
detectability of the non-Gaussianity of fluctuations from inhomogeneous X-ray
heating measured by the skewness and kurtosis. On the other hand, mock
observations created from all our simulations that include telescope noise
corresponding to 1000 h observation with the Square Kilometre Array telescope
show that we may be able image the CD for all heating models considered and
suggest RSDs dramatically boost fluctuations coming from the inhomogeneous

was significantly neutral at $z=7$ and that reionization was, perhaps, still in
progress at $z=5.7$. The narrowband survey, SILVERRUSH, has mapped over $2,000$
Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at these redshifts. Previous analyses have
assumed that reionization was over by $z=5.7$, but this data may actually
sample the final stages of reionization when the last neutral islands were
relegated to the cosmic voids. Motivated by these developments, we reexamine
LAE void and peak statistics and their ability to constrain reionization. We
construct models of the LAE distribution in (1 Gpc$/h$)$^3$ volumes, spanning a
range of neutral fractions at $z=5.7$ and 6.6. Models with a higher neutral
fraction show an enhanced probability of finding holes in the LAE distribution.
When comparing models at fixed mean surface density, however, LAEs obscured by
neutral gas in the voids must be compensated by visible LAEs elsewhere. Hence,
in these models the likelihood of finding an over-dense peak is also enhanced
in the latter half of reionization. Compared to the widely used angular
two-point correlation function (2PCF), we find that the void probability
function (VPF) provides a more sensitive test of models during the latter half
of reionization. By comparison, at neutral fractions $\sim 50\%$, the VPF and a
simple peak thresholding statistic are both similar to the 2PCF in constraining
power. Lastly, we find that the cosmic variance and large-scale asymmetries
observed in the SILVERRUSH fields are consistent with large-scale structure in
a $\Lambda$CDM universe.

achieve the lowest mass detection limits yet for angular separations >0.5
arcsec, no planetary mass companion to any of the seven white dwarfs, whose
initial main sequence masses were >2.8 Msun, was found. Comparison with
evolutionary models yields detection limits of 5 to 7 Jupiter masses according
to one model, and between 9 and 12 Mjup according to another model, at physical
separations corresponding to initial semimajor axis of >5 to 8 A.U. (i.e.,
before the mass loss events associated with the red and asymptotic giant branch
phase of the host star). The study provides further evidence that initially
dense cluster environments, which included O- and B-type stars, might not be
highly conducive to the formation of massive circumstellar disks, and their
transformation into giant planets (with m>6 Mjup and a>6 A.U.). This is in
agreement with radial velocity surveys for exoplanets around G- and K-type

combined self-consistently, with $\texttt{CMC}$ itself employing

efficiency $\alpha$ assumed in $\texttt{COSMIC}$ and the initial cluster virial

need to enable high-rate, low-latency communications. Errors in physical
channels typically arrive in clumps, but most decoders are designed assuming
that channels are memoryless. As a result, communication networks rely on
interleaving over tens of thousands of bits so that channel conditions match
decoder assumptions. Even for short high rate codes, awaiting sufficient data
to interleave at the sender and de-interleave at the receiver is a significant
source of unwanted latency. Using existing decoders with non-interleaved
channels causes a degradation in block error rate performance owing to mismatch
between the decoder's channel model and true channel behaviour.
  Through further development of the recently proposed Guessing Random Additive
Noise Decoding (GRAND) algorithm, which we call GRAND-MO for GRAND Markov
Order, here we establish that by abandoning interleaving and embracing bursty
noise, low-latency, short-code, high-rate communication is possible with block
error rates that outperform their interleaved counterparts by a substantial
margin. Moreover, while most decoders are twinned to a specific code-book
structure, GRAND-MO can decode any code. Using this property, we establish that
certain well-known structured codes are ill-suited for use in bursty channels,

suggests that the use of RLCs with GRAND-MO is a good candidate for

complemented by integrated CO(1-0) observations from the IRAM 30-m telescope to
probe the total molecular gas reservoirs. We find that the galaxies powering
outflows do not possess significantly different global gas fractions or
star-formation efficiencies when compared with a control sample. However, the
ALMA maps reveal that the molecular gas in the outflow-type galaxies is
distributed more centrally than in the control galaxies. For our outflow-type
objects, molecular gas and star-formation is largely confined within their
inner effective radius ($\rm r_{eff}$), whereas in the control sample the
distribution is more diffuse, extending far beyond $\rm r_{eff}$. We infer that
outflows in normal star-forming galaxies may be caused by dynamical mechanisms
that drive molecular gas into their central regions, which can result in
locally-enhanced gas surface density and star-formation.

(such as Tacotron) which generates intermediate features (such as spectrograms)

not use a fixed intermediate representation, and learns all parameters

H2-cooling minihalos (MHs) with Tvir < 10^4 K, whose star formation is

Our previous work showed that including MHs caused two-stage reionization -
early rise to x ~ 0.1, driven by MHs, followed by a rapid rise, late, to x ~ 1,
driven by ACHs - with a signature in CMB polarization anisotropy predicted to
be detectable by the Planck satellite. Motivated by this prediction, we model
global reionization semi-analytically for comparison with Planck CMB data and
the EDGES global 21cm absorption feature, for models with: (1) ACHs, no

(3) agrees well with Planck E-mode polarization data, even with a substantial

|dTb| <~ 60 mK across the EDGES trough, an order of magnitude too shallow, and

(ELC) maneuver. Typically, an ELC maneuver is triggered by emergency cues from
the front or the end of convoy as a response to either avoiding an obstacle or
making way for other vehicles to pass. From a safety viewpoint, connectivity of
ACVs is essential as it entails obtaining or exchanging information about other
ACVs in the convoy. This paper assumes that ACVs have reliable connectivity and
that every following ACV has the information about GPS position traces of the
lead and immediately preceding vehicles in the convoy. This information
provides a ""discretized"" preview of the trajectory to be tracked. Based on the
available information, this article focuses on two schemes for synthesizing
lateral control of ACVs based on(a) a single composite ELC trajectory that
fuses lead and preceding vehicle's GPS traces and (b) separate ELC trajectories
based on preview data of preceding and lead vehicles. The former case entails
the construction of a single composite ELC trajectory, determine the
cross-track error, heading and yaw rate errors with respect to this trajectory
and synthesize a lateral control action. The latter case entails the
construction of two separate trajectories corresponding to the lead vehicle's
and preceding vehicle's data separately and the subsequent computation of two
sets of associated errors and lateral control actions and combining them to
provide a steering command. Numerical and experimental results corroborate the
effectiveness of these two schemes.

are sensitive to ultralight vector dark matter and can improve the current best
constraints given by the Equivalence Principle tests. While a
gravitational-wave detector is a highly precise measuring tool of the length
difference of its arms, its sensitivity is limited because the displacements of
its test mass mirrors caused by vector dark matter are almost common. In this
Letter we point out that the sensitivity is significantly improved if the
effect of finite light-traveling time in the detector's arms is taken into
account. This effect enables advanced LIGO to improve the constraints on the
$U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge coupling by an order of magnitude compared with the current
best constraints. It also makes the sensitivities of the future
gravitational-wave detectors overwhelmingly better than the current ones. The
factor by which the constraints are improved due to the new effect depends on
the mass of the vector dark matter, and the maximum improvement factors are
$470$, $880$, $1600$, $180$ and $1400$ for advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope,
Cosmic Explorer, DECIGO and LISA respectively. Including the new effect, we
update the constraints given by the first observing run of advanced LIGO and

the output variable comes from one of the two linear regression models with an
unknown mixing proportion and an unknown covariance structure of the random

iterative procedure for estimating the two regression vectors and establish
their rates of convergence. Based on the iterative estimators, we further
construct debiased estimators and establish their asymptotic normality. For
individual coordinates, confidence intervals centered at the debiased

  Furthermore, a large-scale multiple testing procedure is proposed for testing
the regression coefficients and is shown to control the false discovery rate
(FDR) asymptotically. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the
numerical performance of the proposed methods and their superiority over
existing methods. The proposed methods are further illustrated through an

A fundamental building block in most multi-robot systems is task allocation:
assigning robots to tasks (e.g., patrolling an area, or servicing a
transportation request) as they appear based on the robots' states to maximize
reward. In many practical situations, the allocation must account for
heterogeneous capabilities (e.g., availability of appropriate sensors or
actuators) to ensure the feasibility of execution, and to promote a higher
reward, over a long time horizon. To this end, we present the FlowDec algorithm
for efficient heterogeneous task-allocation achieving an approximation factor
of at least 1/2 of the optimal reward. Our approach decomposes the
heterogeneous problem into several homogeneous subproblems that can be solved
efficiently using min-cost flow. Through simulation experiments, we show that
our algorithm is faster by several orders of magnitude than a MILP approach.

to new interpretations of the geological settings and to the construction of a
comprehensive 3D geomodel of the basin. The evidence of a system of
paleovalleys could be inferred from the AEM data. The stratigraphy of these
paleovalleys suggests a different glaciation history from the known Marinoan
events, commonly associated with the Kodjari formation of the Voltaian
sedimentary basin. The presence of the paleovalleys within the Panabako may be
correlated with mountain glaciation within the Sturtian age, though no
unequivocal glaciogenic strata have yet been identified. Pre-Marinoan
glaciation is recorded in rocks of the Wassangara group of the Taoudeni Basin.
The combination of the Marinoan and, possibly, Sturtian glaciation episodes,
both of the Cryogenian period, can be an indication of a Neoproterozoic
Snowball Earth. The occurrence of those features not only has important
socioeconomic consequences - as the paleovalleys can act as reservoirs for
groundwater - but also from a scientific point of view, they could require a

is forced to move and look around simultaneously to account for the restricted

large minimum vertex degrees: Every $n$-vertex $2$-connected graph $G$ with
minimum vertex degree $\delta\geq 2$ contains a cycle with at least
$\min\{2\delta,n\}$ vertices. In particular, if $\delta\geq n/2$, then $G$ is
Hamiltonian. The proof of Dirac's theorem is constructive, and it yields an
algorithm computing the corresponding cycle in polynomial time. The
combinatorial bound of Dirac's theorem is tight in the following sense. There
are 2-connected graphs that do not contain cycles of length more than
$2\delta+1$. Also, there are non-Hamiltonian graphs with all vertices but one
of degree at least $n/2$. This prompts naturally to the following algorithmic
questions. For $k\geq 1$,
  (A) How difficult is to decide whether a 2-connected graph contains a cycle
of length at least $\min\{2\delta+k,n\}$?
  (B) How difficult is to decide whether a graph $G$ is Hamiltonian, when at
least $n - k$ vertices of $G$ are of degrees at least $n/2-k$?
  The first question was asked by Fomin, Golovach, Lokshtanov, Panolan,
Saurabh, and Zehavi. The second question is due to Jansen, Kozma, and Nederlof.
Even for a very special case of $k=1$, the existence of a polynomial-time
algorithm deciding whether $G$ contains a cycle of length at least
$\min\{2\delta+1,n\}$ was open. We resolve both questions by proving the
following algorithmic generalization of Dirac's theorem: If all but $k$
vertices of a $2$-connected graph $G$ are of degree at least $\delta$, then
deciding whether $G$ has a cycle of length at least $\min\{2\delta +k, n\}$ can
be done in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.
  The proof of the algorithmic generalization of Dirac's theorem builds on new
graph-theoretical results that are interesting on their own.

of the number of cases and the other future trends of this pandemic have been
made. However, they fail to predict, in a reliable way, the medium and long
term evolution of fundamental features of COVID-19 outbreak within acceptable
accuracy. This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning
models in this particular forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple
linear regression models provide high prediction accuracy values reliably but
only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models,
which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors,
cannot achieve to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization
ability. It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient number of
samples is the source of low prediction performance of the forecasting models.
The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured
in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as
expectations for the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the
information, which is of most relevant with the active cases, we perform
feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different feature
selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature
Selection, and feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them
to each other and also with the models not employing any feature selection.
Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and
Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases
together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that
the accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization ability
is possible up to 3 days only because of the small sample size of COVID-19

associated with g-mode pulsations with periods spanning from $\sim 817$ s to
$\sim 2682$ s. We find constant period spacings for all but one star, which
allowed us to infer their stellar masses and constrain the harmonic degree
$\ell$ of the modes. We performed period-to-period fit analyses on five of the
six analyzed stars. For four stars, we were able to find an asteroseismological
model with masses in agreement with the stellar-mass values inferred from the
period spacings, and generally compatible with the spectroscopic masses. We
estimated the seismological distance and compared it with the precise
astrometric distance measured with GAIA. Finally, we find that the period
spectrum of K 1-16 exhibits dramatic changes in frequency and amplitude. The
high-quality data collected by the TESS space mission, considered
simultaneously with ground-based observations, are able to provide a very

Secret information is transmitted blindly by incorporating in QSVD two new

conventional QSVD which embeds watermarks in a single imaginary unit, we
propose to adaptively embed the watermark into the optimal hiding position
using the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NC) method. This avoids the selection
of coefficient pair with less correlation, and thus, it reduces embedding
impact by decreasing the maximum modification of coefficient values. In this
way, compared with conventional QSVD, the proposed watermarking strategy avoids
more modifications to a single color image layer and a better visual quality of
the watermarked image is observed. Meanwhile, adaptive QSVD resists some common
geometric attacks, and it improves the robustness of conventional QSVD. With
these improvements, our method outperforms conventional QSVD. Its superiority

candidate and, in some circumstances, as the only possible one. In this work,
we present the results of three-dimensional special relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the development of reconnection events
driven by turbulence induced by current-driven kink instability along a
relativistic jet. We have performed a systematic identification of all
reconnection regions in the system, characterizing their local magnetic field
topology and quantifying the reconnection rates. We obtained average rates of
$0.051\pm0.026$ (in units of the Alfv\'{e}n speed) which are comparable to the
predictions of the theory of turbulence-induced fast reconnection. Detailed
statistical analysis also demonstrated that the fast reconnection events follow
a log-normal distribution, which is a signature of its turbulent origin. To
probe the robustness of our method, we have applied our results to the blazar
Mrk 421. Building a synthetic light curve from the integrated power of the
magnetic reconnection events, we evaluated the time-variability from a power
spectral density analysis, obtaining a good agreement with the observations in
the GeV band. This suggests that turbulent fast magnetic reconnection driven by
kink instability can be a possible process behind the high energy emission
variability phenomena observed in blazars.

relationships in networked decision systems ubiquitously. An ordered tree is a
rooted tree where the order of the subtrees (children) of a node is

relevant to evaluate candidate combinatorial objects. In this paper, we present
an algebraic scheme to generate ordered trees with $n$ vertices with utmost

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ time in average per tree. Our computational studies have shown
the feasibility and efficiency to generate ordered trees in constant time in
average, in about one tenth of a millisecond per ordered tree. Due to the 1-1
bijective nature to other combinatorial classes, our approach is favorable to
study the generation of binary trees with $n$ external nodes, trees with $n$

performance by enabling agents to share advice. Existing advising methods have
a common limitation that an adviser agent can offer advice to an advisee agent
only if the advice is created in the same state as the advisee's concerned
state. However, in complex environments, it is a very strong requirement that
two states are the same, because a state may consist of multiple dimensions and
two states being the same means that all these dimensions in the two states are
correspondingly identical. Therefore, this requirement may limit the
applicability of existing advising methods to complex environments. In this
paper, inspired by the differential privacy scheme, we propose a differential
advising method which relaxes this requirement by enabling agents to use advice
in a state even if the advice is created in a slightly different state.
Compared with existing methods, agents using the proposed method have more
opportunity to take advice from others. This paper is the first to adopt the
concept of differential privacy on advising to improve agent learning
performance instead of addressing security issues. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient in complex environments

(SPOD): low-rank reconstruction, denoising, frequency-time analysis, and
prewhitening are demonstrated on large-eddy simulation data of a turbulent jet.
SPOD-based low-rank reconstruction can be performed by direct inversion of a
truncated SPOD. This spectral inversion problem, however, is ambiguous since
SPOD relies on spectral estimation. We demonstrate SPOD-based flow field
reconstruction using direct inversion of the SPOD algorithm (frequency-domain
approach) and propose an alternative approach based on projection of the time
series data onto the modes (time-domain approach). While the SPOD optimally
represents the flow in a statistical sense, the time-domain approach seeks an
optimal reconstruction of each instantaneous flow field. We further propose a
SPOD-based denoising strategy that is based on hard-thresholding of the SPOD
eigenvalues. The proposed strategy achieves significant noise reduction while
facilitating drastic data compression. In contrast to standard methods of
frequency-time analysis such as wavelet transform, a proposed SPOD-based
approach yields a spectrogram that characterizes the temporal evolution of
spatially coherent flow structures. In the frequency-domain, time-varying
expansion coefficients can be obtained by basing the SPOD on a sliding window.
This approach, however, is computationally intractable, and an alternative
strategy based on convolution in the time-domain is presented. When applied to
the turbulent jet data, SPOD-based frequency-time analysis reveals that the
intermittent occurrence of large-scale coherent structures is directly
associated with high-energy events. This work suggests that the time-domain
approach is preferable for low-rank reconstruction of individual snapshots, and
the frequency-domain approach for denoising and frequency-time analysis.

OPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We train the

two firms, where consumer demand depends on firms' posted prices and consumers'
price expectations called reference prices. Consumers' reference prices vary
over time according to a memory-based dynamic, which is a weighted average of
all historical prices. We focus on the setting where firms are not aware of
demand functions and how reference prices are formed but have access to an
oracle that provides a measure of consumers' responsiveness to the current
posted prices. We show that if the firms run no-regret algorithms, in
particular, online mirror descent(OMD), with decreasing step sizes, the market
stabilizes in the sense that firms' prices and reference prices converge to a
stable Nash Equilibrium (SNE). Interestingly, we also show that there exist
constant step sizesunder which the market stabilizes. We further characterize
the rate of convergence to the SNE for both decreasing and constant OMD step
sizes.

critical domains motivating this work are characterized by competitive
marketplaces with many decisionmakers. Realistically, we might expect only a
subset of them to adopt any non-compulsory fairness-conscious policy, a
situation that political philosophers call partial compliance. This possibility
raises important questions: how does the strategic behavior of decision
subjects in partial compliance settings affect the allocation outcomes? If k%
of employers were to voluntarily adopt a fairness-promoting intervention,
should we expect k% progress (in aggregate) towards the benefits of universal
adoption, or will the dynamics of partial compliance wash out the hoped-for
benefits? How might adopting a global (versus local) perspective impact the
conclusions of an auditor? In this paper, we propose a simple model of an
employment market, leveraging simulation as a tool to explore the impact of
both interaction effects and incentive effects on outcomes and auditing
metrics. Our key findings are that at equilibrium: (1) partial compliance (k%
of employers) can result in far less than proportional (k%) progress towards
the full compliance outcomes; (2) the gap is more severe when fair employers
match global (vs local) statistics; (3) choices of local vs global statistics
can paint dramatically different pictures of the performance vis-a-vis fairness
desiderata of compliant versus non-compliant employers; and (4) partial
compliance to local parity measures can induce extreme segregation.

increase quality-ofservice at wireless edge nodes. However, the beneficial role
of edge caching cannot be fully realized when the offloading link is in deep
fade. Fortunately, the impairments induced by wireless propagation environments
could be renovated by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In this
paper, a new RIS-aided edge caching system is proposed, where a network cost
minimization problem is formulated to optimize content placement at cache
units, active beamforming at base station and passive phase shifting at RIS.
After decoupling the content placement subproblem with hybrid beamforming
design, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle the active
beamforming and passive phase shifting. For active beamforming, we transform
the problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) and prove that the optimal
solution of SDP is always rank-1. For passive phase shifting, we introduce
block coordinate descent method to alternately optimize the auxiliary variables
and the RIS phase shifts. Further, a conjugate gradient algorithm based on
manifold optimization is proposed to deal with the non-convex unit-modulus

estimating unknown quantities in the face of outliers. Outliers are typically
the result of incorrect data association or feature matching, and it is common
to have problems where more than 90% of the measurements used for estimation
are outliers. While current approaches for robust estimation are able to deal
with moderate amounts of outliers, they fail to produce accurate estimates in
the presence of many outliers. This paper develops an approach to prune
outliers. First, we develop a theory of invariance that allows us to quickly
check if a subset of measurements are mutually compatible without explicitly
solving the estimation problem. Second, we develop a graph-theoretic framework,
where measurements are modeled as vertices and mutual compatibility is captured
by edges. We generalize existing results showing that the inliers form a clique
in this graph and typically belong to the maximum clique. We also show that in
practice the maximum k-core of the compatibility graph provides an
approximation of the maximum clique, while being faster to compute in large
problems. These two contributions leads to ROBIN, our approach to Reject
Outliers Based on INvariants, which allows us to quickly prune outliers in
generic estimation problems. We demonstrate ROBIN in four geometric perception
problems and show it boosts robustness of existing solvers while running in
milliseconds in large problems.

Benefiting from the fast searching and collision checking algorithms, the
planner can effectively and safely explore the state-time space to generate

leakage on the memory bus. It serves as the intermediate layer between the
trusted on-chip components and the untrusted external memory systems to
modulate the original memory access patterns into indistinguishable memory
sequences. By randomly remapping the data blocks and accessing redundant
blocks, ORAM prevents access pattern leakage through obfuscation. While there
is much prior work focusing on improving ORAM's performance on the conventional
DRAM-based memory system, when the memory technology shifts to use non-volatile
memory (NVM), new challenges come up as to how to efficiently support crash
consistency for ORAM.
  In this work, we propose EHAP-ORAM, which studies how to persist ORAM
construction with an NVM-based memory system. We first analyze the design
requirements for a persistent ORAM system and discuss the need to preserve
crash consistency and atomicity for both data and ORAM metadata. Next, we
discuss some of the challenges in the design of a persistent ORAM system and
propose some solutions to those challenges. Then, we propose the modified
on-chip ORAM controller architecture. Based on the improved hardware
architecture of the ORAM controller on-chip, we propose different persistency
protocols to ensure the crash consistency of the ORAM system and satisfy that
the metadata in PosMap is safe when it is persisted to NVM in trusted/untrusted
off-chip. The proposed architecture and persistency protocol steps minimize the
overhead and leakage during the write-back process. Finally, we compared our
persistent ORAM with the system without crash consistency support, show that in
non-recursive and recursive cases, EHAP-ORAM only incurs 3.36% and 3.65%
performance overhead. The results show that the EHAP-ORAM can support efficient
crash consistency with minimal performance and hardware overhead.

SrTiO3 substrates. Signatures of Weyl fermion transport, i.e., unsaturated
linear positive magnetoresistance accompanied by a quantum oscillation having a
{\pi} Berry phase, were observed in films with thicknesses as small as 10 nm.
Residual resistivity increased with decreasing film thickness, indicating
disorder near the interface between SrRuO3 and the SrTiO3 substrate. Since this
disorder affects the magnetic and electrical properties of the films, the Curie
temperature decreases and the coercive field increases with decreasing
thickness. Thickness-dependent magnetotransport measurements revealed that the
threshold residual resistivity ratio (RRR) to observe Weyl fermion transport is
21. These results provide guidelines for realizing quantum transport of Weyl
fermions in SrRuO3 near heterointerfaces.

congestion is obtained. The injection probability and removal probability have
a great impact on PM emissions. Moreover, the effects of motion status on

the different maximum concentration of particulate matter is emitted even if

variation in spatial details and varying contrast. Changes in particulate
matter density often lead to degradation in visibility. Therefore, several
approaches utilize multi-spectral data as auxiliary information for haze
removal. In this paper, we propose SkyGAN for haze removal in aerial images.
SkyGAN consists of 1) a domain-aware hazy-to-hyperspectral (H2H) module, and 2)
a conditional GAN (cGAN) based multi-cue image-to-image translation module
(I2I) for dehazing. The proposed H2H module reconstructs several visual bands
from RGB images in an unsupervised manner, which overcomes the lack of hazy
hyperspectral aerial image datasets. The module utilizes task supervision and
domain adaptation in order to create a ""hyperspectral catalyst"" for image
dehazing. The I2I module uses the hyperspectral catalyst along with a
12-channel multi-cue input and performs effective image dehazing by utilizing
the entire visual spectrum. In addition, this work introduces a new dataset,
called Hazy Aerial-Image (HAI) dataset, that contains more than 65,000 pairs of
hazy and ground truth aerial images with realistic, non-homogeneous haze of
varying density. The performance of SkyGAN is evaluated on the recent
SateHaze1k dataset as well as the HAI dataset. We also present a comprehensive

light of prior work rooted in sparse recovery methods, which suggest that
sample complexity in this context scales only with the number of network
changes. To shed light on when change detection is easier than structured
learning, we consider testing of edge deletion in forest-structured graphs, and
high-temperature ferromagnets as case studies. We show for these that testing
of small changes is similarly hard, but testing of \emph{large} changes is
well-separated from structure learning. These results imply that testing of

convexity leveraged for sparsity pattern recovery, and algorithm development

feature that the two sources share in common is that no evidence of GeV

strong GeV gamma-ray absorption. We show that this model can self-consistently

years, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based speaker recognition
algorithms have been proposed and achieved satisfactory performance. However,
convolutional operations are building blocks that typically perform on a local

performance. Specifically, we introduce non-local blocks where the output
response of a position is computed as a weighted sum of the input features at
all positions. Combining non-local blocks with pre-defined CNN networks, we
investigate the effectiveness of NLCNN models. Without extensive tuning, the
proposed NLCNN models outperform state-of-the-art speaker recognition
algorithms on the public Voxceleb dataset. What's more, we investigate
different types of non-local operations applied to the frequency-time domain,
time domain, frequency domain and frame-level respectively. Among them, time
domain is the most effective one for speaker recognition applications.

(TSD) and exemplified by a group with the operation $(x,y,z)\mapsto xy^{-1}z$.
We introduce and investigate framed link invariants using heaps. In analogy
with the knot group, we define the fundamental heap of framed links using group
presentations. The fundamental heap is determined for some classes of links
such as certain families of torus and pretzel links. We show that for these
families of links there exist epimorphisms from fundamental heaps to Vinberg
and Coxeter groups, implying that corresponding groups are infinite. A relation
to the Wirtinger presentation is also described. The cocycle invariant is
defined using ternary self-distributive (TSD) cohomology, by means of a state
sum that uses ternary heap $2$-cocycles as weights. This invariant corresponds
to a rack cocycle invariant for the rack constructed by doubling of a heap,
while colorings can be regarded as heap morphisms from the fundamental heap.
For the construction of the invariant, first computational methods for the heap
cohomology are developed. It is shown that the cohomology splits into two
types, called degenerate and nondegenerate, and that the degenerate part is one
dimensional. Subcomplexes are constructed based on group cosets, that allow
computations of the nondegenerate part. Computations of the cocycle invariants
are presented using the cocycles constructed, and conversely, it is proved that
the invariant values can be used to derive algebraic properties of the
cohomology.

transfers to a $3 \times \sqrt3$ and $4\times 4$ phase, the latter of which is
a projection of the bulk counterpart, at critical doping concentrations of
around 0.2 holes per formula unit and 0.25 electrons per formula unit,
respectively. The $4\times 4$ CDW phase can also be stabilized under
compressive strain. Although electron-phonon coupling is prevailing in the CDW
formation, we show that Fermi surface nesting is a good starting point to
explain most of these transitions in monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. These results make

  exponential families","24 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.ST cs.DS math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysis of low-degree polynomial algorithms is a powerful, newly-popular
method for predicting computational thresholds in hypothesis testing problems.
One limitation of current techniques for this analysis is their restriction to
Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions. We expand this range of possibilities by
performing the low-degree analysis of hypothesis testing for the Morris class
of exponential families, giving a unified treatment of Gaussian, Poisson,
gamma, binomial, negative binomial, and generalized hyperbolic secant
distributions. We then give several algorithmic applications.
  1. In models where a random signal is observed through an exponential family,
the success or failure of low-degree polynomials is governed by the $z$-score
overlap, the inner product of $z$-score vectors with respect to the null
distribution of two independent copies of the signal.
  2. In the same models, testing with low-degree polynomials exhibits channel
monotonicity: the above distributions admit a total ordering by computational
cost of hypothesis testing, according to a scalar parameter describing how the
variance depends on the mean in an exponential family.
  3. In a spiked matrix model with a particular non-Gaussian noise
distribution, the low-degree prediction is incorrect unless polynomials with
arbitrarily large degree in individual matrix entries are permitted. This shows
that polynomials summing over self-avoiding walks and variants thereof, as
proposed recently by Ding, Hopkins, and Steurer (2020) for spiked matrix models
with heavy-tailed noise, are suboptimal for this model. Thus low-degree
polynomials appear to offer a tradeoff between robustness and strong
performance fine-tuned to specific models, and may struggle with problems
requiring an algorithm to first examine the input and then use some
intermediate computation to choose from one of several inference subroutines.

studies a Ramsey growth model with endogenous structural transformation in

allocation with the chosen structure, and consumption to maximize the
representative household's total utility subject to the resource constraint.
The paper next establishes the mathematical underpinning of the static,
dynamic, and structural equilibria. The Ramsey growth model and its equilibria
are then extended to economies with complicated economic structures consisting
of hierarchical production, composite consumption, technology adoption and
innovation, infrastructure, and economic and political institutions. The paper
concludes with a brief discussion of applications of the proposed methodology

protocol has received great attention in the area of WiFi positioning. It
provides an acceptable ranging accuracy in favorable environments when a
line-of-sight (LOS) path exists. Otherwise, a signal is detoured along with
non-LOS paths, making the resultant ranging results different from the
ground-truth, called an RTT bias, which is the main reason for poor positioning
performance. To address it, we aim at leveraging the user mobility trajectory
detected by a smartphone's inertial measurement units, called pedestrian dead
reckoning (PDR). Specifically, PDR provides the geographic relation among
adjacent locations, guiding the resultant positioning estimates' sequence not
to deviate from the user trajectory. To this end, we describe their relations
as multiple geometric equations, enabling us to render a novel positioning
algorithm with acceptable accuracy. Depending on the mobility pattern being
linear or arbitrary, we develop different algorithms divided into two phases.
First, we can jointly estimate an RTT bias of each AP and the user's step
length by leveraging the geometric relation mentioned above. It enables us to
construct a user's relative trajectory defined on the concerned AP's local
coordinate system. Second, we align every AP's relative trajectory into a
single one, called trajectory alignment, equivalent to transformation to the
global coordinate system. As a result, we can estimate the sequence of the
user's absolute locations from the aligned trajectory. Various field
experiments extensively verify the proposed algorithm's effectiveness that the
average positioning error is approximately 0.369 (m) and 1.705 (m) in LOS and
NLOS environments, respectively.

constraints, while supporting time-varying references and constraints. In
embedded implementation using a Raspberry-Pi platform, we experimentally
demonstrate that it is possible to train constrained control policies purely
based on the measurements of the unknown nonlinear system. We compare the
control performance of the DPC method against explicit MPC and report
efficiency gains in online computational demands, memory requirements, policy

which we are given real polynomials $f_0,f_1,\dots, f_k$ and the question is to
decide whether $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots,f_k$. In the
more stringent version the task is also to find a proof of this fact. The IMP
underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz,
Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. In the majority of such applications
the IMP involves so called combinatorial ideals that arise from a variety of
discrete combinatorial problems. This restriction makes the IMP significantly
easier and in some cases allows for an efficient algorithm to solve it.
  The first part of this paper follows the work of Mastrolilli [SODA'19] who
initiated a systematic study of IMPs arising from Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (CSP) of the form $CSP(\Gamma)$, that is, CSPs in which the type of
constraints is limited to relations from a set $\Gamma$. We show that many CSP
techniques can be translated to IMPs thus allowing us to significantly improve
the methods of studying the complexity of the IMP. We also develop universal
algebraic techniques for the IMP that have been so useful in the study of the
CSP. This allows us to prove a general necessary condition for the tractability
of the IMP, and three sufficient ones. The sufficient conditions include IMPs
arising from systems of linear equations over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime, and also some
conditions defined through special kinds of polymorphisms.
  Our work has several consequences and applications in terms of bit complexity
of sum-of-squares (SOS) proofs and their automatizability, and studying

a method to incorporate considerations of coil complexity in the optimization
of the plasma boundary. Coil complexity metrics are computed from the current
potential solution obtained with the REGCOIL code (Landreman 2017 Nucl. Fusion

perturbations of the plasma boundary using the shape gradient (Landreman & Paul

metrics with respect to parameters describing the plasma boundary. In keeping
with previous research on winding surface optimization (Paul et al. 2018 Nucl.
Fusion 58 076015), the shape derivatives are computed with a discrete adjoint
method. In contrast with the previous work, derivatives are computed with
respect to the plasma rather than the winding surface parameters. To further
reduce the required resolution, we present a more efficient representation of
the plasma surface using a single Fourier series to describe the radial
distance from a coordinate axis and a spectrally condensed poloidal angle. This
representation is advantageous over the standard cylindrical representation
used in the VMEC code (Hirshman & Whitson 1983 The Physics of Fluids 26
3553-3568), as it provides a uniquely defined poloidal angle, eliminating a
null space in the optimization of the plasma surface. The resulting shape
gradient highlights features of the plasma boundary consistent with simple
coils and can be used to couple coil and fixed-boundary optimization.

|u(t,\cdot)-u_0^{shock}(\cdot -x(t))|^2\,dx\leq \int_{\mathbb
R}|u_0-u_0^{shock}|^2 +C\mu_+([0,t]\times\R), \end{align*} for some Lipschitz
shift $x(t)$, includes an error term accounting for the positive part of the
entropy production measure $\mu=\partial_t(u^2/2)+\partial_x q(u)$, where
$q'(u)=uf'(u)$. Stability estimates in this general non-entropic setting are of
interest in connection with large deviation principles for the hydrodynamic
limit of asymmetric interacting particle systems.
  Our proof adapts the scheme devised by Leger and Vasseur, where one
constructs a shift $x(t)$ which allows to bound from above the time-derivative
of the left-hand side. The main difference lies in the fact that our solution
$u(t,\cdot)$ may present a non-entropic shock at $x=x(t)$ and new bounds are
needed in that situation. We also generalize this stability estimate to initial
data with bounded variation.

Fluid Mech. 917 (2021) A9","10.1017/jfm.2021.268",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimation of the initial state of turbulent channel flow from limited data
is investigated using an adjoint-variational approach. The data are generated
from a reference direct numerical simulation (DNS) which is sub-sampled at
different spatiotemporal resolutions. When the velocity data are at 1/4096 the
spatiotemporal resolution of DNS, the correlation coefficient between the true
and adjoint-variational estimated state exceeds 99 percent. The robustness of
the algorithm to observation noise is demonstrated. In addition, the impact of
the spatiotemporal density of the data on estimation quality is evaluated, and
a resolution threshold is established for a successful reconstruction. The
critical spanwise data resolution is proportional to the Taylor microscale,
which characterizes the domain of dependence of an observation location. Due to
mean advection, either the streamwise or temporal data resolution must satisfy
a criterion based on the streamwise Taylor microscale. A second configuration
is considered where the sub-sampled data are comprised of velocities in the
outer layer and wall shear stresses only. The near-wall flow statistics and
coherent structures, although not sampled, are accurately reconstructed, which
is possible because of the coupling between the outer flow and near-wall
motions. Finally, the most challenging configuration is addressed where only
the spatiotemporally resolved wall stresses are observed. The estimation
remains accurate within the viscous sublayer and deteriorates significantly
with distance from the wall. In wall units, this trend is nearly independent of
the Reynolds number considered, and is indicative of the fundamental difficulty
of reconstructing wall-detached motions from wall data.

investigation and often limited to post mortem research on smartphone or
computer while wiretapping is limited to metadata information. Therefore, it
provides only historical data or metadata while law enforcement officers want a
continuous stream of live and substantive information. This paper identified
that gap in available scenarios for law enforcement investigations and
identified a gap in methods available for forensic acquiring and processing
these scenarios. In this paper, we propose a forensic approach to create
real-time insight in the WhatsApp communication. Our approach is based on the
wiretapping, decrypting WhatsApp databases, open source intelligence and
WhatsApp Web communication analysis. We also evaluate our method with different
scenarios in WhatsApp forensics to prove its feasibility and efficiency.

(O-RAN) framework, which has continued the 3GPP effort towards the definition
of new virtualized and multi-vendor RAN architectures. Basically, fronthaul
compression is achieved by means of reducing the modulation order, thus
enabling a dramatic reduction of the required fronthaul capacity with a simple
technique. In this work, we provide a survey of the architectures, functional
splits, and fronthaul compression techniques envisioned in 3GPP and O-RAN.
Then, we focus on assessing the trade-offs that modulation compression exhibits
in terms of reduced fronthaul capacity versus the impact on the air interface
performance, through a dynamic multi-cell system-level simulation. For that, we
use an ns-3 based system-level simulator compliant with 5G New Radio (NR)
specifications and evaluate different traffic load conditions and NR
numerologies. In a multi-cell scenario, our results show that an 82% reduction
of the required fronthaul capacity can be achieved with negligible air
interface performance degradation by reducing the modulation order down to
64QAM, for different numerologies and load conditions. A higher modulation
order reduction without degradation is permitted in low/medium traffic loads
(reaching up to 94% fronthaul capacity reduction).

younger age and lower [$\alpha$/Fe] than the S0s over the whole mass range. In
the field/group, stellar populations show a similar trend between passive

flattening with increasing mass above log(M$_\star$/M$_\odot)\gtrsim10.5$,

source domain to target domain. Most of DA methods focus on enhancing feature
transferability through domain-invariance learning. However, source-learned
discriminability itself might be tailored to be biased and unsafely
transferable by spurious correlations, \emph{i.e.}, part of source-specific
features are correlated with category labels. We find that standard
domain-invariance learning suffers from such correlations and incorrectly
transfers the source-specifics. To address this issue, we intervene in the
learning of feature discriminability using unlabeled target data to guide it to
get rid of the domain-specific part and be safely transferable. Concretely, we
generate counterfactual features that distinguish the domain-specifics from
domain-sharable part through a novel feature intervention strategy. To prevent
the residence of domain-specifics, the feature discriminability is trained to
be invariant to the mutations in the domain-specifics of counterfactual
features. Experimenting on typical \emph{one-to-one} unsupervised domain
adaptation and challenging domain-agnostic adaptation tasks, the consistent
performance improvements of our method over state-of-the-art approaches
validate that the learned discriminative features are more safely transferable

temporal graph (among other names). Such a graph is temporally connected if
each ordered pair of vertices is connected by a path which traverses edges in
chronological order (i.e., a temporal path). In this paper, we consider a
simple model of random temporal graph, obtained from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graph $G~G_{n,p}$ by considering a random permutation $\pi$ of the edges
and interpreting the ranks in $\pi$ as presence times. Temporal reachability in
this model exhibits a surprisingly regular sequence of thresholds. In
particular, we show that at $p=\log n/n$ any fixed pair of vertices can a.a.s.
reach each other; at $2\log n/n$ at least one vertex (and in fact, any fixed
vertex) can a.a.s. reach all others; and at $3\log n/n$ all the vertices can
a.a.s. reach each other, i.e., the graph is temporally connected. Furthermore,
the graph admits a temporal spanner of size $2n+o(n)$ as soon as it becomes
temporally connected, which is nearly optimal as $2n-4$ is a lower bound. This
result is significant because temporal graphs do not admit spanners of size
$O(n)$ in general (Kempe et al, STOC 2000). In fact, they do not even admit
spanners of size $o(n^2)$ (Axiotis et al, ICALP 2016). Thus, our result implies
that the obstructions found in these works, and more generally, all
non-negligible obstructions, must be statistically insignificant: nearly
optimal spanners always exist in random temporal graphs. All the above
thresholds are sharp. Carrying the study of temporal spanners further, we show
that pivotal spanners -- i.e., spanners of size $2n-2$ made of two spanning
trees glued at a single vertex (one descending in time, the other ascending
subsequently) -- exist a.a.s. at $4\log n/n$, this threshold being also sharp.
Finally, we show that optimal spanners (of size $2n-4$) also exist a.a.s. at $p
= 4\log n/n$.

dexterity by devising new mechanical structures and actuation systems. However,
most of them rely on a single structure/system (e.g., bone-only) and ignore the
fact that the human hand is composed of multiple functional structures (e.g.,
skin, bones, muscles, and tendons). This not only increases the difficulty of
the design process but also lowers the robustness and flexibility of the
fabricated hand. Besides, other factors like customization, the time and cost
for production, and the degree of resemblance between human hands and robotic
hands, remain omitted. To tackle these problems, this study proposes a 3D
printable multi-layer design that models the hand with the layers of skin,
tissues, and bones. The proposed design first obtains the 3D surface model of a
target hand via 3D scanning, and then generates the 3D bone models from the
surface model based on a fast template matching method. To overcome the
disadvantage of the rigid bone layer in deformation, the tissue layer is
introduced and represented by a concentric tube based structure, of which the
deformability can be explicitly controlled by a parameter. Besides, a low-cost
yet effective underactuated system is adopted to drive the fabricated hand. The
proposed design is tested with 33 widely used object grasping types, as well as
special objects like fragile silken tofu, and outperforms previous designs
remarkably. With the proposed design, anthropomorphic robotic hands can be
produced fast with low cost, and be customizable and deformable.

remains commonplace for developers to retain little conceptual understanding of

assistant to whom developers can easily ask questions in order to learn how to
incorporate different privacy-preserving ideas into their IoT application
designs. This paper lays the foundations toward developing such a privacy
assistant by synthesising existing PbD knowledge so as to elicit requirements.
It is believed that such a privacy assistant should not just prescribe a list
of privacy-preserving ideas that developers should incorporate into their
design. Instead, it should explain how each prescribed idea helps to protect
privacy in a given application design context-this approach is defined as
'Explainable Privacy'. A total of 74 privacy patterns were analysed and
reviewed using ten different PbD schemes to understand how each privacy pattern
is built and how each helps to ensure privacy. Due to page limitations, we have
presented a detailed analysis in [3]. In addition, different real-world
Internet of Things (IoT) use-cases, including a healthcare application, were
used to demonstrate how each privacy pattern could be applied to a given
application design. By doing so, several knowledge engineering requirements
were identified that need to be considered when developing a privacy assistant.
It was also found that, when compared to other IoT application domains, privacy
patterns can significantly benefit healthcare applications. In conclusion, this
paper identifies the research challenges that must be addressed if one wishes
to construct an intelligent privacy assistant that can truly augment software
developers' capabilities at the design phase.

policy implicitly models the interactions between traffic agents and computes
safe trajectories for the ego-vehicle accounting for aggressive driver

wherein teacher and student models are fed by a synthetic sample generator

fine-tuning of weights to balance multiple losses, and ignore the diversity of

Without real data, the objectives of seeking high sample authenticity and class

We mitigate this by exponentially penalizing loss increments. With MNIST,

decoders that allow an Eve to determine the transmitted message with high

eavesdropping attacks even when relatively secure transmission techniques are
employed, such as symbol-level precoding (SLP). To counteract this attack, we
propose two novel SLP-based schemes that increase the bit-error rate at Eve by
impeding the learning process. We design these two security-enhanced schemes to
meet different requirements regarding complexity, security, and power

achieved without affecting the decoding performance at the intended users.

respectively, but higher mineral soil C concentration (11%, 22%, and 156%) and
stock (9%, 10%, and 6%) under broadleaved, AM, and N-fixing trees respectively;

over a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By learning rich
language knowledge with millions of parameters, these models are usually
overparameterized and significantly increase the computational overhead in
applications. It is intuitive to address this issue by model compression. In
this work, we propose a method, called Single-Shot Meta-Pruning, to compress
deep pre-trained Transformers before fine-tuning. Specifically, we focus on
pruning unnecessary attention heads adaptively for different downstream tasks.
To measure the informativeness of attention heads, we train our Single-Shot
Meta-Pruner (SMP) with a meta-learning paradigm aiming to maintain the
distribution of text representations after pruning. Compared with existing
compression methods for pre-trained models, our method can reduce the overhead
of both fine-tuning and inference. Experimental results show that our pruner
can selectively prune 50% of attention heads with little impact on the
performance on downstream tasks and even provide better text representations.
The source code will be released in the future.

  Arteriolosclerosis","Accepted in PLOS Digital Health",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The status of retinal arteriovenous crossing is of great significance for
clinical evaluation of arteriolosclerosis and systemic hypertension. As an
ophthalmology diagnostic criteria, Scheie's classification has been used to
grade the severity of arteriolosclerosis. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning approach to support the diagnosis process, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is one of the earliest attempts in medical imaging. The proposed
pipeline is three-fold. First, we adopt segmentation and classification models
to automatically obtain vessels in a retinal image with the corresponding
artery/vein labels and find candidate arteriovenous crossing points. Second, we
use a classification model to validate the true crossing point. At last, the
grade of severity for the vessel crossings is classified. To better address the
problem of label ambiguity and imbalanced label distribution, we propose a new
model, named multi-diagnosis team network (MDTNet), in which the sub-models
with different structures or different loss functions provide different
decisions. MDTNet unifies these diverse theories to give the final decision
with high accuracy. Our severity grading method was able to validate crossing
points with precision and recall of 96.3% and 96.3%, respectively. Among
correctly detected crossing points, the kappa value for the agreement between
the grading by a retina specialist and the estimated score was 0.85, with an
accuracy of 0.92. The numerical results demonstrate that our method can achieve
a good performance in both arteriovenous crossing validation and severity
grading tasks. By the proposed models, we could build a pipeline reproducing
retina specialist's subjective grading without feature extractions. The code is
available for reproducibility.

a tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg at the time about 150 days after the
peak of the optical/UV luminosity. We propose that such a association could be
interpreted as arising from hadronic interactions between relativistic protons
accelerated in the jet launched from the TDE and the intense radiation field of
TDE inside the optical/UV photosphere, if we are observing the jet at a
moderate angle (i.e., approximately 10-30 degree) with respect to the jet axis.
Such an off-axis viewing angle leads to a high gas column density in the line
of sight which provides a high opacity for the photoionization and the
Bethe-Heitler process, {and allows the existence of an intrinsic long-term
X-ray radiation of comparatively high emissivity}. As a result, the cascade
emission accompanying the neutrino production, which would otherwise overshoot
the flux limits in X-ray and/or GeV band, is significantly obscured or
absorbed. Since the jets of TDEs are supposed to be randomly oriented in the
sky, the source density rate of TDE with an off-axis jet is significantly
higher than that of TDE with an on-axis jet. Therefore, an off-axis jet is
naturally expected in a nearby TDE being discovered, supporting the proposed
scenario.

exemplified in Poisson's equation, the heat equation and the wave equation. The
finite difference operators satisfy a summation-by-parts property, which mimics
the integration-by-parts. Since the operators approximate the second
derivative, they are singular by construction. To impose boundary conditions,
these operators are modified using Simultaneous Approximation Terms. This makes
the modified matrices non-singular, for most choices of boundary conditions.
Recently, inverses of such matrices were derived. However, when considering
Neumann boundary conditions on both boundaries, the modified matrix is still
singular. For such matrices, we have derived an explicit expression for the
Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, which can be used for solving elliptic problems
and some time-dependent problems. The condition for this new pseudoinverse to
be valid, is that the modified matrix does not have more than one zero
eigenvalue. We have reconstructed the sixth order accurate narrow-stencil
operator with a free parameter and show that more than one zero eigenvalue can
occur. We have performed a detailed analysis on the free parameter to improve
the properties of the second derivative operator. We complement the derivations

$2^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} n\log n$ time. This improves the previously

$(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}n \log n$ of the algorithm by Rao and

proposed by Arora (J. ACM 1998), but it adds a new idea that we call
sparsity-sensitive patching. On a high level this lets the granularity with
which we simplify the tour depend on how sparse it is locally. We demonstrate
that our technique extends to other problems, by showing that for Steiner Tree

Different from commonly used assumption of the time-invariant wireless channel,
we focus on the research on the time-varying wireless downlink channel to get
close to the practical situation. Our objective is to gain the maximum value of
sum rate in the time-varying channel under the some constraints about cut-off
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR), transmitted power and
beamforming. In order to adapt the rapid changing channel, we abandon the
frequently used algorithm convex optimization and deep reinforcement learning
algorithms are used in this paper. From the view of the ordinary measures such
as power control, interference incoordination and beamforming, continuous
changes of measures should be put into consideration while sparse reward
problem due to the abortion of episodes as an important bottleneck should not
be ignored. Therefore, with the analysis of relevant algorithms, we proposed
two algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) and
hierarchical DDPG, in our work. As for these two algorithms, in order to solve
the discrete output, DDPG is established by combining the Actor-Critic
algorithm with Deep Q-learning (DQN), so that it can output the continuous
actions without sacrificing the existed advantages brought by DQN and also can
improve the performance. Also, to address the challenge of sparse reward, we
take advantage of meta policy from the idea of hierarchical theory to divide
one agent in DDPG into one meta-controller and one controller as hierarchical
DDPG. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDPG and
hierarchical DDPG performs well from the views of coverage, convergence and sum

treatment for the practical case of the 2D-cylindrical geometry. The obtained
results confirm the considerable potential of this approach which is applied
here for the first time to the case of the radiant light transfer in
participating and reactive media. This enables to define clearly, from a
theoretical point of view, the concept of ideal PBR (both for solar or

cases to volumetrically-lightened PBR, mainly for the solar DiCoFluV (Dilution

last case, the results of the calculations allow to announce maximal biomass
productivities as thermodynamic limits, what can contribute to clarify a today

establishes guidelines to conceive more efficient largescale PBR of any desired

is accurately known thanks to reconciled quantum sensor and actinometry
experiments. The incident photon direction is perpendicular to the reactor
windows; in such a configuration the radiative transfer description may be
properly approximated as a one dimensional problem in Cartesian geometry. Based
on accurate pressure measurement in the gas tight photoreactor, the production
rates of H2 (using CdS particles in association with sulphide and sulfite ions
as hole scavengers) are easily and trustingly obtained. First estimations of
apparent quantum yield have proven to be dependent on mean volumetric rate of
radiant light energy absorbed hence demonstrating the need for the use of a
radiative transfer approach to understand the observed phenomena and for the
proper formulation of the thermo-kinetic coupling.

incident photon flux density by actinometry is presented that opens the door to
investigation of large-scale intensified photoreactors. The approach is based
on an original concept: the analysis of the probability that a photon entering
the reaction volume is absorbed by the actinometer. Whereas this probability is
assumed to be equal to one in classical actinometry, this assumption can no
longer be satisfied in many practical situations in which optical thicknesses
are low. Here we remove this restriction by using most recent advances in the
field of radiative transfer Monte Carlo, in order to rigorously evaluate the
instantaneous absorption-probability as a function of conversion.
Implementation is performed in EDStar, an open-source development environment
that enables straightforward simulation of reactors with any geometry (directly
provided by their CAD-file), with the very same Monte Carlo algorithm.
Experimental investigations are focused on Reinecke salt photodissociation in
two reactors designed for the study of natural and artificial photosynthesis.
The first reactor investigated serves as reference configuration: its simple
torus geometry allows to compare flux densities measured with quantum sensors
and actinometry. Validations and analysis are carried out on this reactor.
Then, the approach is implemented on a 25 L photobioreactor with complex
geometry corresponding to one thousand light-diffusing optical fibers
distributing incident photons within the reaction volume. Results show that
classical actinometry neglecting radiative transfer can lead to 50 percent
error when measuring incident flux density for such reactors. Finally, we show
how this radiative transfer approach paves the way for analyzing high
conversion as a mean to investigate angular distribution of incident photons.

real-world, pose-annotated RGB-D data for unknown objects. Our method not only
circumvents the need for a prior 3D object model (textured or otherwise) but
also bypasses complicated setups of fiducial markers, turntables, and sensors.
With the help of a human user, we first source minimalistic labelings of an
ordered set of arbitrarily chosen keypoints over a set of RGB-D videos. Then,
by solving an optimization problem, we combine these labels under a world frame
to recover a sparse, keypoint-based representation of the object. The sparse
representation leads to the development of a dense model and the pose labels
for each image frame in the set of scenes. We show that the sparse model can
also be efficiently used for scaling to a large number of new scenes. We
demonstrate the practicality of the generated labeled dataset by training a

in many disciplines including social choice, game theory, political science,
and public choice. Despite a large body of literature and the common belief
that ties are rare, little is known about how rare ties are in large elections
except for a few simple positional scoring rules under the i.i.d. uniform
distribution over the votes, known as the Impartial Culture (IC) in social
choice. In particular, little progress was made after Marchant explicitly posed
the likelihood of k-way ties under IC as an open question in 2001.
  We give an asymptotic answer to the open question for a wide range of
commonly studied voting rules under a model that is much more general and
realistic than i.i.d. models (especially IC) -- the smoothed social choice
framework by Xia that was inspired by the celebrated smoothed complexity
analysis by Spielman and Teng. We prove dichotomy theorems on the smoothed
likelihood of ties under positional scoring rules, edge-order-based rules, and
some multi-round score-based elimination rules, which include commonly studied
voting rules such as plurality, Borda, veto, maximin, Copeland, ranked pairs,
Schulze, STV, and Coombs as special cases. We also complement the theoretical
results by experiments on synthetic data and real-world rank data on Preflib.
Our main technical tool is an improved dichotomous characterization on the
smoothed likelihood for a Poisson multinomial variable to be in a polyhedron,
which is proved by exploring the interplay between the V-representation and the

attack (adv.PGD) is considered as one of the most effective ways to achieve
moderate adversarial robustness. However, adv.PGD requires too much training
time since the projected gradient attack (PGD) takes multiple iterations to
generate perturbations. On the other hand, adversarial training with the fast
gradient sign method (adv.FGSM) takes much less training time since the fast
gradient sign method (FGSM) takes one step to generate perturbations but fails
to increase adversarial robustness. In this work, we extend adv.FGSM to make it

curvature along FGSM perturbed direction leads to a large difference in
performance of adversarial robustness between adv.FGSM and adv.PGD, and
therefore propose combining adv.FGSM with a curvature regularization
(adv.FGSMR) in order to bridge the performance gap between adv.FGSM and

point depends on a fixed shape of neighboring points in an input grid. Stencil
computations are prevalent in scientific applications engaging a significant
portion of supercomputing resources. Therefore, it has been always important to
optimize stencil programs for the best performance. A rich body of research has
focused on optimizing stencil computations on almost all parallel
architectures. Stencil applications have regular dependency patterns, inherent
pipeline-parallelism, and plenty of data reuse. This makes these applications a
perfect match for a coarse-grained reconfigurable spatial architecture (CGRA).
A CGRA consists of many simple, small processing elements (PEs) connected with
an on-chip network. Each PE can be configured to execute part of a stencil
computation and all PEs run in parallel; the network can also be configured so
that data loaded can be passed from a PE to a neighbor PE directly and thus
reused by many PEs without register spilling and memory traffic. How to
efficiently map a stencil computation to a CGRA is the key to performance. In
this paper, we show a few unique and generalizable ways of mapping one- and
multidimensional stencil computations to a CGRA, fully exploiting the data
reuse opportunities and parallelism. Our simulation experiments demonstrate

photobioreactors of very different conceptions and designs, cultivating the
cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis, on a wide range of volumes and
hemispherical incident light fluxes. The practical usefulness of the proposed
formula is demonstrated by the fact that it appears completely independent of
the characteristics of the material phase (as the type of reactor, the kind of
mixing, the biomass concentration), according to the first principle of
thermodynamics and to the Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem. Its ability to give the
maximum (only) kinetic performance of photobioreactors cultivating many
different photoautotrophic strains (cyanobacteria, green algae, eukaryotic

that the maximum productivities can be maintained over 30 residence times with
only minor changes in the pigment content of the cells corresponding to a
well-known adaptation mechanism of the photosystems, but without any effect on
growth and stoichiometry. For both poly and monochromatic incident light

returns in online performance. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of
recommenders varies depending on the amount of initial offline data available.

requires the modulated radio frequency (RF) signal to be real and non-negative.
To satisfy the requirements, this paper proposes two types of mixed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (X-OFDM) waveform. The Hermitian symmetry (HS)
character of the sub-carriers in the frequency domain, guarantees the signal in
the time domain to be real, which reduces the spectral efficiency to $1/2$. For
the odd sub-carriers in the frequency domain, the signal in the time domain
after the inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) is antisymmetric. For the even
sub-carriers in the frequency domain, the signal in the time domain after the
IFFT is symmetric. Based on the antisymmetric and symmetric characters, the two
types of X-OFDM waveform are designed to guarantee the signal in the time
domain to be non-negative, where the direct current (DC) bias is not needed.
With $N$ sub-carriers in the frequency domain, the generated signal in the time
domain has $3N/2$ points, which further reduces the spectral efficiency to $1/3
= 1/2 \times 2/3$. The numerical simulations show that, the two types of X-OFDM
waveform greatly enhance the power efficiency considering the OWC channel with
the signal-dependent noise and/or the signal-independent noise.

change are inconsistent and unpredictable. Thus, the application of a
multi-regime method would be problematic, even when separate sets of model

online parametric algorithm to determine the change-points for ambient
