  backgrounds","15 pages. Expanded discussions, results unchanged",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show a new class of interaction terms with higher derivatives that can be
added to every low derivative real scalar, such that the theory is degenerate,
and the equation of motion remains of second order. In contrast to previous
setups, the necessary constraints that eliminate the ghosts also have a clear
physical motivation: they impose and preserve at all times the low derivative
dynamics of the real scalar as a background, on top of which, the fluctuations
induced by these higher derivative terms are degenerate, and ghost-free. We
summarize the setup for these constrained ghost-free real scalars in a two-step
prescription. In contrast to some models with first-order derivative
interactions with applications for dark energy and inflation, these theories
with necessarily constrained second-order derivative self-interactions do not
modify the speed of propagation, neither the cone of influence for the field
equations, which are prescribed by the low derivative background that is also
essential to eliminate the ghost; hence, avoiding the potential superluminality
issues of the former.

right-chiral and left-chiral parts of the two-component Dirac wave function
that satisfies the Majorana condition, in the Weyl representation, describe

the nonzero component of each of these two two-component wave functions

demonstrate that for a 1D Weyl-Majorana particle in a box, the nonzero

statements hold: 1) all transformations are achieved by a unitary interaction
followed by a von Neumann measurement; 2) all mixed states are marginals of
pure entangled states. I name this doctrine the dogma of purification ontology.
The source of the dogma is the original von Neumann axiomatisation of the
theory, which largely relies on the Schroedinger equation as a postulate, which
holds in a nonrelativistic context, and whose operator version holds only in
free quantum field theory, but no longer in the interacting theory. In the
present paper I prove that both ontologies of unitarity and state purity are
unfalsifiable, even in principle, and therefore axiomatically spurious. I
propose instead a minimal four-postulate axiomatisation: 1) associate a Hilbert
space HA to each system A; 2) compose two systems by the tensor product rule
HAB = HAxHB; 3) associate a transformation from system A to B to a quantum
operation, i.e. to a completely positive trace-non-increasing map between the
trace-class operators of A and B; 4) (Born rule) evaluate all joint
probabilities through that of a special type of quantum operation: the state
preparation. I then conclude that quantum paradoxes-such as the
Schroedinger-cat's, and, most relevantly, the information paradox-are
originated only by the dogma of purification ontology, and they are no longer
paradoxes of the theory in the minimal formulation. For the same reason, most
interpretations of the theory (e.g. many-world, relational, Darwinism,
transactional, von Neumann-Wigner, time-symmetric, ...) interpret the same
dogma, not the strict theory stripped of the spurious postulates.

$U(\mathcal{M}_G)$ in a small neighborhood of that vertex can be well
approximated based on a somewhat larger neighborhood of the same vertex. Then
we show that the normalized Shannon entropy of $U(\mathcal{M}_G)$ can be also
well approximated using the local structure of $G$. In other words, in the
realm of trees, the normalized Shannon entropy of $U(\mathcal{M}_G)$ -- that

  We show that $U(\mathcal{M}_G)$ is a determinantal process through
establishing a new connection between $U(\mathcal{M}_G)$ and the adjacency

the nullity of the adjacency matrix.
  Some of the proofs are based on the well established method of introducing a
new perturbative parameter, which we call temperature, and then define the
positive temperature analogue of $\mathcal{M}_G$, the so called monomer-dimer

the distribution mismatch between the data distribution and occupancy measure

policy optimization and establish a finite-sample error bound depending on the
ratio between the number of relevant features and restricted minimal eigenvalue
of the data's covariance. In the end, we complement the results with minimax
lower bounds for batch-data policy evaluation/optimization that nearly match

Within planning, what choices drive performance? (3) To what extent does
planning improve generalization? To answer these questions, we study the
performance of MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art MBRL

learning process, both for policy updates and for providing a more useful data
distribution. (2) Using shallow trees with simple Monte-Carlo rollouts is as
performant as more complex methods, except in the most difficult reasoning
tasks. (3) Planning alone is insufficient to drive strong generalization. These

topological invariant composed of the two - point Green function. Such a
topological invariant is known both for the case of homogeneous systems with
intrinsic Anomalous Quantum Hall Effect (AQHE) and for the case of IQHE in the
inhomogeneous systems. In the latter case we may speak, for example, of the
AQHE in the presence of elastic deformations and of the IQHE in presence of
magnetic field. The topological invariant for the general case of inhomogeneous
systems is expressed through the Wigner transformed Green functions and
contains Moyal product. When it is reduced to the expression for the IQHE in
the homogeneous systems the Moyal product is reduced to the ordinary one while
the Wigner transformed Green function (defined in phase space) is reduced to
the Green function in momentum space. Originally the mentioned above
topological representation has been derived for the non - interacting systems.
We demonstrate that in a wide range of different cases in the presence of
interactions the Hall conductivity is given by the same expression, in which
the noninteracting two - point Green function is substituted by the complete
two - point Green function with the interactions taken into account. Several
types of interactions are considered including the contact four - fermion
interactions, Yukawa and Coulomb interactions. We present the complete proof of
this statement up to the two loops, and argue that the similar result remains
to all orders of perturbation theory. It is based on the incorporation of
Wigner - Weyl calculus to the perturbation theory. We, therefore, formulate
Feynmann rules of diagram technique in terms of the Wigner transformed
propagators.

between muscular contraction in the thorax, elasto-capillary interactions in

considerably different length and time scales; consequently, linking them to
the biomechanical properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together
control the spatiotemporal features of inhalation, remains a challenge. We
address this challenge by developing a computational model of the lungs as a
hierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders
coupled to a viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a
pressure that is determined by input biomechanical parameters, enabling us to
test the influence of changes in the mechanical properties of lung tissues and
secretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches,
we quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during
inhalation, reproducing the shape of measured breathing curves. Using this
model, we demonstrate how changes in lung muscle contraction, mucus viscosity
and surface tension, and airway wall stiffness---characteristic of many
respiratory diseases, including those arising from COVID-19, cystic fibrosis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and emphysema---drastically
alter inhaled lung capacity and breathing duration. Our work therefore helps to
identify the key factors that control breathing dynamics, and provides a way to
quantify how disease-induced changes in these factors lead to respiratory
distress.

the dynamics of epidemics on networks in order to help design a multi-network

this, we start with the SIR model (susceptible, infected, removed) on a network
in which nodes represent cities or regions and edges are weighted by flows
between regions. Since the goal is to stabilize the zero infections steady
state, we linearize the discrete-time SIR model yielding difference equations
for the dynamics of infections at each node and then include flows of
infections from other nodes. This yields a vector difference equation for the
spread of infections. We then generalize the concept of stochastic matrix in
order to quantify the dynamics of this update equation. The entries of the
update matrix $M$ may vary in time, even discontinuously as flows between nodes
are turned on and off. This may yield useful design constraints for a
multi-network composed of weak and strong interactions between pairs of nodes
representing interactions within and among cities.

data structure operations given a sequential data structure specification and
knowledge about concurrent behavior. Designing concurrent code is a non-trivial
task even in simplest of cases. Humans often design concurrent data structure
operations by transforming sequential versions into their respective concurrent
versions. This requires an understanding of the data structure, its sequential
behavior, thread interactions during concurrent execution and shared memory
synchronization primitives. We mechanize this design process using automated
commonsense reasoning. We assume that the data structure description is
provided as axioms alongside the sequential code of its algebraic operations.
This information is used to automatically derive concurrent code for that data
structure, such as dictionary operations for linked lists and binary search
trees. Knowledge in our case is expressed using Answer Set Programming (ASP),
and we employ deduction, induction and abduction---just as humans do---in the
reasoning involved. ASP allows for succinct modeling of first order theories of
pointer data structures, run-time thread interactions and shared memory
synchronization. Our reasoner can systematically make the same judgments as a
human reasoner while constructing provably safe concurrent code. We present
several reasoning challenges involved in transforming the sequential data
structure into its equivalent concurrent version. All the reasoning tasks are
encoded in ASP and our reasoner can make sound judgments to transform
sequential code into concurrent code. To the best of our knowledge, our work is
the first one to use commonsense reasoning to automatically transform

  As a consequence, the problem of computing non-crossing shortest paths and
their lengths in a plane undirected weighted graph can be solved in $O(n\log

loosening the rank constraint opens a new realm of quantum contextuality and we

machine learning setting, known as Federated Learning, enables multiple clients

learning model while keeping all their data on-device. However, the scale and
decentralization of federated learning present new challenges. Communication
between the clients and the server is considered a main bottleneck in the
convergence time of federated learning.
  In this paper, we propose and study Adaptive Federated Dropout (AFD), a novel
technique to reduce the communication costs associated with federated learning.
It optimizes both server-client communications and computation costs by
allowing clients to train locally on a selected subset of the global model. We
empirically show that this strategy, combined with existing compression
methods, collectively provides up to 57x reduction in convergence time. It also
outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for communication efficiency.

reversible computers were investigated and found to scale as $\sqrt{AV}$ where
$A$ is the convex bounding surface area of the system and $V$ its internal
volume, compared to $A$ for an irreversible computer. This analysis neglected
to consider interactions between components of the system however, instead
focussing on raw computational power. In this part we extend this analysis to
consider synchronisation events such as communication between independent
reversible processors subject to a limiting supply of free energy. It is found
that, whilst asynchronous computation can proceed at a rate $b\lambda$,
synchronisation events proceed at the much slower rate $\sim b^2\lambda$; in
these rate expressions, $\lambda$ is the gross transition rate for each
processor and $b\sim\sqrt{A/V}\ll1$ is the 'computational bias' measuring the
net fraction of transitions which are successful. Whilst derived for Brownian
reversible computers, this result applies to all forms of reversible computer,
including Quantum computers. In fact this result is an upper bound, and one
must choose the phase space geometry of the synchronisation events carefully to
avoid even worse performance. In the limit of large computers, communication
will therefore tend to freeze out as $b\to0$; if, however, one is willing to
restrict the number of processors permitted to share state at any given time
then this rate can be ameliorated and performance on par with asynchronous
computation can be recovered.

numerically stable alternative with respect to polynomials. To achieve these
goals, we also study the link between spectral operators, wavelets, and
filtered convolution with integral operators induced by spectral kernels.
According to our tests, main advantages of the proposed approach are (i) its

architecture is scaled in multiple dimensions including width, depth,
resolution and a combination of all of these. Width scaling involves
inculcating greater number of neurons per CNN layer, whereas depth scaling

involves a hybrid combination of width, depth and resolution scaling. The
results indicate that histopathological cancer scans are very complex in nature

well defined and strongly consistent. We also present simulation results
demonstrating the consistency of the estimator. We illustrate the application
of the model with a structural scale parameter to household income data. The

prediction of cloud coverage conditions and sun irradiance to estimate the

life for censored outcome data. The models, which enable us to estimate the
expected remaining survival time and generalize commonly used mean residual
life models, also conduct covariate dimension reduction. Using the geometric
approaches in semiparametrics literature and the martingale properties with
survival data, we propose a flexible inference procedure that relaxes the
parametric assumptions on the dependence of mean residual life on covariates
and how long a patient has lived. We show that the estimators for the covariate
effects are root-$n$ consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically
efficient. With the unspecified mean residual life function, we provide a
nonparametric estimator for predicting the residual life of a given subject,
and establish the root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality for this
estimator. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the feasibility of
the proposed estimators. We apply the method to analyze a national kidney
transplantation dataset to further demonstrate the utility of the work.

on the structural, magnetic, and microscopic properties of TbFe thin films. The
structural analysis confirmed the intermixing at interfaces of the Ti and TbFe
layer with the increment of UL thicknesses. Out-of-plane (OOP) coercivity (Hc),
and saturation field (Hs) gradually increased with an increase in UL thickness
regardless of interface mixing. For UL = 10 nm, the domain contrast and OOP
stray field strength were enhanced, which may be due to the extent of d-d
hybridization dominated over the influence of interfacial roughness. While for
UL = 20, and 40 nm, the extent of interfacial roughness dominated the
hybridization effects and as a result, stray fields deteriorated. By placing UL
of 20 nm, Hc increased by nearly 6 times more than the bare TbFe system. So, we
observe a state with high OOP Hc combined with nearly zero OOP stray fields
that are found to co-exist in the sample. The magnetization reversal studies on
a large area reveal domain nucleation followed by domain-wall motion in all the
films. The idea of tuning magnetic properties by varying thicknesses of Ti UL
may useful in spintronics applications.

translations tile $\mathbb{R}^n$? Since any such body must have volume $1$, the
isoperimetric inequality implies that its surface area must be at least
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Remarkably, Kindler et al.\ showed that for general bodies
$B$ this is tight, i.e.\ that there is a tiling body of $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose
surface area is $O(\sqrt{n})$.
  In theoretical computer science, the tiling problem is intimately to the
study of parallel repetition theorems (which are an important component in
PCPs), and more specifically in the question of whether a ""strong version"" of
the parallel repetition theorem holds. Raz showed, using the odd cycle game,
that strong parallel repetition fails in general, and subsequently these ideas
were used in order to construct non-trivial tilings of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  In this paper, motivated by the study of a symmetric parallel repetition, we
consider the symmetric variant of the tiling problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show
that any symmetric body that tiles $\mathbb{R}^n$ must have surface area at
least $\Omega(n/\sqrt{\log n})$, and that this bound is tight, i.e.\ that there
is a symmetric tiling body of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with surface area $O(n/\sqrt{\log
n})$. We also give matching bounds for the value of the symmetric parallel
repetition of Raz's odd cycle game.
  Our result suggests that while strong parallel repetition fails in general,
there may be important special cases where it still applies.

colour-magnitude diagrams before and after the corresponding light curves were
corrected for the long-term variations. Results. Our intra-night monitoring,

April 2019, we recorded a flare, which marks the brightest state of PG 1553+113

clockwise spectral hysteresis loop on its VR colour-magnitude diagram and a
time lag in the sense that the V-band variations lead the R-band ones. We
obtain estimates of the radius, the magnetic field strength, and the electron
energy that characterize the emission region related to the flare. We find a
median period of (2.21 +/- 0.04) years using the historical light curves. In
addition, we detect a secondary period of about 210 days using the historical
light curves corrected for the long-term variations. We briefly discuss the

  AMS",,,,"math.GR math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study continuous bounded cohomology of totally disconnected locally
compact groups with coefficients in a non-Archimedean valued field $K$. To
capture the features of classical amenability that induce the vanishing of real
bounded cohomology, we introduce the notion of normed $K$-amenability, of which
we prove an algebraic characterization. It implies that normed $K$-amenable
groups are locally elliptic, and it relates an invariant, the norm of a
$K$-amenable group, to the order of its discrete finite $p$-subquotients, where
$p$ is the characteristic of the residue field of $K$. Moreover, we prove a
bounded-cohomological characterization for discrete groups.
  The algebraic characterization shows that normed $K$-amenability is a very
restrictive condition, so the bounded cohomological one suggests that there
should be plenty of groups with rich bounded cohomology with trivial $K$
coefficients. We explore this intuition by studying the injectivity and
surjectivity of the comparison map, for which surprisingly general statements
are available. Among these, we show that if either $K$ has positive
characteristic or its residue field has characteristic 0, then the comparison
map is injective in all degrees. If $K$ is a finite extension of
$\mathbb{Q}_p$, we classify quasimorphisms of a group and relate them to its
subgroup structure. For discrete groups, we show that suitable finiteness
conditions imply that the comparison map is an isomorphism.
  A motivation as to why the comparison map is often an isomorphism, in stark
contrast with the real case, is given by moving to topological spaces. We show
that over a non-Archimedean field, bounded cohomology is a cohomology theory in
the sense of Eilenberg--Steenrod, except for a weaker version of the additivity
axiom which is however equivalent for finite disjoint unions. In particular
there exists a Mayer--Vietoris sequence.

and understanding the outside redundancy world. The human vision system cannot
process all information simultaneously due to the visual information
bottleneck. In order to reduce the redundant input of visual information, the
human visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of scenes. This is
commonly known as visual saliency map prediction. This paper proposed a new
psychophysical saliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by
multi-channel model of visual cortex functioning in humans. The model consists
of opponent color channels, wavelet transform, wavelet energy map, and contrast
sensitivity function for extracting low-level image features and providing a
maximum approximation to the human visual system. The proposed model is
evaluated using several datasets, including the MIT1003, MIT300, TORONTO,
SID4VAM, and UCF Sports datasets. We also quantitatively and qualitatively
compare the saliency prediction performance with that of other state-of-the-art
models. Our model achieved strongly stable and better performance with
different metrics on natural images, psychophysical synthetic images and
dynamic videos. Additionally, we found that Fourier and spectral-inspired
saliency prediction models outperformed other state-of-the-art non-neural
network and even deep neural network models on psychophysical synthetic images.
It can be explained and supported by the Fourier Vision Hypothesis. In the
meantime, we suggest that deep neural networks need specific architectures and
goals to be able to predict salient performance on psychophysical synthetic
images better and more reliably. Finally, the proposed model could be used as a
computational model of primate vision system and help us understand mechanism
of primate vision system.

explore the effect of the total controlled electricity capacity by a single, or
group, of generator companies can have on the average electricity price. We
demonstrate this through the use of ElecSim, a simulation of a country-wide
energy market. We develop a strategic agent, representing a generation company,
which uses a deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning
algorithm to bid in a uniform pricing electricity market. A uniform pricing
market is one where all players are paid the highest accepted price. ElecSim is
parameterized to the United Kingdom for the year 2018. This work can help
inform policy on how to best regulate a market to ensure that the price of
electricity remains competitive.
  We find that capacity has an impact on the average electricity price in a
single year. If any single generator company, or a collaborating group of
generator companies, control more than ${\sim}$11$\%$ of generation capacity
and bid strategically, prices begin to increase by ${\sim}$25$\%$. The value of
${\sim}$25\% and ${\sim}$11\% may vary between market structures and countries.
For instance, different load profiles may favour a particular type of generator
or a different distribution of generation capacity. Once the capacity
controlled by a generator company, which bids strategically, is higher than
${\sim}$35\%, prices increase exponentially. We observe that the use of a
market cap of approximately double the average market price has the effect of
significantly decreasing this effect and maintaining a competitive market. A
fair and competitive electricity market provides value to consumers and enables
a more competitive economy through the utilisation of electricity by both
industry and consumers.

concisely illustrating the many-electron formalism for performing ladder
resummations of Feynman diagrams in systems with broken SU(2)-symmetry,
associated to ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AF) order. We then
analyze the algorithmic simplifications introduced by taking the local
approximation of the two-particle irreducible vertex functions in the
Bethe-Salpeter equations, which defines the ladder implementation of D$\Gamma$A
for magnetic systems. The relation of this assumption with the DMFT limit of
large coordination-number/ high-dimensions is explicitly discussed. As a last
step, we derive the expression for the ladder D$\Gamma$A self-energy in the FM-

AF-ordered case is explicitly illustrated by means of approximated calculations
based on a static mean-field input for the D$\Gamma$A equations. The results
obtained capture fundamental aspects of both metallic and insulating ground

signals from both audio and video modalities. This architecture consists of
separate encoders for the two modalities and a single decoder that attends over
them. We show that this architecture is better than fusing modalities at the
signal level. Additionally, we also explore leveraging the visual information
in a second pass model, which has also been referred to as a `deliberation
model'. The deliberation model accepts audio representations and text
hypotheses from the first pass ASR and combines them with a visual stream for
an improved visual context-aware recognition. The proposed deliberation scheme
can work on top of any well trained ASR and also enabled us to leverage the
pre-trained text model to ground the hypotheses with the visual features. Our
experiments on HOW2 dataset show that multi-stream and deliberation
architectures are very effective at the VC-ASR task. We evaluate the proposed
models for two scenarios; clean audio stream and distorted audio in which we
mask out some specific words in the audio. The deliberation model outperforms
the multi-stream model and achieves a relative WER improvement of 6% and 8.7%
for the clean and masked data, respectively, compared to an audio-only model.
The deliberation model also improves recovering the masked words by 59%

we propose to remedy this inefficiency by introducing a method, which we call
Frequency Gating, to compute multiplicative weights for the kernels of the CNN
in order to make them frequency dependent. Several mechanisms are explored:
temporal gating, in which weights are dependent on prior time frames, local
gating, whose weights are generated based on a single time frame and the ones
adjacent to it, and frequency-wise gating, where each kernel is assigned a
weight independent of the input data. Experiments with an autoencoder neural
network with skip connections show that both local and frequency-wise gating
outperform the baseline and are therefore viable ways to improve CNN-based
speech enhancement neural networks. In addition, a loss function based on the
extended short-time objective intelligibility score (ESTOI) is introduced,

deep clustering framework consisting of a modified generative adversarial

operations prior to the discriminator of the GAN to enhance the separability of

building complex network architectures to better capture sophisticated feature
interactions and dynamic user behaviors. The increased model complexity may
slow down online inference and hinder its adoption in real-time applications.
Instead, our work targets at a new model training strategy based on knowledge
distillation (KD). KD is a teacher-student learning framework to transfer
knowledge learned from a teacher model to a student model. The KD strategy not
only allows us to simplify the student model as a vanilla DNN model but also
achieves significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art teacher
models. The benefits thus motivate us to further explore the use of a powerful
ensemble of teachers for more accurate student model training. We also propose
some novel techniques to facilitate ensembled CTR prediction, including teacher
gating and early stopping by distillation loss. We conduct comprehensive
experiments against 12 existing models and across three industrial datasets.
Both offline and online A/B testing results show the effectiveness of our
KD-based training strategy.

Similarly, by taking into account the human's expertise, the robot would also
be able of inferring a human's true objectives even when the human's fails to
properly demonstrate these objectives due to a lack of expertise. In this
paper, we propose to jointly infer the expertise level and objective function

Two inference approaches are proposed. In the first approach, inference is done
over a finite, discrete set of possible objective functions and expertise

always increased with a higher electric field intensity, even after
electrokinetic instabilities are formed, as increasingly unstable flow
conditions decrease the ratio of folding to stretching ($m$), hindering the
interaction between substances. Finally, an optimal proportion of stretching to
folding was found for maximizing mixing efficiency at $m =0.0045$.

  Abstract. This workshop paper draws some material from arXiv:2001.03998 and

corresponds to a non-representative sample from the target populations where
the learners will be deployed. In anticausal prediction tasks, selection biases
often make the associations between confounders and the outcome variable
unstable across different target environments. As a consequence, the
predictions from confounded learners are often unstable, and might fail to
generalize in shifted test environments. Stable prediction approaches aim to
solve this problem by producing predictions that are stable across unknown test
environments. These approaches, however, are sometimes applied to the training
data alone with the hope that training an unconfounded model will be enough to
generate stable predictions in shifted test sets. Here, we show that this is
insufficient, and that improved stability can be achieved by deconfounding the
test set features as well. We illustrate these observations using both
synthetic data and real world data from a mobile health study.

give it access to a tremendous amount of lexico-semantic information, and while
BERTology has shown that BERT captures certain important linguistic dimensions,
there have been no studies exploring the extent to which BERT might have access

conclude that BERT does indeed have access to a significant amount of

processed in this manner included clinical trials regarding macular
degeneration, a disease causing blindness with a heavy disease burden and many
clinical trials. Bar chart characteristics were extracted in both an automated
and manual fashion. These two approaches were then compared for accuracy. These
characteristics were then compared using a Bland-Altman analysis. Results:
Based on Bland-Altman analysis, 91.8% of data points were within the limits of
agreement. By comparing our automated data extraction with manual data
extraction, automated data extraction yielded the following accuracies: X-axis

automated data extraction and manual data extraction. A major source of error
was the incorrect delineation of 7s as 2s by optical character recognition

networks (FP-GANs) is proposed to produce HR MR images from low-resolution
counterparts. It can cope with the detail insensitive problem of the existing
super-resolution model in a divide-and-conquer manner. Specifically, FP-GANs
firstly divides an MR image into low-frequency global approximation and
high-frequency anatomical texture in wavelet domain. Then each sub-band
generative adversarial network (sub-band GAN) conquers the super-resolution
procedure of each single sub-band image. Meanwhile, sub-band attention is
deployed to tune focus between global and texture information. It can focus on
sub-band images instead of feature maps to further enhance the anatomical
reconstruction ability of FP-GANs. In addition, inverse discrete wavelet
transformation (IDWT) is integrated into model for taking the reconstruction of
whole image into account. Experiments on MultiRes_7T dataset demonstrate that
FP-GANs outperforms the competing methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

the local linear estimator of the regression function in a nonparametric

approximated by a location-mixture density of Gaussian densities with means the
individual errors and variance a constant parameter. This mixture density has
the form of a kernel density estimator of errors and is referred to as the
kernel-form error density (c.f., Zhang et al., 2014). While Zhang et al. (2014)
use the local constant (also known as the Nadaraya- Watson) estimator to
estimate the regression function, we extend this to the local linear estimator,
which produces more accurate estimation. The proposed investigation is
motivated by the lack of data-driven methods for simultaneously choosing
bandwidths in the local linear estimator of the regression function and
kernel-form error density. Treating bandwidths as parameters, we derive an
approximate (pseudo) likelihood and a posterior. A simulation study shows that
the proposed bandwidth estimation outperforms the rule-of-thumb and
cross-validation methods under the criterion of integrated squared errors. The
proposed bandwidth estimation method is validated through a nonparametric
regression model involving firm ownership concentration, and a model involving
state-price density estimation.

are examined by comparing the predicted wall shear stresses with the WRLES

overall good agreement with the WRLES data with some discrepancies observed at

converting count rates measured with in situ gamma ray spectrometry to
radioactivity concentrations of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs in the environment.
Compton-to-peak analysis is based on the count rate ratio between the spectral
regions containing scattered gamma rays to the primary $^{134}$Cs and
$^{137}$Cs photopeaks (known as the Compton-to-peak ratio - RCP). RCP changes
with the vertical distribution of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground.
Inferring this distribution enables the selection of appropriate count rate to
activity concentration conversion coefficients. Here PHITS was used to simulate
the dependency of RCP on different vertical distributions of $^{134}$Cs and
$^{137}$Cs within the ground. A model was created of a LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector
used in drone helicopter aerial surveys in Fukushima Prefecture. The model was
verified by comparing simulated gamma ray spectra to measurements from test
sources. Simulations were performed for the infinite half-space geometry to
calculate the dependency of RCP on the mass depth distribution (exponential or
uniform) of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground, and on the altitude of
the detector above the ground. The calculations suggest that the sensitivity of
the Compton-to-peak method is greatest for the initial period following nuclear
fallout when $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs are located close to the ground surface,
and for aerial surveys conducted at low altitudes. This is because the relative
differences calculated between RCP with respect to changes in the mass depth
distribution were largest for these two cases. Data on the measurement height
above and on the $^{134}$Cs to $^{137}$Cs activity ratio is necessary for
applying the Compton-to-peak method to determine the distribution and
radioactivity concentration of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs within the ground.

strong anisotropic oscillation and unique decay features. In the direction
perpendicular to node-line plane, as usual, there is only one oscillation
period related to the Fermi energy. In contrast, in the node-line plane, the
RKKY interaction form a beating pattern and oscillates more rapidly with two
distinct periods: one is coming from the Fermi energy and the other is from the
radius of node-line. More importantly, inside nodal-line SMs bulk, the decay
rate of RKKY interaction manifests a typical two-dimensional feature for
impurities aligned along the direction perpendicular to nodal-line plane.
Furthermore, the magnetic interactions in nodal-line SMs with linear and

to achieve conservation voltage reduction (CVR) in three-phase unbalanced
distribution systems by optimally scheduling smart inverters of distributed
energy resources (DERs). One feature of the proposed method is to consider
integrated primary-secondary distribution networks and voltage dependent loads.
To ease the computational complexity introduced by the large number of
secondary networks, we partition a system into distributed leader-follower
control zones based on the network connectivity. To address the non-convexity
from the nonlinear power flow and load models, a feedback-based linear
approximation using instantaneous power and voltage measurements is proposed.
This enables the online implementation of the proposed method to achieve fast
tracking of system variations led by DERs. Another feature of the proposed
method is the asynchronous implementations of the leader-follower controllers,
which makes it compatible with non-uniform update rates and robust against
communication delays and failures. Numerical tests are performed on a real
distribution feeder in Midwest U. S. to validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method.

inference for the parameters of the popular ARFIMA or FARIMA model without
requiring stationarity by allowing the upper bound $\bar{d}$ for the memory
parameter $d$ to exceed $0.5$. We observe that estimating the parameters of a
single non-stationary ARFIMA model is equivalent to estimating the parameters
of a sequence of stationary ARFIMA models. This enables improved inference
because many standard methods perform poorly when estimates are close to the
boundary of the parameter space. It also allows us to leverage the wealth of
likelihood approximations that have been introduced for estimating the
parameters of a stationary process. We explore how estimation of the memory
parameter $d$ depends on the upper bound $\bar{d}$ and introduce adaptive
procedures for choosing $\bar{d}$. Via simulations, we examine the performance
of our adaptive procedures for estimating the memory parameter when the true
value is as large as $2.5$. Our adaptive procedures estimate the memory
parameter well, can be used to obtain confidence intervals for the memory
parameter that achieve nominal coverage rates, and perform favorably relative
to existing alternatives.

cases. Synthetic over-sampling methods have been effective to improve the
performance of classifiers for imbalance problems. However, most synthetic
over-sampling methods generate non-diverse synthetic instances within the
convex hull formed by the existing minority instances as they only concentrate
on the minority class and ignore the vast information provided by the majority
class. They also often do not perform well for extremely imbalanced data as the
fewer the minority instances, the less information to generate synthetic
instances. Moreover, existing methods that generate synthetic instances using
the majority class distributional information cannot perform effectively when
the majority class has a multi-modal distribution. We propose a new method to
generate diverse and adaptable synthetic instances using Synthetic
Over-sampling with Minority and Majority classes (SOMM). SOMM generates
synthetic instances diversely within the minority data space. It updates the
generated instances adaptively to the neighbourhood including both classes.
Thus, SOMM performs well for both binary and multiclass imbalance problems. We
examine the performance of SOMM for binary and multiclass problems using
benchmark data sets for different imbalance levels. The empirical results show
the superiority of SOMM compared to other existing methods.

it also might have critical practical aspects as we try to find ways to age
slower. Or to not age at all. Different reasons point at distinct strategies
for the research of anti-ageing drugs. While the main reason why biological
systems work as they do is evolution, for quite a while, it was believed that
aging required another explanation. Aging seems to harm individuals so much
that even if it has group benefits, those benefits were unlikely to be enough.
That has led many scientists to propose non-evolutionary explanations as to why
we age. But those theories seem to fail at explaining all the data on how
species age. Here, I will show that the insistence of finding the one idea that
explains it all might be at the root of the difficulty of getting a full

temporal changes are fundamental aspects of the problem, I will show that
environmental change causes the barrier for group advantages to become much
weaker. That weakening might help small group advantages to add up to the point
they could make an adaptive difference. To answer why we age, we might have to
abandon asking which models are correct. The full answer might come from
considering how much each hypothesis behind each existing model, evolutionary

extensive single-label tasks. While few researches focus on the causal variable
discovery in multi-label data due to the complex causal relationships. Since
some variables in multi-label scenario might contain causal information about
multiple labels, this paper investigates the problem of multi-label causal
variable discovery as well as the distinguishing between common causal
variables shared by multiple labels and label-specific causal variables
associated with some single labels. Considering the multiple MBs under the
non-positive joint probability distribution, we explore the relationships
between common causal variables and equivalent information phenomenon, and find
that the solutions are influenced by equivalent information following different
mechanisms with or without existence of label causality. Analyzing these
mechanisms, we provide the theoretical property of common causal variables,
based on which the discovery and distinguishing algorithm is designed to
identify these two types of variables. Similar to single-label problem, causal
variables for multiple labels also have extensive application prospects. To
demonstrate this, we apply the proposed causal mechanism to multi-label feature
selection and present an interpretable algorithm, which is proved to achieve
the minimal redundancy and the maximum relevance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of these contributions.

respect to a suitably defined sound speed). Three-fluid model without cosmic
ray diffusion can be studied in the same way as the classic stellar wind

gravitational force acted on dark matter at late time can be weaker than that
on the standard matter fields without introducing extra gravitational degrees
of freedom. The framework integrates dark matter into a type-II minimally
modified gravity that was recently proposed as a dark energy mimicker. The idea
that makes such a framework possible consists of coupling a dark matter
Lagrangian and a cosmological constant to the metric in a canonically
transformed frame of general relativity (GR). On imposing a gauge fixing
constraint, which explicitly breaks the temporal diffeomorphism invariance, we
keep the number of gravitational degrees of freedom to be two, as in GR. We
then make the inverse canonical transformation to bring the theory back to the
original frame, where one can add the standard matter fields. This framework
contains two free functions of time which specify the generating functional of
the above mentioned canonical transformation and which are then used in order
to realize desired time evolutions of both the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$ and
the effective gravitational constant for dark matter $G_{\rm eff}(z)$. The aim
of this paper is therefore to provide a new framework to address the two
puzzles present in today's cosmology, i.e. the $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$
tension, simultaneously. When the dark matter is cold in this framework, we dub
the corresponding cosmological model the V Canonical Cold Dark Matter (VCCDM),
as the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the standard $\Lambda$CDM is replaced
by a function $V(\phi)$ of an auxiliary field $\phi$ and the CDM is minimally
coupled to the metric in a canonically transformed frame.

is helpful to learn the features present in both normal and abnormal images.
However this is difficult because of the wide range of possible abnormalities
and also the number of ways that normal anatomy can vary naturally. As such, we
leverage the natural variations in normal anatomy to create a range of
synthetic abnormalities. Specifically, the same patch region is extracted from
two independent samples and replaced with an interpolation between both
patches. The interpolation factor, patch size, and patch location are randomly
sampled from uniform distributions. A wide residual encoder decoder is trained
to give a pixel-wise prediction of the patch and its interpolation factor. This
encourages the network to learn what features to expect normally and to
identify where foreign patterns have been introduced. The estimate of the
interpolation factor lends itself nicely to the derivation of an outlier score.
Meanwhile the pixel-wise output allows for pixel- and subject- level

piece comprising a central aluminum layer with PMMA resin layers bonded on both
sides. Upon calculating the displacement field and the strain field using
digital image correlation (DIC), the crack tip was located, and the fracture
toughness was evaluated at the Aluminum/PMMA bonding interface. As a result of
the DIC, it was possible to determine the process by which 1) the elastic
stress wave propagated to the aluminum section, 2) the wave was transmitted to
the PMMA section, and 3) the crack developed at the interface. The tip of the
crack was identified using displacement distributions obtained using DIC. The
fracture toughness of the interface was evaluated using the stress intensity
factor. The true interfacial stress was calculated by correcting the strain
value at the interface obtained using DIC. The distribution of the stress
suggested that mode II fracture appears in the present test method when the
crack is sufficiently shorter than the length of the bonding interface, and
mode I and mode II fractures appear when the crack is longer in comparison.
Although the value of the stress intensity factor was disturbed by the error of
the DIC analysis, it was confirmed that the obtained values were similar
regardless of the difference in the crack length, upon averaging the stress
intensity factor values from the crack tips to the long-range with a ratio of 1
to the subset in DIC. As the obtained stress intensity factor value was similar
to the values calculated in the related literature, it can be concluded that
the method proposed in this study yields a reasonable stress intensity factor.

the simulation often contains input distributions estimated from real-world

overall statistical error. Simulation uncertainty can be reduced by additional
computation (e.g., more replications). Input uncertainty can be reduced by
collecting more real-world data, when feasible. This paper proposes an approach
to quantify overall statistical uncertainty when the simulation is driven by
independent parametric input distributions; specifically, we produce a
confidence interval that accounts for both simulation and input uncertainty by
using a metamodel-assisted bootstrapping approach. The input uncertainty is
measured via bootstrapping, an equation-based stochastic kriging metamodel
propagates the input uncertainty to the output mean, and both simulation and
metamodel uncertainty are derived using properties of the metamodel. A variance

transmission and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research about the
impact of mask-wearing in the COVID-19 pandemic has raised formidable interest
across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
mask-wearing in spreading processes over complex networks. This is done by
studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network
model, where nodes can be one of two types (mask-wearing, and
not-mask-wearing). We provide analytical results that accurately predict the
expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the
characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities,
inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of
mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact
network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive
simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the
mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with
mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al.

become significant. In this paper, we explore the potential impact of
low-magnitude systematic redshift offsets on measurements of the Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, and the cosmological constraints recovered
from such measurements. Using 500 mock galaxy redshift surveys as our baseline
sample, we inject a series of systematic redshift biases (ranging from +/-0.2%
to +/-2%), and measure the resulting shift in the recovered isotropic BAO
scale. When BAO measurements are combined with CMB constraints (in both
{\Lambda}CDM and wCDM cosmologies), plausible systematics introduce a
negligible offset on combined fits of H0 and {\Omega}m, and systematics must be
an order of magnitude greater than this plausible baseline to introduce a
1-{\sigma} shift on such combined fits. We conclude that systematic redshift
biases are very unlikely to bias constraints on parameters such as H0 provided
by BAO cosmology, either now or in the near future. We also detail a
theoretical model that predicts the impact of uniform redshift systematics on
{\alpha}, and show this model is in close alignment with the results of our

mainly resort to fixed-point operations, quantizing both weights and
activations with fixed coding lengths may cause significant performance drop,
especially on low bits. Specifically, most state-of-the-art SR models without
batch normalization have a large dynamic quantization range, which also serves
as another cause of performance drop. To address these two issues, we propose a
new quantization scheme termed PArameterized Max Scale (PAMS), which applies
the trainable truncated parameter to explore the upper bound of the
quantization range adaptively. Finally, a structured knowledge transfer (SKT)
loss is introduced to fine-tune the quantized network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed PAMS scheme can well compress and accelerate the

including, online recruiting portals and image search engines, so it is
imperative that these tools are not discriminatory on the basis of protected
attributes such as gender or race. Currently, fair subset selection algorithms
assume that the protected attributes are known as part of the dataset. However,
protected attributes may be noisy due to errors during data collection or if
they are imputed (as is often the case in real-world settings). While a wide
body of work addresses the effect of noise on the performance of machine
learning algorithms, its effect on fairness remains largely unexamined. We find
that in the presence of noisy protected attributes, in attempting to increase
fairness without considering noise, one can, in fact, decrease the fairness of
the result!
  Towards addressing this, we consider an existing noise model in which there
is probabilistic information about the protected attributes (e.g., [58, 34, 20,
46]), and ask is fair selection possible under noisy conditions? We formulate a
``denoised'' selection problem which functions for a large class of fairness
metrics; given the desired fairness goal, the solution to the denoised problem
violates the goal by at most a small multiplicative amount with high
probability. Although this denoised problem turns out to be NP-hard, we give a
linear-programming based approximation algorithm for it. We evaluate this
approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our empirical results show
that this approach can produce subsets which significantly improve the fairness
metrics despite the presence of noisy protected attributes, and, compared to
prior noise-oblivious approaches, has better Pareto-tradeoffs between utility

implicit large-eddy simulations in the presence and absence of the Hall forcing
term, initiated with an unidirectional sinusoidal magnetic field. The HMHD
simulation while benchmarking the code also emphasizes the complexity of three
dimensional (3D) evolution over its two dimensional (2D) counterpart. The
magnetic reconnections onset significantly earlier in HMHD. Importantly, the
magnetic field generated by the Hall term breaks any inherent symmetry,
ultimately making the evolution 3D. The resulting 3D reconnections develop
magnetic flux ropes and magnetic flux tubes. Projected on the reconnection
plane, the ropes and tubes appear as magnetic islands, which later break into
secondary islands, and finally coalesce to generate an X-type neutral point.
These findings are in agreement with the theory and contemporary simulations of
HMHD, and thus verify our extension of the EULAG-MHD model. The second set
explores the influence of the Hall forcing on generation and ascend of a
magnetic flux rope from sheared magnetic arcades---a novel scenario instructive
in understanding the coronal transients. The rope evolves through intermediate
complex structures, ultimately breaking locally because of reconnections.
Interestingly, the breakage occurs earlier in the presence of the Hall term,
signifying faster dynamics leading to magnetic topology favorable for
reconnections.

ingredient to obtain reliable numerical simulations of several industrial and
environmental applications. For some values of the physical parameters we can
observe the formation of a narrow region or layer around the fractures where
chemical reactions are focused. Here the transported solute may precipitate and
form a salt, or vice-versa. This phenomenon has been observed and reported in
real outcrops. By changing its physical properties this layer might
substantially alter the global flow response of the system and thus the actual
transport of solute: the problem is thus non-linear and fully coupled. The aim
of this work is to propose a new mathematical model for reactive flow in
fractured porous media, by approximating both the fracture and these
surrounding layers via a reduced model. In particular, our main goal is to
describe the layer thickness evolution with a new mathematical model, and
compare it to a fully resolved equidimensional model for validation. As
concerns numerical approximation we extend an operator splitting scheme in time
to solve sequentially, at each time step, each physical process thus avoiding
the need for a non-linear monolithic solver, which might be challenging due to
the non-smoothness of the reaction rate. We consider bi- and tridimensional
numerical test cases to asses the accuracy and benefit of the proposed model in
realistic scenarios.

machine learning models without the assistance of servers, which require access

emerged as a promising technique for training complex deep learning (DL) models
on low-powered mobile devices. The core idea behind this technique is to train
the sensitive layers of a DL model on mobile devices while offloading the
computationally intensive layers to a server. Although a lot of works have
already explored the effectiveness of split learning in simulated settings, a
usable toolkit for this purpose does not exist. In this work, we highlight the
theoretical and technical challenges that need to be resolved to develop a

transferring raw data to a server. Focusing on these challenges, we propose
SplitEasy, a framework for training ML models on mobile devices using split
learning. Using the abstraction provided by SplitEasy, developers can run
various DL models under split learning setting by making minimal modifications.
We provide a detailed explanation of SplitEasy and perform experiments with six
state-of-the-art neural networks. We demonstrate how SplitEasy can train models

infrequent predicates. However, predicates of minority classes often carry more
semantic and precise information~(\textit{e.g.}, \emph{`on'} v.s \emph{`parked

recall. To alleviate the influence of the class imbalance, we propose a novel

two networks are complementary to each other. The former captures object-level

We study the changes in geometry of the truncated disc and the inner
hot-flow of GX 339-4 by analyzing the Power SpectralDensity (PSD) extracted
from six XMM-Newton observations taken at the very end of an outburst.
  Methods. A theoretical model of the PSD of GX 339-4 in the 0.3-0.7 keV
(thermal reverberation dominated) and 0.7-1.5 keV (disc continuum dominated)
energy bands is developed. The model assumes the standard accretion disc to be
truncated at a specific radius, inside of which are two distinct hot-flow
zones: one spectrally soft and the other spectrally hard. The effects of
disc-fluctuations and thermal reverberation are taken into account.
  Results. This model successfully produces the traditional bumpy PSD profiles
and provides good fits to the GX 339-4 data. The truncation radius is found to
increase from $r_{\rm trc}$ $\sim$ 10 to 55 $r_{\rm g}$ as the source
luminosity decreases, strongly confirming that the truncation radius can be
characterized as a function of luminosity. Keeping in mind the large
uncertainty in previous measurements of the truncation radius, our values are
larger than some obtained from spectroscopic analysis, but smaller than those
implied from reverberation lag analysis. Furthermore, the size of two inner
hot-flow zones which are spectrally hard and spectrally soft are also growing
from $\sim$ 5 to 27 $r_{\rm g}$ and from $\sim$ 3 to 26 $r_{\rm g}$,
respectively, as the flux decreases. We find that the radial range of inner
hard zone is always larger than the range of the soft hot-flow zone, but by a
comparatively small factor of $\sim$ 1.1-2.2

have obtained quite good performances for robust end-to-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR). However, these methods only utilize the enhanced feature as
the input of the speech recognition component, which are affected by the speech
distortion problem. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a
gated recurrent fusion (GRF) method with joint training framework for robust
end-to-end ASR. The GRF algorithm is used to dynamically combine the noisy and
enhanced features. Therefore, the GRF can not only remove the noise signals
from the enhanced features, but also learn the raw fine structures from the
noisy features so that it can alleviate the speech distortion. The proposed
method consists of speech enhancement, GRF and speech recognition. Firstly, the
mask based speech enhancement network is applied to enhance the input speech.
Secondly, the GRF is applied to address the speech distortion problem. Thirdly,
to improve the performance of ASR, the state-of-the-art speech transformer
algorithm is used as the speech recognition component. Finally, the joint
training framework is utilized to optimize these three components,
simultaneously. Our experiments are conducted on an open-source Mandarin speech
corpus called AISHELL-1. Experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves the relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 10.04\% over the
conventional joint enhancement and transformer method only using the enhanced
features. Especially for the low signal-to-noise ratio (0 dB), our proposed
method can achieves better performances with 12.67\% CER reduction, which
suggests the potential of our proposed method.

solving various inverse problems. Before such approaches can find application
in safety-critical fields, a verification of their reliability appears
mandatory. Recent works have pointed out instabilities of deep neural networks
for several image reconstruction tasks. In analogy to adversarial attacks in
classification, it was shown that slight distortions in the input domain may
cause severe artifacts. The present article sheds new light on this concern, by
conducting an extensive study of the robustness of deep-learning-based
algorithms for solving underdetermined inverse problems. This covers compressed
sensing with Gaussian measurements as well as image recovery from Fourier and
Radon measurements, including a real-world scenario for magnetic resonance
imaging (using the NYU-fastMRI dataset). Our main focus is on computing
adversarial perturbations of the measurements that maximize the reconstruction
error. A distinctive feature of our approach is the quantitative and
qualitative comparison with total-variation minimization, which serves as a
provably robust reference method. In contrast to previous findings, our results
reveal that standard end-to-end network architectures are not only resilient
against statistical noise, but also against adversarial perturbations. All
considered networks are trained by common deep learning techniques, without
sophisticated defense strategies.

Variational inference is used to create a stochastic latent space to sample

named robust ordered $k$-median and fault-tolerant ordered $k$-median. In
ordered $k$-median, given a finite metric space $(X,d)$, we seek to open $k$
facilities $S\subseteq X$ which induce a service cost vector
$\vec{c}=\{d(j,S):j\in X\}$, and minimize the ordered objective
$w^\top\vec{c}^\downarrow$. Here $d(j,S)=\min_{i\in S}d(j,i)$ is the minimum
distance between $j$ and facilities in $S$, $w\in\mathbb{R}^{|X|}$ is a given
non-increasing non-negative vector, and $\vec{c}^\downarrow$ is the
non-increasingly sorted version of $\vec{c}$. The current best result is a
$(5+\epsilon)$-approximation [CS19].
  We first consider robust ordered $k$-median, a.k.a. ordered $k$-median with
outliers, where the input consists of an ordered $k$-median instance and
parameter $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. The goal is to open $k$ facilities $S$, select
$m$ clients $T\subseteq X$ and assign the nearest open facility to each $j\in
T$. The service cost vector is $\vec{c}=\{d(j,S):j\in T\}$ and $w$ is in
$\mathbb{R}^m$. We introduce a novel yet simple objective function that enables
linear analysis of the non-linear ordered objective, apply an iterative
rounding framework [KLS18] and obtain a constant-factor approximation. We
devise the first constant-approximations for ordered matroid median and ordered
knapsack median using the same method.
  We also consider fault-tolerant ordered $k$-median, where besides the same
input as ordered $k$-median, we are also given additional client requirements
$\{r_j\in\mathbb{Z}_+:j\in X\}$ and need to assign $r_j$ distinct open
facilities to each client $j\in X$. The service cost of $j$ is the sum of
distances to its assigned facilities, and the objective is the same. We obtain
a constant-factor approximation using a novel LP relaxation with constraints

algebraic curve $\mathcal{X}$ is a vector space associated to evaluations on
$\mathcal{P}$ of functions in the Riemann-Roch space $L_\mathcal{X}(D)$. The
problem of testing proximity to an error-correcting code $C$ consists in
distinguishing between the case where an input word, given as an oracle,
belongs to $C$ and the one where it is far from every codeword of $C$. AG codes
are good candidates to construct short proof systems, but there exists no
efficient proximity tests for them. We aim to fill this gap.
  We construct an Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for some

identify suitable requirements for designing efficient IOPP systems for AG
codes. Our approach relies on a neat decomposition of the Riemann-Roch space of
any invariant divisor under a group action on a curve into several explicit
Riemann-Roch spaces on the quotient curve. We provide sufficient conditions on
an AG code $C$ that allow to reduce a proximity testing problem for $C$ to a
membership problem for a significantly smaller code $C'$.
  As concrete instantiations, we study AG codes on Kummer curves and curves in
the Hermitian tower. The latter can be defined over polylogarithmic-size
alphabet. We specialize the generic AG-IOPP construction to reach linear prover
running time and logarithmic verification on Kummer curves, and quasilinear
prover time with polylogarithmic verification on the Hermitian tower.

X-ray (ULX) sources identified in NGC 925. We use Integral field unit data from
the George Mitchel spectrograph in the context of the Metal-THINGS survey. The
optical properties for ULX-1 and ULX-3 are presented, while the spaxel
associated with ULX-2 had a low S/N, which prevented its analysis. We also
report the kinematics and dimensions of the optical nebula associated with each
ULX using ancillary data from the PUMA Fabry-Perot spectrograph. A BPT analysis
demonstrates that most spaxels in NGC 925 are dominated by star-forming
regions, including those associated with ULX-1 and ULX-3. Using the resolved
gas-phase metallicities, a negative metallicity gradient is found, consistent
with previous results for spiral galaxies, while the ionization parameter tends
to increase radially throughout the galaxy. Interestingly, ULX-1 shows a very
low gas metallicity for its galactocentric distance, identified by two
independent methods, while exhibiting a typical ionization. We find that such
low gas metallicity is best explained in the context of the high-mass X-ray
binary population, where the low-metallicity environment favours active Roche
lobe overflows that can drive much higher accretion rates. An alternative
scenario invoking accretion of a low-mass galaxy is not supported by the data
in this region. Finally, ULX-3 shows both a high metallicity and ionization
parameter, which is consistent with the progenitor being a highly-accreting
neutron star within an evolved stellar population region.

retrieval, which aims at learning a deep embedding space such that visual data
are embedded close to their semantic text labels or descriptions. Recent VSE
models use complex methods to better contextualize and aggregate multi-modal
features into holistic embeddings. However, we discover that surprisingly
simple (but carefully selected) global pooling functions (e.g., max pooling)
outperform those complex models, across different feature extractors. Despite
its simplicity and effectiveness, seeking the best pooling function for
different data modality and feature extractor is costly and tedious, especially
when the size of features varies (e.g., text, video). Therefore, we propose a
Generalized Pooling Operator (GPO), which learns to automatically adapt itself
to the best pooling strategy for different features, requiring no manual tuning
while staying effective and efficient. We extend the VSE model using this
proposed GPO and denote it as VSE$\infty$.
  Without bells and whistles, VSE$\infty$ outperforms previous VSE methods
significantly on image-text retrieval benchmarks across popular feature
extractors. With a simple adaptation, variants of VSE$\infty$ further
demonstrate its strength by achieving the new state of the art on two
video-text retrieval datasets. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations
confirm that GPO always discovers the best pooling strategy and can be a
plug-and-play feature aggregation module for standard VSE models. Code and
pre-trained models are available at https://vse-infty.github.io.

shock-shaped region of enhanced density surrounding a stellar source, using the
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SLIP. Bow shocks are structures formed by
the interaction of the winds of fast-moving stars with the interstellar medium.
Our previous study focused on the polarization produced in these structures by
electron scattering; we showed that polarization is highly dependent on
inclination angle and that multiple scattering changes the shape and degree of
polarization. In contrast to electron scattering, dust scattering is
wavelength-dependent, which changes the polarization behaviour. Here we explore
different dust particle sizes and compositions and generate polarized spectral
energy distributions for each case. We find that the polarization SED behaviour
depends on the dust composition and grain size. Including dust emission leads
to polarization changes with temperature at higher optical depth in ways that
are sensitive to the orientation of the bow shock. In various scenarios and
under certain assumptions, our simulations can constrain the optical depth and
dust properties of resolved and unresolved bow shock-shaped scattering
regions.Constraints on optical depth can provide estimates of local ISM density
for observed bow shocks. We also study the impact of dust grains filling the
region between the star and bow shock. We see that as the density of dust
between the star and bow shock increases, the resulting polarization is
suppressed for all the optical depth regimes.

training data is a difficult problem. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) is
known to perform poorly when the number of variables is large compared to the
available number of samples. In order to reduce the mean squared error (MSE) of
the SCM, regularized (shrinkage) SCM estimators are often used. In this work,
we consider regularized SCM (RSCM) estimators for multiclass problems that
couple together two different target matrices for regularization: the pooled
(average) SCM of the classes and the scaled identity matrix. Regularization
toward the pooled SCM is beneficial when the population covariances are
similar, whereas regularization toward the identity matrix guarantees that the
estimators are positive definite. We derive the MSE optimal tuning parameters
for the estimators as well as propose a method for their estimation under the
assumption that the class populations follow (unspecified) elliptical
distributions with finite fourth-order moments. The MSE performance of the
proposed coupled RSCMs are evaluated with simulations and in a regularized
discriminant analysis (RDA) classification set-up on real data. The results
based on three different real data sets indicate comparable performance to
cross-validation but with a significant speed-up in computation time.

the cosmic evolution of the clustering properties of peak, void, wall, and
filament-type critical points is measured using two-point correlation functions
in $\Lambda$CDM dark matter simulations as a function of their relative rarity.
A qualitative comparison to the corresponding theory for Gaussian Random fields
allows us to understand the following observed features: i) the appearance of
an exclusion zone at small separation, whose size depends both on rarity and on
the signature (\ie the number of negative eigenvalues) of the critical points
involved; ii) the amplification of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation bump with
rarity and its reversal for cross-correlations involving negatively biased
critical points; iii) the orientation-dependent small-separation divergence of
the cross-correlations of peaks and filaments (voids and walls) which reflects
the relative loci of such points in the filament's (wall's) eigenframe. The
most significant features of the correlations are tabulated. The (cross-)
correlations involving the most non-linear critical points (peaks, voids)
display significant variation with redshift, while those involving less
non-linear critical points seem mostly insensitive to redshift evolution, which
should prove advantageous to model. The relative distances to the maxima of the
peak-to-wall and peak-to-void over that of the peak-to-filament
cross-correlation are in ratios of $\sim\sqrt{2}$ and $\sim\sqrt{3}$,
respectively which could be interpreted as an indication of the cosmic crystal
being on average close to a cubic lattice. The insensitivity to redshift
evolution suggests that the absolute and relative clustering of critical points
could become a topologically robust alternative to standard clustering
techniques when analyzing upcoming large scale surveys such as Euclid or LSST.

COVID-19's spread in a post-lockdown world. Among the various available
techniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal
strength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered less of a privacy
risk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS,
cellular-tower history, or QR-code scanning. As of October 2020, there have
been millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contract-tracing apps, as
more and more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of
these apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical
research that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to
fill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of
Bluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80
participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world
gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting
proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially
crowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in
need, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover,
technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused
by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users'
willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still
be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity
of up to 20m lasting for an hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that
existing contact-tracing apps can be re-purposed to focus on coarse-grained
proximity detection, and that future ones calibrate distance estimates and
adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.

\emph{Steiner forest problem}, in the Euclidean plane: the input is a multiset
$X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, partitioned into $k$ color classes $C_1, C_2,
\ldots, C_k \subseteq X$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost Euclidean graph
$G$ such that every color class $C_i$ is connected in $G$. We study this
Steiner forest problem in the streaming setting, where the stream consists of
insertions and deletions of points to $X$. Each input point $x\in X$ arrives
with its color $\textsf{color}(x) \in [k]$, and as usual for dynamic geometric
streams, the input points are restricted to the discrete grid $\{0, \ldots,
\Delta\}^2$.
  We design a single-pass streaming algorithm that uses $\mathrm{poly}(k \cdot
\log\Delta)$ space and time, and estimates the cost of an optimal Steiner
forest solution within ratio arbitrarily close to the famous Euclidean Steiner
ratio $\alpha_2$ (currently $1.1547 \le \alpha_2 \le 1.214$). This
approximation guarantee matches the state of the art bound for streaming
Steiner tree, i.e., when $k=1$. Our approach relies on a novel combination of
streaming techniques, like sampling and linear sketching, with the classical
Arora-style dynamic-programming framework for geometric optimization problems,
which usually requires large memory and has so far not been applied in the

Substantial enhancement in the adsorption energy (E_ads) is obtained on BDG-TM

is approximately four times of the pristine BDG and twice that of the
conventional metallic substrates. Badar charge analysis and charge density
difference maps envisage that, the TM decoration alters the charge distribution
at substrate-adatom interface, which in turn brings a considerable change in
the polarization of adatom, leads to significant improvement in the E_ads. The
change in polarization of adatoms is interlinked with charge transfer process
and it has been gauged by computing their effective charges upon adsorption;
which follows the same sequence of E_ads and hence corroborated each other.
Later, the partial density of states analysis shows a splitting and strong
hybridization of Xe-p with TM-d orbitals near the Fermi level of Fe, Ni and Cu

clustering and dispersion of Cu atoms on E_ads are analyzed using a first

which contain uncertainty along with non-determinism and dynamicity. These
three properties call for appropriate algorithms; reinforcement learning (RL)
is dealing with them in a very natural way. Today, despite some efforts, most
real-life combinatorial optimization problems remain out of the reach of
reinforcement learning algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning approach to solve a
realistic scheduling problem, and apply it to an algorithm commonly executed in
the high performance computing community, the Cholesky factorization. On the
contrary to static scheduling, where tasks are assigned to processors in a
predetermined ordering before the beginning of the parallel execution, our
method is dynamic: task allocations and their execution ordering are decided at
runtime, based on the system state and unexpected events, which allows much
more flexibility. To do so, our algorithm uses graph neural networks in
combination with an actor-critic algorithm (A2C) to build an adaptive
representation of the problem on the fly.
  We show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics
used in high-performance computing runtime systems. Moreover, our algorithm
does not require an explicit model of the environment, but we demonstrate that
extra knowledge can easily be incorporated and improves performance. We also
exhibit key properties provided by this RL approach, and study its transfer
abilities to other instances.

long-term tracking studies. A user may simulate distributions of protons or
electrons in either single particle or sliced macro-particle bunches. The
tracking code includes both straight and curvilinear coordinate systems
allowing for the simulation of either linear or circular accelerator lattice

perform learning tasks in an unsupervised fashion. In a recent work, we show
that such shortcoming can be addressed by adopting a convolutional transform

unsupervised fashion. The present paper aims at (i) proposing a deep version of
CTL; (ii) proposing an unsupervised fusion formulation taking advantage of the
proposed deep CTL representation; (iii) developing a mathematically sounded
optimization strategy for performing the learning task. We apply the proposed
technique, named DeConFuse, on the problem of stock forecasting and trading.
Comparison with state-of-the-art methods (based on CNN and long short-term

enabling customers to minimize their electricity bill under time-varying

management in smart grids, the uncoordinated and autonomous operation of HEMS
may lead to some operational problems at the grid level. This paper aims to
develop a coordinated framework for the operation of multiple HEMS in a
residential neighborhood based on the optimal and secure operation of the grid.
In the proposed framework customers cooperate to optimize energy consumption at
the neighborhood level and prevent any grid operational constraints violation.
A new price-based global and individualized incentives are proposed for
customers to respond and adjust loads. The individual customers are rewarded
for their cooperation and the network operator benefits by eliminating
rebounding network peaks. The alternating direction method of multipliers

  By invoking fractional programming and successive convex approximation

discrete manufacturing plants, where distinct items must undergo a sequence of

inputs and the presence of temporal-logic constraints. A new approach is
proposed, adopting a shift of perspective with respect to previous
contributions, from a Eulerian system model that tracks the state of plant
nodes, to a Lagrangian model that tracks the state of each part being
processed. The approach features a hierarchical structure. At a higher level, a
predictive receding horizon strategy allocates a path across the plant to each
part in order to minimize a chosen cost criterion. At a lower level, a path
following logic computes the control inputs in order to follow the assigned
path, while satisfying all constraints. The approach is tested here in
simulations, reporting extremely good performance as measured by closed-loop
cost function values and computational efficiency, also with very large
prediction horizon values. These features pave the way to a number of
subsequent research steps, which will culminate with the experimental testing

into the dynamics of molecular systems. In particular two-dimensional
electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides a probe of coherence and the flow of
energy within quantum systems which is not possible with more conventional
techniques. While heterodyne-detected (HD) 2DES is increasingly common, more
recently fluorescence-detected (FD) 2DES offers new opportunities, including
single-molecule experiments. However in both techniques it can be difficult to
unambiguously identify the pathways which dominate the signal. Therefore the
use of numerically modelling of 2DES is vitally important, which in turn
requires approximating the pulsing scheme to some degree. Here we employ
non-pertubative time evolution to investigate the effects of finite pulse width
and amplitude on 2DES signals. In doing so we identify key differences in the
response of HD and FD detection schemes, as well as the regions of parameter
space where the signal is obscured by unwanted artefacts in either technique.
Mapping out parameter space in this way provides a guide to choosing
experimental conditions and also shows in which limits the usual theoretical
approximations work well and which limits more sophisticated approaches are
required.

on scattered data, while approaches to forecasting focus on specific migration

or repressing gene transcription. A special class of transcriptional repressors
operates via a short-range mechanism, making local DNA regions inaccessible to
binding by activators, and thus providing an indirect repressive action on the
target gene. This mechanism is commonly modeled assuming that repressors
interact with DNA under thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting some
configurations of the gene regulatory region. We elaborate on a more general
nonequilibrium model of short-range repression using the graph formalism for
transitions between gene states, and we apply analytical calculations to
compare it with the equilibrium model in terms of the repression strength and
expression noise. In contrast to the equilibrium approach, the new model allows
us to separate two basic mechanisms of short-range repression. The first
mechanism is associated with the recruiting of factors that mediate chromatin
condensation, and the second one concerns the blocking of factors that mediate
chromatin loosening. The nonequilibrium model demonstrates better performance
on previously published gene expression data obtained for transcription factors
controlling Drosophila development, and furthermore it predicts that the first
repression mechanism is the most favorable in this system. The presented
approach can be scaled to larger gene networks and can be used to infer
specific modes and parameters of transcriptional regulation from gene
expression data.

problem, which converts the traditional MDP model with known parameters and no
capacity constraints to a new model with uncertain parameters and a resource
capacity constraint. Our motivating example comes from a medical resource
allocation problem: patients with multiple chronic diseases can be provided
either normal or special care, where the capacity of special care is limited
due to financial or human resources. In such systems, it is difficult, if not
impossible, to generate good estimates for the evolution of health for each
patient. We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program.
However, it becomes easily intractable in larger instances of the problem for
which we propose and test a parallel approximate dynamic programming algorithm.
We show that commercial solvers are not capable of solving the problem
instances with a large number of scenarios. Nevertheless, the proposed
algorithm provides a solution in seconds even for very large problem instances.
In our computational experiments, it finds the optimal solution for $42.86\%$
of the instances. On aggregate, it achieves $0.073\%$ mean gap value. Finally,
we estimate the value of our contribution for different realizations of the
parameters. Our findings show that there is a significant amount of additional
utility contributed by our model.

allows to describe the syntactical and the lexical elements of a language. The
main difference between Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and PEGs relies on the
interpretation of the choice operator: while the CFGs' unordered choice e | e'
is interpreted as the union of the languages recognized by e and e, the PEGs'
prioritized choice e/e' discards e' if e succeeds. Such subtle, but important
difference, changes the language recognized and yields more efficient parsing
algorithms. This paper proposes a rewriting logic semantics for PEGs. We start
with a rewrite theory giving meaning to the usual constructs in PEGs. Later, we
show that cuts, a mechanism for controlling backtracks in PEGs, finds also a
natural representation in our framework. We generalize such mechanism, allowing
for both local and global cuts with a precise, unified and formal semantics.
Hence, our work strives at better understanding and controlling backtracks in
parsers for PEGs. The semantics we propose is executable and, besides being a
parser with modest efficiency, it can be used as a playground to test different
optimization ideas. More importantly, it is a mathematical tool that can be
used for different analyses.

introduced into power systems by renewable energy resources. Although set
operations are computationally expensive in large systems, distributed
approaches serve as a remedy. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus-based
approach for set-theoretic frequency control in power systems. A robust
controlled-invariant set (RCI) for the system is generated by composing RCIs
for each bus in the network. The process of generating these sets uses a
consensus-based approach in order to facilitate discovery of mutually
compatible subsystem RCIs. Each bus seeks to maximize the size of its own RCI
while treating the effects of coupling as an unknown-but-bounded disturbance.
The consensus routine, which demonstrates linear convergence, is embedded into
a backwards reachability analysis of initial safe sets. Results for a 9-bus
test case show that simple model predictive controllers associated with the
resulting RCIs maintain safe operation when the system is subjected to worst
case (adversarial) fluctuations in net demand, where conventional controllers
are shown to fail.

for financial stock trading. Although many deep learning models have recently
been proposed in this domain, most of them treat the stock trading time-series
data as 2-D image data, whereas its true nature is 1-D time-series data. Since
the stock trading systems are multi-channel data, many existing techniques
treating them as 1-D time-series data are not suggestive of any technique to
effectively fusion the information carried by the multiple channels. To
contribute towards both of these shortcomings, we propose an end-to-end
supervised learning framework inspired by the previously established
(unsupervised) convolution transform learning framework. Our approach consists
of processing the data channels through separate 1-D convolution layers, then
fusing the outputs with a series of fully-connected layers, and finally
applying a softmax classification layer. The peculiarity of our framework -
SuperDeConFuse (SDCF), is that we remove the nonlinear activation located
between the multi-channel convolution layers and the fully-connected layers, as
well as the one located between the latter and the output layer. We compensate
for this removal by introducing a suitable regularization on the aforementioned
layer outputs and filters during the training phase. Specifically, we apply a
logarithm determinant regularization on the layer filters to break symmetry and
force diversity in the learnt transforms, whereas we enforce the non-negativity
constraint on the layer outputs to mitigate the issue of dead neurons. This
results in the effective learning of a richer set of features and filters with
respect to a standard convolutional neural network. Numerical experiments
confirm that the proposed model yields considerably better results than
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for real-world problem of stock

provides the opportunity to compare markets trading similar shares, in a
similar regulatory and economic environment, but with vastly different
liquidity, costs and business models. A2X currently has competitive settlement
and transaction pricing when compared to the JSE, but the JSE has deeper
liquidity. In pursuit of an empirical understanding of how these differences
relate to their respective price response dynamics, we compare the
distributions and auto-correlations of returns on different time scales; we
compare price impact and master curves; and we compare the cost of trading on
each exchange. This allows us to empirically compare the two markets. We find
that various stylised facts become similar as the measurement or sampling time
scale increase. However, the same securities can have vastly different price
responses irrespective of time scales. This is not surprising given the
different liquidity and order-book resilience. Here we demonstrate that direct
costs dominate the cost of trading, and the importance of competitively
positioning cost ceilings. Universality is crucial for being able to
meaningfully compare cross-exchange price responses, but in the case of A2X, it
has yet to emerge in a meaningful way due to the infancy of the exchange --

of twists the dimension of the 2-Selmer group over K is given by an explicit
local formula, and use this to show that this dimension follows an
Erd\H{o}s--Kac type distribution. This is in stark contrast to the distribution
of the dimension of the corresponding 2-Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Q}$, and
this discrepancy allows us to determine the distribution of the 2-torsion in
the Shafarevich--Tate groups of the $E_d$ over K also.
  As a consequence of our methods we prove that, for 100% of twists d, the
action of $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ on the 2-Selmer group of $E_d$
over K is trivial, and the Mordell--Weil group $E_d(K)$ splits integrally as a
direct sum of its invariants and anti-invariants. On the other hand, we give
examples of thin families of quadratic twists in which a positive proportion of

insensitive to the number of eigenvectors to be clustered and the choosing of
the tuning parameter. When dealing with two weak signal networks Simmons and
Caltech, by considering one more eigenvectors for clustering, we provide two
refinements PCC+ and NPCC+ of PCC and NPCC, respectively. Both two refinements

choose a unique solution to conservation law systems with a singular measure in
initial data. Different approximations can lead to solutions with different
distributional limits. The new notion called backward energy condition is then
to single out a proper approximation of the distributional initial data. The
definition is based on the maximal energy dissipation defined in
\cite{CD_1973}. Suppose that a conservation law system admits a supplementary
law in space--time divergent form where the time component is a (strictly or
not) convex function. It could be an energy density or a mathematical entropy
in gas dynamic models, for example. One of the admissibility conditions is that
a proper weak solution should maximally dissipate the energy or the
mathematical entropy. We show that it is consistent with other admissibility
conditions in the case of Riemann problems for systems of isentropic gas
dynamics with non-positive pressure in the first part of the paper. Singular
solutions to these systems are described by shadow waves, nets of piecewise
constant approximations with respect to the time variable. In the second part,
we define and apply the backward energy condition for those systems when the
initial data contains a delta measure approximated by piecewise constant
functions.

spectroscopy (EELS) was used to investigate the volume plasmon energy losses in
and around shear bands. Energy shifts of the peak centre and changes in the
peak width (FWHM) reflecting the damping were precisely determined within an
accuracy of a few meV using an open source python module (Hyperspy) to fit the
shapes of the plasmon and zero-loss peaks with Lorentzian functions. The
maximum bulk plasmon energy shifts were calculated for the bright and dark
shear band segments relative to the matrix to be about 38 and 14 meV,
respectively. The damping was observed to be larger for the denser regions. The
analysis presented here suggests that the changes in the plasmons are caused by
two contributions: (i) Variable damping in the shear band segments due to
changes in the medium-range order (MRO). This affects the static structure
factor S(k), which, in turn, leads to either reduced or increased damping
according to the Ziman-Baym formula. (ii) The ionic density and the effective
electron mass appearing in the zero-momentum plasmon frequency formula
$E_p(q=0)$ are coupled and give rise to small variations in the plasmon energy.

a non-rotating black hole in a novel four dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity is investigated by solving the general relativistic hydrodynamical
equations using the high resolution shock capturing scheme. For this purpose,
the accreated matter from the wind-accreating X-ray binaries falls towards the
black hole from the far upstream side of the domain, suphersonically. We study
the effects of Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ in 4D EGB gravity on the
accreated matter and shock cones created in the downstream region in detail.
The required time having the shock cone in downstream region is getting smaller
for alpha > 0 while it is increasing for alpha < 0. It is found that increases
in alpha leads violent oscillations inside the shock cone and increases the
accretion efficiency. The violent oscillations would cause increase in the
energy flux, temperature, and spectrum of X- rays. So the quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) are naturally produced inside the shock cone when -5 \leq
alpha \leq 0.8. It is also confirmed that EGB black hole solution converges to
the Schwarzschild one in general relativity when alpha \rightarrow 0. Besides,
the negative coupling constants also give reasonable physical solutions and
increase of alpha in negative directions suppresses the possible oscillation
observed in the shock cone.

effectively solves the problem that the client can not afford to execute the
same quantum subroutine repeatedly in the face of large training samples. In
the quantum k-means algorithm, the core subroutine is the Quantum minimization
algorithm (GroverOptim), the client needs to repeat several Grover searches to
find the minimum value in each iteration to find a new clustering center, so we
use quantum homomorphic encryption scheme (QHE) to encrypt the data and upload
it to the cloud for computing. After calculation, the server returns the
calculation result to the client. The client uses the key to decrypt to get the
plaintext result. It reduces the computing pressure for the client to repeat
the same operation. In addition, when executing in the cloud, the key update of
T-gate in the server is inevitable and complex. Therefore, this paper also
proposes a T-gate update scheme based on trusted server in quantum ciphertext
environment. In this scheme, the server is divided into trusted server and
semi-trusted server. The semi-trusted server completes the calculation
operation, and when the T-gate is executed in the circuit, the trusted server
assists the semi-trusted server to calculate the T-gate, and then randomly
generates a key and uploads it to the semi-trusted server. The trusted server
assists the client to complete the key update operation, which once again
reduces the pressure on the client and improves the efficiency of the quantum
homomorphic encryption scheme. And on the basis of this scheme, the experiment
is given by using IBM Qiskit to give the subroutine of quantum k-means. The
experimental results show that the scheme can realize the corresponding
computing function on the premise of ensuring security.

knowledge about a particular domain, such as image cropping and rotation. To
overcome such limitation, we propose a novel domain-agnostic approach to
contrastive learning, named DACL, that is applicable to domains where
invariances, and thus, data augmentation techniques, are not readily available.
Key to our approach is the use of Mixup noise to create similar and dissimilar
examples by mixing data samples differently either at the input or hidden-state
levels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DACL, we conduct experiments across
various domains such as tabular data, images, and graphs. Our results show that
DACL not only outperforms other domain-agnostic noising methods, such as
Gaussian-noise, but also combines well with domain-specific methods, such as
SimCLR, to improve self-supervised visual representation learning. Finally, we
theoretically analyze our method and show advantages over the Gaussian-noise
based contrastive learning approach.

thermal energy of hot plasmas and kinetic energy of accelerated nonthermal
particles. Despite numerous efforts, no consensus on quantifying this energy
balance has yet been reached. We aim to understand the reasons for the
contradicting results on energy partition obtained by various recent studies.
We considered five recent studies that address the thermal-nonthermal energy
partition in solar flares. Their results are reviewed, and their methods are
compared and discussed in detail. The main uncertainties in deriving the energy
partition are identified as (a) the derivation of the differential emission
measure (DEM) distribution and (b) the role of the conductive energy loss for
the thermal component, as well as (c) the determination of the low-energy
cutoff for the injected electrons. The bolometric radiated energy, as a proxy
for the total energy released in the flare, is a useful independent constraint
on both thermal and nonthermal energetics. In most of the cases, the derived
energetics are consistent with this constraint. There are indications that the
thermal-nonthermal energy partition changes with flare strength: in weak
flares, there appears to be a deficit of energetic electrons, while the
injected nonthermal energy is sufficient to account for the thermal component
in strong flares. This behavior is identified as the main cause of the
dissimilar results in the studies we considered. The changing partition has two
important consequences: (a) an additional direct (i.e. non-beam) heating
mechanism has to be present, and (b) considering that the bolometric emission
originates mainly from deeper atmospheric layers, conduction or waves are
required as additional energy transport mechanisms.

requirements. Such requirements can be low-latency or minimum-throughput.
Therefore, the network has to adjust to different needs. Usually, users with
low-latency requirements have to deliver their demand within a specific time
frame, i.e., before a deadline, and they co-exist with throughput oriented
users. In addition, the users are mobile and they share the same wireless
channel. Therefore, they have to adjust their power transmission to achieve
reliable communication. However, due to the limited power budget of wireless
mobile devices, a power-efficient scheduling scheme is required by the network.
In this work, we cast a stochastic network optimization problem for minimizing
the packet drop rate while guaranteeing a minimum throughput and taking into
account the limited-power capabilities of the users. We apply tools from
Lyapunov optimization theory in order to provide an algorithm, named Dynamic
Power Control (DPC) algorithm, that solves the formulated problem in realtime.
It is proved that the DPC algorithm gives a solution arbitrarily close to the
optimal one. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms the
baseline Largest-Debt-First (LDF) algorithm for short deadlines and multiple

Problems of this type often arise in machine learning and a number of other

ellipsoid method with minibatching, which converges linearly and hence requires
significantly less iterations than SGD. This is verified by our experiments,

that the method arrives at approximate solution with given probability when
using minibatches of size proportional to the desired precision to the power
-2. This enables efficient parallel execution of the algorithm, whereas
possibilities for batch parallelization of SGD are rather limited. Despite fast
convergence, ellipsoid method can result in a greater total number of calls to
oracle than SGD, which works decently with small batches. Complexity is
quadratic in dimension of the problem, hence the method is suitable for
relatively small dimensionalities.

macro- or micro-structure of the architecture requiring the unset
hyperparameters to be manually defined, and do not use the information produced
during the optimization process to increase the efficiency of the search. In
this work, we propose EMONAS, an Efficient MultiObjective Neural Architecture

efficiently searches for the best hyperparameters using a Random Forest
surrogate and guiding selection probabilities. EMONAS is evaluated on the task

of large eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix is an important
problem in Statistics with wide applications in many areas. In the context of
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the linear combinations of the original
variables having the largest amounts of variation are determined by this
number. In this paper, we study the high dimensional asymptotic regime where
the number of variables grows at the same rate as the number of observations,
and use the spiked covariance model proposed in Johnstone (2001), under which
the problem reduces to model selection. Our focus is on the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) which is known to be strongly consistent from the work of Bai
et al. (2018). However, Bai et al. (2018) requires a certain ""gap condition""
ensuring the dominant eigenvalues to be above a threshold strictly larger than
the BBP threshold (Baik et al. (2005), both quantities depending on the
limiting ratio of the number of variables and observations. It is well-known
that, below the BBP threshold, a spiked covariance structure becomes
indistinguishable from one with no spikes. Thus the strong consistency of AIC
requires some extra signal strength.
  In this paper, we investigate whether consistency continues to hold even if
the ""gap"" is made smaller. We show that strong consistency under arbitrarily
small gap is achievable if we alter the penalty term of AIC suitably depending
on the target gap. Furthermore, another intuitive alteration of the penalty can
indeed make the gap exactly zero, although we can only achieve weak consistency
in this case. We compare the two newly-proposed estimators with other existing
estimators in the literature via extensive simulation studies, and show, by
suitably calibrating our proposals, that a significant improvement in terms of
mean-squared error is achievable.

parameterization. We treat NSs as rigid triaxial bodies and give analytical

waveforms from freely precessing triaxial NSs and use Taylor expansions to
obtain waveforms with a small wobble angle. For pulsar signals, we adopt a
simple cone model to study the timing residuals and pulse profile modulations.
In reality, the electromagnetic torque acts on pulsars and affects the
precession behavior. Thereof, as an additional extension to our previous work,

distinct ground states by tuning a nonthermal control parameter. Often, they
can be accurately described within the Landau theory of phase transitions,
similarly to conventional thermal phase transitions. However, this picture can
break down under certain circumstances. Here, we present a comprehensive study
of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the magnetic structure and spin
dynamics of the spin-1/2 ladder compound C$_9$H$_{18}$N$_2$CuBr$_4$.
Single-crystal heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements reveal that
the N$\rm \acute{e}$el-ordered phase breaks down beyond a critical pressure of
$P_{\rm c}$$\sim$1.0 GPa through a continuous quantum phase transition.
Estimates of the critical exponents suggest that this transition may fall
outside the traditional Landau paradigm. The inelastic neutron scattering
spectra at 1.3 GPa are characterized by two well-separated gapped modes,
including one continuum-like and another resolution-limited excitation in
distinct scattering channels, which further indicates an exotic
quantum-disordered phase above $P_{\rm c}$.

program conducted in Argentina aimed at K-12 teachers with no CS background.
The only requirement to sign up was to be an in-service teacher, and therefore
there were a plethora of different teacher profiles that attended the courses.
Our research aims at understanding whether a single teacher training program
can be effective in teaching CS contents and specific pedagogy to teachers with
very heterogeneous profiles. Also, we investigate what teachers expect to do
with the contents they learn. To assess these questions anonymous examinations
and questionnaires were given and interviews were conducted with course
attendees. Even though the majority reached the expected minimum bar regarding
CS contents and pedagogy, significant differences appear in their
self-perception as regards career opportunities in CS teaching. Our conclusion
is that carrying out CS teacher training for a broad spectrum of profiles may
be effective for promoting CS contents. However, if the goal is to boost
teachers' confidence in teaching a CS subject, then having a program which
focuses on a more restricted selection of profiles would be a better strategy.

estimates. We analyse the well-known binary 16 Cyg AB for validation purposes
and confirm the existence of a slight metal enhancement (~0.02 dex) in the
primary, which might arise from planetary formation/ingestion. We draw
attention to systematic errors in some widely-used catalogues of non-seismic
parameters that may significantly bias asteroseismic inferences. In particular,
we find evidence that the ASPCAP Teff scale used for the APOKASC catalogue is
too cool for dwarfs and that the [Fe/H] values are underestimated by ~0.1 dex.
We compare seismic ages to those inferred from empirical abundance-age
relations based on ages from PARSEC isochrones and abundances obtained in the
framework of the HARPS-GTO program. These calibrations take into account a
dependency with the stellar effective temperature, metallicity, and/or mass. We
find that the seismic and abundance-based ages differ on average by 1.5-2 Gyrs,
while taking into account a dependency with one or two stellar parameters in
the calibrations leads to a global improvement of up to ~0.5 Gyr. However, even
in that case we find that seismic ages are systematically larger by ~0.7 Gyr.
We argue that it may be ascribed to a variety of causes including the presence
of small zero-point offsets between our abundances and those used to construct
the calibrations or to the choice of the set of theoretical isochrones. The
conclusions above are supported by the analysis of literature data for a larger

common to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by
plotting its ""learning curve"", that is, the decay of the error rate as a
function of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical
framework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis
and Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the
distribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of
the learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match
the practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in
any given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training
examples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired
accuracy.
  In this paper, we study an alternative learning model that better captures
such practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete
theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we
consider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the
performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without
requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this paper is a
remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal
learning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept
class decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates.
Moreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate
combinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that
achieve the best possible rate in each case.
  For concreteness, we consider in this paper only the realizable case, though
analogous results are expected to extend to more general learning scenarios.

applying an appropriate linear normalization, certain non-stationary Gaussian
processes can be used as asymptotically-motivated models for the process
conditioned on threshold exceedances at a fixed reference location and time. In
this work, we adapt existing conditional extremes models to allow for the
handling of large spatial datasets. This involves specifying the model for
spatial observations at $d$ locations in terms of a latent $m\ll d$ dimensional
Gaussian model, whose structure is specified by a Gaussian Markov random field.
We perform Bayesian inference for such models for datasets containing thousands
of observation locations using the integrated nested Laplace approximation, or
INLA. We explain how constraints on the spatial and spatio-temporal Gaussian
processes, arising from the conditioning mechanism, can be implemented through
the latent variable approach without losing the computationally convenient
Markov property. We discuss tools for the comparison of models via their
posterior distributions, and illustrate the flexibility of the approach with
gridded Red Sea surface temperature data at over $6,000$ observed locations.
Posterior sampling is exploited to study the probability distribution of

collected in a 12.7 mm vertical pipe under adiabatic, air-water conditions. The
result shows the intergroup transfer in the small diameter pipe can be drastic,
especially under low superficial liquid velocities. The cause of this
phenomenon is mainly due to the large relative bubble size comparing to the
pipe cross-sectional area. The wake entrainment effect could be enhanced by the
small spherical bubbles that are acting like cap or slug bubbles in a
medium-size pipe. Based on the experimental observation, a throughout analysis
of the dependence of the drastic intergroup transfer is provided in this study.
The models predicting the initiation of drastic intergroup transfer in small

developed. These models are compared with the two-phase data among the
different pipe sizes and the results show a good agreement. These newly
developed models are applied to the IATE wake entrainment model by developing a

heavy ion collisions. The method takes into account the fluctuations which are
inherent to the relationship between any experimental observable and the impact
parameter in this energy range. We apply the method to the very large dataset
on heavy ion collisions in the energy range 20-100 MeV/nucleon obtained with
the INDRA multidetector since 1993, for two observables which are the most
commonly used for the estimation of impact parameters in this energy range. The
mean impact parameters deduced with this new method for ""central"" collisions
selected using typical observable cuts are shown to be significantly larger
than those found when fluctuations are neglected, and as expected the
difference increases as bombarding energy decreases. In addition, we will show
that this new approach may provide previously inaccessible experimental
constraints for transport models, such as an estimation of the extrapolated
mean value of experimental observables for b = 0 collisions. The ability to
give more realistic, model-independent, estimations of the impact parameters
associated to different experimental datasets should improve the pertinence of
comparisons with transport model calculations which are essential to better
constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter.

mitigate this inconsistency, which would be beneficial for idiom comprehension.
Furthermore, to fully utilize the synonymic relationship, we propose the
synonym knowledge enhanced reader. Specifically, for each idiom, we first
construct a synonym graph according to the annotations from a high-quality

mass estimates to calculate HI mass functions (HIMFs) and cosmic HI mass

integrating the HI mass of galaxies with M_* > 10^{10} M_solar, confirms that
massive star-forming galaxies do not dominate the neutral gas at z ~ 1. We
study the evolution of the HI mass to stellar mass ratio from z ~ 1 to today

quantity M_HI/SFR exhibits very large scatter, and the scatter increases from a
factor of 5 - 7 at z = 0 to factors close to a hundred at z = 1. This implies
that there is no relation between HI gas and star formation in high redshift

an excess of black holes at masses of 9, 16, 30 and 57 M_. Intriguingly, for
both the distributions, the location of subsequent peaks are separated by a
factor of around two and there is a lack of mergers with chirp masses of 10-12

scenario when, due to a gap in the black-hole mass spectrum, a pile-up occurs
at the first peak followed by mergers of lower mass black-holes to
hierarchically produce higher mass black-holes. However, cross-generation
merger peaks and observations with high spins are also predicted to occur in
such a scenario that we are not currently observing. The results presented are
limited in measurement accuracy due to small numbers of observations but if
corroborated by future gravitational wave observations these features have

particles. The transition lines separating the different phases show different

diagram of higher-charge models substantially differs from that of unit-charge
models, which undergo only transitions driven by the breaking of the global
SU(N) symmetry, while the gauge correlations do not play any relevant role. We
support the conjectured scenario with numerical results, based on finite-size

is a persistent problem in the social, biological, and medical sciences. The
problem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most
common in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers
have developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply
with the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of
attempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal
inference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have
relied on fully parametric assumptions. In this paper, we propose two
strategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments
in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach
leverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the
case of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary
variable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as
many instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments
approach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded
treatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori
knowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not
impose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on
estimation of the confounder. This paper extends and generalizes existing work
on unmeasured confounding with a single treatment and models commonly used in
bioinformatics.

repulsive interactions $0< V < V_s$ (with $V_s \approx 2.1$), we demonstrate
the existence of a {\em bilayer Coulomb phase} with purely dipolar two-point

the usual Coulomb phase of square and honeycomb lattice dimer models. The
transition line $z_{c}(V)$ separating this bilayer Coulomb phase from a

universality class. Additionally, we argue for the possibility of a tricritical
point at which the bilayer Coulomb phase, the large-$z$ disordered phase and
the large-$V$ staggered phase meet in the large-$z$, large-$V$ part of the
phase diagram. In contrast, for the attractive case with $ V_{cb} < V \leq 0$
($V_{cb} \approx -1.2$), we argue that any $z > 0$ destroys the power-law
correlations of the $z=0$ decoupled layers, and leads immediately to a
short-range correlated state, albeit with a slow crossover for small $|V|$. For
$V_{c} < V < V_{cb}$ ($V_{c} \approx -1.55$), we predict that any small nonzero
$z$ immediately gives rise to long-range {\em bilayer columnar order} although
the $z=0$ decoupled layers remain power-law correlated in this regime; this
implies a non-monotonic $z$ dependence of the columnar order parameter for
fixed $V$ in this regime. This bilayer columnar ordered state is separated from
the large-$z$ disordered state by a line of Ashkin-Teller transitions $z_{\rm

objective, we present new methodology for calculating the full RIXS response of
a correlated metal in an unbiased fashion. Through comparison of measurements
and calculations that tune the incident photon energy over a wide portion of
the Fe L$_3$ absorption resonance of the example material BaFe$_2$As$_2$, we
show that the RIXS response in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ is dominated by the direct
channel contribution, including the Raman-like response below threshold, which
we explain as a consequence of the finite core-hole lifetime broadening.
Calculations are initially performed within the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter
framework, which we then significantly improve by convolution with an effective
spectral function for the intermediate-state excitation. We construct this
spectral function, also from first-principles, by employing the cumulant
expansion of the Green's function and performing a real-time time dependent
density functional theory calculation of the response of the electronic system
to the perturbation of the intermediate-state excitation. Importantly, this
allows us to evaluate the indirect RIXS response from first-principles,
accounting for the full periodicity of the crystal structure and with

  Our coloring algorithm is completely different and considerably simpler and
faster. It solves the coloring problem in a direct way, without using network
decomposition, by gradually rounding a certain fractional color assignment
until reaching an integral color assignments. Moreover, via the approach of
Chang, Li, and Pettie [STOC'18], this improved deterministic algorithm also
leads to an improvement in the complexity of randomized algorithms for
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring, now reaching the bound of $O(\log^3\log n)$ rounds.
  As a further application, we also provide faster deterministic distributed
algorithms for the following variants of the vertex coloring problem. In graphs
of arboricity $a$, we show that a $(2+\epsilon)a$-vertex coloring can be
computed in $O(\log^3 a\cdot\log n)$ rounds. We also show that for $\Delta\geq
3$, a $\Delta$-coloring of a $\Delta$-colorable graph $G$ can be computed in
$O(\log^2 \Delta\cdot\log^2 n)$ rounds.

gravitational wave events. However, many uncertainties remain in their often

Stellar Evolution (MSE), designed to rapidly model the stellar, binary, and
dynamical evolution of multiple-star systems. MSE includes a number of new
features not present in previous population synthesis codes: (1) an arbitrary
number of stars, as long as the initial system is hierarchical, (2) dynamic
switching between secular and direct N-body integration for efficient
computation of the gravitational dynamics, (3) treatment of mass transfer in
eccentric orbits, which occurs commonly in multiple-star systems, (4) a simple
treatment of tidal, common-envelope, and mass transfer evolution in which the
accretor is a binary instead of a single star, (5) taking into account planets
within the stellar system, and (6) including gravitational perturbations from
passing field stars. MSE, written primarily in the C++ language, will be made
publicly available and has few prerequisites; a convenient Python interface is
provided. We give a detailed description of MSE and illustrate how to use the
code in practice. We demonstrate its operation in a number of examples.

(with no two edges having the same color) in a properly edge-colored graph,
where a proper edge coloring is a coloring of the edge set such that no
same-colored edges are incident. Recently, Gao, Ramadurai, Wanless, and Wormald
proved that in every proper edge coloring of a graph with $q$ colors where each
color appears at least $q+o(q)$ times, there is always a rainbow matching using
every color. We strengthen this result by simultaneously relaxing two
conditions: (i) we lift the condition on the number of colors and allow any
finite number of colors and instead, put a weaker condition requiring the
maximum degree of the graph to be at most $q$, and (ii) we also relax the
proper coloring condition and require that the graph induced by each of the
colors have bounded degree. This strengthening resolves a natural question
inspired by the remarks made by Gao, Ramadurai, Wanless, and Wormald.
  As an application of this result, we show that for every proper edge coloring
of a graph with $2q+o(q)$ colors where each color appears at least $q$ times,
there is always a rainbow matching of size $q$. This can be seen as an
asymptotic version of a conjecture of Bar\'at, Gy\'arf\'as, and S\'ark\""ozy
restricted on simple graphs. We also provide a construction showing that having
$q+1$ colors is not enough, disproving a conjecture of Aharoni and Berger. As a
by-product of our techniques, we obtain a new asymptotic version of the
Brualdi--Ryser--Stein Conjecture, which is one of the central open questions in

orbits on the same plane. If they emerged with low to modest eccentricity
orbits from a common gaseous disk around the central super-massive black hole,
their inferred lifespan would not be sufficiently long to account for the
excitation of their high orbital eccentricity through dynamical relaxation.
Here we analyze the secular perturbation on Galactic Center stars by an
intermediate-mass companion (IMC) as a potential mechanism to account for these
young disk stars' high eccentricity. This IMC may be either an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a compact cluster such as IRS-13E. If
its orbital angular momentum vector is anti-parallel to that of the disk stars,
this perturbation would be effective in exciting the eccentricity of stars with
orbital precession rates which resonate with IMC's precession rate. If it
orbits around the SMBH in the same direction as the disk stars, the
eccentricity of the young stars can still be highly excited by the IMC during
the depletion of their natal disk, possible associated with the launch of the
Fermi bubble. In this scenario, IMC's precession rate decreases and its secular
resonance sweeps through the proximity of the young stars. We carry out
numerical simulations with various inclination angles between the orbits of IMC
and the disk stars and show this secular interaction is a robust mechanism to
excite the eccentricity and inclination of some disk stars.

model to three rotationally supported galaxies: NGC 7814 (Bulge-Dominated

  As was done in the general cases of spherically-symmetric and
axially-symmetric structures, which were studied in previous work on the

Newtonian Dynamics, a leading alternative gravity model which explains the
observed properties of these galaxies without requiring the Dark Matter
hypothesis.
  In our model, the MOND acceleration constant $a_{0} \simeq 1.2 \times
10^{-10}\mbox{m}\thinspace \mbox{s}^{ -2}$ can be related to a natural scale
length $l_{0}$, namely $a_{0} \approx GM/l_{0}^{2}$ for a galaxy of mass $M$.
Also, the empirical Radial Acceleration Relation, connecting the observed
radial acceleration $g_{obs}$ with the baryonic one $g_{bar}$, can be explained
in terms of a variable local dimension $D$. As an example of this methodology,
we provide detailed rotation curve fits for the three galaxies mentioned above.

  Stability of RNA Sequences through the Application of Deep Learning Methods","12 pages, 13 figures - Updated Third Version after Review",,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synthesis and efficient implementation mRNA strands has been shown to have
wide utility, especially recently in the development of COVID vaccines.
However, the intrinsic chemical stability of mRNA poses a challenge due to the
presence of 2'-hydroxyl groups in ribose sugars. The -OH group in the backbone
structure enables a base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated
hydroxyl on the adjacent phosphorous and consequent self-hydrolysis of the
phosphodiester bond. As expected for in-line hydrolytic cleavage reactions, the
chemical stability of mRNA strands is highly dependent on external
environmental factors, e.g. pH, temperature, oxidizers, etc. Predicting this
chemical instability using a computational model will reduce the number of
sequences synthesized and tested through identifying the most promising
candidates, aiding the development of mRNA related therapies. This paper
proposes and evaluates three deep learning models (Long Short Term Memory,
Gated Recurrent Unit, and Graph Convolutional Networks) as methods to predict
the reactivity and risk of degradation of mRNA sequences. The Stanford Open
Vaccine dataset of 6034 mRNA sequences was used in this study. The training set
consisted of 3029 of these sequences (length of 107 nucleotide bases) while the
testing dataset consisted of 3005 sequences (length of 130 nucleotide bases),
in structured (Lowest Entropy Base Pair Probability Matrix) and unstructured
(Nodes and Edges) forms. The stability of mRNA strands was accurately
generated, with the Graph Convolutional Network being the best predictor of
reactivity ($RMSE = 0.249$) while the Gated Recurrent Unit Network was the best
at predicting risks of degradation ($RMSE = 0.266$). Combining all target
variables, the GRU performed the best with 76% accuracy. Results suggest these
models can be applied to understand and predict the chemical stability of mRNA
in the near future.

degeneration (AMD), are poorly detected by human experts on standard color
fundus photography (CFP) and typically require advanced imaging modalities such
as fundus autofluorescence (FAF). The objective was to develop and evaluate the
performance of a novel 'M3' deep learning framework on RPD detection. Materials
and Methods A deep learning framework M3 was developed to detect RPD presence
accurately using CFP alone, FAF alone, or both, employing >8000 CFP-FAF image
pairs obtained prospectively (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2). The M3
framework includes multi-modal (detection from single or multiple image
modalities), multi-task (training different tasks simultaneously to improve
generalizability), and multi-attention (improving ensembled feature
representation) operation. Performance on RPD detection was compared with
state-of-the-art deep learning models and 13 ophthalmologists; performance on
detection of two other AMD features (geographic atrophy and pigmentary
abnormalities) was also evaluated. Results For RPD detection, M3 achieved area
under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.832, 0.931, and 0.933 for CFP
alone, FAF alone, and both, respectively. M3 performance on CFP was very
substantially superior to human retinal specialists (median F1-score 0.644
versus 0.350). External validation (on Rotterdam Study, Netherlands)
demonstrated high accuracy on CFP alone (AUROC 0.965). The M3 framework also
accurately detected geographic atrophy and pigmentary abnormalities (AUROC
0.909 and 0.912, respectively), demonstrating its generalizability. Conclusion
This study demonstrates the successful development, robust evaluation, and
external validation of a novel deep learning framework that enables accessible,
accurate, and automated AMD diagnosis and prognosis.

dimensionality of the gene expression data was reduced by three separate
methods (PCA, UMAP, and a simple linear autoencoder) and the results from each

  The clusters revealed three separate immune pathways in the SLE patients that
caused SLE. These pathways were: (1) high interferon levels, (2) high
autoantibody levels, and (3) dysregulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway. The first two pathways have been extensively studied in SLE. However,
mitochondrial apoptosis has not been investigated before to the best of our
knowledge as a standalone cause of SLE, independent of autoantibody production,
indicating that mitochondrial proteins could lead to a new set of therapeutic
targets for SLE in future research.

indicator of the pandemic spreading has been the number of test positive cases.
However, the tests are both incomplete (due to untested asymptomatic cases) and
late (due the lag from the initial contact event, worsening symptoms, and test
results). Social media can complement physical test data due to faster and
higher coverage, but they present a different challenge: significant amounts of
noise, misinformation and disinformation. We believe that social media can
become good indicators of pandemic, provided two conditions are met. The first
(True Novelty) is the capture of new, previously unknown, information from
unpredictably evolving situations. The second (Fact vs. Fiction) is the
distinction of verifiable facts from misinformation and disinformation. Social
media information that satisfy those two conditions are called live knowledge.
We apply evidence-based knowledge acquisition (EBKA) approach to collect,
filter, and update live knowledge through the integration of social media
sources with authoritative sources. Although limited in quantity, the reliable
training data from authoritative sources enable the filtering of misinformation

For safety and performance analyses of ADS, the most important part is the
modelling and consideration of road traffic participants. There is multiple

traffic behavior and are integrated directly or over interfaces with vehicle
simulation software (VSS). For these software environments, the possibility to

energy $E_\kappa$, the $F_\kappa(E)$ give the spreading of the $\kappa$ states
over the eigenstates $E$. It is shown that the first four moments of
$F_\kappa(E)$ are essentially same as that of the conditional $q$-normal
distribution given in: P.J. Szabowski, Electronic Journal of Probability {\bf
15}, 1296 (2010). This naturally gives asymmetry in $F_\kappa(E)$ with respect
to $E$ as $E_\kappa$ increases and also the peak value changes with $E_\kappa$.
Thus, the wavefunction structure in quantum many-fermion systems with $k$-body
interactions follows in general the conditional $q$-normal distribution.

  Evaluation in mmWave 5G NR",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication represents one of the main innovations
of the next generation of wireless technologies, allowing users to reach
unprecedented data rates. To overcome the high path loss at mmWave frequencies,
these systems make use of directional antennas able to focus the transmit power
into narrow beams using BeamForming (BF) techniques, thus making the
communication directional. This new paradigm opens up a set of challenges for
the design of efficient wireless systems, in which antenna and BF components
play an important role also at the higher layer of the protocol stack. For this
reason, accurate modeling of these components in a full-stack simulation is of
primary importance to understand the overall system behavior. This paper
proposes a novel framework for the end-to-end simulation of 5G mmWave cellular
networks, including a ray-tracing based channel model and accurate models for
antenna arrays and BF schemes. We showcase this framework by evaluating the
performance of different antenna and BF configurations considering both
link-level and end-to-end metrics and present the obtained results.

described, the trends of development are determined. Due to a detailed analysis
of scientific works, a retrospective of the development of adaptive and, in
particular, cloud-oriented systems is shown. The preconditions of their

The adaptive cloud-based educational systems design is considered as the
promising trend of research. It was determined that adaptability can be
manifested in one or a combination of several aspects: content, evaluation and

sarcomatoid lung carcinomas and to compare clinicopathologic features and
survival rates of PD-L1-positive and negative patients. Methods: PD-L1
expression was evaluated in 65 surgically resected sarcomatoid carcinomas. The
clinicopathologic features of cases with PD-L1-positive and negative tumors
were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Multiple Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to determine independent
predictors of overall survival. Results: PD-L1 antibody positivity was found in
72.3% of surgically resected sarcomatoid lung carcinomas. Regarding
histopathologic subtypes, PD-L1 expression was positive in 80.4% of pleomorphic
carcinomas, 62.5% of spindle- and/or giant-cell carcinomas, and 16.7% of
carcinosarcomas. Pleural invasion was observed in 68.1% of PD-L1-positive cases
and 27.8% of PD-L1-negative cases (p = 0.008). No difference in survival was
found between PD-L1-positive and negative tumors. The only factor significantly
associated with poor survival was the pathological stage of the tumor.
Conclusions: This study reveals a high rate of PD-L1 positivity in a large
number of sarcomatoid lung carcinoma cases with pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle-
and/or giantcell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma subtypes. The only significantly
different clinicopathologic feature in PD-L1-positive cases is pleural
invasion. PD-L1 positivity is not a significant predictor of survival in
sarcomatoid lung carcinomas.

II and VII$_{h=0}$ models when a cosmological constant, aligned electromagnetic
field and stiff matter are present. Additionally we study the non-commutative
quantum Bianchi II models when an aligned electromagnetic field is included.
Through the use of the Euclidean-signature semi classical method we find a
plethora of new solutions to these model's corresponding Lorentzian signature
Wheeler DeWitt equations which we can interpret qualitatively. These new
solutions for the aforementioned models involving matter sources reveal some
potentially interesting effects that should be chronicled as possible phenomena
that a toy model of quantum gravity can induce on the evolution of a quantum
universe. Furthermore we find 'excited' states which behave differently from
the 'excited' states of the Bianchi IX and Taub models that were previously
uncovered using this method. By comparing and contrasting the 'excited' states
given by these models we help facilitate a better understating of what
constitutes an 'excited' state solution of the Wheeler Dewitt equation. Our
results further show the utility of the Euclidean-signature semi classical
method for tackling Lorentzian signature problems without having to invoke a
Wick rotation. This feature of not needing to apply a Wick rotation makes this
method potentially very useful for tackling a variety of problems in bosonic
relativistic field theory and quantum gravity.

for solving coupled flow and transport problems. Each time step for SFI
consists of an outer loop, in which there are inner Newton loops to implicitly
and sequentially solve the pressure and transport sub-problems. In standard
SFI, the sub-problems are usually solved with tight tolerances at every outer
iteration. This can result in wasted computations that contribute little
progress towards the coupled solution. The issue is known as `over-solving'.
Our objective is to minimize the cost of inner solvers while maintaining the
convergence rate of SFI. We first extended a nonlinear-acceleration (NA)
framework (Jiang and Tchelepi 2019) to multi-component compositional models,
for ensuring robust outer-loop convergence. We then developed inexact-type
methods that alleviate `over-solving'. It is found that there is no need for
one sub-problem to strive for perfection, while the coupled (outer) residual
remains high due to the other sub-problem. The new SFI solver was tested using
several complex cases. The problems involve multi-phase and EoS-based
compositional fluid systems. We compared different strategies such as fixed
relaxations on absolute and relative tolerances for the inner solvers, as well
as an adaptive approach. The results show that the basic SFI method is quite
inefficient. Away from a coupled solution, additional accuracy achieved in
inner solvers is wasted, contributing to little or no reduction of the overall
outer residual. By comparison, the adaptive inexact method provides relative
tolerances adequate for the current convergence state of the sub-problems. We
show across a wide range of flow conditions that the new solver can effectively
resolve the over-solving issue, and thus greatly improve the overall
efficiency.

lattice Boltzmann method. Performing extensive numerical simulations taking
into account the coupled dynamics of the fluid-fluid interface and of magnetic
particles floating on it and driven by external magnetic fields we identify
several regimes of the swimmer motion. In the regime of high frequencies the
swimmer's maximum velocity is centered around the particle's inverse coasting
time. Modifying the ratio of surface tension and magnetic forces allows to
study the swimmer propagation in the regime of significantly lower frequencies
mainly defined by the strength of the magnetocapillary potential. Finally,
introducing a constant magnetic contribution in each of the particles in
addition to their magnetic moment induced by external fields leads to another
regime characterised by strong in-plane swimmer reorientations that resemble
experimental observations.

of an interventional therapeutic work-flow. Cone beam computed tomography
(CBCT), computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) images thereby
provides complementary functional and/or structural information of the targeted
region and organs at risk. Merging this information relies on a correct spatial
alignment of the observed anatomy between the acquired images. This can be
achieved by the means of multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR),
demonstrated to be capable of estimating dense and elastic deformations between
images acquired by multiple imaging devices. However, due to the typically
different field-of-view (FOV) sampled across the various imaging modalities,
such algorithms may severely fail in finding a satisfactory solution.
  In the current study we propose a new fast method to align the FOV in
multi-modal 3D medical images. To this end, a patch-based approach is
introduced and combined with a state-of-the-art multi-modal image similarity
metric in order to cope with multi-modal medical images. The occurrence of
estimated patch shifts is computed for each spatial direction and the shift
value with maximum occurrence is selected and used to adjust the image
field-of-view.
  We show that a regional registration approach using voxel patches provides a
good structural compromise between the voxel-wise and ""global shifts""
approaches. The method was thereby beneficial for CT to CBCT and MRI to CBCT
registration tasks, especially when highly different image FOVs are involved.
Besides, the benefit of the method for CT to CBCT and MRI to CBCT image
registration is analyzed, including the impact of artifacts generated by
percutaneous needle insertions. Additionally, the computational needs are
demonstrated to be compatible with clinical constraints in the practical case
of on-line procedures.
