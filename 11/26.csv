YouTube is arguably the largest and most engaging online media consumption
platform in the world. Recently, YouTube's scale has fueled concerns that
YouTube users are being radicalized via a combination of biased recommendations
and ostensibly apolitical anti-woke channels, both of which have been claimed
to direct attention to radical political content. Here we test this hypothesis
using a representative panel of more than 300,000 Americans and their
individual-level browsing behavior, on and off YouTube, from January 2016
through December 2019. Using a labeled set of political news channels, we find
that news consumption on YouTube is dominated by mainstream and largely
centrist sources. Consumers of far-right content, while more engaged than
average, represent a small and stable percentage of news consumers. However,
consumption of anti-woke content, defined in terms of its opposition to
progressive intellectual and political agendas, grew steadily in popularity and
is correlated with consumption of far-right content off-platform. We find no
evidence that engagement with far-right content is caused by YouTube
recommendations systematically, nor do we find clear evidence that anti-woke
channels serve as a gateway to the far right. Rather, consumption of political
content on YouTube appears to reflect individual preferences that extend across
the web as a whole.

as blood flow from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images.
Fitting the observed data with multi-compartment exchange models is desirable,
as they are physiologically plausible and resolve directly for blood flow and
microvascular function. However, the reliability of model fitting is limited by
the low signal-to-noise ratio, temporal resolution, and acquisition length.
This may result in inaccurate parameter estimates.
  This study introduces physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a means to
perform myocardial perfusion MR quantification, which provides a versatile
scheme for the inference of kinetic parameters. These neural networks can be
trained to fit the observed perfusion MR data while respecting the underlying
physical conservation laws described by a multi-compartment exchange model.
Here, we provide a framework for the implementation of PINNs in myocardial
perfusion MR.
  The approach is validated both in silico and in vivo. In the in silico study,
an overall reduction in mean-squared error with the ground-truth parameters was
observed compared to a standard non-linear least squares fitting approach. The
in vivo study demonstrates that the method produces parameter values comparable
to those previously found in literature, as well as providing parameter maps
which match the clinical diagnosis of patients.

between blocks for natural language grows like a power law, we seek for links
between power-law growth rate of algorithmic mutual information and of some
estimator of the unifilar order, i.e., the number of hidden states in the
generating stationary ergodic source in its minimal unifilar hidden Markov
representation. We consider an order estimator which returns the smallest order
for which the maximum likelihood is larger than a weakly penalized universal
probability. This order estimator is intractable and follows the ideas by
Merhav, Gutman, and Ziv (1989) and by Ziv and Merhav (1992) but in its exact
form seems overlooked despite some nice theoretical properties. In particular,
we can prove both strong consistency of this order estimator and an upper bound
of algorithmic mutual information in terms of it. Using both results, we show
that all (also uncomputable) sources of a finite unifilar order exhibit
sub-power-law growth of algorithmic mutual information and of the unifilar
order estimator. In contrast, we also exhibit an example of unifilar processes
of a countably infinite order, with a deterministic pushdown automaton and an
algorithmically random oracle, for which the mentioned two quantities grow as a
power law with the same exponent. We also relate our results to natural

regions of the World in subsequent waves. There is, however, no consensus on
the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather
than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or
others based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the
disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless,
understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing
effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave
pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is
guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show
that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation
symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching
a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves
is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time
scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model
featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control
the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in
between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting
the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or
delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding
principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb
pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of
human life loss and economic damage.

urbanization and the architectural form of urban environment. Consequently, the
urban space is divided into four classes: 1) highly informal; 2) moderately
informal; 3) moderately formal; and 4) highly formal areas. In total 16
sub-classes were identified. For semantic segmentation, Google's DeeplabV3+

for safe motion planning. As a result, 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) plays a
vital role in autonomous navigation. Most MOT methods use a
tracking-by-detection pipeline, which includes object detection and data
association processing. However, many approaches detect objects in 2D RGB
sequences for tracking, which is lack of reliability when localizing objects in
3D space. Furthermore, it is still challenging to learn discriminative features
for temporally-consistent detection in different frames, and the affinity
matrix is normally learned from independent object features without considering
the feature interaction between detected objects in the different frames. To
settle these problems, We firstly employ a joint feature extractor to fuse the
2D and 3D appearance features captured from both 2D RGB images and 3D point
clouds respectively, and then propose a novel convolutional operation, named
RelationConv, to better exploit the correlation between each pair of objects in
the adjacent frames, and learn a deep affinity matrix for further data
association. We finally provide extensive evaluation to reveal that our

evolution of Betti number curves and feature persistence diagrams of the three
(topological) classes of structural features: matter concentrations, filaments
and tunnels, and voids. The Betti curves specify the prominence of features as
a function of density level, and their evolution with cosmic epoch reflects the
changing network connections between these structural features. The persistence
diagrams quantify the longevity and stability of topological features. In this
study we establish, for the first time, the link between persistence diagrams,
the features they show, and the gravitationally driven cosmic structure
formation process. By following the diagrams' development over cosmic time, the
link between the multiscale topology of the cosmic web and the hierarchical
buildup of cosmic structure is established. The sharp apexes in the diagrams
are intimately related to key transitions in the structure formation process.
The apex in the matter concentration diagrams coincides with the density level
at which, typically, they detach from the Hubble expansion and begin to
collapse. At that level many individual islands merge to form the network of
the cosmic web and a large number of filaments and tunnels emerge to establish
its connecting bridges. The location trends of the apex possess a self-similar
character that can be related to the cosmic web's hierarchical buildup. We find
that persistence diagrams provide a significantly higher and more profound
level of information on the structure formation process than more global
summary statistics like Euler characteristic or Betti numbers.

shear modulus. To this end, we derive a novel equation of motion for a
nonlinear gradient elasticity model, where the higher-order gradient terms
capture the effect of small-scale soil heterogeneity/micro-structure. We also
present a novel finite-difference scheme to solve the nonlinear equation of
motion in space and time. Simulations of the propagation of arbitrary initial
pulses clearly reveal the influence of the nonlinearity: strain-dependent speed
in general and, as a result, sharpening of the pulses. Stationary solutions of
the equation of motion are obtained by introducing the moving reference frame
together with the stationarity assumption. Periodic (with and without a
descending trend), as well as localized stationary waves, are found by
analyzing the obtained ordinary differential equation in the phase portrait,
and integrating it along the different trajectories. The localized stationary
wave is in fact a kink wave and is obtained by integration along a homoclinic
orbit. In general, the closer the trajectory lies to a homoclinic orbit, the
sharper the edges of the corresponding periodic stationary wave and the larger
its period. Finally, we find that the kink wave is in fact not a true soliton
as the original shapes of two colliding kink waves are not recovered after
interaction. However, it may have high amplitude and reach the surface
depending on the damping mechanisms (which have not been considered).
Therefore, seismic site response analyses should not a priori exclude the
presence of such localized stationary waves.

the latter shape the allowed region for the former. Requiring said overall

Cytoarchitecture is a basic principle of the microstructural organization of

neuronal cells are indicators of changes in connectivity and function.
Automated scanning procedures and observer-independent methods are
prerequisites to reliably identify cytoarchitectonic areas, and to achieve
reproducible models of brain segregation. Time becomes a key factor when moving
from the analysis of single regions of interest towards high-throughput
scanning of large series of whole-brain sections. Here we present a new
workflow for mapping cytoarchitectonic areas in large series of cell-body
stained histological sections of human postmortem brains. It is based on a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained on a pair of section

between. The model learns to create all missing annotations in between with
high accuracy, and faster than our previous workflow based on

3D-reconstruction of sections, and is robust against histological artefacts. It
processes large data sets with sizes in the order of multiple Terabytes
efficiently. The workflow was integrated into a web interface, to allow access

regression model for the event times. Cure models are statistical models for
event times that take into account that a fraction of the population might

form $S(t) = 1 - \pi + \pi\exp(-\int_0^t\alpha(s)\,d s)$, where $\pi$ is the
probability of being susceptible to the event under study, and $\alpha(s)$ is
the hazard rate of the susceptible fraction. We let both $\pi$ and $\alpha(s)$
depend on possibly different covariate vectors $X$ and $Z$. The probability
$\pi$ is taken to be the logistic function $\pi(X^{\prime}\gamma) =
1/\{1+\exp(-X^{\prime}\gamma)\}$, while we model $\alpha(s)$ by Aalen's linear

$K \to \infty$. For each model in the sequence of parametric models, we assume
that the data generating mechanism is parametric, thus simplifying the
derivation of the estimators, as well as the proofs of consistency and limiting
normality. Finally, we use contiguity techniques to switch back to assuming
that the data stem from the semiparametric model. This technique for deriving
and studying estimators in non- and semiparametric settings has previously been

might serve as models of the human recognition process. However, most such
networks provide their answer after a fixed computational effort, whereas human
reaction time varies, e.g. from 0.2 to 10 s, depending on the properties of
stimulus and task. To model the effect of difficulty on human reaction time, we
considered a classification network that uses early-exit classifiers to make
anytime predictions. Comparing human and MSDNet accuracy in classifying
CIFAR-10 images in added Gaussian noise, we find that the network equivalent
input noise SD is 15 times higher than human, and that human efficiency is only
0.6\% that of the network. When appropriate amounts of noise are present to
bring the two observers (human and network) into the same accuracy range, they
show very similar dependence on duration or FLOPS, i.e. very similar
speed-accuracy tradeoff. We conclude that Anytime classification (i.e. early
exits) is a promising model for human reaction time in recognition tasks.

Positioning System (GPS) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), brings
better positioning accuracy. However, ANs from two systems are usually
synchronized to two different clock sources. Different from single-system
localization, an extra user-to-system clock offset needs to be handled.
Existing dual-system methods either have high computational complexity or
sub-optimal positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new closed-form
dual-system localization (CDL) approach that has low complexity and optimal
localization accuracy. We first convert the nonlinear problem into a linear one
by squaring the distance equations and employing intermediate variables. Then,
a weighted least squares (WLS) method is used to optimize the positioning
accuracy. We prove that the positioning error of the new method reaches
Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) in far field conditions with small measurement
noise. Simulations on 2D and 3D positioning scenes are conducted. Results show
that, compared with the iterative approach, which has high complexity and
requires a good initialization, the new CDL method does not require
initialization and has lower computational complexity with comparable
positioning accuracy. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis on
positioning accuracy, and show that the new CDL method has superior performance
over the state-of-the-art closed-form method. Experiments using real GPS and
BDS data verify the applicability of the new CDL method and the superiority of
its performance in the real world.

flat or even a decreasing surface-density profile, while fainter late-type
stars maintain a cusp-like profile. Historically, the lack of red giants in the
Galactic center was discovered via the drop in the strength of the CO
absorption bandhead by Kris Sellgren et al. (1990), later followed by the
stellar number counts based on the high angular resolution near-infrared
observations. Several mechanisms were put forward that could have led to the
preferential depletion of bright red giants: star-star collisions, tidal
stripping, star-accretion disc collisions, or an infall of a massive cluster or
a secondary black hole. Here we propose a novel scenario for the bright
red-giant depletion based on the collisions between red giants and the nuclear
jet, which was likely active in the Galactic center a few million years ago and
could have led to the formation of the large-scale $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles.
The process of the jet-induced ablation of red giants appears to be most
efficient within $\sim 0.04\,{\rm pc}$ (S-cluster), while at larger distances
it was complemented by star-accretion disc collisions and at smaller scales,
tidal stripping operated. These three mechanisms likely operated simultaneously
and created an apparent core of late-type stars within $\sim 0.5\,{\rm pc}$.

connected) smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds commenced in arXiv:1706.01268. The
diffeomorphism class of such a threefold is known to be determined up to
finitely many possibilities by the integral middle cohomology and two integral
forms on the integral second cohomology, namely the cubic cup-product form and
the linear form given by cup-product with the second chern class. The question
addressed in both papers is whether knowledge of these cubic and linear forms
determines the threefold up to finitely many families, that is the moduli of
such threefolds is bounded. If this is true, then in particular the middle
integral cohomology would be bounded by knowing these two forms. Crucial to
this question is the study of rigid non-movable surfaces on the threefold,
which are the irreducible surfaces that deform with any small deformation of
the complex structure of the threefold but for which no multiple moves on the
threefold. We showed in the previous paper that if there are no such surfaces,
then the answer to the above question is yes. Moreover if the Picard number is
2, the answer was shown to be yes without any further assumptions on the
Calabi-Yau threefold. The main results of this paper are for Picard number 3,
where we prove boundedness in the case where there is at most one rigid
non-movable surface, assuming the cubic form is smooth (thereby defining a real
elliptic curve); in the two cases where the Hessian curve is singular, we also
assume that the line defined by the second chern class does not intersect this
curve at an inflexion point. In addition to the methods described in the
previous paper, a further crucial tool in the proofs will be the classical
Steinian involution on the Hessian of an elliptic curve.

theoretical analysis of the error between the filtered output and the input

under regularity assumptions on the input and the filtering kernel, we prove
for a second-order CT-$\Sigma\Delta$ that the error estimate may be in
$o(1/N^2)$, where $N$ is the oversampling ratio. The whole theory is validated
by numerical experiments.

together. The main model of interaction is the message-passing model, where
processes communicate by exchanging messages. Nevertheless, there are several
models varying along important dimensions: degree of synchrony, kinds of
faults, number of faults... This variety is compounded by the lack of a general
formalism in which to abstract these models. One way to bring order is to
constrain these models to communicate in rounds. This is the setting of the
Heard-Of model, which captures many models through predicates on the messages
sent in a round and received on time. Yet, it is not easy to define the
predicate that captures a given operational model. The question is even harder
for the asynchronous case, as unbounded message delay means the implementation
of rounds must depend on details of the model. This paper shows that
characterising asynchronous models by heard-of predicates is indeed meaningful.
This characterization relies on delivered predicates, an intermediate
abstraction between the informal operational model and the heard-of predicates.
Our approach splits the problem into two steps: first extract the delivered
model capturing the informal model, and then characterize the heard-of
predicates that are generated by this delivered model. For the first part, we
provide examples of delivered predicates, and an approach to derive more. It
uses the intuition that complex models are a composition of simpler models. We
define operations like union, succession or repetition that make it easier to
derive complex delivered predicates from simple ones while retaining
expressivity. For the second part, we formalize and study strategies for when
to change rounds. Intuitively, the characterizing predicate of a model is the
one generated by a strategy that waits for as much messages as possible,
without blocking forever.

reduce displacement efficiency. In this study, we report a possible adjustment
in pore geometry which aims to suppress the capillary fingering in porous media
with hierarchical structures. Through pore-scale simulations and theoretical
analysis, we demonstrate and quantify combined effects of wettability and
hierarchical geometry on displacement patterns, showing a transition from
fingering to compact mode. Our results suggest that with a higher porosity of
the 2nd-order porous structure, the displacement can keep compact across a
wider range of wettability conditions. Combined with our previous work on
viscous fingering in such media, we can provide a complete insight into the
fluid-fluid displacement control in hierarchical porous media, across a wide

  Estimation for Dense Object Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localization Quality Estimation (LQE) is crucial and popular in the recent
advancement of dense object detectors since it can provide accurate ranking
scores that benefit the Non-Maximum Suppression processing and improve
detection performance. As a common practice, most existing methods predict LQE
scores through vanilla convolutional features shared with object classification
or bounding box regression. In this paper, we explore a completely novel and
different perspective to perform LQE -- based on the learned distributions of
the four parameters of the bounding box. The bounding box distributions are
inspired and introduced as ""General Distribution"" in GFLV1, which describes the
uncertainty of the predicted bounding boxes well. Such a property makes the
distribution statistics of a bounding box highly correlated to its real
localization quality. Specifically, a bounding box distribution with a sharp
peak usually corresponds to high localization quality, and vice versa. By
leveraging the close correlation between distribution statistics and the real
localization quality, we develop a considerably lightweight Distribution-Guided
Quality Predictor (DGQP) for reliable LQE based on GFLV1, thus producing GFLV2.
To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt in object detection to use a
highly relevant, statistical representation to facilitate LQE. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, GFLV2
(ResNet-101) achieves 46.2 AP at 14.6 FPS, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art ATSS baseline (43.6 AP at 14.6 FPS) by absolute 2.6 AP on COCO

more applications, have been successfully applied to perform corrective and
preventive software maintenance. Pattern-Driven Maintenance (PDM) is a method
designed to support the creation of such rules during software maintenance.
However, as PDM was recently proposed, few maintainers have reported on its
usage. Hence, the challenges and skills needed to apply PDM properly are
unknown. Aims: In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by
maintainers on applying PDM for creating custom static analysis rules for
defect localization. Method: We conducted an observational study on novice
maintainers creating custom static analysis rules by applying PDM. The study
was divided into three tasks: (i) identifying a defect pattern, (ii)
programming a static analysis rule to locate instances of the pattern, and
(iii) verifying the located instances. We analyzed the efficiency and
acceptance of maintainers on applying PDM and their comments on task
challenges. Results: We observed that previous knowledge on debugging, the
subject software, and related technologies influenced the performance of
maintainers as well as the time to learn the technology involved in rule
programming. Conclusions: The results strengthen our confidence that PDM can
help maintainers in producing custom static analysis rules for locating
defects. However, a proper selection and training of maintainers is needed to
apply PDM effectively. Also, using a higher level of abstraction can ease
static analysis rule programming for novice maintainers.

Our results show an improvement of up to 1% in accuracy for ModelNet40 compared

the number of iterations and provide numerical solutions that are first-order

We identify the force-chain structure throughout the system during probe

acceleration. In microgravity environments, stick-slip behaviors are
negligible, and we find that faster probe insertion can suppress stick-slip
behaviors where they are present. We conclude that the mechanical response of

GCIS is based on the induced suffix sorting algorithm SAIS, presented by Nong
et al. in 2009. The proposed solution builds on the factorization performed by
SAIS during suffix sorting. A context-free grammar is used to replace factors
by non-terminals. The algorithm is then recursively applied on the shorter
sequence of non-terminals. The resulting grammar is encoded by exploiting some
redundancies, such as common prefixes between right-hands of rules, sorted
according to SAIS. GCIS excels for its low space and time required for
compression while obtaining competitive compression ratios. Our experiments on
regular and repetitive, moderate and very large texts, show that GCIS stands as
a very convenient choice compared to well-known compressors such as Gzip,
7-Zip, and RePair, the gold standard in grammar compression. In exchange, GCIS
is slow at decompressing. Yet, grammar compressors are more convenient than
Lempel-Ziv compressors in that one can access text substrings directly in
compressed form, without ever decompressing the text. We demonstrate that GCIS
is an excellent candidate for this scenario because it shows to be competitive
among its RePair based alternatives. We also show, how GCIS relation with SAIS
makes it a good intermediate structure to build the suffix array and the LCP
array during decompression of the text.

characterisation of the exoplanets are currently in operation for 8-10 meter
class telescopes. Coronagraphs are commonly used in these facilities to reject
the diffracted light of an observed star and enable direct imaging and
spectroscopy of its circumstellar environment. SHARK-NIR is a coronagraphic
camera that will be implemented at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). After
an extensive simulation campaign, SHARK-NIR team selected a suite of
coronagraphic techniques to be implemented in the instrument in order to fulfil
the scientific requirements. In summary, the Gaussian Lyot coronagraph is the
option to serve all those science cases requiring field-stabilization and
moderate contrast. Observations in pupil-stabilized mode to search for
exoplanets can take advantage of three Shaped Pupil masks (SPC) and a
Four-Quadrant Phase Mask (FQPM) coronagraph. The SPC are designed for high
contrast on a small field close to the star and are robust to image and pupil
jitter. The FQPM allows to access the entire scientific FoV (18''x18'') and
delivers excellent performance in ideal conditions (high Strehl ratios), but
performance is still good, both close and further away from the star, even at
lower Strehl and with moderate vibrations. After the procurement phase, the
coronagraphic masks were delivered to our labs and we started to test their
performance on the optical bench and define the alignment procedures that will
be employed in the final integration of the instrument in our cleaning room. In
this article, we describe the tests that we performed in the lab with SHARK-NIR
coronagraphs. We measured the contrast achievable with each technique in
very-high Strehl conditions and defined the alignment-integration procedures.

photothermal energy conversion processes are rigorously calculated to predict

predicts that when optimized, the power output of the considered PETE device

100$\times$ solar concentration, which is substantially lower than those
predicted in previous works under ideal conditions. In addition, the
photon-enhancement ratio is lower than 10 and decreases with the increasing
solar concentration due to the photothermal heating of the emitter, suggesting
that PETE may be an adequate energy conversion process for low-to-medium CSP
below $\sim$100$\times$ concentration. These observations signify the
importance of a rigorous energy balance analysis based on spectral and spatial

equivariant Gaussian processes. Secondly, we introduce Steerable Conditional
Neural Processes (SteerCNPs), a new, fully equivariant member of the Neural
Process family. In experiments with Gaussian process vector fields, images, and
real-world weather data, we observe that SteerCNPs significantly improve the
performance of previous models and equivariance leads to improvements in
transfer learning tasks.

have explicitly calculable averages. This explicit calculability is a stronger
feature than ordinary integrability, just like the cases of quadratic and
Coulomb potentials are distinguished among other central potentials, and we
call it superintegrability. Aa a peculiarity of matrix models, the relevant
basis is formed by the Schur polynomials (characters) and their
generalizations, and superintegrability looks like a property
$<character>\,\sim character$. This is already known to happen in the most
important cases of Hermitian, unitary, and complex matrix models. Here we add
two more examples of principal importance, where the model depends on external
fields: a special version of the complex model and the cubic Kontsevich model.
In the former case, straightforward is a generalization to the complex tensor
model. In the latter case, the relevant characters are the celebrated $Q$ Schur
functions appearing in the description of spin Hurwitz numbers and other
related contexts.

  Population Living in Deprived Communities","Presented at NeurIPS 2020 Workshop on Machine Learning for the
  Developing World",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over a billion people live in slums in settlements that are often located in
ecologically sensitive areas and hence highly vulnerable. This is a problem in
many parts of the world, but it is more prominent in low-income countries,
where in 2014 on average 65% of the urban population lived in slums. As a
result, building resilient communities requires quantifying the population
living in these deprived areas and improving their living conditions. However,
most of the data about slums comes from census data, which is only available at
aggregate levels and often excludes these settlements. Consequently,
researchers have looked at alternative approaches. These approaches, however,
commonly rely on expensive high-resolution satellite imagery and field-surveys,
which hinders their large-scale applicability. In this paper, we investigate a
cost-effective methodology to estimate the slum population by assessing the
quality of gridded population data. We evaluate the accuracy of the WorldPOP
and LandScan population layers against ground-truth data composed of 1,703
georeferenced polygons that were mapped as deprived areas and which had their
population surveyed during the 2010 Brazilian census. While the LandScan data
did not produce satisfactory results for most polygons, the WorldPOP estimates
were less than 20% off for 67% of the polygons and the overall error for the
totality of the studied area was only -5.9%. This small error margin
demonstrates that population layers with a resolution of at least a 100m, such
as WorldPOP's, can be useful tools to estimate the population living in slums.

that the CRS-derived radial solar wind speeds, when converted from the radial

generally agree with those similarly-derived speeds from the Low-Energy Charged

significantly from the radial solar wind speeds measured directly by the Plasma

solar wind speeds are significantly higher than those measured by PLS and times
when they are significantly lower. The differences are not expected nor
explained, but it appears that after a few years in the heliosheath the V2
radial solar wind speeds derived from the C-G method underestimate the true
speeds as the spacecraft approaches the heliopause. We discuss the implications
of this observation for the stagnation region reported along the Voyager 1

recently observed in some reentrant spin-glass materials. Here we investigate
the SEB in La$_{1.5}$(Sr$_{0.5-x}$Ba$_{x}$)CoMnO$_{6}$ double-perovskites, a
system with multifarious magnetic phases for which a notable increase in the
exchange bias field is observed for intermediate Sr/Ba concentrations. The Ba
to Sr substitution leads to the enhancement of the crystal lattice, which is
accompanied by the raise of both the effective magnetic moment ($\mu_{eff}$)
and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature that is observed below
the ferromagnetic ordering. Such increases are likely related to the increased
fraction of Co$^{3+}$ in the high spin configuration, leading to the
enhancement of Co$^{3+}$--O--Mn$^{4+}$ AFM phase and to the reduction in the
uncompensation of the AFM coupling between Co and Mn. The combined effect of
the increased $\mu_{eff}$ and AFM phase plausible explains the changes in the
SEB effect.

weaker gravitational strength at early times and naturally recovering the
consistency with laboratory and Solar System tests of gravity. We analyze the
capability of EMG with positive $\xi$ to fit current cosmological observations

reliably described within the context of the relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi
acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of
the jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the
jet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet
plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the
thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons,
muons, $\eta$-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation
from the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy
$\gamma$-ray emission. One of our main goals is, through the appropriate
solution of the transport equation and taking into account the various
mechanisms that cause energy losses to the particles, to study the secondary
particle distributions within hadronic astrophysical jets. After testing our

jamming signal and the signal being jammed, even though they cannot be

unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. Through Hall effect and Fermi surface
measurements of CeCoIn$_5$, in comparison to ab initio calculations, we find
evidence for a critical point that connects two Fermi surfaces with different
volumes without apparent symmetry-breaking, indicating the presence of a
transition that involves an abrupt localization of one sector of the charge
degrees of freedom. We present a model for the anomalous electrical Hall
resistivity of this material based on the conductivity of valence charge
fluctuations.

knowledge, there is no previous work addressing this problem. One main issue,
widely known to the community, is that object boundaries derived only from 2D
image appearance are ambiguous and unreliable. To address this, we exploit
LiDAR clues to aid unsupervised object detection. By exploiting the 3D scene
structure, the issue of localization can be considerably mitigated. We further
identify another major issue, seldom noticed by the community, that the
long-tailed and open-ended (sub-)category distribution should be accommodated.
In this paper, we present the first practical method for unsupervised object
detection with the aid of LiDAR clues. In our approach, candidate object
segments based on 3D point clouds are firstly generated. Then, an iterative
segment labeling process is conducted to assign segment labels and to train a
segment labeling network, which is based on features from both 2D images and 3D
point clouds. The labeling process is carefully designed so as to mitigate the
issue of long-tailed and open-ended distribution. The final segment labels are
set as pseudo annotations for object detection network training. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open dataset suggest that the derived
unsupervised object detection method achieves reasonable accuracy compared with
that of strong supervision within the LiDAR visible range. Code shall be

extensive flight envelope and the nonlinear flight dynamics. A solution that
can excel both in nominal performance and in robustness to uncertainties is
still to be found. While Control Theory often debouches into parameters'
scheduling procedures, Reinforcement Learning has presented interesting results
in ever more complex tasks, going from videogames to robotic tasks with
continuous action domains. However, it still lacks clearer insights on how to
find adequate reward functions and exploration strategies. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is pioneer in proposing Reinforcement Learning as a
framework for flight control. In fact, it aims at training a model-free agent
that can control the longitudinal flight of a missile, achieving optimal
performance and robustness to uncertainties. To that end, under TRPO's
methodology, the collected experience is augmented according to HER, stored in
a replay buffer and sampled according to its significance. Not only does this
work enhance the concept of prioritized experience replay into BPER, but it
also reformulates HER, activating them both only when the training progress
converges to suboptimal policies, in what is proposed as the SER methodology.
Besides, the Reward Engineering process is carefully detailed. The results show
that it is possible both to achieve the optimal performance and to improve the
agent's robustness to uncertainties (with low damage on nominal performance) by
further training it in non-nominal environments, therefore validating the
proposed approach and encouraging future research in this field.

methods with respective advantages and applications. This paper seeks to
present and discuss one such method, namely Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). CNNs are deep neural networks that use a special linear operation
called convolution. This operation represents a key and distinctive element of
CNNs, and will therefore be the focus of this method paper. The discussion
starts with the theoretical foundations that underlie convolutions and CNNs.
Then, the discussion proceeds to discuss some improvements and augmentations
that can be made to adapt the method to estimate a wider set of function
classes. The paper mainly investigates two ways of improving the method: by
using locally connected layers, which can make the network less invariant to
translation, and tiled convolution, which allows for the learning of more
complex invariances than standard convolution. Furthermore, the use of the Fast
Fourier Transform can improve the computational efficiency of convolution.
Subsequently, this paper discusses two applications of convolution that have
proven to be very effective in practice. First, the YOLO architecture is a
state of the art neural network for image object classification, which
accurately predicts bounding boxes around objects in images. Second, tumor
detection in mammography may be performed using CNNs, accomplishing 7.2% higher
specificity than actual doctors with only .3% less sensitivity. Finally, the
invention of technology that outperforms humans in different fields also raises
certain ethical and regulatory questions that are briefly discussed.

the region of the spur closer to the stream appears dynamically colder than the

their evolution. In some cases, the ejected mass likely originates from
non-terminal explosive outbursts, rather than continuous winds. Here we study
the dependence of the ejecta mass, $m_{\rm ej}$, on the energy budget $E$ of an
explosion deep within the star, using both analytical arguments and numerical
hydrodynamics simulations. Focusing on polytropic stellar models, we find that
for explosion energies smaller than the stellar binding energy, the ejected
mass scales as $m_{\rm ej} \propto E^{\varepsilon_{m}}$, where $\varepsilon_m =
2.4-3.0$ depending on the polytropic index. The loss of energy due to shock
breakout emission near the stellar edge leads to the existence of a minimal
mass-shedding explosion energy, corresponding to a minimal ejecta mass. For a
wide range of progenitors, from Wolf-Rayet stars to red supergiants, we find a
similar limiting energy of $E_{\rm min} \approx 10^{46}-10^{47} \rm \, erg$,

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1489",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-redshift star-forming galaxies often have irregular morphologies with
{\it giant clumps} containing up to $10^{8-9}$ solar masses of gas and stars.
The origin and evolution of giant clumps are debated both theoretically and
observationally. In most cosmological simulations, high-redshift galaxies have
regular spiral structures or short-lived clumps, in contradiction with many
idealised high-redshift disc models. Here we test whether this discrepancy can
be explained by the low gas fractions of galaxies in cosmological simulations.
We present a series of simulations with varying gas fractions, from 25\%,
typical of galaxies in most cosmological simulations, to 50\%, typical of
observed galaxies at 1.5 < z < 3. We find that gas-poor models have short-lived
clumps, that are unbound and mostly destroyed by galactic shear, even with weak
stellar feedback. In contrast, gas-rich models form long-lived clumps even with
boosted stellar feedback. This shows that the gas mass fraction is the primary
physical parameter driving violent disc instabilities and the evolution of
giant clumps on $\sim$10$^8$~yr timescales, with lower impact from the
calibration of the stellar feedback. Many cosmological simulations of galaxy
formation have relatively gas-poor galactic discs, which could explain why
giant clumps are absent or short-lived in such models. Similar baryonic and
dark matter mass distribution could produce clumpy galaxies with long-lived
clumps at $z\sim2$ if the gas fraction was in better agreement with
observations.

Our results reveal that by increasing the ratio of the superconducting gaps
$\Delta_2/\Delta_1$, the critical supercurrent in a ballistic $S_1NS_2$ system
can be enhanced by more than $100\%$, and reaches a saturation point, or decays
away, depending on the junction thickness, magnetization strength, and chemical
potential. The total critical current in a diffusive $S_1NS_2$ system was found
to be enhanced by more than $50\%$ parabolically, and reaches saturation by
increasing one of the superconducting gaps. In a uniform ferromagnetic
junction, the supercurrent undergoes reversal by increasing
$\Delta_2/\Delta_1>1$. Through decomposing the total supercurrent into its
supergap and subgap components, our results illustrate their crucial relative
contributions to the Josephson current flow. It was found that the competition
of subgap and supergap currents in a $S_1FS_2$ junction results in the
emergence of second harmonics in the current-phase relation. In contrast to a
diffusive asymmetric Josephson configuration, the behavior of the supercurrent
in a ballistic system with $\Delta_2/\Delta_1=1$ can be properly described by
the subgap current component only, in a wide range of parameter sets, including
Fermi level mismatch, magnetization strength, and junction thickness.
Interestingly, when $\Delta_2/\Delta_1>1$, our results have found multiple
parameter sets where the total supercurrent is driven by the supergap
component. Therefore, our comprehensive study highlights the importance of
subgap and supergap supercurrent components in both the ballistic and diffusive

entangled state is also the one which is maximally coherent in its Schmidt

connected. Entanglement coherence turns out to be closely related to the

operators use IP anycast, announcing servers in BGP from multiple physical
locations to reduce client latency and provide capacity. However, DNS is easy
to spoof: third parties intercept and respond to queries for benign or
malicious purposes. Spoofing is of particular risk for services using anycast,
since service is already announced from multiple origins. In this paper, we
describe methods to identify DNS spoofing, infer the mechanism being used, and
identify organizations that spoof from historical data. Our methods detect
overt spoofing and some covertly-delayed answers, although a very diligent
adversarial spoofer can hide. We use these methods to study more than six years
of data about root DNS servers from thousands of vantage points. We show that
spoofing today is rare, occurring only in about 1.7% of observations. However,
the rate of DNS spoofing has more than doubled in less than seven years, and it
occurs globally. Finally, we use data from B-Root DNS to validate our methods
for spoof detection, showing a true positive rate over 0.96. B-Root confirms
that spoofing occurs with both DNS injection and proxies, but proxies account

universe undergoes a series of transitions between different vacua. The density
perturbations (studied in this paper) are seeded by the probabilistic nature of
tunneling rather than quantum fluctuations of the inflaton. We find the scalar
power spectrum of chain inflation and show that it is fully consistent with a
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In agreement with some of the previous literature (and
disagreement with others), we show that $10^4$ phase transitions per e-fold are
required in order to agree with the amplitude of Cosmic Microwave Background
anisotropies within the observed range of scales. Interestingly, the amplitude
of perturbations constrains chain inflation to a regime of highly unstable de
Sitter spaces, which may be favorable from a quantum gravity perspective since
the Swampland Conjecture on Trans-Planckian Censorship is automatically
satisfied. We provide new analytic estimates for the bounce action and the
tunneling rate in periodic potentials which replace the thin-wall approximation
in the regime of fast tunneling. Finally, we study model implications and
derive an upper limit of $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV on the axion decay constant in

knowledge of input distributions is needed to find the mutual information terms
in closed forms, which should be optimized over input distributions and
associated resource allocation. The optimum solution may require dividing the
available resources among several GIC (each called a ""constituent region"",
hereafter) and apply time-sharing among them. The current article focuses on a
single constituent region (meaning the constraints on resources are all
satisfied with equality) for a 2-users weak GIC. It is shown that, by relying
on a different, intuitively straightforward, interpretation of the underlying
optimization problem, one can determine the encoding/decoding strategies in the
process of computing the optimum solution. This is based on gradually moving
along the boundary of the capacity region in infinitesimal steps, where the
solution for the end point in each step is optimized relying on the solution at
the step's starting point. This approach enables proving Gaussian distribution
is optimum over the entire boundary, and also allows finding simple closed form
solutions describing different parts of the capacity region. The solution for
each constituent 2-users GIC coincides with the optimum solution to the Han
Kobayashi (HK) system of constraints with i.i.d. (scalar) Gaussian inputs.
Although the article is focused on 2-users weak GIC, the proof for optimality
of Gaussian distribution is independent of the values of cross gains, and
thereby is universally applicable to strong, mixed and Z interference channels,
as well as to GIC with more than two users. In addition, the procedure for the
construction of boundary is applicable for arbitrary cross gain values, by
re-deriving various conditions that have been established assuming cross gains
being less than one.

their surrounding Intracluster Light (ICL) using a surface brightness cut, a
luminosity cut, excess light above a de Vaucouleurs profile, or a double
S\'ersic decomposition. Assuming that all light above $M<-21.85~g'~\rm{mag}$ is
attributable to the ICL, we find an average ICL fraction of $f^{\rm MT}_{\rm
ICL}=71\pm22\%$ of all diffuse light centered on the BCG to belong to the ICL.
Likewise, if we assume all light fainter than $\rm{SB}>27$ $g'$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ to belong to the ICL, the average ICL fraction is $f^{\rm
SB27}_{\rm ICL}=34\pm19\%$. After fitting a de Vaucouleurs profile to the inner
parts of the SB profile, we detect excess light at large radii, corresponding
to an average ICL fraction of $f^{\rm DV}_{\rm ICL}=48\pm20\%$. Finally, by
decomposing the SB profile into two S\'ersic functions, we find an average ICL
fraction of $f^{\rm S\times}_{\rm ICL}=52\pm21\%$ associated with the outer
S\'ersic component. Our measured ICL and BCG+ICL luminosities agree well with
predictions from high-resolution simulations where the outer S\'ersic component
traces the unrelaxed, accreted stellar material. BCG and ICL properties defined
in this way are correlated with cluster parameters to study the co-evolution of
BCGs, ICL, and their host clusters. We find positive correlations between
BCG+ICL brightness and cluster mass, cluster velocity dispersion, cluster
radius, and integrated satellite brightness, confirming that BCG/ICL growth is
indeed coupled with cluster growth. On average, the ICL is better aligned than
the BCG with the host cluster in terms of position angle, ellipticity, and
centering. That makes it a potential Dark Matter tracer.

attack is a predominant one causing detrimental effects on the network by

rank attack detection scheme for non-storing mode of RPL used in IoT to deal
with both increased and decreased rank attacks. Accordingly, we have modified
the RPL Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) formation algorithm
to detect rank attacks during topology formation and maintenance. The
distributed module of the algorithm runs in all the participating nodes whereas
the centralized module runs in the sink. Unlike many existing schemes, instead
of sending additional control message, we make the scheme low-overhead by
simply modifying the DAO control message. Additionally, a lightweight Message
Authentication Code (HMAC-LOCHA) is used to verify the integrity and
authenticity of the control messages exchanged between nodes and the sink. The
correctness of the proposed scheme is established through a concrete proof
using multiple test case scenarios. Finally, the performance of the proposed
scheme is evaluated both theoretically and through simulation in Contiki-based
Cooja simulator. Theoretical evaluation proves the energy efficiency of the
scheme. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms over a
state-of-the-art rank attack detection scheme in terms of detection accuracy,
false positive or negative rate and energy consumption while also keeping
acceptable network performance such as improved detection latency and at par

cross-section of neutrinos it is vital to increase the sensitivity of the radio

re-configurability in DNN accelerators, we introduce an approximate computing

bits) and re-configurability is supported at the granularity of blocks. Results
of block-wise computations are composed in an approximate manner to enable
efficient re-configurability. We design a DNN accelerator that embodies
approximate blocked computation and propose a method to determine a suitable
approximation configuration for a given DNN. By varying the approximation
configurations across DNNs, we achieve 1.17x-1.73x and 1.02x-2.04x improvement

akin to revealing the solution to the problem, which can inadvertently
encourage students to pursue a trial-and-error approach to testing, rather than
using a more systematic approach that encourages learning. In addition to not
teaching students why their test suite is inadequate, this type of feedback may
motivate students to become dependent on the feedback rather than thinking for
themselves. To address this deficiency, there is an opportunity to investigate
alternative feedback mechanisms that include a positive reinforcement of
testing concepts. We argue that using an inquiry-based learning approach is
better than simply providing the answers. To facilitate this type of learning,
we present Testing Tutor, a web-based assignment submission platform that
supports different levels of testing pedagogy via a customizable feedback

strata are partitioned into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
strata. Each partition of atomic strata is a possible solution to the
stratification problem, the quality of which is measured by its cost. The Bell
number of possible solutions is enormous, for even a moderate number of atomic
strata, and an additional layer of complexity is added with the evaluation time
of each solution. Many larger scale combinatorial optimisation problems cannot
be solved to optimality, because the search for an optimum solution requires a
prohibitive amount of computation time. A number of local search heuristic
algorithms have been designed for this problem but these can become trapped in
local minima preventing any further improvements. We add, to the existing suite
of local search algorithms, a simulated annealing algorithm that allows for an
escape from local minima and uses delta evaluation to exploit the similarity
between consecutive solutions, and thereby reduces the evaluation time. We
compared the simulated annealing algorithm with two recent algorithms. In both

coherence measure is equal to sum of the three possible concurrences for
measuring the entanglement among different flavor modes which were calculated
in the paper by (M. Blasone et al., Europhys. Lett., {\bf 112}, 20007). Our
result shows that the origin of the flavor entanglement in neutrino oscillation
is the same as that of quantum coherence. Furthermore, in the wave packet
framework, the variation of $l_{1}$-norm is investigated by varying the wave
packet width $\sigma_{x}$. As it is expected the amount of coherence increases
by $\sigma_{x}$ due to the increase in the overlapping of the mass eigenstates.

regulation which permits us to explicitly -- within a specific microscopic
model -- relate the bulk association constant of a weak acid to the surface
association constant for the same weak acid adsorption sites. When considering
metal nanoparticles we explicitly account for the effect of the induced surface
charge in the conducting core. To explore the accuracy of the approximations,
we compare the ionic density profiles of an isolated charge-regulated metal

accuracy of the theoretical approach is established, we proceed to calculate
the interaction force between two charge-regulated metal nanoparticles by
numerically solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation with charge regulation
boundary condition. The force is then calculated by integrating the
electroosmotic stress tensor. We find that for metal nanoparticles the charge
regulation boundary condition can be well approximated by the constant surface
charge boundary condition, for which a very accurate Derjaguin-like
approximation was recently introduced. On the other hand, a constant surface
potential boundary condition often used in colloidal literature, shows a
significant deviation from the charge regulation boundary condition for

it establishes a global precision limit. We apply these results to the

estimator converges to the true temperature. The global framework thus enables
a reliable approach to data analysis in thermometry experiments.

observations of V445 Pup obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) spanning 1.5
to 43.3 GHz, and between 2001 January and 2008 March (days 89 to 2700 after
eruption). The radio light curve is dominated by synchrotron emission over
these seven years, and shows four distinct radio flares. Resolved radio images
obtained in the VLA A configuration show that the synchrotron emission hugs the
equatorial disc, and comparisons to near-IR images of the nova clearly
demonstrate that it is the densest ejecta, not the fastest ejecta, that are the
sites of the synchrotron emission in V445 Pup. The data are consistent with a
model where the synchrotron emission is produced by a wind from the white dwarf
impacting the dense equatorial disc, resulting in shocks and particle
acceleration. The individual synchrotron flares may be associated with density
enhancements in the equatorial disc and/ or velocity variations in the wind
from the white dwarf. This overall scenario is similar to a common picture of
shock production in hydrogen-rich classical novae, but V445 Pup is remarkable
in that these shocks persist for almost a decade, much longer than the weeks or

hydrate confined at the nanometer scale are unraveled using advanced molecular
modeling techniques combined with a mesoscale thermodynamic approach. By means
of atom-scale simulations probing coexistence upon confinement and free energy
calculations, phase stability of confined methane hydrate is shown to be
restricted to a narrower temperature and pressure domain than its bulk
counterpart. The melting point depression at a given pressure, which is
consistent with available experimental data, is shown to be quantitatively
described using the Gibbs--Thomson formalism if used with accurate estimates
for the pore/liquid and pore/hydrate surface tensions. The metastability
barrier upon hydrate formation and dissociation is found to decrease upon
confinement, therefore providing a molecular scale picture for the faster
kinetics observed in experiments on confined gas hydrates. By considering
different formation mechanisms -- bulk homogeneous nucleation, external surface
nucleation, and confined nucleation within the porosity -- we identify a
crossover in the nucleation process; the critical nucleus formed in the pore
corresponds either to a hemispherical cap or a bridge nucleus depending on
temperature, contact angle, and pore size. Using the classical nucleation
theory, for both mechanisms, the typical induction time is shown to scale with
the pore surface to volume ratio and, hence, the reciprocal pore size. These
findings for the critical nucleus and nucleation rate associated to such
complex transitions provide a mean to rationalize and predict methane hydrate
formation in any porous media from simple thermodynamic data.

megaregions of intense heat which are evident from observations. A delineation
of the eleven United States UCs relative to their underlying climatological
regions (non-UCs) suggest a surprisingly mixed trend. Medians and trends of
winter temperatures over the last 60-years are generally higher in the UCs but
no such general trends are observed in the summer. Heat wave metrics related to
public health, energy demand and relative intensity do not exhibit
significantly higher overall trends. Temperature and heat wave indices in the
UCs exhibit high correlations with each other including across seasons.
Spatiotemporal patterns in population, along with urbanization, agriculture and
elevation, exhibit high (positive or negative) rank correlations with warming
and heatwave intensification. The findings can inform climate adaptation in

the inner product of a preference vector with pre-specified multi-objective

receives a (adversarial) preference every episode and proposes policies to

Furthermore, we consider preference-free exploration, i.e., the agent first
interacts with the environment without specifying any preference and then is
able to accommodate arbitrary preference vector up to $\epsilon$ error. Our
proposed algorithm is provably efficient with a nearly optimal trajectory

galaxies. These direct collisions can eject gas masses on the order of \SI{e10}
Msun stripped from the stellar disks of each galaxy. The Taffy Galaxy system
(UGC 1294/5) is a prototypical example of a splash bridge system. CO
observations of the Taffy revealed that its splash bridge contains a mass of
H_2 equal to that of the Milky Way's H_2 mass. However, the little visible star
formation occurring within the bridge highlights the need for models of direct
gas-rich disk collisions. The Arp 194 system displays what may be another
splash bridge resulting from the collision between two disk galaxies. The
region between the two stellar disks contains bright clumps of active star
formation. We aim to better understand the conditions for star formation in
splash bridges by employing a Jeans criterion to determine where gravitational
instabilities occur in the shocked and cooling gas of gas-rich disk collisions.
The splash bridge results are obtained from our previous work using a sticky
particle code and post-processed. We find that the inclination between the gas
disks and the collision velocity with which the gas collides strongly affects
the fraction of gas that will become gravitationally unstable. Low inclinations
between gas disks produce starbursts whereas high inclinations result in
steady-rate star formation. The offset of the gas disks at impact will
determine how many gas elements directly collide but does not strongly affect

due to their competition with charge-density fluctuations. A distinct Higgs
mode, controllable by terahertz (THz) laser pulses, can arise in multi-band,
unconventional SCs via strong {\em interband} Coulomb interaction, but is yet
to be accessed. Here we both discover and demonstrate quantum control of such

amplitude mode oscillations on the THz driving fields is distinct from any
one-band and conventional SC results: we observe a large nonlinear change of
resonance strength, yet with a persisting mode frequency. We argue that this
result provides compelling evidence for a transient coupling between the
electron and hole amplitude modes via strong interband coherent interaction. To
support this scenario, we perform quantum kinetic modeling of a hybrid Higgs
mechanism without invoking extra disorder or phonons. In addition to
distinguishing between collective modes and charge fluctuations, the light
quantum control of multiband SCs can be extended to probe and manipulate
many-body entanglement and hidden symmetries in different quantum materials.

account two types of the magnetic anisotropy, single-ion anisotropy and
bond-dependent anisotropy, we elucidate magnetic phase diagrams for an
archetypal triangular-lattice system in the absence and presence of an external
magnetic field. In the case of the single-ion anisotropy, we find a plethora of
multiple-$Q$ instabilities depending on the strength and the sign of the
anisotropy (easy plane or easy axis), including a skyrmion crystal with
topological number of two. In an external magnetic field, we find that a
skyrmion crystal with topological number of one is stabilized by the in-plane
(out-of-plane) magnetic field under the easy-plane (easy-axis) anisotropy. We
also examine the stability of the field-induced skyrmion crystal by rotating
the field direction. As a biproduct, we show that a triple-$Q$ state with
nonzero chirality appears in the presence of the biquadratic interaction and
the easy-axis anisotropy. Meanwhile, we find that the bond-dependent anisotropy
also stabilizes both types of skyrmion crystals. We show that, however, for the
skyrmion crystal with topological number of one, Bloch- and N\'eel-type
skyrmion crystals are selectively realized depending on the sign of the

complicated because paired (shape, program) data is not readily available for
many domains, making exact supervised learning infeasible. However, it is
possible to get paired data by compromising the accuracy of either the assigned
program labels or the shape distribution. Wake-sleep methods use samples from a
generative model of shape programs to approximate the distribution of real
shapes. In self-training, shapes are passed through a recognition model, which
predicts programs that are treated as ""pseudo-labels"" for those shapes. Related
to these approaches, we introduce a novel self-training variant unique to
program inference, where program pseudo-labels are paired with their executed
output shapes, avoiding label mismatch at the cost of an approximate shape
distribution. We propose to group these regimes under a single conceptual
framework, where training is performed with maximum likelihood updates sourced
from either Pseudo-Labels or an Approximate Distribution (PLAD). We evaluate
these techniques on multiple 2D and 3D shape program inference domains.
Compared with policy gradient reinforcement learning, we show that PLAD
techniques infer more accurate shape programs and converge significantly

correlates with rearrangements in dimensions $d=2$ to $d=5$. We find that
softness - and even just the coordination number $Z$ - are quite predictive of
rearrangements over a wide range of pressures, all the way down to unjamming,
in all $d$ studied. This result provides direct evidence that local structure
can play a role in higher spatial dimensions.

imposes several challenges in a continuum framework. Here we exploit customized
reversible cohesive elements in a hybrid finite element model that can handle
occurrence of snap-through instabilities. The simulations capture various
peeling phenomena that emerge in experimental observations, where layers are
pulled from a flat, rigid substrate in the direction parallel to the surface.
For long layers, periodicity in reattachment is shown to develop and is linked
to the concept of Schallamach waves. Further, the connection between surface
properties and stick-slip behavior is investigated: we find that stick-slip is
linked to the propensity of the interface to localize deformation and damage.
Beyond elucidating the various peeling behaviors and the detachment modes, the
computational framework developed here provides a straightforward approach for
investigation of complex delamination processes, which can guide development of
future applications across different scales and in various settings.

populations and communities through its effects on the performance of
individuals. Because organisms' responses to environmental conditions are often
nonlinear (e.g., decreasing performance on both sides of an optimal
temperature), the mean response is often different from the response in the
mean environment. Ye et. al. 2020, proposed testing for the presence of such
variance effects on individual or population growth rates by estimating the
""Jensen Effect"", the difference in average growth rates under varying versus
fixed environments, in functional single index models for environmental effects
on growth. In this paper, we extend this analysis to effect of environmental
variance on reproduction and survival, which have count and binary outcomes. In
the standard generalized linear models used to analyze such data the direction
of the Jensen Effect is tacitly assumed a priori by the model's link function.
Here we extend the methods of Ye et. al. 2020 using a generalized single index
model to test whether this assumed direction is contradicted by the data. We
show that our test has reasonable power under mild alternatives, but requires
sample sizes that are larger than are often available. We demonstrate our

practice for broad populations. The average treatment effect (ATE) for a target

are effect modifiers whose distribution in the target population is different
that from that in the trial. Methods exist to use trial data to estimate the
target population ATE, provided the distributions of treatment effect modifiers
are observed in both the trial and target population -- an assumption that may
not hold in practice.
  Methods: The proposed sensitivity analyses address the situation where a
treatment effect modifier is observed in the trial but not the target
population. These methods are based on an outcome model or the combination of
such a model and weighting adjustment for observed differences between the
trial sample and target population. They accommodate several types of outcome
models: linear models (including single time outcome and pre- and
post-treatment outcomes) for additive effects, and models with log or logit
link for multiplicative effects. We clarify the methods' assumptions and
provide detailed implementation instructions.
  Illustration: We illustrate the methods using an example generalizing the
effects of an HIV treatment regimen from a randomized trial to a relevant
target population.
  Conclusion: These methods allow researchers and decision-makers to have more
appropriate confidence when drawing conclusions about target population
effects.

many-copy setting. This is not a problem when arbitrary quantum measurements
are allowed, as then the states can be distinguished perfectly even with one
copy. However, it becomes highly nontrivial when we consider states of a
multipartite system and locality constraints are imposed. We hence focus on the
restricted families of measurements such as local operation and classical
communication (LOCC), separable operations (SEP), and the
positive-partial-transpose operations (PPT) in this paper.
  We first study asymptotic discrimination of an arbitrary multipartite
entangled pure state against its orthogonal complement using LOCC/SEP/PPT
measurements. We prove that the incurred optimal average error probability
always decays exponentially in the number of copies, by proving upper and lower
bounds on the exponent. In the special case of discriminating a maximally
entangled state against its orthogonal complement, we determine the explicit
expression for the optimal average error probability and the optimal trade-off
between the type-I and type-II errors, thus establishing the associated
Chernoff, Stein, Hoeffding, and the strong converse exponents. Our technique is
based on the idea of using PPT operations to approximate LOCC.
  Then, we show an infinite separation between SEP and PPT operations by
providing a pair of states constructed from an unextendible product basis
(UPB): they can be distinguished perfectly by PPT measurements, while the
optimal error probability using SEP measurements admits an exponential lower
bound. On the technical side, we prove this result by providing a quantitative

due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one
map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests
near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from
compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As
the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent
this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical
significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach
based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the
subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step
approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly
recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the
photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic
forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet
transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are
formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily
overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of
the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed
sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA.
Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as
implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to
recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition
including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative
merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real

unrealistic since they are collected over large heterogeneous domains (i.e.,
spatial behavior differs across subregions). Although several approaches have
been developed for nonstationary spatial models, these have focused primarily

leveraging parallel computing in modern high-performance computing systems. We
partition the spatial domain into disjoint subregions and fit locally
nonstationary models using a carefully curated set of spatial basis functions.
Then, we combine the local processes using a novel neighbor-based weighting

hierarchical modeling. We demonstrate our method to simulated examples and two

excellent laboratory to study the interaction between the accreted matter and

understanding of its accretion geometry is still outstanding. Here, we report
an X-ray spectral study using contemporaneous observations from \nustar\ and

a high soft X-ray temperature $\sim52$ keV. We suggest that the
multi-temperature emission is due to a distribution of the specific accretion
rate over the accretion region, which leads to a continuous temperature
distribution over the heated area and explains the high temperature of the soft
X-rays. We interpret these characteristics as the results of the inefficient
accretion in APs. Thus the accretion stream can punch deeply into the
magnetosphere and feed the white dwarf (WD) over a much narrower accretion
region near its equator. Additionally, the broad-band X-rays provide details of
the accretion; the low total accretion rate of $\sim 1 \times 10^{-10}
~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}$ contradicts the speculation that V1432 Aql was a recent
nova, while the high specific accretion rate of $\sim 5.6 ~g ~cm^{-2} ~s^{-1}$

of knowledge-based artificial intelligence systems. While a conceptual system,
which has abundant concepts and rich semantic relationships, and is
developable, evolvable, and adaptable to multi-task environments, its actual
construction is not only one of the major challenges of knowledge engineering,
but also the fundamental goal of research on knowledge and conceptualization.
Finding a new method to represent concepts and construct a conceptual system
will therefore greatly improve the performance of many intelligent systems.
Fortunately the core of human cognition is a system with relatively complete
concepts and a mechanism that ensures the establishment and development of the
system. The human conceptual system can not be achieved immediately, but rather
must develop gradually. Developmental psychology carefully observes the process
of concept acquisition in humans at the behavioral level, and along with
cognitive psychology has proposed some rough explanations of those
observations. However, due to the lack of research in aspects such as
representation, systematic models, algorithm details and realization, many of
the results of developmental psychology have not been applied directly to the
building of artificial conceptual systems. For example, Karmiloff-Smith's
Representation Redescription (RR) supposition reflects a concept-acquisition
process that re-describes a lower level representation of a concept to a higher
one. This paper is inspired by this developmental psychology viewpoint. We use
an object-oriented approach to re-explain and materialize RR supposition from
the formal semantic perspective, because the OO paradigm is a natural way to

and research areas. We present a detailed analysis of 12231 research papers
indexed by Web of Science (WoS) as retracted publications from 1981-2020. The
study demonstrates the collaboration patterns of retracted publications where
61.5% of authors have only one and 24.6% have two retracted papers; however, 2%
of authors have more than 10 retracted papers. To study the impact of citing
retracted papers, we investigated the retracted papers with citations. The
study reveals that 55.2% of retracted papers have been cited at least once,
where 25.4% of papers are such papers where at least one citation turned out to
be a retraction. This shows the impact of scientific misconduct or fraud on new
research. The number of retractions is independent of the journal impact factor
and as compared to high impact papers, low impact papers are attracting more
citations. We also investigate the citations received by retracted papers
published in higher as well as lower impact factor journals. 1/4th of the
papers are retracted citations that cited the retracted papers; however, there
is no significant relationship exists between the higher impact or lower impact
journals with retractions or citations. Finally, how the average team size and
average retracted citations vary among different research areas are studied.
The study provides an insight that how a fraud leads to another fraud in the

serious concern.

acquisition function is built to determine where next to evaluate the objective
function. In general, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression
operates on a continuous space. When input variables are categorical or
discrete, an extra care is needed. A common approach is to use one-hot encoded

combinatorial explosion problem. In this paper we present a method for Bayesian
optimization in a combinatorial space, which can operate well in a large
combinatorial space. The main idea is to use a random mapping which embeds the
combinatorial space into a convex polytope in a continuous space, on which all
essential process is performed to determine a solution to the black-box

antiferromagnets on magnetization plateaus by employing two complementary
methods: the adiabatic flux insertion in closed boundary conditions and a 't
Hooft anomaly argument on inherent symmetries in a quasi-one-dimensional limit.
The flux insertion with a tilted boundary condition restricts the lower bound
of the ground-state degeneracy on $1/9$, $1/3$, $5/9$, and $7/9$ magnetization
plateaus under the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ spin-rotation and the translation
symmetries: $3$, $1$, $3$, and $3$, respectively. This result motivates us
further to develop an anomaly interpretation of the $1/3$ plateau. Taking
advantage of the insensitivity of anomalies to spatial anisotropies, we examine
the existence of the unique gapped ground state on the $1/3$ plateau from a
quasi-one-dimensional viewpoint. In the quasi-one-dimensional limit, kagome
antiferromagnets are reduced to weakly coupled three-leg spin tubes. Here, we
point out the following anomaly description of the $1/3$ plateau. While a
simple $S=1/2$ three-leg spin tube cannot have the unique gapped ground state
on the $1/3$ plateau because of an anomaly between a $\mathbb Z_3\times \mathbb
Z_3$ symmetry and the translation symmetry at the $1/3$ filling, the kagome
antiferromagnet breaks explicitly one of the $\mathbb Z_3$ symmetries related
to a $\mathbb Z_3$ cyclic transformation of spins in the unit cell. Hence the
kagome antiferromagnet can have the unique gapped ground state on the $1/3$

locating the fetal four crucial chambers of heart in a US image. However, it is
a greatly challenging task due to several key factors, such as numerous
speckles in US images, the fetal cardiac chambers with small size and unfixed

2010. The signal to noise ratio in all kinds of experimental images of more or
less regular 2D periodic arrays is significantly enhanced by CIP and the
technique is independent of the type of recording device. In the SPM imaging
context, CIP can be understood as an a posteriori sharpening of the effective
experimental scanning probe tip by computational means. It is now possible to
remove multiple scanning probe mini-tip effects in images from 2D periodic
arrays of physical objects that either self-assembled or were created
artificially. Accepted within the scientific community is by now also the fact
that SPM tips can change their shape and fine structure during the operation of
a microscope and, thereby, obfuscate the recorded images in systematic ways.
CIP restores much of the smeared out information in such images. The adaptation
of a geometric Akaike Information Criterion from the robotics and computer
vision community to the unambiguous detection of 2D translation symmetries
enabled much of our recent progress. In the main body of this book chapter, we

extended from being a set of equations to an admissible set; (ii) the domain of
arguments has been extended from the whole state space to a restricted subset.
In the proposed method, state feedback controls are considered as a set of
extended Ledley antecedence solutions for a designed iterative admissible sets
over their corresponding restricted subsets. Based on this, an algorithm has
been proposed to verify the solvability, and simultaneously to provide all
possible state feedback stabilizers when the problem is solvable. All
stabilizers are optimal, which stabilize the logic systems from any initial
state to the destination state/state set in the shortest time. The method is
firstly demonstrated on Boolean control networks to achieve point
stabilization. Then, with some minor modifications, the proposed method is also
proven to be applicable to set stabilization problems. Finally, it is shown
that in $k$-valued and mix-valued logical systems, the proposed method remains

the threshold of $1/2$ for genuine multipartite entanglement \cite{Guhne2010},

Schwarzschild's orbit-based method, we have also developed a simplified model

those from N-body simulations. Both zoom-in simulations and the simplified

by an astute listener, even if the performance is an improvisation or an
unfamiliar piece. An example might be a highly dissonant chord played by
mistake in a classical-era sonata, or a sudden off-key note in a recurring
motif. The problem of identifying and correcting such errors can be approached
with artificial intelligence -- if a trained human can easily do it, maybe a
computer can be trained to spot the errors quickly and just as accurately. The
ability to identify and auto-correct errors in real-time would be not only
extremely useful to performing musicians, but also a valuable asset for
producers, allowing much fewer overdubs and re-recording of takes due to small
imperfections. This paper examines state-of-the-art solutions to related
problems and explores novel solutions for music error detection and correction,
focusing on their real-time applicability. The explored approaches consider
error detection through music context and theory, as well as supervised
learning models with no predefined musical information or rules, trained on

presented solutions operate on a high-level representation of the audio (MIDI)

cell migration model with Dirichlet boundary condition. The formal continuum
limit of the model is a nonlinear parabolic equation with a diffusivity which
can become negative if the cell density is small and spatial oscillations and
aggregation occur in the numerical simulations. In the classical diffusion
migration model with positive diffusivity and non-birth term, species will
vanish eventually with Dirichlet boundary. However, because of the aggregation
mechanism under small cell density, the total species density is conservative
in the discrete aggregation diffusion model. Also, the discrete system
converges to a unique positive steady-state with the initial density lying in
the diffusion domain. Furthermore, the aggregation mechanism in the model
induces rich asymptotic dynamical behaviors or patterns even with 5 discrete
space points which gives a theoretical explanation that the interaction between
aggregation and diffusion induces patterns in biology. In the corresponding
continuous backward forward parabolic equation, the existence of the solution,
maximum principle, the asymptotic behavior of the solution is also
investigated.

flow of river and the variations in the water flow makes the energy production
unreliable. This problem is usually solved by constructing a small pond in
front of the run of river hydropower plant. However, changes in water level of
conventional single pond model results in sags, surges and unpredictable power
fluctuations. This work proposes three pond model instead of traditional single
pond model. The volume of water in three ponds is volumetrically equivalent to
the traditional single pond but it reduces the dependency of the run of river
power plant on the flow of river. Moreover, three pond model absorbs the water
surges and disturbances more efficiently. The three pond system, modeled as
non-linear hydraulic three tank system, is being applied with fuzzy inference
system and standard PID based methods for smooth and efficient level
regulation. The results of fuzzy inference system are across-the-board improved
in terms of regulation and disturbances handling as compared to conventional

space ($1<p<\infty$) and give a nearly complete characterization of such
deterministic strategyproof mechanisms. We use the distance between an agent
and the facility in $L_p$ space to denote the cost of the agent. A mechanism is
strategyproof iff no agent can reduce her cost from misreporting her private
location. We show that in $L_p$ space ($1<p<\infty$) with 2 agents, any
location output of a deterministic, unanimous, translation-invariant
strategyproof mechanism must satisfy a set of equations and mechanisms are
continuous, scalable. In one-dimensional space, the output must be one agent's
location, which is easy to prove in any $n$ agents. However, in $m$-dimensional
space ($m\ge 2$), the situation will be much more complex, with only 2-agent
case finished. We show that the output of such a mechanism must satisfy a set
of equations, and when $p=2$ the output must locate at a sphere with the
segment between the two agents as the diameter. Further more, for $n$-agent
situations, we find that the simple extension of this the 2-agent situation
cannot hold when dimension $m>2$ and prove that the well-known general median
mechanism will give an counter-example. Particularly, in $L_2$ (i.e.,
Euclidean) space with 2 agents, such a mechanism is rotation-invariant iff it
is dictatorial; and such a mechanism is anonymous iff it is one of the three
mechanisms in Section 4. And our tool implies that any such a mechanism has a
tight lower bound of 2-approximation for maximum cost in any multi-dimensional
space.

find chondritic relative abundances of refractory lithophile elements (RLE) in
the bulk bodies (""constant RLE ratio rule""), based on limited variations of RLE
ratios among chondritic meteorites and the solar photosphere. Here, we show
that ratios of RLE, such as Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf, Sm/Nd and Al/Ti, are fractionated
from the solar value in chondrules from enstatite chondrites (EC). The
fractionated RLE ratios of individual EC chondrules document different
chalcophile affinities of RLE under highly reducing environments and a
separation of RLE-bearing sulfides from silicates before and/or during
chondrule formation. In contrast, the bulk EC have solar-like RLE ratios,
indicating that a physical sorting of silicates and sulfides was negligible
before and during the accretion of EC parent bodies. Likewise, if the Earth's
accretion were dominated by EC-like materials, as supported by multiple isotope
systematics, the physical sorting of silicates and sulfides in the accretionary
disk should not have occurred among the Earth's building blocks. Alternatively,
the Earth's precursors might have been high-temperature nebular materials that
condensed before the RLE fractionation due to precipitation of the RLE-bearing
sulfides...Highly reduced planets that have experienced selective removal or
accretion of silicates or metal/sulfide phases, such as Mercury, might have
fractionated, non-solar bulk RLE ratios.

Woods-Saxon potentials, it is shown that the recent observation of halo

result of the shell structure, which is unique in one-neutron resonant levels,
in particular near degeneracy of the neutron 1$f_{7/2}$ and 2$p_{3/2}$ resonant
levels, together with the strong preference of prolate shape by the proton

much favored by the proton number $Z$ = 8 that the presence of possible neutron
shell-structure may not make the system deformed. Thus, the strong preference
of particular shape by the proton numbers 8 and 9, respectively, together with
a considerable amount of the energy difference between the neutron $1d_{3/2}$

segmentation methods being very difficult to balance accuracy and computational
complexity, a fast point cloud ground segmentation approach based on a

improved elevation map for ground coarse segmentation, and then uses
spatiotemporal adjacent points to optimize the segmentation results. The
processed point cloud is classified into high-confidence obstacle points,
ground points, and unknown classification points to initialize an MRF model.
The graph cut method is then used to solve the model to achieve fine
segmentation. Experiments on datasets showed that our method improves on other
algorithms in terms of ground segmentation accuracy and is faster than other
graph-based algorithms, which require only a single core of an I7-3770 CPU to
process a frame of Velodyne HDL-64E data (in 39.77 ms, on average). Field tests

the mass of ultra-light dark matter particles, called `fuzzy' dark matter
(FDM). A general feature of FDM models is the presence of ubiquitous density
fluctuations in bound, virialized dark matter structures, on the scale of the
de Broglie wavelength, arising from wave interference in the evolving dark
matter distribution. These time-varying fluctuations can disturb the motions of
stars, leading to potentially observable signatures in cold thin tidal streams
in our own Galaxy. The study of this effect has been hindered by the difficulty
in simulating the FDM wavefunction in Milky Way-sized systems. We present a
simple method to evolve realistic wavefunctions in nearly static potentials,
that should provide an accurate estimate of this granulation effect. We
quantify the impact of FDM perturbations on tidal streams, and show that
initially, while stream perturbations are small in amplitude, their power
spectra exhibit a sharp cutoff corresponding to the de Broglie wavelength of
the FDM potential fluctuations. Eventually, when stream perturbations become
nonlinear, fold caustics generically arise that lead to density fluctuations
with universal behavior. This erases the signature of the de Broglie wavelength
in the stream density power spectrum, but we show that it will still be
possible to determine the FDM mass in this regime, by considering the
fluctuations in quantities like angular momenta or actions.

density evolution (MIM-DE) to construct the lookup tables (LUTs) for the node
updates. The computational complexity and memory requirements are discussed and
compared to the LUT decoder variants. For applications with low-latency
requirement, we consider the layered schedule to accelerate the convergence
speed of decoding quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. In particular, we develop the
layered MIM-DE to design the LUTs based on the MS algorithm, leading to the MIM
layered quantized MS (MIM-LQMS) decoder. An optimization method is further
introduced to reduce the memory requirement for storing the LUTs. Simulation
results show that the MIM quantized decoders outperform the state-of-the-art
LUT decoders in the waterfall region with both 3-bit and 4-bit precision over
the additive white Gaussian noise channels. For small decoding iterations, the
MIM quantized decoders also achieve a faster convergence speed compared to the
benchmarks. Moreover, the 4-bit MIM-LQMS decoder can approach the error
performance of the floating-point layered BP decoder within 0.3 dB in the
moderate-to-high SNR regions, over both the AWGN channels and the fast fading
channels.

candidate, whereas some of the predictions heavily rely on the near-horizon
physics that remains to be tested experimentally. As a concrete alternative,
thermal 2-2-holes closely resemble black holes without event horizons. Being a
probable endpoint of gravitational collapse, they not only provide a resolution
to the information loss problem, but also naturally give rise to stable
remnants. Previously, we have considered primordial 2-2-hole remnants as dark
matter. Due to the strong constraints from a novel phenomenon associated with
remnant mergers, only small remnants with close to the Planck mass can
constitute all of dark matter. In this paper, we examine the scenario that the
majority of dark matter consists of particles produced by the evaporation of
primordial 2-2-holes, whereas the remnant contribution is secondary. The
products with light enough mass may contribute to the number of relativistic
degrees of freedom in the early universe, which we also calculate. Moreover,
2-2-hole evaporation can produce particles that are responsible for the baryon
asymmetry. We find that baryogenesis through direct B-violating decays or
through leptogenesis can both be realized. Overall, the viable parameter space
for the Planck remnant case is similar to primordial black holes with Planck
remnants. Heavier remnants, on the other hand, lead to different predictions,
and the viable parameter space remains large even when the remnant abundance is
small.

properties coincide with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson. In light of the
LHC Higgs data which suggests that the observed Higgs boson is SM-like, it
follows that the mixing of the SM Higgs interaction eigenstate with the other
neutral scalar interaction eigenstates of the 2HDM should be suppressed,
corresponding to the so-called Higgs alignment limit. The exact Higgs alignment
limit can arise naturally due to a global symmetry of the scalar potential. If
this symmetry is softly broken, then the Higgs alignment limit becomes
approximate (although still potentially consistent with the current LHC Higgs
data). In this paper, we obtain the approximate Higgs alignment suggested by
the LHC Higgs data as a consequence of a softly broken global symmetry of the
Higgs Lagrangian. However, this can only be accomplished if the Yukawa sector
of the theory is extended. We propose an extended 2HDM with vector-like top
quark partners, where explicit mass terms in the top sector provide the source
of the soft symmetry breaking of a generalized CP symmetry. In this way, we can
realize approximate Higgs alignment without a significant fine-tuning of the
model parameters. We then explore the implications of the current LHC bounds on
vector-like top quark partners for the success of our proposed scenario.

most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined
to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within
static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of \textbf{state
driven visual reasoning} approach has limitations in reflecting whether the
machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which
has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in
Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{transformation driven visual reasoning} task. Given both the initial
and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or
multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value)
or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new
dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three
levels of settings, i.e.~Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step
transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views).
Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models
perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event

machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and real data need to be

planet formation theory. One of the possibilities is that it results from
gravitational instability as a result of pile-up of small silicate dust
particles released from sublimating icy pebbles that pass the snow line. Aims:
We want to understand and quantify the role of the water snow line for the
formation of rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals. In this paper, we focus on
the formation of rock-rich planetesimals. A companion paper examines the
combined formation of both rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals. Methods: We
develop a new Monte Carlo code to calculate the radial evolution of silicate
particles in a turbulent accretion disk, accounting for the back-reaction
(i.e., inertia) of the particles on their radial drift velocity and diffusion.
Results depend in particular on the particle injection width (determined from
the radial sublimation width of icy pebbles), the pebble scale height and the
pebble mass flux through the disk. The scale height evolution of the silicate
particles, which is the most important factor for the runaway pile-up, is
automatically calculated in this Lagrange method. Results: From the numerical
results, we derive semi-analytical relations for the scale height of the
silicate dust particles and the particles-to-gas density ratio at the midplane,
as functions of a pebble-to-gas mass flux ratio and the $\alpha$ parameters for
disk gas accretion and vertical/radial diffusion. We find that the runaway
pile-up of the silicate particles (formation of rocky planetesimals) occurs if
the pebble-to-gas mass flux ratio is $> [(\alpha_{Dz}/\alpha_{acc})/3 \times
10^{-2}]^{1/2}$ where $\alpha_{Dz}$ and $\alpha_{acc}$ are the $\alpha$
parameters for vertical turbulent diffusion and disk gas accretion.

perturbation from a zero-mean and unit-covariance distribution. In contrast,
this work considers the generalization where the perturbations have a possibly
non-identity covariance constructed from the history of the ZO queries. We
propose to feed the second-order approximation into the covariance matrix of
the random perturbation, so it is dubbed as Hessian-aided random perturbation
(HARP). HARP collects four zeroth-order queries per iteration to form
approximations for both the gradient and the Hessian. We show the convergence
(in an almost surely sense) and derive the convergence rate for HARP under mild
assumptions. We demonstrate, with theoretical guarantees and numerical
experiments, that HARP is less sensitive to ill-conditioning and more

  peristaltic pump","12 pages, 16 figures, Preprint submitted to the Journal of Sensors
  and Actuators A: Physical",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The unique working mechanics of roller-type peristaltic pumps have allowed
their applications to span a wide variety of sectors and industries. The
roller-type pump's accurate dosing and hydrostatic capabilities can
theoretically allow for the pump to be used for hydraulic actuation (as an
electro-hydrostatic actuator) for low pressure applications. This however
requires accurate control of the peristaltic pump and its flow rate. The
associated pressure pulsations will also have an impact on the pump's selection
criteria. Accurate control of roller-type peristaltic pumps commonly rely on
flow-meters, which increases the cost of the pump and can complicate control
strategies. Current modelling approaches either do not rely on first principle
modelling and require expensive simulation software, or do not apply for larger
Reynolds numbers at larger flow rates. The most applicable model focusses on
the flow rate for each roller individually. This implies that the model
requires alterations in order to accommodate pumps with varying numbers of
rollers. This paper presents an alternative modelling methodology towards the
volume flow rate, pulsatile flow rate qualities, and pressure pulsations
commonly found on peristaltic pumps. The model instead focusses on the flow
rate at the inlet and the outlet of the pump, rather than on each individual
roller. This model is highly scalable and allows for varying number of rollers.
The model is validated using a 3D printed peristaltic pump and pulsatile flow
rate test bench. The pump is capable of accommodating roller housings with
varying numbers of rollers (3 or 2) in order to validate the model.

consistent with the recent SPHERE polarisation measurement with a fractional

replicated by compact, spherical dust grains (i.e. from Mie theory) that are
around 1.2 $\mu$m in size, assuming astronomical silicate composition, or 3.9

systems, leading to logarithmic enhancement of (Rayleigh) phonon attenuation. A
logarithmic correction of the form $\sim -\omega^{2}\ln\omega$ is predicted to
occur in the plot of the reduced excess DOS for frequencies around the boson
peak in 3D. Moreover, the theory provides scaling laws of the density of states

current customer needs. Business Process Management (BPM) can provide the means
to structure and tackle this change. However, most approaches to BPM face
restrictions on the number of processes they can optimize at a time due to
complexity and resource restrictions. Investigating this shortcoming, the
concept of the long tail of business processes suggests a hybrid approach that
entails managing important processes centrally, while incrementally improving
the majority of processes at their place of execution. This study scrutinizes
this observation as well as corresponding implications. First, we define a
system of indicators to automatically prioritize processes based on execution
data. Second, we use process mining to analyze processes from multiple
companies to investigate the distribution of process value in terms of their
process variants. Third, we examine the characteristics of the process variants
contained in the short head and the long tail to derive and justify
recommendations for their management. Our results suggest that the assumption
of a long-tailed distribution holds across companies and indicators and also
applies to the overall improvement potential of processes and their variants.
Across all cases, process variants in the long tail were characterized by fewer
customer contacts, lower execution frequencies, and a larger number of involved
stakeholders, making them suitable candidates for distributed improvement.

In addition to steady-state solutions in different scenarios, phase space

also performed to demonstrate macroscopic quantum self-trapping regimes.
Schr\""odinger-cat states, maximally path-entangled ($N00N$) states, and
macroscopic soliton qubits are predicted and exploited for the
distinguishability of obtained macroscopic states in the framework of binary
(non-orthogonal) state discrimination problem. For arbitrary phase estimation
in the framework of linear quantum metrology approach, these macroscopic

Josephson junction (SJJ) device, which consists of two weakly-coupled
condensates with negative scattering length. The condensates are trapped in a
double-well potential and elongated in one dimension. Starting with classical
field theory we map for the first time a two-soliton problem onto the effective
two-mode Hamiltonian and perform a second quantization procedure. Compared to
the conventional Bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) condensate system, we show
that the SJJ-model in quantum domain exhibits unusual features due to its
effective nonlinear strength proportional to the square of total particle
number, $N^2$. A novel self-tuning effect for the effective tunneling parameter
is also demonstrated in the SJJ-model, which depends on the particle number and
rapidly vanishes as the JJ population imbalance increases. The formation of
entangled Fock state superposition is predicted for the quantum SJJ-model,
revealing dominant $N00N$-state components at the ""edges"" for $n=0, N$ particle
number. We have shown that the obtained quantum state is more resistant to few
particle losses from the condensates if tiny components of entangled Fock
states are present in the vicinity of the major $N00N$-state component. This
peculiarity of the quantum SJJ-model establishes an important difference from
its semiclassical analogue obtained in the framework of Hartree approach.

be studied with the efficient meron-cluster algorithm in any dimension. As with
the usual bipartite half-filled Hubbard models, the na\""ive $U(2)$ symmetry is
enhanced to $SO(4)$. On the other hand our model has a novel spin-charge flip
${\mathbb Z}^C_2$ symmetry which is an important ingredient of free massless
fermions. In this work we focus on one spatial dimension, and show that our
model can be viewed as a lattice-regularized two-flavor chiral-mass Gross-Neveu
model. Our model remains solvable in the presence of the Hubbard coupling $U$,
which maps to a combination of Gross-Neveu and Thirring couplings in one
dimension. Using the meron-cluster algorithm we find that the ground state of
our model is a valence bond solid when $U=0$. From our field theory analysis,
we argue that the valence bond solid forms inevitably because of an interesting
frustration between spin and charge sectors in the renormalization group flow
enforced by the ${\mathbb Z}^C_2$ symmetry. This state spontaneously breaks
translation symmetry by one lattice unit, which can be identified with a
$\mathbb{Z}_2^\chi$ chiral symmetry in the continuum. We show that increasing
$U$ induces a quantum phase transition to a critical phase described by the
$SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theory. The quantum critical point between these
two phases is known to exhibit a novel symmetry enhancement between spin and
dimer. Here we verify the scaling relations of these correlation functions near
the critical point numerically. Our study opens up the exciting possibility of
numerical access to similar novel phase transitions in higher dimensions in
fermionic lattice models using the meron-cluster algorithm.

Otherwise, the CNN (which is itself a continuous function) has to replicate an

daunting task: a vulnerability may affect a single line of code, and yet it
compromises the security of the entire application. Even worse, vulnerabilities
may manifest only in exceptional circumstances that do not occur in the normal
operation of the application. It is widely recognized that state-of-the-art
penetration testing tools play a crucial role, and are routinely used, to dig
up vulnerabilities. Yet penetration testing is still primarily a human-driven
activity, and its effectiveness still depends on the skills and ingenuity of
the security analyst driving the tool. In this paper, we propose a technique
for the automatic discovery of vulnerabilities in event-based systems, such as
web and mobile applications. Our approach is based on a collaborative,
co-evolutionary and contract-driven search strategy that iteratively (i)
executes a pool of test cases, (ii) identifies the most promising ones, and
(iii) generates new test cases from them. The approach makes a synergistic
combination of evolutionary algorithms where several ""species"" contribute to
solving the problem: one species, the test species, evolves to find the target
test case, i.e., the set of instruction whose execution lead to the vulnerable
statement, whereas the other species, called contract species, evolve to select
the parameters for the procedure calls needed to trigger the vulnerability. To
assess the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented a working prototype
and ran it against both a case study and a benchmark web application. The
experimental results confirm that our tool automatically discovers and executes
a number of injection flaw attacks that are out of reach for state-of-the-art

composed of frictional particles we also find that the critical (i.e.~the shear
jamming) packing fraction $\phi_c$ increase with decreasing $\gamma_0$. In both

between model outputs and experimental data. Usually, this comparison
constitutes plotting the model results against data on the same axes to provide
a visual assessment of agreement or lack thereof. However, there are a number
of concerns with such naive comparisons. First, these comparisons tend to
provide qualitative rather than quantitative assessments and are clearly
insufficient for making decisions regarding model validity. Second, they often
disregard or only partly account for existing uncertainties in the experimental
observations or the model input parameters. Third, such comparisons can not
reveal whether the model is appropriate for the intended purposes, as they
mainly focus on the agreement in the observable quantities.
  These pitfalls give rise to the need for an uncertainty-aware framework that

comparison of the system response quantities of an experiment with the ones
from a computational model, while accounting for uncertainties in both. To
address this need, we have developed a statistical framework that incorporates
a probabilistic modeling technique using a fully Bayesian approach. A Bayesian
perspective yields an optimal bias-variance trade-off against the experimental
data and provide an integrative metric for model validation that incorporates
parameter and conceptual uncertainty. Additionally, to accelerate the analysis
for computationally demanding flow and transport models in porous media, the
framework is equipped with a model reduction technique, namely Bayesian Sparse
Polynomial Chaos Expansion. We demonstrate the capabilities of the
aforementioned Bayesian validation framework by applying it to an application

an applicable design for converters based on conditional and geometrical
parameters. In this study, locations with maximum potential are chosen, and
conditional parameters are used as input data to design the oscillating

Anzali and Amirabad port, and after considering the proposed design, the
converter's productivity raised by 63 percent. It is also written that the
flap's optimal width is recommended to be between 18 and 23 meters. Moreover,
changes in damping incident forces have a direct relationship with the system's

compound nucleus were studied at the Tandem-ALTO facility using the

$\alpha$-particles from unbound $^{19}$Ne states were collected, in
coincidence, with a double-sided silicon strip detector array. Angular
correlations were extracted and constraints on the spin and parity of decaying
states established. The coincidence yield at $E_x$ = 6.29 MeV was observed to
be high spin, supporting the conclusion that it is indeed a doublet consisting
of high spin and low spin components. Evidence for a broad, low spin state was
observed around 6 MeV. Branching ratios were extracted for several states above
the proton threshold and were found to be consistent with the literature.
R-matrix calculations show the relative contribution of sub-threshold states to
the astrophysically important energy region above the proton threshold. The
levels schemes of $^{19}$Ne and $^{19}$F are still not sufficiently well known
and further studies of the analogue assignments are needed. The tentative broad
state at 6 MeV may only play a role if the reduced proton width is large.

remains one of the prime possibilities as candidates for DM near the TeV scale.
Taking a phenomenological view, such null results may be explained for a
generic WIMP in a Higgs-portal scenario if we allow the light-quark Yukawa
couplings to assume non-Standard Model (non-SM)-like values. This follows from
a cancellation among different terms in the DM-nucleon scattering which can, in
turn, lead to a vanishingly small direct-detection cross section. It might also
lead to isospin violation in the DM-nucleon scattering. Such non-SM values of
light-quark Yukawa couplings may be probed in the high luminosity run of the

Existing methods that use only nadir images suffer from severe problems of
ambiguous features and occlusions between buildings and other regions.
Furthermore, buildings in urban environments vary significantly in scale, which
leads to performance issues when using single-scale features. To solve these
issues, this paper proposes a fused feature pyramid network, which utilizes
both color and depth data for the 3D verification of existing buildings 2D
footprints from oblique images. First, the color data of oblique images are
enriched with the depth information rendered from 3D mesh models. Second,
multiscale features are fused in the feature pyramid network to convolve both
the color and depth data. Finally, multi-view information from both the nadir
and oblique images is used in a robust voting procedure to label changes in
existing buildings. Experimental evaluations using both the ISPRS benchmark
datasets and Shenzhen datasets reveal that the proposed method outperforms the
ResNet and EfficientNet networks by 5\% and 2\%, respectively, in terms of
recall rate and precision. We demonstrate that the proposed method can
successfully detect all changed buildings; therefore, only those marked as
changed need to be manually checked during the pipeline updating procedure;
this significantly reduces the manual quality control requirements. Moreover,
ablation studies indicate that using depth data, feature pyramid modules, and
multi-view voting strategies can lead to clear and progressive improvements.

indices are used to explore how resistance and reproductive potentia change
over a trawling gradient. The RRI allows for dividing the benthic community

modelling by simulating the extinction or loss of vulnerable species and its

comparing individual species' RRI scores to empirically observed responses over

observed responses (regression slopes) were significantly correlated providing
support for the rationality of the approach taken. Data analyses evidenced
increases of resistance and resilience indices over the trawling gradient,
demonstrating that communities lost vulnerable species with increasing

it to be disproportionately affected though the loss of vulnerable species. The

benchmark the performances of several single-reference wave function methods
(CC2, CCSD, CC3, CCSDT, ADC(2), and ADC(3/2)) and time-dependent
density-functional theory (TD-DFT) with various functionals (B3LYP, PBE0,
M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and $\omega$B97X-D). We consider the impact of various
gauges (length, velocity, and mixed) and formalisms: equation of motion (EOM)
\emph{vs} linear response (LR), relaxed \emph{vs} unrelaxed orbitals, etc.
Beyond the expected accuracy improvements and a neat decrease of formalism
sensitivy when using higher-order wave function methods, the present
contribution shows that, for both ADC(2) and CC2, the choice of gauge impacts
more significantly the magnitude of the oscillator strengths than the choice of
formalism, and that CCSD yields a notable improvement on this transition
property as compared to CC2. For the excited-state dipole moments, switching on
orbital relaxation appreciably improves the accuracy of both ADC(2) and CC2,
but has a rather small effect at the CCSD level. Going from ground to excited
states, the typical errors on dipole moments for a given method tend to roughly
triple. Interestingly, the ADC(3/2) oscillator strengths and dipoles are
significantly more accurate than their ADC(2) counterparts, whereas the two
models do deliver rather similar absolute errors for transition energies.
Concerning TD-DFT, one finds: i) a rather negligible impact of the gauge on
oscillator strengths for all tested functionals (except for M06-2X); ii)
deviations of ca.~0.10 D on ground-state dipoles for all functionals; iii) the
better overall performance of CAM-B3LYP for the two considered excited-state
properties.

we propose to learn those view-points. In particular, we introduce the
Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN) that regresses optimal view-points for
3D shape recognition, building upon advances in differentiable rendering. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end along with any multi-view network for 3D
shape classification. We integrate MVTN in a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that can render either 3D meshes or point clouds. MVTN exhibits clear
performance gains in the tasks of 3D shape classification and 3D shape
retrieval without the need for extra training supervision. In these tasks, MVTN
achieves state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet40, ShapeNet Core55, and the

spin polarization (NSP) and fluctuation bandwidth, in a single InAs quantum dot
under resonant excitation conditions with unprecedented spectral resolution.
The electron spin splitting is measured directly via resonant spin-flip single
photon Raman scattering detected by superconducting nanowires to generate
excitation-emission energy maps. The observed two-dimensional maps reveal an OH
field that has a non-linear dependence on excitation frequency. This study
provides new insight into earlier reports of so-called avoidance and tracking,
showing two distinct NSP responses directly by the addition of a emission
energy axis. The data show that the polarization processes depend on which
electron spin state is optically driven, with surprising differences in the
polarization fluctuations for each case: in one case, a stabilized field
characterized by a single-peaked distribution shifts monotonically with the
laser excitation frequency resulting in a nearly constant optical interaction
strength across a wide detuning range, while in the other case the previously
reported avoidance behavior is actually the result of a nonlinear dependence on
the laser excitation frequency near zero detuning leading to switching between
two distinct mesoscopic nuclear spin states. The magnitude of the field, which
is as large as 400 mT, is measured with sub-100 nuclear spin sensitivity.
Stable/unstable points of the OH field distribution are observed, resulting
from the non-linear feedback loop in the electron-trion-nuclear system. Nuclear
spin polarization state switching occurs between fields differing by 160 mT at
least as fast as 25 ms. Control experiments indicate that the strain-induced
quadrupolar interaction may explain the measured OH fields.

atoms typically decays as $\sim 1/|p|^4$ at large momentum $p$. Tan's relation
connects the amplitude of that $1/|p|^4$ tail to the adiabatic derivative of
the energy with respect to the gas' coupling constant or scattering length.
Here it is shown that the relation breaks down in the one-dimensional Bose gas
with contact repulsion, for a peculiar class of stationary states. These states
exist thanks to the infinite number of conserved quantities in the system, and
they are characterized by a rapidity distribution which itself decreases as
$1/|p|^4$. In the momentum distribution, that rapidity tail adds to the usual
Tan contact term. Remarkably, atom losses, which are ubiquitous in experiments,
do produce such peculiar states. The development of the tail of the rapidity
distribution originates from the ghost singularity of the wavefunction
immediately after each loss event. This phenomenon is discussed for arbitrary
interaction strengths, and it is supported by exact calculations in the two
asymptotic regimes of infinite and weak repulsion.

that at least ${D^{n - 1}}$ Bell states can be distinguished due to the

align the student and teacher networks' feature maps in the spatial domain,
typically by minimizing point-wise and/or pair-wise discrepancy. Observing that
in semantic segmentation, some layers' feature activations of each channel tend
to encode saliency of scene categories (analogue to class activation mapping),
we propose to align features channel-wise between the student and teacher

a probabilty map using softmax normalization, and then minimize the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the corresponding channels of the two
networks. By doing so, our method focuses on mimicking the soft distributions
of channels between networks. In particular, the KL divergence enables learning
to pay more attention to the most salient regions of the channel-wise maps,
presumably corresponding to the most useful signals for semantic segmentation.
Experiments demonstrate that our channel-wise distillation outperforms almost
all existing spatial distillation methods for semantic segmentation
considerably, and requires less computational cost during training. We
consistently achieve superior performance on three benchmarks with various

previous study has solved the problem when applying standard perturbation

is conducted and leads to an unsatisfactory error. Here we develop a modified
perturbation theory for small shifts in anisotropically dielectric interfaces.
By using optimized smoothing function for each component of permittivity, we
obtain a method to calculate the intrinsic frequency shifts of anisotropic

years with the UCN storage method are in a good agreement. These results are
consistent with the latest most accurate measurements of the neutron decay
asymmetry within the Standard Model. However, there is a significant
discrepancy at $3.6\sigma$ (1% of the decay probability) level between the
averaged result of the storage method experiments and the most accurate
measurements performed with the beam method. This article addresses the
possible causes of such discrepancy. We focused on finding the spectrum of
possible systematic corrections in the beam experiment. Four separate sources
of the systematic errors which had not been properly addressed in articles
dedicated to the beam technique were considered. Two of those sources are
related with the motion of protons in an electromagnetic field and the elastic
scattering by the residual gas. The third error concerns proton loss in the
dead layer of the detector. It is shown the corresponding correction requires a
more detailed analysis than that given in the papers describing the beam
measurement method. The fourth source of the systematic error is the charge
exchange process on the residual gas. The influence of that process was
neglected in the beam method experiments. We present arguments that careful
analysis of this issue is necessary since the proposed proton losses correction
decreases the measured lifetime. For the problem of proton charge exchange on a
residual gas, the spectrum of possible corrections is investigated. It is shown
that for an accurate calculation of the correction, it is necessary to directly
measure the concentration and composition of the residual gas inside the proton
trap. The analysis reveals that even presence of only $H_2$ molecules can lead
to the significant correction which is the most probable explanation of the
neutron anomaly.

been studied for decades. Among various approaches, skeleton-based methods
recently attract increasing attention due to their robust and superior
performance. However, existing skeleton-based methods ignore the potential
action relationships between different persons, while the action of a person is
highly likely to be impacted by another person especially in complex events. In
this paper, we propose a novel group-skeleton-based human action recognition
method in complex events. This method first utilizes multi-scale
spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (MS-G3Ds) to extract skeleton
features from multiple persons. In addition to the traditional key point
coordinates, we also input the key point speed values to the networks for
better performance. Then we use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to embed the
distance values between the reference person and other persons into the
extracted features. Lastly, all the features are fed into another MS-G3D for
feature fusion and classification. For avoiding class imbalance problems, the
networks are trained with a focal loss. The proposed algorithm is also our
solution for the Large-scale Human-centric Video Analysis in Complex Events
Challenge. Results on the HiEve dataset show that our method can give superior
performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

generic patches could provide at the same time a unified representation and a
specification for fix patterns. Generic patches are indeed formally defined,
and there exists a robust, industry-adapted, and extensible engine that
processes generic patches to perform control-flow code matching and
automatically generates concretes patches based on the specified change
operations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a repair
framework, FLEXIREPAIR, that explores generic patches as the core concept. In
particular, we show how concretely generic patches can be inferred and applied
in a pipeline of Automated Program Repair (APR). With FLEXIREPAIR, we address
an urgent challenge in the template-based APR community to separate
implementation details from actual scientific contributions by providing an
open, transparent and flexible repair pipeline on top of which all advancements
in terms of efficiency, efficacy and usability can be measured and assessed
rigorously. Furthermore, because the underlying tools and concepts have already
been accepted by a wide practitioner community, we expect FLEXIREPAIR's
adoption by industry to be facilitated. Preliminary experiments with a
prototype FLEXIREPAIR on the IntroClass and CodeFlaws benchmarks suggest that
it already constitutes a solid baseline with comparable performance to some of
the state of the art.

  electrodeposition without supporting electrolyte",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall nlin.PS physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work focuses on the microstructure of metallic deposits formed by
galvanostatic electrodeposition inside a Hele-Shaw cell without both supporting
electrolyte and flow. For a low applied current density j, the deposit grows
under the form of ramified branches. As shown by Fleury (Nature, 390,, 1997),
these branches are composed of small metallic crystals. This microstructure is
built up by a re-nucleation process induced by the dynamics of a space charge
region (non-electrically neutral solution) ahead of the growth front. When
increasing j the crystal size decreases whereas the nucleation frequency
increases. These latter tendencies are reversed for high j when, as
experimentally observed, dendrites are formed instead of ramified branches.
There must be a transition between the nucleation/growth regime (ramified
branches) and the pure growth regime (dendrites). This transition is examined
experimentally by carefully observing the branch microstructure by SEM. For
copper and silver branches, when j is lower than a critical current density j_c
(concentration-dependent), the branches are composed only of non-dendritic
crystals. Whereas, when j>j_c, dendritic crystals are observed and they become
the main kind of crystals constituting the branches for higher j. These
observations show that the morphological transition on the pattern scale,
between ramified branches and dendrites, originates from a morphological
transition on the scale of the crystals constituting the branches. This latter
is considered theoretically by analyzing the shape stability of the growing
crystals. The Mullins & Sekerka model (shape stability of a spherical particle
growing by diffusion) disagrees with these observations by predicting that the
crystals are always unstable. It is proposed that the space charge layer,
surrounding the growing crystals, induces a stabilizing effect.

quasi-periodic variability known as `heartbeat', similar to the one observed in
GRS 1915+105. In this paper, we report the results of $\sim 125$ ks
\textit{AstroSat} observations of this source during the 2016 outburst. For the
first time a double peaked QPO (DPQ) is detected in a few time segments of this
source with a difference of $\delta f ~\sim12$ mHz between the two peaks. The
nature of the DPQ was studied based on hardness ratios and using the static as
well as the dynamic power spectrum. Additionally, a low frequency (25--48 mHz)
`heartbeat' single peak QPO (SPQ) was observed at different intervals of time
along with harmonics ($50-95$ mHz). Broadband spectra in the range $0.7-23$
keV, obtained with \textit{SXT} and \textit{LAXPC}, could be fitted well with
combination of a thermal Comptonisation and a multicolour disc component model.
During \textit{AstroSat} observation, the source was in the Soft-Intermediate
State (SIMS) as observed with \textit{Swift/XRT}. We present a comparative
study of the `heartbeat' state variability in IGR J17091--3624 with GRS
1915+105. Significant difference in the timing properties is observed although
spectral parameters ($\Gamma\sim2.1-2.4$ and $T_\mathrm{max}\sim0.6-0.8$ keV)
in the broad energy band remain similar. Spectral properties of segments
exhibiting SPQ and DPQ are further studied using simple phase resolved
spectroscopy which does not show a significant difference. Based on the model
parameters, we obtain the maximum ratio of mass accretion rate in GRS 1915+105
to that in IGR J17091--3624 as $\sim25:1$. We discuss the implications of our
findings and comment on the physical origin of these exotic variabilities.

second-order in the quadrupolar perturbation induced on the inner binary by the
distant third body. The Newtonian three-body equations of motion, expanded in
powers of the ratio of semimajor axes $a/A$, become a pair of effective
one-body Keplerian equations of motion, perturbed by a sequence of multipolar
perturbations, denoted quadrupole, $O[(a/A)^3]$, octupole, $O[(a/A)^4]$, and so
on. In the Lagrange planetary equations for the evolution of the instantaneous
orbital elements, second-order effects arise from obtaining the first-order
solution for each element, consisting of a constant (or slowly varying) piece
and an oscillatory perturbative piece, and reinserting it back into the
equations to obtain a second-order solution. After an average over the two
orbital timescales to obtain long-term evolutions, these second-order
quadrupole ($Q^2$) terms would be expected to produce effects of order
$(a/A)^6$. However we find that the orbital average actually enhances the
second-order terms by a factor of the ratio of the outer to the inner orbital
periods, $ \sim (A/a)^{3/2}$. For systems with a low-mass third body, the $Q^2$
effects are small, but for systems with a comparable-mass or very massive third
body, such as a Sun-Jupiter system orbiting a solar-mass star, or a $100 \,
M_\odot$ binary system orbiting a $10^6 \, M_\odot$ massive black hole, the
$Q^2$ effects can completely suppress flips of the inner orbit from prograde to
retrograde and back that occur in the first-order solutions. These results are
in complete agreement with those of Luo, Katz and Dong, derived using a

evanescent-wave Johnson noise in their vicinity due both to thermal and quantum
effects. The noise fields can decohere qubits in their neighborhood. It is
quantified by the average value of $B(x,t)B(x',t')$ and its time Fourier
transform. We develop the formalism particularly for objects whose dimensions
are small compared with the skin depth, which is the appropriate regime for
nanoscale devices. This leads to a general and surprisingly simple formula for
the noise correlation function of an object of arbitrary shape. This formula
has a clear physical interpretation in terms of induced currents in the object.
It can also be the basis for straightforward numerical evaluation. For a
sphere, a solution is given in closed form in terms of a generalized multipole
expansion. Plots of the solution illustrate the physical principles involved.
We give examples of how the spatial pattern of noise can affect quantum
information processing in nearby qubits. The theory implies that if the qubit
system is miniaturized to a scale $D$, then decoherence rates of qubits scale
as $1/D$.

(MR-TOF-MS) of the FRS Ion Catcher with an unprecedented mass resolving power
of almost 1,000,000. For the $^{69}$As isotope, this is the first direct mass
measurement. A mass uncertainty of 22 keV was achieved with only 10 events. For
the $^{70}$Se isotope, a mass uncertainty of 2.6 keV was obtained,
corresponding to a relative accuracy of $\delta$m/m = 4.0$\times 10^{-8}$, with
less than 500 events. The masses of the $^{71}$Se and $^{71}$Br isotopes were
measured with an uncertainty of 23 and 16 keV, respectively. Our results for
the $^{70,71}$Se and $^{71}$Br isotopes agree with the 2016 Atomic Mass

1.7$\times 10^{-8}$, the highest yet achieved with a MR-TOF-MS. Our results
show that the measured restrengthening of the proton-neutron interaction
($\delta$V$_{pn}$) for odd-odd nuclei at the N=Z line above Z=29 (recently
extended to Z=37) is hardly evident at N-Z=2, and not evident at N-Z=4.
Nevertheless, detailed structure of $\delta$V$_{pn}$ along the N-Z=2 and N-Z=4
lines, confirmed by our mass measurements, may provide a hint regarding the
ongoing $\approx$500 keV discrepancy in the mass value of the $^{70}$Br
isotope, which prevents including it in the world average of ${Ft}$-value for
superallowed 0$^+\rightarrow$ 0$^+$ $\beta$ decays. The reported work sets the

sizes L = 256 - 4000 Mpc/h, mass and force resolutions and epochs from very
early moments z = 30 to the present moment z = 0. We calculate density fields
with various smoothing lengths to find the dependence of the density field on

kurtosis. Results. We focus on the third (skewness S) and fourth (kurtosis K)
moments of the distribution functions: their dependence on the smoothing scale,
the amplitude of fluctuations and the redshift. During the evolution the
reduced skewness $S_3= S/\sigma$ and reduced kurtosis $S_4=K/\sigma^2$ present
a complex behaviour: at a fixed redshift curves of $S_3(\sigma)$ and
$S_4(\sigma)$ steeply increase with $\sigma$ at $\sigma\le 1$ and then flatten
out and become constant at $\sigma\ge2$. If we fix the smoothing scale $R_t$,
then after reaching the maximum at $\sigma\approx 2$, the curves at large
$\sigma$ start to gradually decline. We provide accurate fits for the evolution
of $S_{3,4}(\sigma,z)$. Skewness and kurtosis approach at early epochs constant
levels, depending on smoothing length: $S_3(\sigma) \approx 3$ and $S_4(\sigma)
\approx 15$. Conclusions. Most of statistics of dark matter clustering (e.g.,
halo mass function or concentration-mass relation) are nearly universal: they
mostly depend on the $\sigma$ with the relatively modest correction to explicit
dependence on the redshift. We find just the opposite for skewness and
kurtosis: the dependence of moments on evolutionary epoch $z$ and smoothing
length $R_t$ is very different, together they determine the evolution of
$S_{3,4}(\sigma)$ uniquely. The evolution of $S_3$ and $S_4$ cannot be
described by current theoretical approximations.

the launch of SVOM in mid-2022, with its two wide-field high-energy instruments

characterize high-energy transients in the local Universe (z<0.3), and to
discuss the contribution of this instrument to multi-messenger astronomy and to
gamma-ray burst(GRB) astrophysics in the 2020s. A list of local HE transients,
along with their main characteristics, is constructed through an extensive

assessed with detailed simulations using tools developed for the SVOM mission,
including a GEANT4 simulation of the energy response and a simulated trigger
algorithm representative of the onboard trigger algorithm. The SNR for almost
all detections will be sufficiently high to allow the on-board ECLAIRs trigger
algorithm to detect and derive the localisation of the transient, transmitting
it to the SVOM satellite and ground-based instruments. Coupled with the

for soft materials, as it generally respects thermodynamics principles and

involves solid and fluid species, interacting on the basis of mass balance and
momentum conservation, we decide to adopt a solution strategy of the discrete
problem based on iterative splitting schemes. As the model is similar (but not
equivalent to) the Biot poromechanics problem, we follow the abundant
literature for solvers of the latter equations, developing two approaches that
resemble the well known undrained and fixed-stress splits for the Biot model. A
thorough convergence analysis of the proposed schemes is performed. In
particular, the undrained-like split is developed and analyzed in the framework
of generalized gradient flows, whereas the fixed-stress-like split is
understood as block-diagonal $L^2$-type stabilization and analyzed by means of
a relative stability analysis. In addition, the application of Anderson
acceleration is suggested, improving the robustness of the split schemes.
Finally, we test these methods on different benchmark tests, and we also
compare their performance with respect to a monolithic approach. Together with
the theoretical analysis, the numerical examples provide guidelines to
appropriately choose what split scheme shall be used to address realistic
applications of the soft material poromechanics model.

recognize and avoid possible collisions with obstacles in order to move
successfully in their environment. Humans, however, have learned to predict
movements intuitively and to avoid obstacles in a forward-looking way. The task
of collision avoidance can be divided into a global and a local level.
Regarding the global level, we propose an approach called ""Predictive Collision
Management Path Planning"" (PCMP). At the local level, solutions for collision
avoidance are used that prevent an inevitable collision. Therefore, the aim of
PCMP is to avoid unnecessary local collision scenarios using predictive
collision management. PCMP is a graph-based algorithm with a focus on the time
dimension consisting of three parts: (1) movement prediction, (2) integration
of movement prediction into a time-dependent graph, and (3) time and
risk-dependent path planning. The algorithm combines the search for a shortest
path with the question: is the detour worth avoiding a possible collision
scenario? We evaluate the evasion behavior in different simulation scenarios
and the results show that a risk-sensitive agent can avoid 47.3% of the
collision scenarios while making a detour of 1.3%. A risk-averse agent avoids
up to 97.3% of the collision scenarios with a detour of 39.1%. Thus, an agent's
evasive behavior can be controlled actively and risk-dependent using PCMP.

box for text detection, the annotations of polygons are extremely expensive and
challenging. Unlike existing works that employ fully-supervised training with
polygon annotations, this study proposes an unconstrained text detection system
termed Polygon-free (PF), in which most existing polygon-based text detectors
(e.g., PSENet [33],DB [16]) are trained with only upright bounding box
annotations. Our core idea is to transfer knowledge from synthetic data to real
data to enhance the supervision information of upright bounding boxes. This is
made possible with a simple segmentation network, namely Skeleton Attention
Segmentation Network (SASN), that includes three vital components (i.e.,
channel attention, spatial attention and skeleton attention map) and one soft
cross-entropy loss. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Polygonfree
system can combine general detectors (e.g., EAST, PSENet, DB) to yield
surprisingly high-quality pixel-level results with only upright bounding box
annotations on a variety of datasets (e.g., ICDAR2019-Art, TotalText,
ICDAR2015). For example, without using polygon annotations, PSENet achieves an
80.5% F-score on TotalText [3] (vs. 80.9% of fully supervised counterpart),
31.1% better than training directly with upright bounding box annotations, and
saves 80%+ labeling costs. We hope that PF can provide a new perspective for
text detection to reduce the labeling costs. The code can be found at

studied due to their structural similarity with the former. A hexagonal
graphene-like boron-carbon-nitrogen (h-BCN) monolayer was synthesized recently
using bis-BN cyclohexane (B2N2C2H12) as a precursor molecule. Herein, we
investigated the electronic and structural properties of this novel BCN
material, in the presence of single-atom (boron, carbon, or nitrogen)
vacancies, by employing density functional theory calculations. The stability
of these vacancy-endowed structures is verified from cohesion energy
calculations. Results showed that a carbon atom vacancy strongly distorts the
lattice leading to breaking on its planarity and bond reconstructions. The
single-atom vacancies induce the appearance of flat midgap states. A
significant degree of charge localization takes place in the vicinity of these
defects. It was observed a spontaneous magnetization only for the boron-vacancy
case, with a magnetic dipole moment about 0.87 mu_B. Our calculations predicted
a direct electronic bandgap value of about 1.14 eV, which is in good agreement
with the experimental one. Importantly, this bandgap value is intermediate
between gapless graphene and insulating h-BN.

prevalence of accessible depth sensors. Recently, graph convolutional networks
(GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to
model graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for
modeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly
focus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is
learned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer
of the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple
sets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The
reason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and
conventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights
into GCNs. To overcome this gap, we reinvent the split-transform-merge strategy
in GCNs for skeleton sequence processing. Specifically, we design a simple and
highly modularized graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based
action recognition. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block
that aggregates multi-granularity information from both the spatial and
temporal paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin with only 1/5 of the

emphasis on a correct introduction of surface stresses. This is achieved by
multiplying the cohesion and gradient energies by the local ratio of the crack
surface areas in the deformed and undeformed configurations and with the
gradient energy in terms of the gradient of the order parameter in the
reference configuration. This results in an expression for the surface stresses
which is consistent with the sharp surface approach. Namely, the structural
part of the Cauchy surface stress represents an isotropic biaxial tension, with
the magnitude of a force per unit length equal to the surface energy. The
surface stresses are a result of the geometric nonlinearities, even when
strains are infinitesimal. They make multiple contributions to the
Ginzburg-Landau equation for damage evolution, both in the deformed and
undeformed configurations. Important connections between material parameters
are obtained using an analytical solution for two separating surfaces, as well
as an analysis of the stress-strain curves for homogeneous tension for
different degradation and interpolation functions. A complete system of
equations is presented in the undeformed and deformed configurations. All the
phase field parameters are obtained utilizing the existing first principle
simulations for the uniaxial tension of Si crystal in the [100] and [111]

become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values. To this end, we

the appropriate convolution kernels to apply in response to the nature of the

gathering homogeneous points that share identical semantic categories and have
close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then decoded by several
simple convolutional layers. Due to the limited receptive field introduced by
the sparse convolution, a small light-weight transformer is also devised to
capture the long-range dependencies and high-level interactions among point
samples. The proposed method achieves promising results on both ScanetNetV2 and

nonlinearities on the stabilization of both single and multi-mode SPBs in the
framework of a damped higher order NLS (HONLS) equation. We observe the onset
of novel instabilities associated with the development of critical states which
result from symmetry breaking in the damped HONLS system. We broaden the
Floquet characterization of instabilities of solutions of the NLS equation,
using an even 3-phase solution of the NLS as an example, to show instabilities
are associated with degenerate complex elements of both the periodic and
continuous Floquet spectrum. As a result the Floquet criteria for the
stabilization of a solution of the damped HONLS centers around the elimination
of all complex degenerate elements of the spectrum. For an initial SPB with a
given mode structure, a perturbation analysis shows that for short time only
the complex double points associated with resonant modes split under the damped
HONLS while those associated with nonresonant modes remain effectively closed.
The corresponding damped HONLS numerical experiments corroborate that
instabilities associated with nonresonant modes persist on a longer time scale

(OMA) or non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), with an emphasis on
investigating the interplay between NOMA and RIS. Depending on whether the RIS
reflection coefficients can be adjusted only once or multiple times during one
transmission, we distinguish between static and dynamic RIS configurations. In
particular, the capacity region of RIS aided single-antenna NOMA networks is
characterized and compared with the OMA rate region from an
information-theoretic perspective, revealing that the dynamic RIS configuration
is capacity-achieving. Then, the impact of the RIS deployment location on the
performance of different multiple access schemes is investigated, which reveals
that asymmetric and symmetric deployment strategies are preferable for NOMA and
OMA, respectively. Furthermore, for RIS aided multiple-antenna NOMA networks,
three novel joint active and passive beamformer designs are proposed based on
both beamformer based and cluster based strategies. Finally, open research
problems for RIS-NOMA networks are highlighted.

concentration inequalities by establishing functional inequalities like
Poincare and log-Sobolev inequalities. These inequalities are especially useful
for deriving concentration for dependent distributions coming from stationary
distributions of Markov chains. In contrast to the scalar case, the study of
matrix concentration inequalities is fairly recent and there does not seem to
be a general framework for proving matrix concentration inequalities using the
Entropy method. In this paper, we initiate the study of Matrix valued
functional inequalities and show how matrix valued functional inequalities can
be used to establish a kind of iterative variance comparison argument to prove
Matrix Bernstein like inequalities. Strong Rayleigh distributions are a class
of distributions which satisfy a strong form of negative dependence properties.
We show that scalar Poincare inequalities recently established for a flip-swap
markov chain considered in the work of Hermon and Salez [HS19] can be lifted to
prove matrix valued Poincare inequalities. This can then be combined with the
iterative variance argument to prove a version of matrix Bernstein inequality
for Lipshitz matrix-valued functions for Strong Rayleigh measures.

reflecting birth-death chain to the state 0 and viceversa. First we will
consider reflecting-absorbing factorizations of birth-death chains on the
integers. We give conditions on the two free parameters such that each of the
factors is a stochastic matrix. By inverting the order of the factors (also
known as a Darboux transformation) we get new families of ""almost"" birth-death
chains on the integers with the only difference that we have new probabilities
going from the state $1$ to the state $-1$ and viceversa. On the other hand an
absorbing-reflecting factorization of birth-death chains on the integers is
only possible if both factors are splitted into two separated birth-death
chains at the state $0$. Therefore it makes more sense to consider
absorbing-reflecting factorizations of ""almost"" birth-death chains with extra
transitions between the states $1$ and $-1$ and with some conditions. This
factorization is now unique and by inverting the order of the factors we get a
birth-death chain on the integers. In both cases we identify the spectral
matrices associated with the Darboux transformation, the first one being a
Geronimus transformation and the second one a Christoffel transformation of the
original spectral matrix. We apply our results to examples of chains with

Fourier sums, i.e., real signals which can be represented as sparse exponential
sums of the form $f(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{K} \gamma_{j} \, \cos(2\pi a_{j} t +
b_{j})$, where the frequency parameters $a_{j} \in {\mathbb R}$ (or $a_{j} \in
{\mathrm i} {\mathbb R}$) are pairwise different. Our method is based on the
recently proposed stable iterative rational approximation algorithm in
\cite{NST18}. For signal reconstruction we use a set of classical Fourier
coefficients of $f$ with regard to a fixed interval $(0, P)$ with $P>0$. Even
though all terms of $f$ may be non-$P$-periodic, our reconstruction method
requires at most $2K+2$ Fourier coefficients $c_{n}(f)$ to recover all
parameters of $f$. We show that in the case of exact data, the proposed
iterative algorithm terminates after at most $K+1$ steps. The algorithm can
also detect the number $K$ of terms of $f$, if $K$ is a priori unknown and
$L>2K+2$ Fourier coefficients are available. Therefore our method provides a
new stable alternative to the known numerical approaches for the recovery of
exponential sums that are based on Prony's method.

participants received feedback regarding the ErrPs' detection from its start.
The generic classifier was not trained with the user's brain signals. Still,
its performance was optimized during the online experiment with the use of
personalized decision thresholds. Participants with SCI presented a
non-homogenous ErrP morphology, and four of them did not present clear ErrP

Though we cannot place either host star into a known stellar association or
cluster, we can estimate their ages via their photometric and spectroscopic
properties. Both stars exhibit significant photometric variability due to spot
modulation, with measured rotation periods of $\sim 3.5$ days. These stars also
exhibit significant chromospheric activity, with age estimates from the
chromospheric calcium emission lines and X-ray fluxes matching that estimated
from gyrochronology. Both stars also exhibit significant lithium absorption,
similar in equivalent width to well-characterized young cluster members. TESS
has the potential to deliver a population of young planet-bearing field stars,
contributing significantly to tracing the properties of planets as a function
of their age.

Green Bank Northern Celestial Cap Pulsar Survey, and possesses the third
shortest orbital period ($P=1.6$ hour) among confirmed binary pulsars. Recent
observations reported that this source is experiencing a rapid orbital
expansion at a rate of $\dot{P}=(1.89\pm0.05)\times 10^{-12}~\rm s\,s^{-1}$.
The evaporation winds of the companion induced by the spin-down luminosity of
the MSP may be responsible for such a positive orbital period derivative.
However, our calculations show that the winds ejecting from the vicinity of the
companion or the inner Lagrangian point can not account for the observation due
to an implausible evaporation efficiency. Assuming that the evaporation winds
eject from the vicinity of the MSP in the form of asymmetry disc winds or
outflow, the evaporation efficiency can be constrained to be $\sim 0.1$.
Therefore, the rapidly orbital expansion detected in PSR J0636+5128 provides
evidence of outflows and accretion disc around the MSP.

radiation hydrodynamics ones. Using a time-implicit solver is profitable as
soon as the time step given by the hydrodynamics is 50-100 times larger than
the explicit time step for radiative transfer, depending on the preconditioner
and the architecture. Albeit more work is needed to ensure stability in all
circumstances. Using ARK-RT, we study the propagation of an ionization front in
convective dense cores. We show that the ionization front is strongly stable
against perturbations even with destabilizing convective motions. As a result,
the presence of instabilities should be interpreted with caution. Overall,
ARK-RT is well-suited to study many astrophysical problems involving convection

challenging task. Due to the inherent nature of the modality to emphasize soft

detecting bones in MR images. On the other hand, it is relatively easier to
segment bones from CT images because of the high contrast between bones and the
surrounding regions. For this reason, we perform a cross-modality synthesis
between MR and CT domains for simple thresholding-based segmentation of the
vertebral bones. However, this implicitly assumes the availability of paired
MR-CT data, which is rare, especially in the case of scoliotic patients. In
this paper, we present a completely unsupervised, fully three-dimensional (3D)
cross-modality synthesis method for segmenting scoliotic spines. A 3D CycleGAN
model is trained for an unpaired volume-to-volume translation across MR and CT
domains. Then, the Otsu thresholding algorithm is applied to the synthesized CT
volumes for easy segmentation of the vertebral bones. The resulting
segmentation is used to reconstruct a 3D model of the spine. We validate our
method on 28 scoliotic vertebrae in 3 patients by computing the
point-to-surface mean distance between the landmark points for each vertebra
obtained from pre-operative X-rays and the surface of the segmented vertebra.
Our study results in a mean error of 3.41 $\pm$ 1.06 mm. Based on qualitative

two-step recovery scheme: first - topological reconstruction to the point where
the system can be revived, then dynamic interventions, to reignite the system's
lost functionality. Applying this method to a range of nonlinear network
dynamics, we identify the recoverable phase of a complex system, a state in

proposed every year to answer such questions - each with a distinct problem
formulation, computational time, and memory footprint. This lack of unity makes
it difficult for a practitioner to compare different algorithms and pick the
most suitable one for a specific application. These challenges - even more
severe for non-experts - create a gap in which state-of-the-art techniques
developed in academic settings fail to be optimally deployed in real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AUTOGM, an automated system for
graph mining algorithm development. We first define a unified framework
UNIFIEDGM that integrates various message-passing based graph algorithms,
ranging from conventional algorithms like PageRank to graph neural networks.
Then UNIFIEDGM defines a search space in which five parameters are required to
determine a graph algorithm. Under this search space, AUTOGM explicitly
optimizes for the optimal parameter set of UNIFIEDGM using Bayesian
Optimization. AUTOGM defines a novel budget-aware objective function for the
optimization to incorporate a practical issue - finding the best speed-accuracy
trade-off under a computation budget - into the graph algorithm generation
problem. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AUTOGM
generates novel graph mining algorithms with the best speed/accuracy trade-off

the models' ability to capture the correct vulnerability signals to produce

systematically reduces the original source code to a minimal snippet which a
model needs to maintain its prediction. The model's reliance on incorrect
signals is then uncovered when the vulnerability in the original code is
missing in the minimal snippet, both of which the model however predicts as
being vulnerable. We measure the signal awareness of models using a new metric
we propose- Signal-aware Recall (SAR). We apply P2IM on three different neural
network architectures across multiple datasets. The results show a sharp drop
in the model's Recall from the high 90s to sub-60s with the new metric,
highlighting that the models are presumably picking up a lot of noise or
dataset nuances while learning their vulnerability detection logic. Although
the drop in model performance may be perceived as an adversarial attack, but
this isn't P2IM's objective. The idea is rather to uncover the signal-awareness
of a black-box model in a data-driven manner via controlled queries. SAR's
purpose is to measure the impact of task-agnostic model training, and not to
suggest a shortcoming in the Recall metric. The expectation, in fact, is for
SAR to match Recall in the ideal scenario where the model truly captures
task-specific signals.

symplectic integrator and its numerical implementation in the GPU-accelerated
direct-summation N-body code FROST. The new integrator is especially suitable
for simulations with a large dynamical range due to its hierarchical nature.
The strictly positive integrator sub-steps in a fourth-order symplectic
integrator are made possible by computing an additional gradient term in
addition to the Newtonian accelerations. All force calculations and kick
operations are synchronous so the integration algorithm is manifestly
momentum-conserving. We also employ a time-step symmetrisation procedure to
approximately restore the time-reversibility with adaptive individual
time-steps. We demonstrate in a series of binary, few-body and million-body
simulations that FROST conserves energy to a level of $|\Delta E / E| \sim
10^{-10}$ while errors in linear and angular momentum are practically
negligible. For typical star cluster simulations, we find that FROST scales
well up to $N_\mathrm{GPU}^\mathrm{max}\sim 4\times N/10^5$ GPUs, making direct
summation N-body simulations beyond $N=10^6$ particles possible on systems with
several hundred and more GPUs. Due to the nature of hierarchical integration
the inclusion of a Kepler solver or a regularised integrator with
post-Newtonian corrections for close encounters and binaries in the code is
straightforward.

using broadcast stations with varying signal strength so that the signal could

cover all stations with minimum total cost of signal called the

between these values and the current ones is utilized to adapt the premise

error between the desired and network's outputs is used to learn consequent

loco-regional relapse, distant metastasis and death. Early identification of
these indications is necessary to change the treatment strategy. Biomarkers
play an essential role in this aspect. The survival chance of a patient is
dependent on the biomarker, and the treatment strategy also differs
accordingly, e.g., the survival prediction of breast cancer patients diagnosed
with HER2 positive status is different from the same with HER2 negative status.
This results in a different treatment strategy. So, the heterogeneity of the
biomarker statuses or levels should be taken into consideration while modelling
the survival outcome. This heterogeneity factor which is often unobserved, is
called frailty. When multiple indications are present simultaneously, the
scenario becomes more complex as only one of them can occur, which will censor
the occurrence of other events. Incorporating independent frailties of each
biomarker status for every cause of indications will not depict the complete
picture of heterogeneity. The events indicating cancer progression are likely
to be inter-related. So, the correlation should be incorporated through the
frailties of different events. In our study, we considered a multiple events or
risks model with a heterogeneity component. Based on the estimated variance of
the frailty, the threshold levels of a biomarker are utilised as early
detection tool of the disease progression or death. Additive-gamma frailty
model is considered to account the correlation between different frailty
components and estimation of parameters are performed using
Expectation-Maximization Algorithm. With the extensive algorithm in R, we have
obtained the threshold levels of activity of a biomarker in a multiple events
scenario.

  Detection using Chest X-rays Images","34 pages, 6 Tables, 11 Figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The use of computer-aided diagnosis in the reliable and fast detection of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a necessity to prevent the spread of
the virus during the pandemic to ease the burden on the medical infrastructure.
Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging techniques
as it is cheap, easily accessible, fast and portable. This paper explores the
effect of various popular image enhancement techniques and states the effect of
each of them on the detection performance. We have compiled the largest X-ray
dataset called COVQU-20, consisting of 18,479 normal, non-COVID lung opacity
and COVID-19 CXR images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
public COVID positive database. Ground glass opacity is the common symptom
reported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and so a mixture of 3616 COVID-19, 6012
non-COVID lung opacity, and 8851 normal chest X-ray images were used to create
this dataset. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram
equalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, image
complement, gamma correction, and Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique were
used to improve COVID-19 detection accuracy. Six different Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) were investigated in this study. Gamma correction technique
outperforms other enhancement techniques in detecting COVID-19 from standard
and segmented lung CXR images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f1-score,
and specificity in the detection of COVID-19 with gamma correction on CXR
images were 96.29%, 96.28%, 96.29%, 96.28% and 96.27% respectively. The
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11 %, 94.55
%, 94.56 %, 94.53 % and 95.59 % respectively for segmented lung images. The
proposed approach with very high and comparable performance will boost the fast
and robust COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.

once appropriate adjustments are made to handle the different conditions (e.g.
temperature variation). When involving user motivation strategies, hourly based
energy savings can provide multiple advantages. However, there are two major

and unordinary patterns. In this paper we provide an analytical methodology to
handle such scenarios and create year-long hourly-based consumption baseline.

suffer from lack of exploration. Another line of prior work addresses the

Deep Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL) method to learn CTR models based on
Gaussian processes, which can provide predictive uncertainty estimations while
maintaining the flexibility of deep neural networks. DUAL can be easily
implemented on existing models and deployed in real-time systems with minimal
extra computational overhead. By linking the predictive uncertainty estimation
ability of DUAL to well-known bandit algorithms, we further present DUAL-based
Ad-ranking strategies to boost up long-term utilities such as the social

applied in computer-aided detection, diagnosis and prognosis, and has shown its
value during the public health crisis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in
COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the
United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image
retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated
clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image
diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model
based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims
at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims
at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same
labels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity
loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the
optimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The
model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset
collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image
retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a
robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model
is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support
task, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a
new dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep
metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR
retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the
treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.

(a-Ge) film as working electrode and sodium foil as reference and counter
electrode. The stresses generated in a-Ge electrodes due to electrochemical
reaction with sodium were measured in real-time during the galvanostatic
cycling. A specially designed patterned a-Ge electrode was cycled against
sodium and the corresponding volume changes were measured using an AFM; it was
observed that sodiation/desodiation of a-Ge results in more than 300% volume
change, consistent with literature. The potential and stress response showed
that the a-Ge film undergoes irreversible changes during the first sodiation
process, but the subsequent desodiation/sodiation cycles are reversible. The
stress response of the film reached steady-state after the initial sodiation
and is qualitatively similar to the response of Ge during lithiation, i.e.,
initial linear elastic response followed by extensive plastic deformation of
the film to accommodate large volume changes. However, despite being bigger
ion, sodiation of Ge generated lower stress levels compared to lithiation.
Consequently, the mechanical dissipation losses associated with plastic
deformation are lower during sodiation process than it is for lithiation.

  EEG classification",,,,,"cs.CV q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is argued in [1] that [2] was able to classify EEG responses to visual
stimuli solely because of the temporal correlation that exists in all EEG data
and the use of a block design. We here show that the main claim in [1] is
drastically overstated and their other analyses are seriously flawed by wrong
methodological choices. To validate our counter-claims, we evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the dataset in [2] reaching about
50% classification accuracy over 40 classes, lower than in [2], but still
significant. We then investigate the influence of EEG temporal correlation on
classification accuracy by testing the same models in two additional
experimental settings: one that replicates [1]'s rapid-design experiment, and
another one that examines the data between blocks while subjects are shown a
blank screen. In both cases, classification accuracy is at or near chance, in
contrast to what [1] reports, indicating a negligible contribution of temporal
correlation to classification accuracy. We, instead, are able to replicate the
results in [1] only when intentionally contaminating our data by inducing a
temporal correlation. This suggests that what Li et al. [1] demonstrate is that
their data are strongly contaminated by temporal correlation and low
signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that the reason why Li et al. [1] observe such
high correlation in EEG data is their unconventional experimental design and
settings that violate the basic cognitive neuroscience design recommendations,
first and foremost the one of limiting the experiments' duration, as instead
done in [2]. Our analyses in this paper refute the claims of the ""perils and
pitfalls of block-design"" in [1]. Finally, we conclude the paper by examining a
number of other oversimplistic statements, inconsistencies, misinterpretation
of machine learning concepts, speculations and misleading claims in [1].

first construct a new class of differential graded operads, which we call the
stable operads. These operads are, in a particular sense, stabilizations of
$\mathbb{E}_\infty$ operads. For example, we construct a stable Barratt-Eccles
operad. We develop a homotopy theory of algebras over these stable operads and
a theory of (co)homology operations for algebras over these stable operads. We
note interesting properties of these operads, such as that, non-equivariantly,
in each arity, they have (almost) trivial homology, whereas, equivariantly,
these homologies sum to a certain completion of the generalized Steenrod
algebra and so are highly non-trivial. We also justify the adjective ""stable""
by showing that, among other things, the monads associated to these operads are
additive in the homotopy coherent, or $\infty$-, sense. We then provide an
application of our stable operads to $p$-adic stable homotopy theory. It is
well-known that cochains on spaces yield examples of algebras over
$\mathbb{E}_\infty$ operads. We show that in the stable case, cochains on
spectra yield examples of algebras over our stable operads. Moreover, a result
of Mandell says that, endowed with the $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ algebraic structure,
cochains on spaces provide algebraic models of $p$-adic homotopy types. We show
that, endowed with the algebraic structure encoded by our stable operads,
spectral cochains provide algebraic models for $p$-adic stable homotopy types.
