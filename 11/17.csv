problems that has received increased attention in the last few years. Current
approaches are primarily based on harnessing the power of deep learning models
and optimization techniques to reverse the degradation model. Owing to its
hardness, isotropic blurring or Gaussians with small anisotropic deformations
have been mainly considered. Here, we widen this scenario by including large
non-Gaussian blurs that arise in real camera movements. Our approach leverages
the degradation model and proposes a new formulation of the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) cascade model, where each network sub-module is
constrained to solve a specific degradation: deblurring or upsampling. A new
densely connected CNN-architecture is proposed where the output of each
sub-module is restricted using some external knowledge to focus it on its
specific task. As far we know this use of domain-knowledge to module-level is a
novelty in SISR. To fit the finest model, a final sub-module takes care of the
residual errors propagated by the previous sub-modules. We check our model with
three state of the art (SOTA) datasets in SISR and compare the results with the
SOTA models. The results show that our model is the only one able to manage our
wider set of deformations. Furthermore, our model overcomes all current SOTA
methods for a standard set of deformations. In terms of computational load, our
model also improves on the two closest competitors in terms of efficiency.
Although the approach is non-blind and requires an estimation of the blur
kernel, it shows robustness to blur kernel estimation errors, making it a good
alternative to blind models.

in SRT education are needed. The field of research in SRT education is still at
an early stage, especially at the level of secondary education, and there is a
shortage of empirical evaluation of learning outcomes. In order to guide future
research directions, there is a need for an overview and synthesis of the
results reported so far. We have selected 40 articles and categorized them
according to reported learning difficulties, teaching approaches, and research
tools. Analysis shows that students at all educational levels experience
learning difficulties with the use of frames of reference, the postulates of
SRT, and relativistic effects. In the reported teaching sequences,
instructional materials, and learning activities, these difficulties are
approached from different angles. Some teaching approaches focus on thought
experiments to express conceptual features of SRT, while others use virtual
environments to provide realistic visualization of relativistic effects. From
the reported teaching approaches, three learning objectives can be identified:
to foster conceptual understanding, to foster understanding of the history and
philosophy of science, and to gain motivation and confidence toward SRT and
physics in general. In order to quantitatively compare learning outcomes of
different teaching strategies, a more thorough evaluation of assessment tools
is required.

Recent advances have identified the translocation of Yes-associated protein

mechanical forces and regulating mechanotransduction. We formulate a
spatiotemporal model of the mechanotransduction signalling pathway that
includes coupling of YAP with the cell force-generation machinery through the
Rho family of GTPases. Considering the active and inactive forms of a single
Rho protein (GTP/GDP-bound) and of YAP (non-phosphorylated/phosphorylated), we
study the cross-talk between cell polarization due to active Rho and YAP
activation through its nuclear localization.
  For fixed mechanical stimuli, our model predicts stationary
nuclear-to-cytoplasmic YAP ratios consistent with experimental data at varying
adhesive cell area. We further predict damped and even sustained oscillations
in the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio by accounting for recently reported
positive and negative YAP-Rho feedback. Extending the framework to time-varying
mechanical stimuli that simulate cyclic stretching and compression, we show
that the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio's time dependence follows that of the
cyclic mechanical stimulus. The model presents one of the first frameworks for
understanding spatiotemporal YAP mechanotransduction, providing several
predictions of possible YAP localization dynamics, and suggesting new
directions for experimental and theoretical studies.

FRDet, a lightweight one-stage object detector that is balanced to satisfy all
the constraints of accuracy, model size, and real-time processing on an
embedded GPU processor for autonomous driving applications. Our network aims to
maximize the compression of the model while achieving or surpassing YOLOv3
level of accuracy. This paper proposes the Fire-Residual (FR) module to design
a lightweight network with low accuracy loss by adapting fire modules with
residual skip connections. In addition, the Gaussian uncertainty modeling of
the bounding box is applied to further enhance the localization accuracy.
Experiments on the KITTI dataset showed that FRDet reduced the memory size by
50.8% but achieved higher accuracy by 1.12% mAP compared to YOLOv3. Moreover,
the real-time detection speed reached 31.3 FPS on an embedded GPU board(NVIDIA
Xavier). The proposed network achieved higher compression with comparable
accuracy compared to other deep CNN object detectors while showing improved
accuracy than the lightweight detector baselines. Therefore, the proposed FRDet

autonomous driving that can satisfies all the criteria of accuracy, real-time

We develop a neuronal network model including both axonic and anaxonic neurons

the graded potential in local neurons, the fraction of local neurons, the
largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the range of connections of the
local neurons. Tuning the fraction of local neurons, we derive the phase

implemented within the global end-to-end BeyondPlanck (BP) framework, and apply
this to the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) data. Following the most
recent Planck analysis, we decompose the full time-dependent gain into a sum of
three orthogonal components: One absolute calibration term, common to all
detectors; one time-independent term that can vary between detectors; and one
time-dependent component that is allowed to vary between one-hour pointing
periods. Each term is then sampled conditionally on all other parameters in the
global signal model through Gibbs sampling. The absolute calibration is sampled
using only the orbital dipole as a reference source, while the two relative
gain components are sampled using the full sky signal, including the orbital
and Solar CMB dipoles, CMB fluctuations, and foreground contributions. We
discuss various aspects of the data that influence gain estimation, including
the dipole/polarization quadrupole degeneracy and anomalous jumps in the
instrumental gain. Comparing our solution to previous pipelines, we find good
agreement in general, with relative deviations of -0.67% (-0.84%) for 30 GHz,
0.12% (-0.04%) for 44 GHz and -0.03% (-0.64%) for 70 GHz, compared to Planck
DR4 (Planck 2018). The deviations we find are within expected error bounds, and
we attribute them to differences in data usage and general approach between the
pipelines. In particular, the BP calibration is performed globally, resulting
in better inter-frequency consistency. Additionally, WMAP observations are used
actively in the BP analysis, which breaks degeneracies in the Planck data set
and results in better agreement with WMAP. Although our presentation and
algorithm are currently oriented toward LFI processing, the procedure is fully
generalizable to other experiments.

formalize the task of data clustering. Here, we are given sets of facilities
$F$ and clients $C$, and the goal is to open $k$ facilities from the set $F$,
which provides the best division into clusters, that is, the sum of distances
from each client to the closest open facility is minimized. In the Capacitated
$k$-Median, the facilities are also assigned capacities specifying how many
clients can be served by each facility.
  Both problems have been extensively studied from the perspective of
approximation algorithms. Recently, several surprising results have come from
the area of parameterized complexity, which provided better approximation
factors via algorithms with running times of the form $f(k)\cdot poly(n)$. In
this work, we extend this line of research by studying a different choice of
parameterization. We consider the parameter $\ell = |F| - k$, that is, the
number of facilities that remain closed. It turns out that such a
parameterization reveals yet another behavior of $k$-Median. We observe that
the problem is W[1]-hard but it admits a parameterized approximation scheme.
Namely, we present an algorithm with running time
$2^{O(\ell\log(\ell/\epsilon))}\cdot poly(n)$ that achieves a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. On the other hand, we show that under the
assumption of Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis, one cannot extend this result to
the capacitated version of the problem.

takes into account the finite distance effect of both the source and detector,

precise way. From this, the BH angular shadow size is expressed as a simple
formula containing metric functions and particle/photon sphere radius. The
magnification of the relativistic images were shown to diverge at different
values of the source-detector angular coordinate difference, depending on the
relation between the source and detector distance from the lens. To verify all
these results, we then applied them to the Hayward BH spacetime, concentrating
on the effects of its charge parameter $l$ and the asymptotic velocity $v$ of
the signal. The BH shadow size were found to decrease slightly as $l$ increase
to its critical value, and increase as $v$ decreases from light speed. For the
deflection angle and the magnification of the images however, both the increase
of $l$ and decrease of $v$ will increase their values.

correspondence between symmetric spaces and many but not all of the classical

the classical random matrix ensembles from Cartan's symmetric spaces through
the use of alternative coordinate systems. In the end, we have to let go of the
notion of a one-to-one correspondence.
  We emphasize that the KAK decomposition traditionally favored by
mathematicians is merely one coordinate system on the symmetric space, albeit a
beautiful one. However, other matrix factorizations, especially the generalized
singular value decomposition from numerical linear algebra reveal themselves to
be perfectly valid coordinate systems revealing that one symmetric space can
lead to many classical random matrix theories.
  We establish the connection between this numerical linear algebra viewpoint
and the theory of generalized Cartan decomposition. This in turn allows us to
produce yet more random matrix theories from a single symmetric space. Yet
again these random matrix theories arise from matrix factorizations, through
ones that we are not aware have appeared in the literature.

driving the development of large-scale, single neuron resolution recordings

inherently high-dimensional, with as many dimensions as neurons - so how do we
make sense of them? For many the answer is to reduce the number of dimensions.
Here I argue we can distinguish weak and strong principles of neural dimension
reduction. The weak principle is that dimension reduction is a convenient tool
for making sense of complex neural data. The strong principle is that dimension
reduction shows us how neural circuits actually operate and compute.
Elucidating these principles is crucial, for which we subscribe to provides
radically different interpretations of the same neural activity data. I show
how we could make either the weak or strong principles appear to be true based
on innocuous looking decisions about how we use dimension reduction on our
data. To counteract these confounds, I outline the experimental evidence for
the strong principle that do not come from dimension reduction; but also show
there are a number of neural phenomena that the strong principle fails to
address. To reconcile these conflicting data, I suggest that the brain has both
principles at play.

revolutionary concept in their formalism was that it was fundamentally
two-mode, i.e. the related observables could not be attributed to any single
one of the comprising modes, but rather to a generalized complex quadrature
that could only be attributed to both of them. Here, we propose a subtle, but
fundamentally meaningful modification to their important work. Unlike the above
proposal, we deliberately choose a frequency-agnostic definition of the
two-mode quadrature, that we motivate on physical grounds. This simple
modification has far-reaching implications to the formalism -- the real and
imaginary parts of the quadratures now coincide with the famous EPR variables,
and our two-mode operators transform trivially under two-mode and single-mode
squeezing operations. Their quadratic forms, which we call the ""quadrature
power"" are shown to succinctly generate the $SU(1,1)$ algebra of squeezing
Hamiltonians, and correspond directly to important, broadband physical
observables, that have been directly measured in experiment and are explicitly
related to properties like squeezing and entanglement. This new point of view
gives a fresh perspective on two-mode processes that is completely agnostic to
the bandwidth, and reveals intriguing new ways for understanding and measuring
broadband two-mode squeezing.

dielectric and ferroelectric properties of sintered BCZT ceramics at 1250
{\deg}C for 10h were investigated. XRD measurements revealed the presence of a
single perovskite phase at room temperature with the coexistence of the
orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries. The increase of grain size and the
ceramic density in BCZT ceramics result in an enhancement of the dielectric and
ferroelectric properties of BCZT ceramics. More interestingly, the synthesis
temperature of BCZT powders with high dielectric and ferroelectric properties
could be decreased to a low temperature of 160 {\deg}C, which is about 1200
{\deg}C lower when compared with solid-state reaction and 840 {\deg}C lower
when compared with sol-gel methods. The BCZT ceramics elaborated at 160 {\deg}C
revealed excellent electrical properties. Hence, the use of low-temperature
hydrothermal processing can be encouraging for the synthesis of lead-free
ceramics with high dielectric and ferroelectric properties.

the principle of proximity preservation. Nodes are mapped into points of the

Popular methods employed in network embedding either rely on implicit
approximations of the principle of proximity preservation or implement it by
enforcing the geometry of the embedding space, thus hindering geometric
properties that networks may spontaneously exhibit. Here, we take advantage of
a model-free embedding method explicitly devised for preserving pairwise
proximity, and characterize the geometry emerging from the mapping of several
networks, both real and synthetic. We show that the learned embedding has
simple and intuitive interpretations: the distance of a node from the geometric
center is representative for its closeness centrality, and the relative
positions of nodes reflect the community structure of the network. Proximity
can be preserved in relatively low-dimensional embedding spaces, and the hidden
geometry displays optimal performance in guiding greedy navigation regardless
of the specific network topology. We finally show that the mapping provides a
natural description of contagion processes on networks, with complex
spatiotemporal patterns represented by waves propagating from the geometric
center to the periphery. The findings deepen our understanding of the

rapidity with which the influence of online user dynamics propagates. A
countermeasure technology for the flaming phenomena based on the oscillation

Conventional countermeasures based on the oscillation model assume that the
damping coefficient is a constant regardless of the eigenfrequency. This
assumption is, however, problematic as the damping coefficients are, in
general, inherently frequency-dependent; the theory underlying the dependence
is being elucidated. This paper discusses a design method that uses the damping

consistency-regularized self-training. We conduct extensive experiments with
our framework on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. These experiments enable us to
isolate and assess the benefits of individual components which are evaluated
using state-of-the-art methods (e.g.~Core-Set, VAAL, simCLR, FixMatch). Our
experiments reveal two key insights: (i) Self-supervised pre-training
significantly improves semi-supervised learning, especially in the few-label
regime, (ii) The benefit of active learning is undermined and subsumed by S4L
techniques. Specifically, we fail to observe any additional benefit of
state-of-the-art active learning algorithms when combined with state-of-the-art
S4L techniques.

proposed Modified Coded Caching Scheme (MCCS) with the optimized cache
placement based on the popularity-first approach to minimize the average
delivery rate. We introduce two information-theoretic lower bounds on the
average rate for caching under uncoded placement. For $K = 2$ users, we show
that the optimized MCCS attains the lower bound and is optimal for caching with
uncoded placement. For general $K$ users with distinct file requests, the
optimized MCCS attains the popularity-first-based lower bound. When there are
redundant file requests among $K$ users, we show a possible gap between the
optimized MCCS and the lower bounds, which is attributed to zero-padding
commonly used for coded delivery. We analyze the impact of zero-padding and its
limitation. Simulation study shows that the loss is very small in general and
only exists in some limited cases.

existence of axionlike particles (ALPs) that mix with photons in the presence
of a magnetic field. One prominent indirect method of searching for ALPs is to
look for irregularities in blazar gamma-ray spectra caused by ALP-photon mixing
in astrophysical magnetic fields. This requires the modelling of magnetic
fields between Earth and the blazar. So far, only very simple models for the
magnetic field in the blazar jet have been used. Here we investigate the
effects of more complicated jet magnetic field configurations on these spectral
irregularities, by imposing a magnetic field structure model onto the jet model
proposed by Potter & Cotter. We simulate gamma-ray spectra of Mrk 501 with ALPs
and fit them to no-ALP spectra, scanning the ALP and B-field configuration
parameter space and show that the jet can be an important mixing region, able
to probe new ALP parameter space around $m_a\sim$ 1-1000 neV and
$g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ $5\times10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$. However, reasonable (i.e.
consistent with observation) changes of the magnetic field structure can have a
large effect on the mixing. For jets in highly magnetized clusters, mixing in
the cluster can overpower mixing in the jet. This means that the current
constraints using mixing in the Perseus cluster are still valid.

the mechanical contraction method and a variant of random walk (de Gennes ant)

jointly characterizes energy harvesting and packet transmissions in grant-free

do that, a joint queuing theory and stochastic geometry model is utilized to
develop a spatio-temporal analytical model. Particularly, the harvested energy
and packet transmission success probability are characterized using tools from
stochastic geometry. {Moreover, each device is modeled using a two-dimensional
discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Such two dimensions are utilized to jointly
track the scavenged/depleted energy to/from the batteries along with the
arrival/departure of packets to/from devices buffers over time. Consequently,
the adopted queuing model represents the devices as spatially interacting
queues. To that end, the network performance is assessed in light of the packet
throughput, the average delay, and the average buffer size. The effect of base
stations (BSs) densification is discussed and several design insights are
provided. The results show that the parameters for uplink power control and

problem and then provide a semidefinite relaxation algorithm to solve it.
Moreover, we study psd decompositions of separable Hermitian tensors. When the
psd rank is low, we first flatten them into cubic order tensors and then apply
tensor decomposition methods to compute psd decompositions. We prove that this
method works well if the psd rank is low. In computation, this flattening
approach can detect separability for much larger sized Hermitian tensors. This

not lead to enhancement of the powerfactor because of the breaking of band

reaction method and its dielectric, ferroelectric, energy storage,
electromechanical as well as electrocaloric properties were investigated at 25
kV/cm. Pure perovskite structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.
The maximum of the dielectric constant was found to be 17390 at 41 {\deg}C. The
enhanced total energy density, the recovered energy density, and the energy
storage efficiency of 92.7 mJ/cm3, 84.4 mJ/cm3, and 91.04%, respectively, were
observed at 60 {\deg}C, whereas the highest storage efficiency of 95.87 % was
obtained at 100 {\deg}C. At room temperature, the electromechanical strain and
the large-signal piezoelectric coefficient reached a maximum of 0.07 % and 280
pm/V. The large electrocaloric effect of 0.71 K and the electrocaloric
responsivity of 0.28. 10-6 K.mm/kV at 49 {\deg}C under 25 kV/cm were indirectly
calculated via Maxwell relation from the ferroelectric polarization P (T, E)
that was determined from the P-E hysteresis loops. By exploiting the
Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) phenomenological theory, the electrocaloric
response was estimated to be of 0.61 K at 50 {\deg}C under 25 kV/cm. We
conclude that BTSn lead-free ceramic is a promising candidate for potential
applications in high-efficiency energy storage devices and solid-state
refrigeration technology.

labels, which are ubiquitous in visual classification tasks, it has been a
great challenge to train ConvNets against them robustly. Various solutions,
e.g., sample selection, label correction, and robustifying loss functions, have
been proposed for this challenge, and most of them stick to the end-to-end
training of the representation (feature extractor) and classifier. In this
paper, by a deep rethinking and careful re-examining on learning behaviors of
the representation and classifier, we discover that the representation is much
more fragile in the presence of noisy labels than the classifier. Thus, we are
motivated to design a new method, i.e., REED, to leverage above discoveries to
learn from noisy labels robustly. The proposed method contains three stages,
i.e., obtaining the representation by self-supervised learning without any
labels, transferring the noisy label learning problem into a semisupervised one
by the classifier directly and reliably trained with noisy labels, and joint
semi-supervised retraining of both the representation and classifier. Extensive
experiments are performed on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method can beat the state-of-the-art ones
by a large margin, especially under high noise level.

control algorithm that is able to estimate the other agents' objective
functions in real time, and incorporate those estimates online into a
receding-horizon game-theoretic planner. LUCIDGames solves the inverse optimal
control problem by recasting it in a recursive parameter-estimation framework.
LUCIDGames uses an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to iteratively update a
Bayesian estimate of the other agents' cost function parameters, improving that
estimate online as more data is gathered from the other agents' observed
trajectories. The planner then takes account of the uncertainty in the Bayesian
parameter estimates of other agents by planning a trajectory for the robot
subject to uncertainty ellipse constraints. The algorithm assumes no explicit
communication or coordination between the robot and the other agents in the
environment. An MPC implementation of LUCIDGames demonstrates real-time
performance on complex autonomous driving scenarios with an update frequency of
40 Hz. Empirical results demonstrate that LUCIDGames improves the robot's
performance over existing game-theoretic and traditional MPC planning
approaches. Our implementation of LUCIDGames is available at

activity is responsible for far-from-equilibrium phenomena such as active
stress, self-organized flow, and spontaneous nematic defect generation. How
microscopic interactions between motors and filaments lead to larger-scale
dynamics remains incompletely understood. To build from motor-filament
interactions to predict bulk behavior of cytoskeletal systems, more
computationally efficient techniques for modeling motor-filament interactions
are needed. Here we derive a coarse-graining hierarchy of explicit and
continuum models for crosslinking motors that bind to and walk on filament
pairs. We compare the steady-state motor distribution and motor-induced
filament motion for the different models and analyze their computational cost.
All three models agree well in the limit of fast motor binding kinetics.
Evolving a truncated moment expansion of motor density speeds the computation

a slowly expanding torus located near the equatorial plane of AG Car. Using
non-LTE line modelling, we derived the physical parameters of the gas, which is
warm (50 K) and moderately dense (10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$. The total mass of molecular
gas in the ring is 2.7$\pm$0.9 solar masses. We analysed the radio continuum
map, which depicts a point-like source surrounded by a shallow nebula. From the
flux of the point-like source, we derived a current mass-loss date of
$1.55\pm0.21\times10^{-5}$ solar masses / yr. Finally, to better understand the
complex circumstellar environment of AG Car, we put the newly detected ring in
relation to the main nebula of dust and ionised gas. We discuss possible
formation scenarios for the ring, namely, the accumulation of interstellar
material due to the action of the stellar wind, the remnant of a close binary
interaction or merger, and an equatorially enhanced mass-loss episode. If
molecular gas formed in situ as a result of a mass eruption, it would account

a lensing $B$-mode template. This template is constructed by combining an
estimate of the polarized CMB with a tracer of the projected large-scale

infrared background derived from Planck satellite data, while the polarized CMB

From simulations, we find that the uncertainty on $r$ is reduced by $\sim10\%$,
from $\sigma(r)$= 0.024 to 0.022, which can be compared with a $\sim26\%$
reduction obtained when using a perfect lensing template. Applying the
technique to the real data, the constraint on $r$ is improved from $r_{0.05} <

for each $k \in \mathbb N$, there is a $\lambda_k \ge k^{-2k^2}$ such that for
any $k$-complex $\mathcal{S}$, every $k$-complex on $n \ge n_0(\mathcal{S})$
vertices with at least $n^{k+1 - \lambda_k}$ facets contains a homeomorphic
copy of $\mathcal{S}$. This was previously known only in dimensions one and
two, both by highly dimension-specific arguments: the existence of $\lambda_1$
is a result of Mader from 1967, and the existence of $\lambda_2$ was suggested
by Linial in 2006 and recently proved by Keevash-Long-Narayanan-Scott. We
deduce this geometric fact from a purely combinatorial result about
trace-bounded hypergraphs, where an $r$-partite $r$-graph $H$ with partite
classes $V_1, V_2, \dots, V_r$ is said to be $d$-trace-bounded if for each $2
\le i \le r$, all the vertices of $V_i$ have degree at most $d$ in the trace of
$H$ on $V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \dots \cup V_i$. Our second main result is the
following estimate for the Tur\'an numbers of degenerate trace-bounded

\ge (5rd)^{1-r}$ such that for any $d$-trace-bounded $r$-partite $r$-graph $H$,
every $r$-graph on $n \ge n_0(H)$ vertices with at least $n^{r - \alpha_{r,d}}$

with rural areas typically witnessing higher suicide rates in the U.S. However,
previous studies often ignored the effect of socio-environmental factors on the
suicide rates and its regional disparity. To address these gaps, we propose a
holistic data-driven framework to model the associations of social
(demographic, socioeconomic) and environmental (climate) factors on suicide
rates, and study the disparities across urban and suburban areas. Leveraging
the county-level suicide data from 2000--2017 along with the
socio-environmental features, we trained, tested and validated a suite of
advanced statistical learning algorithms to identify, assess and predict the
influence of key socio-environmental factors on suicide rates. Random forest
outperformed all other models in terms of goodness-of-fit and predictive
accuracy, and selected as the final model to make inferences. Our results
indicate that population demographics is significantly associated with both
urban and suburban suicide rates. We found that suburban population is more
vulnerable to suicides compared to urban communities, with suburban suicide
rate being particularly sensitive to unemployment rate and median household
income. Our analysis revealed that suicide mortality is correlated to climate,
showing that urban suicide rate is more sensitive to higher temperatures,
seasonal-heating-degree-days and precipitation, while suburban suicide rate is
sensitive to only seasonal-cooling-degree-days. This work provides deeper
insights on interactions between key socio-environmental factors and suicides
across different urbanized areas, and can help the public health agencies
develop suicide prevention strategies to reduce the growing risk of suicides.

difficult, yet ubiquitous in the sciences. Indeed, despite more than half a
century of research, it is still unknown which classes of operators allow for
computation of spectra and eigenvectors with convergence rates and error
control. Recent progress in classifying the difficulty of spectral problems
into complexity hierarchies has revealed that the most difficult spectral
problems are so hard that one needs three limits in the computation, and no
convergence rates nor error control is possible. This begs the question: which
classes of operators allow for computations with convergence rates and error
control? In this paper we address this basic question, and the algorithm used
is an infinite-dimensional version of the QR algorithm. Indeed, we generalise
the QR algorithm to infinite-dimensional operators. We prove that not only is
the algorithm executable on a finite machine, but one can also recover the
extremal parts of the spectrum and corresponding eigenvectors, with convergence
rates and error control. This allows for new classification results in the
hierarchy of computational problems that existing algorithms have not been able
to capture. The algorithm and convergence theorems are demonstrated on a wealth
of examples with comparisons to standard approaches (that are notorious for
providing false solutions).We also find that in some cases the IQR algorithm
performs better than predicted by theory and make conjectures for future study.

depend on the boundary conditions. In this context, the fact that the intrinsic
higher-dimensional skin effects under the full open boundary condition need the
presence of the topological defects is understood in terms of the anomalous
fermion production such as the Rubakov-Callan effect in the presence of the
magnetic monopole. In terms of the entanglement structure, we investigate
steady states of fermionic open systems whose Liouvillian (rapidity) spectra
host non-Hermitian topology. We analyze dissipation-driven Majorana steady
states in zero-dimensional open systems and relate them to the Majorana edge
modes of topological superconductors by using the entanglement entropy. We also
analyze a steady state of a one-dimensional open Fermi system with a
non-Hermitian topological spectrum and relate it to the chiral edge states of
the Chern insulator on the basis of the trace index defined from the
entanglement spectrum. These correspondences indicate that the entanglement
generates circular nonreciprocal currents under the periodic boundary condition

condition. Finally, we discuss several related topics such as pseudospectral
behaviors of Liouvillian dynamics and skin effects in interacting systems.

discovery spectrum of PH3 can not be re-attributed to SO2, as the line width is
larger than observed for SO2 features, and the required abundance would be an
extreme outlier. The JCMT spectrum is also consistent with our simple model,
constant PH3-abundance with altitude, with no discrepancy in line profile
(within data limits); reconciliation with a full photochemical model is the
subject of future work. Section 2 presents initial results from re-processed
ALMA data. Villanueva et al. noted an issue with bandpass calibration. They
have worked on a partially re-processed subset of the ALMA data, so we note
where their conclusions, and those of Greaves et al., are now superseded. To
summarise: we recover PH3 in Venus' atmosphere with ALMA (~5{\sigma}
confidence). Localised abundance appears to peak at ~5-10 parts-per-billion
(ppb), with suggestions of spatial variation. Advanced data-products suggest a
planet-averaged PH3 abundance ~1-4 ppb, lower than from the earlier ALMA
processing (which indicated 7+ ppb). The ALMA data are reconcilable with the
JCMT detection (~20 ppb) if there is order-of-magnitude temporal variation;
more advanced processing of the JCMT data is underway to check methods.
Independent PH3 measurements suggest possible altitude dependence (under ~5 ppb
at 60+ km, up to ~100 ppb at 50+ km; see Section 2: Conclusions.). Given that
both ALMA and JCMT were working at the limit of observatory capabilities, new
spectra should be obtained. The ALMA data in-hand are no longer limited by
calibration, but spectral ripples still exist, probably due to size and
brightness of Venus in relation to the primary beam. Further, spatial ripples
are present, potentially reducing significance of real narrow spectral
features.

Brain tumors can spread very quickly to other parts of the brain and the spinal
cord unless necessary preventive action is taken. Thus, the survival rate for
this disease is less than 40% for both men and women. A conclusive and early
diagnosis of a brain tumor could be the difference between life and death for
some. However, brain tumor detection and segmentation are tedious and
time-consuming processes as it can only be done by radiologists and clinical
experts. The use of computer vision techniques, such as Mask R Convolutional
Neural Network (Mask R CNN), to detect and segment brain tumors can mitigate
the possibility of human error while increasing prediction accuracy rates. The
goal of this project is to create an assistive diagnostics tool for brain tumor
detection and segmentation. Transfer learning was used with the Mask R CNN, and
necessary parameters were accordingly altered, as a starting point. The model
was trained with 20 epochs and later tested. The prediction segmentation
matched 90% with the ground truth. This suggests that the model was able to
perform at a high level. Once the model was finalized, the application running
on Flask was created. The application will serve as a tool for medical
professionals. It allows doctors to upload patient brain tumor MRI images in
order to receive immediate results on the diagnosis and segmentation for each
patient.

both redshift and $\rm frac_{AGN}$ is generally improved by factors of $\gtrsim

to constrain the AGN accretion power (accuracy $\approx 0.3$ dex). Our work
demonstrates that MIRI will be able to place strong constraints on the mid-IR

structure, the kSZ effect can be used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional
radial-velocity field, a technique known as kSZ tomography. We explore the
cross-correlation between the CMB and line-intensity fluctuations to retrieve
the late-time kSZ signal across a wide redshift range. We focus on the CII

signal between redshifts $z=1-5$ for upcoming experiments. We show that while
instruments currently under construction may reach a low-significance detection

sensitivity, with a detection significance of $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$. Due to
sample-variance cancellation, the cross-correlation between the reconstructed

measurements of %the scale-dependent bias contributions from new physics to the
power spectrum at large scales. To illustrate this improvement, we consider
models of the early Universe that induce primordial local-type non-gaussianity

theory states. If their initial energy density is high compared with $H^4$ then
the early-time evolution is well described by viscous hydrodynamics with a
non-zero bulk viscosity. At late times the dynamics is always far from
equilibrium. The asymptotic late-time state preserves the full de Sitter
symmetry group and its dual geometry is a domain-wall in AdS$_5$. The approach
to this state is characterised by an emergent relation of the form
$\mathcal{P}=w\,\mathcal{E}$ that is different from the equilibrium equation of

but only on $H/M$ and is negative if the ratio $H/M$ is close to unity. The
event and the apparent horizons of the late-time solution do not coincide with

""entanglement horizon"" that cannot be penetrated by extremal surfaces anchored

offer compelling advantages for studying star formation in galaxies, with huge
increases in sensitivity, survey speed and resolution over previous generation
surveys, and remaining impervious to extinction. The LOFAR Surveys Key Science

the 150MHz data over the ELAIS-N1 field reaching an RMS sensitivity of

SFR and stellar mass estimates derived from energy balance SED fitting, using
redshifts and aperture-matched forced photometry from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky
Survey (LoTSS) deep fields data release. The impact of active galactic nuclei
is minimised by leveraging the deep ancillary data alongside outlier-resistant
median-likelihood methods. We find a linear and non-evolving SFR-L150 relation,
apparently consistent with expectations based on calorimetric arguments, down
to the lowest SFRs. However, we also recover compelling evidence for stellar
mass dependence in line with previous work on this topic, in the sense that
higher mass galaxies have a larger 150MHz luminosity at a given SFR, suggesting
that the overall agreement with calorimetric arguments may be a coincidence. We
conclude that in the absence of AGN, 150MHz observations can be used to measure
accurate galaxy SFRs out to $z=1$ at least, but it is necessary to account for
stellar mass in order to obtain 150MHz-derived SFRs accurate to <0.5 dex. Our

Apart from
an infinite number of 'superdilatations,' in order to incorporate 'superspecial

strictly requires the presence of nonlinear terms in the remaining generators.
The algebra appears to be very rigid, in the sense that its central extensions
as well as the nonlinear terms coefficients become determined by the central
charge of the Virasoro subalgebra. The wedge algebra corresponds to the
conformal group in three spacetime dimensions $SO(3,2)$, so that the full

of the AdS$_{4}$ algebra with nontrivial central charges. Moreover, since the
Lorentz subalgebra ($sl(2,R)$) is non-principally embedded within the conformal

conformal extension of BMS$_{3}$ can be further regarded as a $W_{(2,2,2,1)}$

extended massive galaxies have quenched, in contrast to a quenched fraction of
69% for the normal-size massive galaxies. We find that normal-size massive
galaxies build up their central stellar mass without a significant increase in
their stellar size between z=2-4, whereas the stellar size of the extended

statistical analysis of the z~0 galaxy population using resolved kinematics.
However, the improvement in number statistics comes at a cost, with
multi-object IFS survey more severely impacted by the effect of seeing and
lower S/N. We present an analysis of ~1800 galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey
and investigate the spread and overlap in the kinematic distributions of the
spin parameter proxy $\lambda_{Re}$ as a function of stellar mass and
ellipticity. For SAMI data, the distributions of galaxies identified as regular
and non-regular rotators with \textsc{kinemetry} show considerable overlap in
the $\lambda_{Re}$-$\varepsilon_e$ diagram. In contrast, visually classified
galaxies (obvious and non-obvious rotators) are better separated in
$\lambda_{Re}$ space, with less overlap of both distributions. Then, we use a
Bayesian mixture model to analyse the observed
$\lambda_{Re}$-$\log(M_*/M_{\odot})$ distribution. Below
$\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})\sim10.5$, a single beta distribution is sufficient
to fit the complete $\lambda_{Re}$ distribution, whereas a second beta
distribution is required above $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})\sim10.5$ to account
for a population of low-$\lambda_{Re}$ galaxies. While the Bayesian mixture
model presents the cleanest separation of the two kinematic populations, we
find the unique information provided by visual classification of kinematic maps
should not be disregarded in future studies. Applied to mock-observations from
different cosmological simulations, the mixture model also predicts bimodal
$\lambda_{Re}$ distributions, albeit with different positions of the
$\lambda_{Re}$ peaks. Our analysis validates the conclusions from previous
smaller IFS surveys, but also demonstrates the importance of using kinematic
selection criteria that are dictated by the quality of the observed or
simulated data.

150~MHz of the ELAIS-N1, Lockman Hole, and Bo\""{o}tes fields, down to RMS
sensitives of around 20, 22, and 32$~\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$, respectively. These
fields are some of the best studied extra-galactic fields in the northern sky,
with existing deep, wide-area panchromatic photometry from X-ray to infrared
wavelengths, covering a total of $\approx$~26~\mbox{deg$^{2}$}. We first
generated improved multi-wavelength catalogues in ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Hole;
combined with the existing catalogue for Bo\""{o}tes, we present forced, matched
aperture photometry for over 7.2 million sources across the three fields. We
identified multi-wavelength counterparts to the radio detected sources, using a
combination of the Likelihood Ratio method and visual classification, which
greatly enhances the scientific potential of radio surveys and allows for the
characterisation of the photometric redshifts and the physical properties of
the host galaxies. The final radio-optical cross-matched catalogue consists of
81\,951 radio-detected sources, with counterparts identified and
multi-wavelength properties presented for 79\,820 ($>$97\%) sources. We also
examine the properties of the host galaxies, and through stacking analysis find
that the radio population with no identified counterpart is likely dominated by
AGN at $z\sim3-4$. This dataset contains one of the largest samples of
radio-selected star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at these
depths, making it ideal for studying the history of star-formation, and the
evolution of galaxies and AGN across cosmic time.

The contamination rates of the full sample will therefore likely be lower than

template fitting and machine learning and is optimised to produce the best

surface-to-bulk mechanism, which we dub the topological anomalous skin effect.
This occurs even in the absence of disorder for a single-band superconductor,
and is facilitated by the topological splitting of the Hilbert space into bulk
and chiral surface Majorana states. In the clean limit, the effect manifests as
a characteristic absorption peak due to surface-bulk transitions. We also
consider the effects of bulk disorder, using the Keldysh response theory. For
weak disorder, the bulk response is reminiscent of the Mattis-Bardeen result
for $s$-wave superconductors, with strongly suppressed spectral weight below
twice the pairing energy, despite the presence of gapless Weyl points. For
stronger disorder, the bulk response becomes more Drude-like and the $p$-wave
features disappear. We show that the surface-bulk signal survives when combined
with the bulk in the presence of weak disorder. The topological anomalous skin
effect can therefore serve as a fingerprint for Weyl superconductivity. We also
compute the Meissner response in the slab geometry, incorporating the effect of
the surface states.

variations in potassium as well as calcium and scandium, which has been
detected in a few notable cases such as NGC 2419 and NGC 2808, is still poorly
explored. We started a systematic search for excess of Ca (and Sc) in GC stars
with respect to the level of unmodified field stars. Statistically robust
evidence of such excess was found in a small number of GCs (NGC 4833, NGC 6715,
NGC 6402, NGC 5296, NGC 5824, and NGC 5139/omega Centauri) that join the
previously known two clusters. For the first time we show that NGC 4833 is
likely to host anti-correlated K and Mg abundances. All these GCs are among the
most massive ones in the Galaxy. We found that the fraction of stars with Ca
enhancement at 3sigma above the field star distribution is a multivariate
function of the GC mass and metallicity, as in other manifestations of the
multiple population phenomenon in GCs. We argue that these alterations in only
a few GCs can be reproduced by two different channels: either a class of
ordinary stars, that is common to all GCs, acts only in particular
environments, or an on-off mechanism is generated by the occurrence of a
peculiar type of stars (or lack of such stars). Hot bottom burning in
asymptotic giant branch stars in the low-metallicity regime is a good candidate
for the first class. Alternatively, a metallicity dependence is also expected
for supermassive stars, which are predicted to preferentially form in massive
GCs. (abridged).

structure, in magnetic systems where substantial electron-electron correlations
are present. Here, we present results of a theoretical framework which allows
to compute these interactions in any given system and demonstrate its
performance for several selected cases, for both bulk and low-dimensional

CoPt and FePt, the B20 compounds MnSi and FeGe as well as the low-dimensional
transition metal bilayers Co/Pt(111) and Mn/W(001). The effect of
electron-electron correlations is analyzed using dynamical mean-field theory on

electronic structure. Our method can be combined with more advanced techniques
for treating correlations, e.g., quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization

the more general framework of multipath quantum interference. Multipath
interference with a path-detector is theoretically analyzed to find the
connection between predictability and distinguishability. It is shown that
entanglement is what quantitatively connects distinguishability with

coherence, can also be viewed as a triality between predictability,
entanglement and coherence. There exist two different kind of duality relations
in the literature, which pertain to two different kinds of interference
experiments, with or without a path-detector. Results of this study show that
the two duality relations are quantitatively connected via entanglement. The
roots of the new results in the classical optical domain, including the
polarization coherence theorem, can be understood in the light of this work.
Additionally, the triality relations obtained can quantify wave-particle
duality in the interesting case of a quanton with an internal degree of

out to about a 3 degree radius, but that additional flux density uncertainty is
present for all sources at about the 3 per cent level; this is likely to be
associated with residual calibration errors, and is shown to be more
significant in datasets with poorer ionosphere conditions. We also provide

wind ($\theta > 72^{\circ}$) and the covering factor ($C_\mathrm{f} > 0.69$).

\sigma$ errors). We find that a major error contribution on the energetics is
due to $r_0$, stressing the importance of an accurate determination through a
proper spectral modeling, as done with WINE. Using 20 Swift (UVOT and XRT)
observations and the simultaneous OM data from XMM-Newton, we also find that
$\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ undergoes large variations, with a maximum excursion of
$\Delta\alpha_\mathrm{ox} =-0.7$, after the UFO is detected, leading to a
remarkable X-ray weakness. This may point towards a starving of the inner
accretion disk due to the removal of matter through the wind.

required for fault-tolerant quantum computation, the major remaining obstacle
to useful quantum computation is scaling, a challenge greatly amplified by the
huge overhead imposed by quantum error correction itself. We propose a
fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme that can nonetheless be assembled from
a small number of experimental components, potentially dramatically reducing
the engineering challenges associated with building a large-scale
fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our scheme has a threshold of 0.39% for
depolarising noise, assuming that memory errors are negligible. In the presence
of memory errors, the logical error rate decays exponentially with
$\sqrt{T/\tau}$, where $T$ is the memory coherence time and $\tau$ is the
timescale for elementary gates. Our approach is based on a novel procedure for
fault-tolerantly preparing three-dimensional cluster states using a single
actively controlled qubit and a pair of delay lines. Although a circuit-level
error may propagate to a high-weight error, the effect of this error on the
prepared state is always equivalent to that of a constant-weight error. We
describe how the requisite gates can be implemented using existing technologies
in quantum photonic and phononic systems. With continued improvements in only a
few components, we expect these systems to be promising candidates for
demonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation with a comparatively modest
experimental effort.

pulsational characteristics influenced by tidal effects , the first such object
observed. We aim to investigate the pulsational properties of the eclipsing
binary RS Cha in terms of the theory of tidally perturbed pulsations. Based on
photometric time series obtained from the TESS satellite, we performed binary
modelling using PHOEBE to interpret the binary light curve and to allow the
investigation of the pulsations of both components in RS Cha. We modelled the
detrended light curve with the superposition of linear modes. The frequencies
were then interpreted as self excited modes perturbed by tidal forces. We find
evidence for tidally perturbed modes, which enables the identification of
pulsation modes. RS Cha mainly exhibits dipole modes, while one prominent $l=2$
or $l=3$ mode is also inferred. The latter verifies previous results from
spectroscopic time series. This work shows that RS Cha is an ideal candidate to
test the theory of tidally perturbed pulsations within the framework of
asteroseismic modelling. The identification of multiple pulsation modes using
this theory is unprecedented and will be a keystone in the future of pre-main
sequence asteroseismology. However, amplitude modulation caused by the changing
light ratio during the orbital phase in an eclipsing binary also plays a
significant role, which can complicate mode identification.

stars that interact strongly with a hard, high-redshift binary supermassive
black hole (SMBH) system formed in a cosmological scenario. Methods: We use a
novel hybrid integration approach that combines the direct N-body code
$\varphi$-GRAPE with ETICS, a collisionless code that employs the
self-consistent field method for force calculation. The hybrid approach shows
considerable speed-up over direct summation for particle numbers $> 10^6$,
while retaining accuracy of direct N-body for a subset of particles. During the
SMBH binary evolution we monitor individual stellar interactions with the
binary in order to identify stars that noticeably contribute to the SMBH binary
hardening. Results: We successfully identify and analyze in detail the
properties of stars that extract energy from the binary. We find that the
summed energy changes seen in these stars match very well with the overall
binary energy change, demonstrating that stellar interactions are the primary
drivers of SMBH binary hardening in triaxial, gas-poor systems. The slight
triaxiality of our system results in efficient loss cone refilling, avoiding
the final parsec problem. We distinguish three different populations of
interactions based on their apocenter. We find a clear prevalence of
interactions co-rotating with the binary. Nevertheless, retrograde interactions
are the most energetic, contributing only slightly less than the prograde
population to the overall energy exchange. The most energetic interactions are
also likely to result in a change of sign in the angular momentum of the star.
We estimate the merger timescale of the binary to be $\approx 20$
$\mathrm{Myr}$, a value larger by a factor of two than the timescale reported
in a previous study.

the active and dead zone, where the accretion rate changes and mass can
accumulate. We quantify how the turbulence level is affected by the presence of
a non uniform ohmic resistivity in the radial-x direction that leads to a
region of inhibited turbulence (or dead zone). Comparing the turbulent activity
to that of ideal simulations, the turbulence inhibited area shows density
fluctuations and magnetic activity at its boundaries, driven by energy
injection from the active (ideal) zone boundaries. We find magnetic dissipation
to be significantly stronger in the ideal regions, and the turbulence
penetration through the boundary of the dead zone is determined by the value of
the resistivity itself, through the ohmic dissipation process, though the
thickness of the transition does not play a significant role in changing the
dissipation. We investigate the 1D spectra along the shearing direction:
magnetic spectra appear flat at large scales both in ideal as well as resistive
simulations, though a Kolmogorov scaling over more than one decade persists in
the dead zone, suggesting the turbulent cascade is determined by the
hydrodynamics of the system: MRI dynamo action is inhibited where sufficiently
high resistivity is present.

solve the internal Matsubara frequency summations of Feynman diagrams. In this

numerous significant advantages. Most importantly, the algorithm is general
enough for any kind of single-time correlation function series, involving any
single-particle vertex insertions. Therefore, it readily allows for the use of
action-shifted schemes, aimed at improving the convergence properties of the
series. By performing a frequency-resolved action-shift tuning, we are able to
further improve the method and converge the self-energy in a non-trivial

process tomography, a complex task that consumes a number of physical resources
scaling exponentially with the number of subsystems. An alternative approach to
the full reconstruction of a quantum channel allows selecting which coefficient
from its matrix description to measure, and how accurately, reducing the amount
of resources to be polynomial. The possibility of implementing this method is
closely related to the possibility of building a complete set of mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs) whose existence is known only when the dimension of the
Hilbert space is the power of a prime number. However, an extension of the
method that uses tensor products of maximal sets of MUBs, has been introduced
recently. Here we explicitly describe how to implement this algorithm to
selectively and efficiently estimate any parameter characterizing a quantum
process in a non-prime power dimension, and we conducted for the first time an
experimental verification of the method in a Hilbert space of dimension $d=6$.
That is the small space for which there is no known a complete set of MUBs but
it can be decomposed as a tensor product of two other Hilbert spaces of
dimensions $D_1=2$ and $D_2=3$, for which a complete set of MUBs is known. The
$6$-dimensional states were codified in the discretized transverse momentum of
the photon wavefront. The state preparation and detection stages are
dynamically programmed with the use of only-phase spatial light modulators, in

stability and asymptotic resurgent properties of this dynamical system, we
demonstrate, that its solutions exhibit a rather different behavior for large
(UV) and small (IR) effective Knudsen numbers. Close to the forward attractor
in the IR regime the constitutive relations of each moment can be written as a
multiparameter transseries. This resummation scheme allows us to extend the
definition of a transport coefficient to the non-equilibrium regime naturally.
Each transport coefficient is renormalized by the non-perturbative
contributions of the non-hydrodynamic modes. The Knudsen number dependence of
the transport coefficient is governed by the corresponding renormalization
group flow equation. An interesting feature of the Yang-Mills plasma in this
regime is that it exhibits transient non-Newtonian behavior while
hydrodynamizing. In the UV regime the solution for the moments can be written
as a power-law asymptotic series with a finite radius of convergence. We show
that radius of convergence of the UV perturbative expansion grows linearly as a
function of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. Finally, we compare

determines the optimal network topology and estimates the number of steps to
reach that topology, while the second subproblem generates a sequence of
switching operations to coordinate the switches. For repairing the faults, we
design an MILP model that dispatches repair crews to clear faults and replace
melted fuses. After clearing a fault, we update the topology of the network by
generating a new sequence of switching operations, and the process continues
until all faults are cleared. To improve the computational efficiency, a
network reduction algorithm is developed to group line sections, such that only
switchable sections are present in the reduced network. The proposed method is
validated on the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-bus systems.

of activity and quiescence. Characterising the duty cycle of active galactic
nuclei is crucial for understanding the impact of the energy they release on
the host galaxy. For radio AGN, this can be done by identifying dying (remnant)
and restarted radio galaxies from their radio spectral properties. Using the
combination of images at 1400 MHz produced by Apertif, the new phased-array
feed receiver installed on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and images
at 150 MHz provided by LOFAR, we have derived resolved spectral index images
(at a resolution of ~15 arcsec) for all the sources within ~6 deg^2 area of the
Lockman Hole region. We were able to select 15 extended radio sources with
emission (partly or entirely) characterised by extremely steep spectral indices
(steeper than 1.2). These objects represent radio sources in the remnant or the
restarted phases of their life cycle. Our findings suggest this cycle to be
relatively fast. They also show a variety of properties relevant for modelling
the evolution of radio galaxies. For example, the restarted activity can occur
while the remnant structure from a previous phase of activity is still visible.
This provides constraints on the duration of the 'off' (dying) phase. In
extended remnants with ultra-steep spectra at low frequencies, the activity
likely stopped a few hundred megayears ago, and they correspond to the older
tail of the age distribution of radio galaxies, in agreement with simulations
of radio source evolution. We find remnant radio sources with a variety of
structures (from double-lobed to amorphous), suggesting different types of
progenitors. The present work sets the stage for exploiting low-frequency
spectral index studies of extended sources by taking advantage of the large
areas common to the LOFAR and the Apertif surveys.

relativistic gravitational implosion. Coulomb forces, for example, can in
principle prevent the ultimate collapse of charged matter to a singularity.
Also, half a century ago, Mael Melvin noted that magnetic forcelines do not
collapse under their own gravity, no matter how strong the latter may be.
Instead, magnetic fields seemed capable of stabilising themselves against
gravitational self-contraction. Intrigued, Melvin wondered whether magnetism
could also support against the realistic collapse of charged matter. Here, we
look back into these issues by means of two complementary scenarios. The first
reconsiders Melvin's highly idealised ""magnetic universe"" and reaches the same
conclusion, namely that magnetic fields do not self-gravitate. The second is a
realistic collapse scenario, like that of magnetised massive compact stars.
Looking for answers to Melvin's question, we find that magnetic fields do show
a generic tendency to support against relativistic gravitational implosion. The
magnetic effect in question involves the curvature of the host space, it grows
stronger as the collapse progresses and the triggering agent is the field's
tension. In other words, the reason is the elasticity of the field lines and
their inherent tendency to react against anything that distorts them from

from a simple massive complex scalar (referred to as mini boson stars), to

numerically evolve the nonlinear Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in 3D,
beginning with stationary boson star solutions. We show that the linear,
non-axisymmetric instability found in mini boson stars with azimuthal number
$m=1$ persists across the entire parameter space for these stars, though the
timescale diverges in the Newtonian limit. Therefore, any boson star with $m=1$
that is sufficiently far into the non-relativistic regime, where the leading
order mass term dominates, will be unstable, independent of the nonlinear
scalar self-interactions. However, we do find regions of $m=1$ boson star
parameter space where adding nonlinear interactions to the scalar potential
quenches the non-axisymmetric instability, both on the non-relativistic, and
the relativistic branches of solutions. We also consider select boson stars
with $m=2$, finding instability in all cases. For the cases exhibiting
instability, we follow the nonlinear development, finding a range of dynamics
including fragmentation into multiple unbound non-rotating stars, and formation
of binary black holes. Finally, we comment on the relationship between
stability and criteria based on the rotating boson star's frequency in relation
to that of a spherical boson star or the existence of a co-rotation point. The
boson stars that we find not to exhibit instability when evolved for many
dynamical times include rapidly rotating cases where the compactness is
comparable to that of a black hole or neutron star.

radio halos or radio relics. The existence of this diffuse synchrotron emission
indicates the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic fields. It is
still an open question what mechanisms exactly are responsible for the

LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields offer a unique view of this problem.
Reaching noise levels below 30 $\mu$Jy/beam, these are the deepest images made
at the low frequency of 144 MHz. This paper presents a search for diffuse
emission in galaxy clusters in the first data release of the LOFAR Deep Fields.
We detect a new high-redshift radio halo with a flux density of $8.9 \pm 1.0$
mJy and corresponding luminosity of $P_{144\mathrm{MHz}}=(3.6 \pm
0.6)\times10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ in an X-ray detected cluster at $z=0.77$ with a

upper limits are placed on clusters with non-detections. We compare the results
to the correlation between halo luminosity and cluster mass derived for radio
halos found in the literature. This study is one of few to find diffuse
emission in low mass ($M_{500} < 5\times10^{14} M_\odot$) systems and shows
that deep low-frequency observations of galaxy clusters are fundamental for
opening up a new part of parameter space in the study of non-thermal phenomena

multiple dispatchers and FCFS servers. In the absence of any information on job
sizes, dispatchers typically use queue length information reported by the
servers to assign incoming jobs. When job sizes are highly variable, using only
queue length information is clearly suboptimal and performance can be improved
if some indication can be provided to the dispatcher about the size of an
ongoing job. In a FCFS server measuring the attained service time of the
ongoing job is easy and servers can therefore report this attained service time
together with the queue length when queried by a dispatcher.
  In this paper we propose and analyse a variety of load balancing policies
that exploit both the queue length and attained service time to assign jobs, as
well as policies for which only the attained service time of the job in service
is used. We present a unified analysis for all these policies in a large scale
system under the usual asymptotic independence assumptions. The accuracy of the
proposed analysis is illustrated using simulation.
  We present extensive numerical experiments which clearly indicate that a
significant improvement in waiting (and thus also in response) time may be
achieved by using the attained service time information on top of the queue
length of a server. Moreover, the policies which do not make use of the queue
length still provide an improved waiting time for moderately loaded systems.

challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational
requirements. Common approaches to the analysis of agent-based models include
extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the model or the derivation of
coarse-grained differential equation models to predict the expected or averaged
output from the agent-based model. Both of these approaches have limitations,
however, as extensive computation of complex agent-based models may be
infeasible, and coarse-grained differential equation models can fail to

that methods from the equation learning field provide a promising, novel, and

use, requires few model simulations, and accurately predicts model dynamics in
parameter regions where coarse-grained differential equation models fail to do
so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two

the system. Applying these bounds to $s$-wave systems with a Zeeman field, we
conclude that a topological phase transition requires that the Zeeman energy at
least locally exceed the superconducting pairing by the energy gap of the full
Hamiltonian. Our results are independent of the geometry and dimensionality of
the system.

free-stream disturbances which are often uncertain. This uncertainty
compromises predictions of models and simulations. To enhance the fidelity of
simulations, we directly infuse them with available observations. Our
methodology is general and can be adopted with any simulation tool, and is
herein demonstrated using direct numerical simulations. An ensemble variational
(EnVar) optimization is performed, whereby we determine the upstream flow that
optimally reproduces the observations. The cost functional accounts for our
relative confidence in the model and the observations, and judicious choice of
the ensemble members improves convergence and reduces the prediction
uncertainty. We demonstrate our observation-infused predictions for
boundary-layer transition at Mach 4.5. Without prior knowledge of the
free-stream condition, and using only observations of wall pressure at isolated
locations from an independent computation (true flow), all of the relevant
inflow disturbances are identified. We then evaluate the entire flow field,
beyond the original limited wall observations, and interpret simulations
consistently with data and vice versa. Our predicted flow compares favorably to
the true `unknown' state, and discrepancies are analyzed in detail. We also
examine the impact of weighting of observations. Improved convergence of the
inverse problem and accuracy of the inflow amplitudes and phases are
demonstrated, and are explained by aid of a simple example from two-dimensional
unstable, chaotic convection.

fat-tailed distribution. An application is to price theory in economics. We
show that fat tails arise endogenously from modeling of price change based on
an excess demand analysis resulting in a quotient of arbitrarily correlated
demand and supply whether or not jump discontinuities are present. The
assumption is that supply and demand are described by drift terms, Brownian
(i.e., Gaussian) and compound Poisson jump processes. If $P^{-1}dP/dt$ (the
relative price change in an interval $dt$) is given by a suitable function of
relative excess demand, $\left( \mathcal{D}% -\mathcal{S}\right) /\mathcal{S}$
(where $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ are demand and supply), then the
distribution has tail behavior $F\left( x\right) \sim x^{-\zeta}$ for a power
$\zeta$ that depends on the function $G$ in $P^{-1}dP/dt=G\left(
\mathcal{D}/\mathcal{S}\right) $. For $G\left( x\right) \sim\left\vert
x\right\vert ^{1/q}$ one has $\zeta=q.$ The empirical data for assets typically
yields a value, $\zeta\tilde{=}3,$ or $\ \zeta \in\left[ 3,5\right] $ for some
markets.
  The discrepancy between the empirical result and theory never arises if one
models price dynamics using basic economics methodology, i.e., generalized
Walrasian adjustment, rather than the usual starting point for classical
finance which assumes a normal distribution of price changes. The function $G$
is deterministic, and can be calibrated with a smaller data set. The results
establish a simple link between the decay exponent of the density function and
the price adjustment function, a feature that can improve methodology for risk
assessment.
  The mathematical results can be applied to other problems involving the
relative difference or quotient of Levy processes of jump-diffusion type.

fractional stellar mass growth rate (FSMGR), morphology, and
gas-to-stellar-mass ratio (estimated from a combination of HI data and
photometric gas fractions calibrated with the RESOLVE survey). Our void
galaxies typically have lower baryonic masses than galaxies in denser
environments, and they display the properties expected of a lower mass
population: they have more late-types, are bluer, have higher FSMGR, and are
more gas rich. We control for baryonic mass and investigate the extent to which
void galaxies are different at fixed mass. Void galaxies are bluer, more
gas-rich, and more star forming at fixed mass than non-void galaxies, which is
a possible signature of galaxy assembly bias. Furthermore, we show that these
trends persist even at fixed mass and morphology, and we find that voids host a
distinct population of early-types that are bluer and more star-forming than
the typical red and quenched early-types. In addition to these empirical
observational results, we also present theoretical results from mock catalogs

the primary intention of showing the incompleteness of quantum mechanics; to
prove it, he uses the instantaneous nonlocal effects caused by the collapse of
the wave function of a single particle -the spooky action at a distance-, when
a measurement is done. This historical event precede the well-know
Einstein-Podolsk-Rosen criticism over the incompleteness of quantum mechanics.
Here, by using the Stern-Gerlach experiment (SGE), we demonstrate how the
instantaneous nonlocal feature of the collapse of the wave function together
with the single-particle entanglement can be used to produce the nonlocal
effect of steering. In the steering process Bob gets a quantum state depending
on which observable Alice decides to measure. To accomplish this, we fully
exploit the spreading (over large distances) of the entangled wave function of
the single-particle. In particular, we demonstrate that the nonlocality of the
single-particle entanglement allows the particle to know which detector Alice
is using to steer Bob's state. Therefore, notwithstanding strong
counterarguments, we prove that the single-particle entanglement gives rise to
truly nonlocal effects at two far a away places. This open the possibility of
using the single-particle entanglement for implementing truly nonlocal task.

Because of the steep spectral index of the excess over the cosmic microwave
background, it is best studied at low frequencies where the signal is
strongest. The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) wide and deep sky surveys give us
the best constraints yet on the contribution of discrete extragalactic sources
at 144 MHz, and in particular allow us to include contributions from diffuse,
low-surface-brightness emission that could not be fully accounted for in

crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to

To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models

  We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a

extended the original Ally~app to include two types of machine-learning model

that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and
updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a
\textit{control model\/} that sent intervention messages at random times. The
app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We
observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40\% improvement in

temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to

On contrary to the effect of multi-user interference and receiver noise, which
vanishes as the number of relay antenna goes to infinity, the residual SI and
ICL caused by the hardware impairments remains in the MC system.

computationally prohibitive for such large systems. To overcome this
bottleneck, we have developed a machine learning model that consists of a novel
dimensionality reduction technique and a deep neural network-based learning in
the reduced dimension. The proposed nonlinear dimensionality reduction
technique extends the functional principal component analysis to satisfy the
constraint of deformation. Its novelty lies in designing a function space that
satisfies the constraint exactly, which is crucial for efficient dimensionality
reduction. Owing to the dimensionality reduction and several other strategies
adopted in the present work, learning through deep neural networks is
remarkably accurate. The proposed model accurately matches an
atomistic-physics-based model while being orders of magnitude faster. It
extracts universally dominant patterns of deformation in an unsupervised
manner. These patterns are comprehensible and elucidate how the model predicts,
yielding interpretability. The proposed model can form a basis for the
exploration of machine learning toward the mechanics of one and two-dimensional

commercial value. Spawning stock and recruitment of the Chesapeake Bay
population declined by 80% in the 1990s. After severe management actions were
implemented in 2008, female abundance rebounded to pre-1994 levels and
stabilized. The stepwise decline in the early 1990s, followed by a consistently
low level of abundance for 15 y and a jump to high abundance after 2008,
suggested the existence of alternative stable states. Alternatively, high
fishing pressure combined with low recruitment in 1992 could have triggered a
proportional decline in the population, followed by a population increase in
2008 due to rigorous management actions that reduced fishing. We evaluated
these alternatives with a stage-structured dynamic population model using
ordinary differential equations. In addition, stock assessment models assume
that fishing and mortality are independent of density. Hence, we also
investigated the role of density-dependent predation, cannibalism and fishing
in blue crab population dynamics. We conclude that for the blue crab population
in Chesapeake Bay: (1) bistable positive states are not likely with
biologically realistic parameter values; (2) hyperbolic (depensatory) fishing
will not produce extinction at the range of population densities observed in
the bay; and (3) crabs can survive a higher fishing rate under the more
realistic assumption of sigmoidal (density-dependent) predation and cannibalism
than under constant (density-independent) predation and cannibalism. These
collectively indicate that the blue crab population in Chesapeake Bay is
resilient to a range of biotic and abiotic disturbances.

likely spectral type of the secondary. We discuss why we favour the assumption
that the donor in AH Her is a slightly evolved star, in which case we find that
the best solution for the inclination yields $i = 48^\circ \pm 2^\circ$.
Nonetheless, should the donor be a ZAMS star, we obtain that the inclination is

modern-day life, there is still some controversy around the ways to asses the
amount and quality of information inside a noisy optical channel. A number of
theoretical approaches based on, e.g., conditional Shannon entropy and Fisher
information have been developed, along with some experimental validations. Some
of these approaches are limited to a certain alphabet, while others tend to
fall short when considering optical beams with non-trivial structure, such as
Hermite-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss and other modes with non-trivial structure. Here,
we propose a new definition of classical Shannon information via the Wigner
distribution function, while respecting the Heisenberg inequality. Following
this definition, we calculate the amount of information in a Gaussian,
Hermite-Gaussian, and Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in juxtaposition and
experimentally validate it by reconstruction of the Wigner distribution
function from the intensity distribution of structured laser beams. We
experimentally demonstrate the technique that allows to infer field structure
of the laser beams in singular optics to assess the amount of contained
information. Given the generality, this approach of defining information via
analyzing the beam complexity is applicable to laser modes of any topology that
can be described by 'well-behaved' functions. Classical Shannon information
defined in this way is detached from a particular alphabet, i.e. communication
scheme, and scales with the structural complexity of the system. Such a synergy
between the Wigner distribution function encompassing the information in both
real and reciprocal space, and information being a measure of disorder, can
contribute into future coherent detection algorithms and remote sensing.

Parker Solar Probe/ISoIS instrument suite at 0.35 AU from the Sun. From
standard velocity-dispersion analysis, the apparent ion path length is 0.625 AU
at the onset of each event. Aims:We develop a formalism for estimating the path
length of random-walking magnetic field lines, to explain why the apparent ion
pathlength at event onset greatly exceeds the radial distance from the Sun for
these events. Methods:We developed analytical estimates of the average increase
in pathlength of random-walking magnetic field lines, relative to the
unperturbed mean field. Monte Carlo simulations of fieldline and particle
trajectories in a model of solar wind turbulence are used to validate the
formalism and study the path lengths of particle guiding-center and
full-orbital trajectories. The formalism is implemented in a global solar wind
model, and results are compared with ion pathlengths inferred from ISoIS
observations. Results:Both a simple estimate and a rigorous theoretical
formulation are obtained for fieldlines' pathlength increase as a function of
pathlength along the large-scale field. From simulated fieldline and particle
trajectories, we find that particle guiding centers can have pathlengths
somewhat shorter than the average fieldline pathlength, while particle orbits
can have substantially larger pathlengths due to their gyromotion with a
nonzero effective pitch angle. Conclusions:The long apparent path length during
these solar energetic ion events can be explained by 1) a magnetic field line
path length increase due to the field line random walk, and 2) particle
transport about the guiding center with a nonzero effective pitch angle. Our
formalism for computing the magnetic field line path length, accounting for
turbulent fluctuations, may be useful for application to solar particle
transport in general.

problem by jointly learning four low-level vision sub-tasks: optical flow
$\textbf{F}$, stereo-depth $\textbf{D}$, camera pose $\textbf{P}$ and motion
segmentation $\textbf{S}$. Our key insight is that the rigidity of the scene
shares the same inherent geometrical structure with object movements and scene
depth. Hence, rigidity from $\textbf{S}$ can be inferred by jointly coupling
$\textbf{F}$, $\textbf{D}$ and $\textbf{P}$ to achieve more robust estimation.
To this end, we propose a novel scene flow framework named EffiScene with
efficient joint rigidity learning, going beyond the existing pipeline with
independent auxiliary structures. In EffiScene, we first estimate optical flow
and depth at the coarse level and then compute camera pose by
Perspective-$n$-Points method. To jointly learn local rigidity, we design a
novel Rigidity From Motion (RfM) layer with three principal components:
\emph{}{(i)} correlation extraction; \emph{}{(ii)} boundary learning; and
\emph{}{(iii)} outlier exclusion. Final outputs are fused based on the rigid
map $M_R$ from RfM at finer levels. To efficiently train EffiScene, two new
losses $\mathcal{L}_{bnd}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{unc}$ are designed to prevent
trivial solutions and to regularize the flow boundary discontinuity. Extensive
experiments on scene flow benchmark KITTI show that our method is effective and
significantly improves the state-of-the-art approaches for all sub-tasks, i.e.

constraint and reduce the complexity from $O(KN^2)$ to $O(KN\tau)$.
Furthermore, the constrained optimization is modeled as a $K$-edges maximum

Arja using SBIR correctly repairs 28 defects, but only 21 using SBFL, and only
15 using Blues; SequenceR using SBIR correctly repairs 12 defects, but only 10

overcome poor FL), correctly repairs 30 defects using SBIR and SBFL, but only
13 using Blues. Our work is the first investigation of simultaneously using

applied in spatial computing to address deep learning trained with extreme

exists in ground truth labels due to how labels are collected in spatial

Such techniques can be wasteful due to the cost of data retrieval. Our proposed

science, as community structures often reveal both topological and functional
relationships between different components of the complex system. In this
paper, we first propose a gradient descent framework of modularity optimization
called vector-label propagation algorithm (VLPA), where a node is associated
with a vector of continuous community labels instead of one label. Retaining
weak structural information in vector-label, VLPA outperforms some well-known
community detection methods, and particularly improves the performance in
networks with weak community structures. Further, we incorporate stochastic
gradient strategies into VLPA to avoid stuck in the local optima, leading to
the stochastic vector-label propagation algorithm (sVLPA). We show that sVLPA
performs better than Louvain Method, a widely used community detection
algorithm, on both artificial benchmarks and real-world networks. Our
theoretical scheme based on vector-label propagation can be directly applied to
high-dimensional networks where each node has multiple features, and can also
be used for optimizing other partition measures such as modularity with
resolution parameters.

implementation on quantum computers. Given the natural sparsity of
wavefunctions obtained from Quantum Monte Carlo methods, we consider here a
stochastic solution to the UCC problem. Using the Coupled Cluster Monte Carlo
framework, we develop cluster selection schemes that capture the structure of
the UCC wavefunction, as well as its Trotterized approximation, and use these
to solve the corresponding projected equations. Due to the fast convergence of
the equations with order in the cluster expansion, this approach scales
polynomially with the size of the system. Unlike traditional UCC
implementations, our approach naturally produces a non-variational estimator
for the energy in the form of the projected energy. For UCCSD in small systems,
we find this agrees well with the expectation value of the energy and, in the
case of two electrons, with full configuration interaction results. For the
larger N$_2$ system, the two estimators diverge, with the projected energy
approaching the coupled cluster result, while the expectation value is close to

learning an individual policy for each particular task, the proposed framework,
DISH, distills a hierarchical policy from a set of tasks by representation and

latent variables. The resulting policy consists of two levels of hierarchy: (i)
a planning module that reasons a sequence of latent intentions that would lead
to an optimistic future and (ii) a feedback control policy, shared across the
tasks, that executes the inferred intention. Because the planning is performed
in low-dimensional latent space, the learned policy can immediately be used to
solve or adapt to new tasks without additional training. We demonstrate the
proposed framework can learn compact representations (3- and 1-dimensional
latent states and commands for a humanoid with 197- and 36-dimensional state

measured physical attributes or the prior knowledge of the object. This paper
proposes an approach to determining the strategy of dexterous grasping by using
an anthropomorphic robotic hand simply based on a label or a description of an
object. Object attributes are parsed from natural-language descriptions and
augmented with an object knowledge base that is scraped from retailer websites.
A novel metric named joint probability distance is defined to measure distance
between object attributes. The probability distribution of grasp types for the
given object is learned using a deep neural network which takes in object
features as input. The action of the multi-fingered hand with redundant degrees
of freedom (DoF) is controlled by a linear inverse-kinematics model of grasp
topology and scales. The grasping strategy generated by the proposed approach
is evaluated both by simulation and execution on a Sawyer robot with an AR10
robotic hand.

aperture radar (SAR) images are of great importance for urban SAR applications,
yet highly challenging owing to the complexity of SAR data. This paper
addresses the issue of individual building segmentation from a single VHR SAR
image in large-scale urban areas. To achieve this, we introduce building
footprints from GIS data as complementary information and propose a novel
conditional GIS-aware network (CG-Net). The proposed model learns multi-level
visual features and employs building footprints to normalize the features for
predicting building masks in the SAR image. We validate our method using a high
resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X image collected over Berlin. Experimental
results show that the proposed CG-Net effectively brings improvements with
variant backbones. We further compare two representations of building
footprints, namely complete building footprints and sensor-visible footprint
segments, for our task, and conclude that the use of the former leads to better
segmentation results. Moreover, we investigate the impact of inaccurate GIS
data on our CG-Net, and this study shows that CG-Net is robust against
positioning errors in GIS data. In addition, we propose an approach of ground
truth generation of buildings from an accurate digital elevation model (DEM),
which can be used to generate large-scale SAR image datasets. The segmentation
results can be applied to reconstruct 3D building models at level-of-detail
(LoD) 1, which is demonstrated in our experiments.

very precisely thanks to a strong constraint on the orbital inclination: $M_A =

energy distribution fitting method to derive characteristics of the component
stars in lieu of the precise radii that would normally be derived from a
doubly-eclipsing binary. The deconvolution of the SEDs reveals that the
brighter component of the binary is at the faint turnoff point for the cluster
-- a distinct evolutionary point that occurs after the convective core has been
established and while the star is in the middle of its movement toward lower
surface temperature, before the so-called hook at the end of main sequence. The
measurements are in distinct disagreement with evolution models at solar
metallicity: higher metal abundances are needed to reproduce the
characteristics of WOCS 11028 A. We discuss the changes to model physics that
are likely to be needed to address the discrepancies. The clearest conclusions
are that diffusion is probably necessary to reconcile spectroscopic abundances
of M67 stars with the need for higher metallicity models, and that reduced
strength convective overshooting is occurring for stars at the turnoff. At
super-solar bulk metallicity, various indicators agree on a cluster age between
about 3.5 and 4.0 Gyr.

linearly implicit energy-preserving schemes with arbitrary order of accuracy

exponential scalar variable (ESAV) approach that can remove the
bounded-from-blew restriction of nonlinear terms in the Hamiltonian functional
and provides a totally explicit discretization of the auxiliary variable
without computing extra inner products, which make it more effective and
applicable than the traditional scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach. To
achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy and energy preservation, we utilize the
symplectic Runge-Kutta method for both solution variables and the auxiliary
variable, where the values of internal stages in nonlinear terms are explicitly
derived via an extrapolation from numerical solutions already obtained in the
preceding calculation. A prediction-correction strategy is proposed to further
improve the accuracy. Fourier pseudo-spectral method is then employed to obtain
fully discrete schemes. Compared with the SAV schemes, the solution variables
and the auxiliary variable in these ESAV schemes are now decoupled. Moreover,
when the linear terms are of constant coefficients, the solution variables can
be explicitly solved by using the fast Fourier transform. Numerical experiments
are carried out for three Hamiltonian PDEs to demonstrate the efficiency and
conservation of the ESAV schemes.

  and co-Attention Distillation","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (IEEE TMM)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely-used in image
translation, but their high computation and storage costs impede the deployment
on mobile devices. Prevalent methods for CNN compression cannot be directly
applied to GANs due to the peculiarties of GAN tasks and the unstable
adversarial training. To solve these, in this paper, we introduce a novel GAN
compression method, termed DMAD, by proposing a Differentiable Mask and a
co-Attention Distillation. The former searches for a light-weight generator
architecture in a training-adaptive manner. To overcome channel inconsistency
when pruning the residual connections, an adaptive cross-block group sparsity
is further incorporated. The latter simultaneously distills informative
attention maps from both the generator and discriminator of a pre-trained model
to the searched generator, effectively stabilizing the adversarial training of
our light-weight model. Experiments show that DMAD can reduce the Multiply
Accumulate Operations (MACs) of CycleGAN by 13x and that of Pix2Pix by 4x while
retaining a comparable performance against the full model. Our code can be

$\text{RCD}(K,N)$ spaces, that is, metric-measure spaces
$(X,\mathsf{d},\mathscr{H}^N)$ with lower Ricci curvature bounded below. Our
main structural result is that the boundary $\partial X$ is homeomorphic to a
manifold away from a set of codimension 2, and is $N-1$ rectifiable. Along the
way we show effective measure bounds on the boundary and its tubular
neighborhoods. These results are new even for Gromov-Hausdorff limits
$(M_i^N,\mathsf{d}_{g_i},p_i) \rightarrow (X,\mathsf{d},p)$ of smooth manifolds
with boundary, and require new techniques beyond those needed to prove the
analogous statements for the regular set, in particular when it comes to the
manifold structure of the boundary $\partial X$.
  The key local result is an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, which tells us that
if a ball $B_{2}(p)\subset X$ is sufficiently close to a half space
$B_{2}(0)\subset \mathbb{R}^N_+$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, then $B_1(p)$
is biH\""older to an open set of $\mathbb{R}^N_+$. In particular, $\partial X$
is itself homeomorphic to $B_1(0^{N-1})$ near $B_1(p)$. Further, the boundary
$\partial X$ is $N-1$ rectifiable and the boundary measure
$\mathscr{H}^{N-1}_{\partial X}$ is Ahlfors regular on $B_1(p)$ with volume
close to the Euclidean volume.
  Our second collection of results involve the stability of the boundary with
respect to noncollapsed mGH convergence $X_i\to X$. Specifically, we show a
boundary volume convergence which tells us that the $N-1$ Hausdorff measures on
the boundaries converge $\mathscr{H}^{N-1}_{\partial X_i}\to
\mathscr{H}^{N-1}_{\partial X}$ to the limit Hausdorff measure on $\partial X$.
We will see that a consequence of this is that if the $X_i$ are boundary free
then so is $X$.

develops timeseries models to forecast hourly count timeseries data, and
estimate its volatility. Such models need to take into account the complex
patterns over various temporal scales including hourly, daily, weekly and
annual as well as the temporal correlation. To capture this complex structure,
a large number of parameters are needed. Here a structural model selection
approach is utilized to choose the parameters. This method explores the
parameter space for a group of covariates at each step. These groups of
covariate are constructed to represent a particular structure in the model. The
statistical models utilized are extensions of Generalized Linear Models to
timeseries data. One challenge in using such models is the explosive behavior
of the simulated values. To address this issue, we develop a technique which
relies on damping the simulated value, if it falls outside of an admissible
interval. The admissible interval is defined using measures of variability of
the left and right tails. A new definition of outliers is proposed based on
these variability measures. This new definition is shown to be useful in the
context of asymmetric distributions.

The filter-and-sum operation is applied on a context around the frame to be

  7, Pages 547-561",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In a focused ion beam (FIB) microscope, source particles interact with a
small volume of a sample to generate secondary electrons that are detected,
pixel by pixel, to produce a micrograph. Randomness of the number of incident
particles causes excess variation in the micrograph, beyond the variation in
the underlying particle-sample interaction. We recently demonstrated that joint
processing of multiple time-resolved measurements from a single pixel can
mitigate this effect of source shot noise in helium ion microscopy. This paper
is focused on establishing a rigorous framework for understanding the potential
for this approach. It introduces idealized continuous- and discrete-time
abstractions of FIB microscopy with direct electron detection and
estimation-theoretic limits of imaging performance under these measurement
models. Novel estimators for use with continuous-time measurements are
introduced and analyzed, and estimators for use with discrete-time measurements
are analyzed and shown to approach their continuous-time counterparts as time
resolution is increased. Simulated FIB microscopy results are consistent with
theoretical analyses and demonstrate that substantial improvements over
conventional FIB microscopy image formation are made possible by time-resolved
measurement.

by the solutions of the MVSDEs with shifted driving L\'evy noise, we build up a
framework to fully apply the weak convergence method to establish large and
moderate deviation principles for MVSDEs. In the case of ordinary SDEs, the
rate function is calculated by using the solutions of the corresponding
skeleton equations simply replacing the noise by the elements of the
Cameron-Martin space. It turns out that the correct rate function for MVSDEs is
defined through the solutions of skeleton equations replacing the noise by
smooth functions and replacing the distributions involved in the equation by
the distribution of the solution of the corresponding deterministic equation
(without the noise). This is somehow surprising. With this approach, we obtain
large and moderate deviation principles for much wider classes of MVSDEs in
comparison with the existing literature.

different variables, and can be difficult to understand, especially for
non-statistical audiences. We developed methodology to apply business
constraints to clustering solutions and allow the decision-maker to choose the
balance between statistical goodness-of-fit and conformity to business

features in peer groups, and a number of visualisations are developed to
explain high-dimensional clusters for non-statistical audiences. In a case
study where peer group size was required to be small ($\leq 100$ members), we
applied constrained clustering to a noisy high-dimensional data-set over two
subsequent years, ensuring that the clusters were sufficiently stable between
years. Our approach not only satisfied clustering constraints on the test data,

goodness-of-fit and stability between subsequent years. We demonstrated in the

contextual factors, however linear regression is known to be sub-optimal when
nonlinear relationships exist between the comparative measure and covariates.

case-study of high noise data. We provide new visualisations and numerical

research topic in real world applications. As the complexity of data dimension
increases, it requires to understand the semantic contexts in its description

methods show limited performances with high dimensional data such as ImageNet.
Existing studies have evaluated their performance on low dimensional, clean and
well separated data set such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. In this paper, we study
anomaly detection with high dimensional and complex normal data. Our
observation is that, in general, anomaly data is defined by semantically
explainable features which are able to be used in defining semantic
sub-clusters of normal data as well. We hypothesize that if there exists
reasonably good feature space semantically separating sub-clusters of given
normal data, unseen anomaly also can be well distinguished in the space from
the normal data. We propose to perform semantic clustering on given normal data
and train a classifier to learn the discriminative feature space where anomaly
detection is finally performed. Based on our careful and extensive experimental
evaluations with MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet with various combinations of
normal and anomaly data, we show that our anomaly detection scheme outperforms

general semiparametric theory for proximal estimation of the average treatment

recently, adaptive weighting was introduced to improve the reconstruction image

a new adaptive weighting factor named the variational coherence factor (VCF),

The proposed technique provides superior results in terms of image resolution,
sidelobe reduction, signal-to-noise and contrast level improvement. The

spaces. Affordances are a powerful concept to simplify this search, because
they model what actions can be successful in a given situation. However, the
classical notion of affordance is not suitable for long horizon planning
because it only informs the robot about the immediate outcome of actions
instead of what actions are best for achieving a long-term goal. In this paper,
we introduce a new affordance representation that enables the robot to reason
about the long-term effects of actions through modeling what actions are
afforded in the future, thereby informing the robot the best actions to take
next to achieve a task goal. Based on the new representation, we develop a
learning-to-plan method, Deep Affordance Foresight (DAF), that learns partial
environment models of affordances of parameterized motor skills through
trial-and-error. We evaluate DAF on two challenging manipulation domains and
show that it can effectively learn to carry out multi-step tasks, share learned

potential timing has not previously been studied at the level of individual
directed molecular transitions within a conductance-based model ion-state
graph. The underlying connection provides an important example of how
mathematics can be applied to study the effects of unobservable microscopic
fluctuations to macroscopically observable quantities. We study a stochastic
Langevin model and show how to resolve the individual contributions that each
transition in the ion channel graph makes to the variance of the interspike
interval (ISI). We extend the mean--return-time (MRT) phase reduction developed
in (Cao et al. 2020, SIAM J. Appl. Math) to the second moment of the return
time from an MRT isochron to itself. Because fixed-voltage spike-detection
triggers do not correspond to MRT isochrons, the inter-phase interval (IPI)
variance only approximates the ISI variance. We find the IPI variance and ISI
variance agree to within a few percent when both can be computed. Moreover, we
prove rigorously, and show numerically, that our expression for the IPI
variance is accurate in the small noise (large system size) regime; our theory
is exact in the limit of small noise. By selectively including the noise
associated with only those few transitions responsible for most of the ISI
variance, our analysis extends the stochastic shielding (SS) paradigm (Schmandt
et al. 2012, Phys. Rev. Lett.) from the stationary voltage-clamp case to the
current-clamp case. We show numerically that the SS approximation has a high
degree of accuracy even for larger, physiologically relevant noise levels. We
show that the ISI variance is not an unambiguously defined quantity, but
depends on the choice of voltage level set as the spike-detection threshold,
both in vitro and in silico.

with the modes of an optical cavity to form hybrid light-matter states known as
vibrational polaritons. Experiments show that the kinetics of thermally
activated chemical reactions can be modified by VSC. Transition-state theory,
which assumes that internal thermalization is fast compared to reactive
transitions, has been unable to explain the observed findings. Here, we carry
out kinetic simulations to understand how dissipative processes, namely those
that VSC introduces to the chemical system, affect reactions where internal
thermalization and reactive transitions occur on similar timescales. Using the
Marcus-Levich-Jortner type of electron transfer as a model reaction, we show
that such dissipation can change reactivity by accelerating internal
thermalization, thereby suppressing nonequilibrium effects that occur in the
reaction outside the cavity. This phenomenon is attributed mainly to cavity
decay (i.e., photon leakage), but a supporting role is played by the relaxation
between polaritons and dark states. When nonequilibrium effects are already
suppressed in the bare reaction (the reactive species are essentially at
internal thermal equilibrium throughout the reaction), we find that reactivity
does not change significantly under VSC. Connections are made between our
results and experimental observations.

various forms has been playing a crucial role in improving the learning
performance, especially when training data is limited. Nonetheless, there is
little understanding of to what extent domain knowledge can affect a machine
learning task from a quantitative perspective. To increase the transparency and
rigorously explain the role of domain knowledge in machine learning, we study
the problem of quantifying the values of domain knowledge in terms of its
contribution to the learning performance in the context of informed machine
learning. We propose a quantification method based on Shapley value that fairly
attributes the overall learning performance improvement to different domain
knowledge. We also present Monte-Carlo sampling to approximate the fair value
of domain knowledge with a polynomial time complexity. We run experiments of
injecting symbolic domain knowledge into semi-supervised learning tasks on both
MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, providing quantitative values of different symbolic
knowledge and rigorously explaining how it affects the machine learning
performance in terms of test accuracy.

studies, how atomic nuclei embedded in the plasma environment are affected by

effects on the change of nuclear energy levels are probed through computations
performed within the nuclear shell-model framework. For this purpose, the
single-particle energy (spe) values to be used in the calculations are obtained
by considering the modified Woods-Saxon (WS) potential due to shielding effect

it is confirmed that the spe's change within certain limit value ranges. When
considering the nuclear shell-model for the related computing, it is clear that
this change leads to an obvious shifting in the energies of the nuclear states.
It is observed that proton spe values are sensitive to plasma shielding effect,
and shielding effect has a significant potent on the ground-state and excited
energy states of the nucleus. In particular, the ground-state binding energies
are determined to be extremely sensitive to the plasma shielding parameters.
Plasma environments affect the proton spe and ground state energy (gse) in the

since it's hard for many of us to sing like a professional singer. In this
paper, we propose an approach -- Learn2Sing that only needs a singing teacher
to generate the target speakers' singing voice without their singing voice
data. In our approach, a teacher's singing corpus and speech from multiple
target speakers are trained in a frame-level auto-regressive acoustic model
where singing and speaking share the common speaker embedding and style tag
embedding. Meanwhile, since there is no music-related transcription for the
target speaker, we use log-scale fundamental frequency (LF0) as an auxiliary
feature as the inputs of the acoustic model for building a unified input
representation. In order to enable the target speaker to sing without singing
reference audio in the inference stage, a duration model and an LF0 prediction
model are also trained. Particularly, we employ domain adversarial training
(DAT) in the acoustic model, which aims to enhance the singing performance of
target speakers by disentangling style from acoustic features of singing and

modeling ability through extra text data, such as shallow fusion with an

fact that Mandarin Chinese is a character-based language and each character is
pronounced as a tonal syllable, this paper proposes a novel cascade RNN-T
approach to improve the language modeling ability of RNN-T. Our approach
firstly uses an RNN-T to transform acoustic feature into syllable sequence, and
then converts the syllable sequence into character sequence through an
RNN-T-based syllable-to-character converter. Thus a rich text repository can be
easily used to strengthen the language model ability. By introducing several
important tricks, the cascade RNN-T approach surpasses the character-based
RNN-T by a large margin on several Mandarin test sets, with much higher

where there is a small density of $\downarrow$ impurities attractively
interacting with a sea of $\uparrow$ fermions. In the single-impurity limit at
zero temperature, there exists the so-called polaron-molecule transition, where
the impurity sharply changes its character by binding a $\uparrow$ fermion at
sufficiently strong attraction. Using a recently developed variational
approach, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the impurity, and we
show that the transition becomes a smooth crossover at finite temperature due
to the thermal occupation of excited states in the impurity spectral function.
However, remnants of the single-impurity transition are apparent in the
momentum-resolved spectral function, which can in principle be probed with
Raman spectroscopy. We furthermore show that the Tan contact exhibits a
characteristic non-monotonic dependence on temperature that provides a
signature of the zero-temperature polaron-molecule transition. For a finite
impurity density, we argue that descriptions purely based on the behavior of
the Fermi polaron are invalid near the polaron-molecule transition, since
correlations between impurities cannot be ignored. In particular, we show that
the spin-imbalanced system undergoes phase separation at low temperatures due
to the strong attraction between $\uparrow\downarrow$ molecules induced by the
Fermi sea. Thus, we find that the impurity spectrum and the induced
impurity-impurity interactions are key to understanding the phase diagram of
the spin-imbalanced Fermi gas.

understand the stability, evolution, and final outcome of the simulated

be divided into two main groups depending on their behavior. Particles smaller
than a centimeter are quickly removed from the system by solar radiation
pressure, while the dynamics of particles larger than a few centimeters is
dominated by the gravitational field of Bennu. Because of its shape and spin
period, Bennu has eight equilibrium points around it. The structure of the
phase space near its equatorial surface is directly connected to these
equilibrium points. Therefore, we performed numerical simulations to obtain
information about the orbital evolution near the equilibrium points. The
results show that most of the particles larger than a few centimeters fall in
the equatorial region close to the Kingfisher area or close to the region
diametrically opposite to it. In contrast, almost none of these particles fall
in the equatorial region close to the Osprey area. In addition, we also
performed computational experiments considering a spherical cloud of particles
initially orbiting Bennu. Most of the particles in prograde orbits fall on the
surface within our integration period, which was limited to 1.14 years. The
particles preferentially fall near high-altitude regions at low equatorial
latitudes and close to the north pole. The mid-latitudes are those more
depleted of falls, as in the Nightingale and Sandpiper areas.

s-Transformer with the standard Transformer, on short sentences, both achieve
the same MOS scores of 4.29, which is very close to 4.32 by the recordings;
similar scores of 4.22 vs 4.2 on long sentences, and significantly better for
extra-long sentences with a gain of 0.2 in MOS. Since the cached memory is
updated with time, the s-Transformer generates rather natural and coherent
speech for a long period of time.

inconvenient and scarcely available. Recent research has demonstrated the

thermography, to gather respiratory signals from the face and monitor
breathing. However, the current non-contact respiratory monitoring techniques
have poor accuracy because they are sensitive to environmental influences like
lighting and motion artifacts. Furthermore, frequent contact between users and

transmission latency. To reduce data transmission and network latency, our
three-tier architecture layer-by-layer decomposes the computing tasks of
respiration monitoring. Moreover, we improved the accuracy of respiratory
monitoring by designing a target tracking algorithm and an algorithm for
eliminating false peaks to extract high-quality respiratory signals. By
gathering the data and choosing several regions of interest on the face, we
were able to extract the respiration signal and investigate how different

indicate that when the nasal region is used to extract the respiratory signal,
it performs experimentally best. Our approach performs better than rival

(NCG), where we compute the fraction of OOD inputs that are classified with the
same label as their nearest neighbor in the training set. Our motivation stems
from understanding the prediction patterns of adversarially robust networks,
since previous work has identified unexpected consequences of training to be
robust to norm-bounded perturbations. We find that robust networks have
consistently higher NCG accuracy than natural training, even when the OOD data
is much farther away than the robustness radius. This implies that the local
regularization of robust training has a significant impact on the network's
decision regions. We replicate our findings using many datasets, comparing new
and existing training methods. Overall, adversarially robust networks resemble
a nearest neighbor classifier when it comes to OOD data. Code available at

application of conformal field theory to periodically driven systems, the

are classes of periodically driven (1+1)-dimensional CFTs that can be
analytically solved, and that show both heating and non-heating phases, as well
as unusual properties in terms of information scrambling. Hitherto, most
results have focused on the dynamics of such models at stroboscopic times, i.e.

time-evolution at arbitrary real times and derive formulas for the exact

time-averaged velocity fields and the turbulence statistics of turbine wakes.
Specifically, it is found that the temporal average of the wake deflection, the
velocity deficit and the transverse velocity, the Reynolds stresses, and the
wake width defined using the velocity deficit can be properly scaled using the
characteristic length and velocity scales depending on the thrust on the rotor
and yaw angles. The width of the region influenced by the transverse velocity,
the PDF of the instantaneous wake position, and the standard deviation of wake
position and wake width, on the other hand, are scaled well using the rotor
diameter independent of the yaw angles and tip-speed ratios. These results
suggest that the wake of a yawed wind turbine can be decomposed into the
streamwise and transverse components, and the turbine-added turbulence and the
meandering motion of the wake can be decoupled from the wake deflection for the
considered cases.

describes the behaviour of relativistic quantum particles, including
imaginary-mass particles with faster-than-light speeds (e.g., tachyon).
However, experimental searches for such particles remain negative so far.
Fortunately, there are possibilities to investigate the relativistic quantum
effects by quantum simulations using a controllable system. However, these
simulations are mostly explored in closed physical systems that hinders the
demonstration of imaginary-mass particles, whereas the general open framework
would promise more possibilities in quantum simulations. Here, we reveal that
the dynamic behaviors of imaginary-mass particles can be mapped to the transfer
of wave packet in a non-Hermitian silicon optical lattice. We experimentally
demonstrate a super-divergent dynamics of tachyon that travels faster than
massless particles (e.g., photon). Besides, our simulation suggests another
kind of imaginary-mass particles that have rarely been explored, which show
non-divergent behaviors with imaginary energy. It is the first experimental
quantum simulation being able to observe the imaginary-mass particles that have
never been experimentally verified. Our work provides a fully controllable and
extensible platform to investigate relativistic quantum phenomena at a
chip-scale level, which would inspire more insightful explorations in quantum

clusters. In the saturated state of the dynamo, we find a Faraday depth (FD)
dispersion $\sigma_{\rm FD} \approx 100$ rad m$^{-2}$, in agreement with
observed values in the ICM. Remarkably, the FD power spectrum is qualitatively
similar to $M(k)/k$, where $M(k)$ is the magnetic spectrum and $k$ the
wavenumber. However, this similarity is broken at high $k$ when FD is obtained
by applying RM synthesis to polarized emission from the ICM due to poor
resolution and complexities of spectrum in FD space. Unlike the Gaussian
probability distribution function (PDF) obtained for FD, the PDF of the
synchrotron intensity is lognormal. A relatively large $\sigma_{\rm FD}$ in the
ICM gives rise to strong frequency-dependent variations of the pixel-wise mean
and peak polarized intensities at low frequencies ($\lesssim 1.5\,{\rm GHz}$).
The mean fractional polarization $\langle p \rangle$ obtained at the resolution
of the simulations increases from $<0.1$ at 0.5 GHz to its intrinsic value of
$\sim0.3$ at 6 GHz. Beam smoothing significantly affects the polarization
properties below $\lesssim 1.5\,{\rm GHz}$, reducing $\langle p \rangle$ to
$\lesssim 0.01$ at 0.5 GHz. At frequencies $\gtrsim 5\,{\rm GHz}$, polarization
remains largely unaffected, even when recovered using RM synthesis. Thus, our

testing is still in its infancy. The purpose of this work is to overcome its
present limitation to conservative nonlinearities. Our approach relies on the
recently extended periodic motion concept, according to which nonlinear modes
of damped systems are defined as family of periodic motions induced by an
appropriate artificial excitation that compensates the natural dissipation. The
particularly simple experimental implementation with only a single-point,
single-frequency, phase resonant forcing is analyzed in detail. The method
permits the experimental extraction of natural frequencies, modal damping
ratios and deflection shapes (including harmonics), for each mode of interest,
as function of the vibration level. The accuracy, robustness and current
limitations of the method are first demonstrated numerically. The method is
then verified experimentally for a friction-damped system. Moreover, a
self-contained measure for estimating the quality of the extracted modal
properties is investigated. The primary advantages over alternative vibration
testing methods are noise robustness, broad applicability and short measurement
duration. The central limitation of the identified modal quantities is that
they only characterize the system in the regime near isolated resonances.

semantic segmentation either employed simultaneous training of the model in the

our novel Unsupervised BatchNorm Adaptation (UBNA) method, which adapts a given

representations (neither data, nor networks) and which can also be applied in
an online setting or using just a few unlabeled images from the target domain
in a few-shot manner. Specifically, we partially adapt the normalization layer
statistics to the target domain using an exponentially decaying momentum
factor, thereby mixing the statistics from both domains. By evaluation on
standard UDA benchmarks for semantic segmentation we show that this is superior
to a model without adaptation and to baseline approaches using statistics from
the target domain only. Compared to standard UDA approaches we report a
trade-off between performance and usage of source domain representations.

free parameters that may be robustly constrained. We partition the sky into
four large disjoint regions (High Latitude; Galactic Spur; Galactic Plane; and
Galactic Center), each associated with its own power-law index. We find that
the High Latitude region is prior-dominated, while the Galactic Center region
is contaminated by residual instrumental systematics. The two remaining regions
appear to be signal-dominated, and for these we derive spectral indices of
$\beta_{\mathrm s}^{\mathrm{Spur}}=-3.17\pm0.06$ and $\beta_{\mathrm

knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes based on the class description.
Despite showing promising performance, ZSL approaches assume that the training
samples from all seen classes are available during the training, which is
practically not feasible. To address this issue, we propose a more generalized
and practical setup for ZSL, i.e., continual ZSL (CZSL), where classes arrive
sequentially in the form of a task and it actively learns from the changing
environment by leveraging the past experience. Further, to enhance the
reliability, we develop CZSL for a single head continual learning setting where
task identity is revealed during the training process but not during the
testing. To avoid catastrophic forgetting and intransigence, we use knowledge
distillation and storing and replay the few samples from previous tasks using a
small episodic memory. We develop baselines and evaluate generalized CZSL on
five ZSL benchmark datasets for two different settings of continual learning:
with and without class incremental. Moreover, CZSL is developed for two types
of variational autoencoders, which generates two types of features for
classification: (i) generated features at output space and (ii) generated
discriminative features at the latent space. The experimental results clearly
indicate the single head CZSL is more generalizable and suitable for practical
applications.

Taking inspiration from diagnostic laparoscopy, used in the past for hepatic

a specific region of the organ where the Glisson's capsule is visible. In
ultrasound images, the Glisson's capsule appears in the shape of a line which

a great informative potential relies on smoothness of the Glisson's capsule
surface. To this purpose, several classifiers are taken into consideration,
which deal with different type of data, namely ultrasound images, binary images
depicting the Glisson's line, and features vector extracted from the original

for manual annotation, there is currently a large performance gap between
methods trained on real and synthetic data. This paper introduces a new method,
which bridges this gap.
  Most methods trained on synthetic data use 2D images, as domain randomization
in 2D is more developed. To obtain precise poses, many of these methods perform
a final refinement using 3D data. Our method integrates the 3D data into the
network to increase the accuracy of the pose estimation. To allow for domain
randomization in 3D, a sensor-based data augmentation has been developed.
Additionally, we introduce the SparseEdge feature, which uses a wider search
space during point cloud propagation to avoid relying on specific features
without increasing run-time.
  Experiments on three large pose estimation benchmarks show that the presented
method outperforms previous methods trained on synthetic data and achieves
comparable results to existing methods trained on real data.

well-known for producing state-of-the-art results under challenging day-night

handcrafted heuristics for sequential matching - which are applied on top of a
pre-computed pairwise similarity matrix between reference and query image

to single-frame retrieval methods. As a result, performing multi-frame place

evaluation on large datasets, and fail when using relatively short parameter

DeepSeqSLAM: a trainable CNN+RNN architecture for jointly learning visual and
positional representations from a single monocular image sequence of a route.
We demonstrate our approach on two large benchmark datasets, Nordland and

intergalactic-medium(IGM), foreground and host halos, using cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation. We find that the median DM caused by foreground
halos is around 30\% of that caused by the IGM, but has a much larger variance.
The DM induced by hosts deviates from a log-normal distribution, but exhibits
an extended distribution in the range of $1-3000 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$ with a
median value $\sim 100 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$. Then we produce mock FRB
sources, assuming a uniform distribution in the range $z\sim 0-0.82$, to
consider the propagation effect of IGM, foreground and host halos on FRB
signals simultaneously. The DM distribution of mock sources agrees well with
the observation. The fitted DM-redshift relation of the mock sources can
provide a rough estimation of the redshifts of observed events with errors
$\delta z \lesssim 0.15$. The distribution of mock sources in the DM-scattering
time($\tau$) space can also match the observation, assuming a Kolmogorov
turbulence model with the inner and outer scale is 1000 km to 1 AU, and 0.2-10
pc respectively. Finally, we estimate the relative importance of these medium
on DM and $\tau$ in our models. The IGM and host halos are the primary and
secondary sources to the extragalactic DM, $\rm{DM_{exg}}$. Meanwhile, the
contribution from foreground halos increases as $\rm{DM_{exg}}$ increases. The
host and foreground halos may be the most important medium for scattering.
Statistically, the latter may dominate the scattering of events with
$\rm{DM_{exg}} \gtrsim 200 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$.

methodologies are used to identify data-driven models. The first methodology
focuses on identifying the system using steady-state excitations. To accomplish
this, a phase-locked loop controller is implemented to acquire periodic
oscillations near resonance and construct a nonlinear-mode model. This model is
based on amplitude-dependent modal properties, i.e. does not require nonlinear
basis functions. The second methodology exploits uncontrolled experiments with
broadband random inputs to build polynomial nonlinear state-space models using
advanced system identification tools. The methods are applied to two
experimental test rigs, a magnetic cantilever beam and a free-free beam with a
lap joint. The respective models of both methods and both specimens are then
challenged to predict dynamic, near-resonant behavior observed under different
sine and sine-sweep excitations. The vibration prediction of the nonlinear-mode
and state-space models clearly highlight the capabilities and limitations of
the models. The nonlinear-mode model, by design, yields a perfect match at
resonance peaks and high accuracy in close vicinity. However, it is limited to
well-spaced modes and sinusoidal excitation. The state-space model covers a
wider dynamic range, including transient excitations. However, the real-life
nonlinearities considered in this study can only be approximated by polynomial
basis functions. Consequently, the identified state-space models are found to
be highly input-dependent, in particular for sinusoidal excitations where they
are found to lead to a low predictive capability.

gained popularity thanks to the recent breakthroughs powered by deep learning.
Most approaches regress the full object shape in a canonical pose, possibly
extrapolating the occluded parts based on the learned priors. However, their
viewpoint invariant technique often discards the unique structures visible from
the input images. In contrast, this paper proposes to rely on viewpoint variant
reconstructions by merging the visible information from the given views. Our
approach is divided into three steps. Starting from the sparse views of the
object, we first align them into a common coordinate system by estimating the
relative pose between all the pairs. Then, inspired by the traditional voxel
carving, we generate an occupancy grid of the object taken from the silhouette
on the images and their relative poses. Finally, we refine the initial
reconstruction to build a clean 3D model which preserves the details from each
viewpoint. To validate the proposed method, we perform a comprehensive
evaluation on the ShapeNet reference benchmark in terms of relative pose
estimation and 3D shape reconstruction.

Geolocation identification using smart devices has paved the path for
incentive-based location-based services (LBS). A location proof is a digital
certificate of the geographical location of a user, which can be used to access
various LBS. However, a user full control over a device allows the tampering of
location proof. Initially, to resist false proofs, two-party trusted
centralized location proof systems (LPS) were introduced to aid the users in
generating secure location proofs mutually. However, two-party protocols
suffered from the collusion attacks by the participants of the protocol.
Consequently, many witness-oriented LPS have emerged to mitigate collusion
attacks in two-party protocols. However, witness-oriented LPS presented the
possibility of three-way collusion attacks (involving the user, location
authority, and the witness). The three-way collusion attacks are inevitable in
all existing witness-oriented schemes. To mitigate the inability to resist
three-way collusion of existing schemes, in this paper, we introduce a
decentralized consensus protocol called as MobChain, where the selection of a
witness and location authority is achieved through a distributed consensus of
nodes in an underlying P2P network of a private blockchain. The persistent
provenance data over the blockchain provides strong security guarantees, as a
result, the forging and manipulation become impractical. MobChain provides
secure location provenance architecture, relying on decentralized decision
making for the selection of participants of the protocol to resist three-way
collusion problem. Our prototype implementation and comparison with the
state-of-the-art solutions show that MobChain is computationally efficient,

framework called Bayesian optimization-IRL (BO-IRL) which identifies multiple

Optimization along with our newly proposed kernel that (a) projects the

functions yielding similar likelihoods. This projection allows the use of
standard stationary kernels in the latent space to capture the correlations
present across the reward function space. Empirical results on synthetic and
real-world environments (model-free and model-based) show that BO-IRL discovers
multiple reward functions while minimizing the number of expensive exact policy
optimizations.

typically amortized, resulting in relatively inaccurate posterior approximation
compared to instance-wise variational optimization. Recent semi-amortized
approaches were proposed to address this drawback; however, their iterative
gradient update procedures can be computationally demanding. To address these
issues, in this paper we introduce an accurate amortized inference algorithm.
We propose a novel recursive mixture estimation algorithm for VAEs that
iteratively augments the current mixture with new components so as to maximally
reduce the divergence between the variational and the true posteriors. Using
the functional gradient approach, we devise an intuitive learning criteria for
selecting a new mixture component: the new component has to improve the data
likelihood (lower bound) and, at the same time, be as divergent from the
current mixture distribution as possible, thus increasing representational
diversity. Compared to recently proposed boosted variational inference (BVI),
our method relies on amortized inference in contrast to BVI's non-amortized
single optimization instance. A crucial benefit of our approach is that the
inference at test time requires a single feed-forward pass through the mixture
inference network, making it significantly faster than the semi-amortized
approaches. We show that our approach yields higher test data likelihood than
the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.

problem of training effective NN models on constrained devices having a fixed,

compression. Our Dynamic Hard Pruning (DynHP) technique incrementally prunes
the network during training, identifying neurons that marginally contribute to
the model accuracy. DynHP enables a tunable size reduction of the final neural
network and reduces the NN memory occupancy during training. Freed memory is
reused by a \emph{dynamic batch sizing} approach to counterbalance the accuracy
degradation caused by the hard pruning strategy, improving its convergence and
effectiveness. We assess the performance of DynHP through reproducible
experiments on three public datasets, comparing them against reference

temperature of 77.4 K and argon 87.3 K, at a pore of 3.6 nm, and the
performance of optimization algorithms was compared. We also introduce the
Hybrid Density Functional Theory (H-DFT) approach based on stochastic
optimization methods and the classical Picard iteration method to find the
equilibrium fluid density starting from the physically appropriate solution.
The combination of Picard iteration and stochastic algorithms helps to
significantly speed up the calculations of equilibrium density in the system
without losing the quality of the solution, especially in cases with the high
relative pressure and expressed layering structure.

w.r.t. a probability map $\mu$ if, for every finite string $w$, the limiting
frequency of $w$ in $\alpha$ exists and equals $\mu(w)$. %We raise the question
of how to characterize the probability maps $\mu$ for which
$\mu$-distributedness is preserved across finite-state selection, or
equivalently, by selection by programs using constant space. We prove the
following result for any finite or countably infinite alphabet $\Sigma$: every
finite-state selector over $\Sigma$ selects a $\mu$-distributed sequence from
every $\mu$-distributed sequence \emph{if and only if} $\mu$ is induced by a
Bernoulli distribution on $\Sigma$, that is a probability distribution on the
alphabet extended to words by taking the product. The primary -- and remarkable
-- consequence of our main result is a complete characterization of the set of
probability maps, on finite and infinite alphabets, for which finite-state
selection preserves $\mu$-distributedness. The main positive takeaway is that
(the appropriate generalization of) Agafonov's Theorem holds for Bernoulli
distributions (rather than just equidistributions) on both finite and countably

Yet, microscale insights into confined LCLCs, specifically in the context of

emergence of time dependent textures in static disodium chromoglycate (DSCG)

conditions and the initial DSCG concentration, we can systematically tune the
temporal dynamics of the N to M-phase transition and textural behaviour of the

suggest that the local surface-mediated dynamics could be central in
understanding LCLC flows, and in turn, the associated transport properties of

four weighting schemes based on some geometric shapes for digital image

the circle (AC). At the smaller scaling ratio, the image interpolation

highest at 66.6 % among non traditional algorithms presented and, here, its

steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) whose spectrum is dominated by
the harmonics of the target frequency. In this setting, we address the target
identification and propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture.
Method: The proposed DNN processes the multi-channel SSVEP with convolutions
across the sub-bands of harmonics, channels, time, and classifies at the fully
connected layer. We test with two publicly available large scale (the benchmark
and BETA) datasets consisting of in total 105 subjects with 40 characters. Our
first stage training learns a global model by exploiting the statistical
commonalities among all subjects, and the second stage fine tunes to each
subject separately by exploiting the individualities. Results: Our DNN achieves
impressive information transfer rates (ITRs) on both datasets, 265.23 bits/min

rates are the highest ever reported performance results on these datasets.
Significance: Due to its unprecedentedly high speller ITRs and flawless
applicability to general SSVEP systems, our technique has great potential in
various biomedical engineering settings of BCIs such as communication,

ultraviolet/optical range, with time delays increasing at longer wavelengths.
Thermal reprocessing of the X-rays illuminating the accretion disk has been
proposed as a viable explanation. In this scenario, the variable X-ray flux
irradiating the accretion disk is partially reflected in X-rays, and partially
absorbed, thermalized and re-emitted with some delay by the accretion disk at
longer wavelengths. We investigate this scenario assuming an X-ray point-like
source illuminating a standard Novikov-Thorne accretion disk, around a rotating
black hole. We consider all special and general relativistic effects to
determine the incident X-ray flux on the disk and in propagating light from the
source to the disk and to the observer. We also compute the disk reflection
flux taking into consideration the disk ionization. We investigate the
dependence of the disk response function and time lags on various physical
parameters, such as black hole mass and spin, X-ray corona height, luminosity,
and photon index, accretion rate, inclination, and inner/outer disk radii. We
found it is important to consider relativistic effects and the disk ionization
in estimating the disk response. We also found a strong non-linearity between
the X-ray luminosity and the disk response. We present an analytic function for
the time-lags dependence on wavelength, which can be used to fit observed
time-lag spectra. We also estimate the fraction of the reverberation signal
with respect to the total flux and we suggest possible explanation for the lack
of X-ray-ultraviolet/optical correlated variations in a few sources.

is not as simple in engineering and sciences as it is in social and economic
fields. Scientific problems suffer most times from paucity of data, while they
may involve a large number of variables and parameters that interact in complex
and non-stationary ways, obeying certain physical laws. Moreover, a
physically-based model is not only useful for making predictions, but to gain
knowledge by the interpretation of its structure, parameters, and mathematical
properties. The solution to these shortcomings seems to be the seamless
blending of the tremendous predictive power of the data-driven approach with
the scientific consistency and interpretability of physically-based models. We
use here the concept of physically-constrained neural networks (PCNN) to
predict the input-output relation in a physical system, while, at the same time
fulfilling the physical constraints. With this goal, the internal hidden state
variables of the system are associated with a set of internal neuron layers,
whose values are constrained by known physical relations, as well as any
additional knowledge on the system. Furthermore, when having enough data, it is
possible to infer knowledge about the internal structure of the system and, if
parameterized, to predict the state parameters for a particular input-output
relation. We show that this approach, besides getting physically-based
predictions, accelerates the training process, reduces the amount of data
required to get similar accuracy, filters partly the intrinsic noise in the
experimental data and provides improved extrapolation capacity.

vacuum gauges can be affected by the change of secondary electron emission
properties of ion collectors during the operation, the corresponding electron
yield induced by bombardment of low energy Ar+ ions was measured. Results show
that exposure to ionisation vacuum gauge environment contributes to development

different pore diameter distributions and average diameters ranging from 10 to
300 $\mu$m. In these materials, the drying may lead either to a collapsed state
with low porosity or to the cavitation and reopening of a fraction of the
pores. Using optical microscopy and porosity measurements, we showed the
importance of the pore diameters and interactions on the result of drying. At
pore diameters lower than 30 $\mu$m, the majority of pores remain collapsed. We
attribute the permanence of the collapse of most small pores to a low
probability of cavitation and to the adhesion of the pore walls. Pores with
diameters larger than 100 $\mu$m tend to reopen after the water they contain
cavitates. The behavior of pores with diameters ranging from 30 to 100 $\mu$m
depends on the porosity and drying temperature. We also visualize collective
cavitation upon drying of sponges initially saturated with a sodium chloride
solution. In this case, the cavitation in the largest pores leads to reopening
of small pores in a neighboring zone of the sample. To our knowledge, our
results present the first experimental proof of the pore-size-dependent and
cooperative nature of the response of soft sponges with closed porosity to
drying.

shallow water moment equations. Shallow water moment equations describe shallow
flows for complex velocity profiles which vary in vertical direction and the
models can be seen as extensions of the standard shallow water equations.
Equilibrium stability is an important property of balance laws that determines
the linear stability of solutions in the vicinity of equilibrium manifolds and
it is seen as a necessary condition for stable numerical solutions. After an
analysis of the hyperbolic structure of the models, we identify three different
stability manifolds based on three different limits of the right-hand side
friction term, which physically correspond to water-at-rest, constant-velocity,
and bottom-at-rest velocity profiles. The stability analysis then shows that
the structural stability conditions are fulfilled for the water-at-rest
equilibrium and the constant-velocity equilibrium. However, the bottom-at-rest
equilibrium can lead to instable modes depending on the velocity profile.
Relaxation towards the respective equilibrium manifolds is investigated
numerically for different models.

invariance are imposed in the decomposition; however, the time-reversal
invariance is not used due to an active role of gauge links in the TMDs.
Therefore, there exist time-reversal-odd functions in addition to the
time-reversal even ones in the TMDs. We list all the functions up to twist-4
level because there were missing terms associated with the lightcone vector $n$
in previous works on the twist-2 part and there was no correlation-function

the new terms with $n$, and we find 30 new structure functions in twists 3 and

function should vanish after integrals over the partonic transverse momentum,
we obtain new sum rules for the time-reversal-odd structure functions, $ \int

to dense clouds due to increased local gas density. However, the question of
whether dust properties change with redshift remains elusive. In this paper,
using the fact that the mean radiation intensity of the interstellar medium
(ISM) of star-forming galaxies increases with redshift, we show that dust
properties should change due to increasing efficiency of rotational disruption
by radiative torques, an effect named RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD). We
first show that, due to RATD, the size distribution of interstellar dust varies
with redshift, such as dust grains become smaller at higher $z$. We model the
extinction curves and find that the curve becomes steeper with increasing
redshift. The ratio of total-to-selective extinction, $R_{V}$, decreases with
redshift and achieves low values of $R_{V}\sim 1.5-2.5$ for grains having a
composite structure. We also find that dust properties change with the local
gas density due to RATD, but the change is dominated by the radiation field for
the diffuse ISM. The low values of $R_{V}$ implied by RATD of interstellar dust
could reproduce anomalous dust extinction observed toward type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)-like extinction curves with a steep
far-UV rise toward high-z galaxies. Fluctuations in $R_{V}$ due to interstellar
turbulence and varying radiation intensity may resolve the tension in
measurements of the Hubble constant using SNe Ia. We finally discuss the
implications of evolving dust properties for high-z astrophysics.

the non-local magnetoresistance vanishes rapidly at a similar temperature as
the spin Hall magnetoresistance. We attribute the reduced $\alpha$ at high
temperatures to the increasing thermal magnon population which leads to
enhanced scattering of the non-equilibrium magnon population and a reduced
magnon diffusion length. Finally, we find a magnetic field independent offset
voltage in the non-local signal for $T > 470\,\mathrm{K}$ which we associate
with electronic leakage currents through the normally insulating yttrium iron
garnet film. Indeed, this non-local offset voltage is thermally activated with
an energy close to the band gap.

is based on the compactness method, which involves linearization of the
operator at each approximation step. Due to the nonlinearity of the equations,
the linearized operators involve the Hessian of correctors, which appear in the
previous step. The involvement of the Hessian of the correctors deteriorates
the regularity of the linearized operator, and sometimes even changes its
oscillating pattern. These issues are resolved with new approximation
techniques, which yield a precise decomposition of the regular part and the
irregular part of the homogenization process, along with a uniform control of
the Hessian of the correctors in an intermediate level. The approximation
techniques are even new in the context of linear equations. Our argument can be
applied not only to concave operators, but also to certain class of non-concave
operators.

significant in the rankings of universities. We propose methods measuring the
statistical significance among different universities and illustrate the
results by empirical data. Design/methodology/approach: Based on z-testing and
overlapping confidence intervals, and using data about 205 Chinese universities
included in the Leiden Rankings 2020, we argue that three main groups of
Chinese research universities can be distinguished.
  Findings: When the sample of 205 Chinese universities is merged with the 197
US universities included in Leiden Rankings 2020, the results similarly
indicate three main groups: high, middle, low. Using this data (Leiden Rankings
and Web-of-Science), the z-scores of the Chinese universities are significantly
below those of the US universities albeit with some overlap.
  Research limitations: We show empirically that differences in ranking may be
due to changes in the data, the models, or the modeling effects on the data.
The scientometric groupings are not always stable when we use different
methods.
  R&D policy implications: Differences among universities can be tested for
their statistical significance. The statistics relativize the values of
decimals in the rankings. One can operate with a scheme of low/middle/high in
policy debates and leave the more fine-grained rankings of individual
universities to operational management and local settings.
  Originality/value: In the discussion about the rankings of universities, the
question of whether differences are statistically significant, is, in our
opinion, insufficiently addressed.

for improving Bayesian estimation-based uncertainty inference (UI) in deep

classifier of a DNN, i.e., the last fully-connected (FC) layer, with a mixture
of Gaussian mixture models (MoGMM) to obtain an MoGMM-FC layer. Unlike existing
UI methods for DNNs, which only calculate the means or modes of the DNN
outputs' distributions, the proposed MoGMM-FC layer acts as a probabilistic
interpreter for the features that are inputs of the classifier to directly
calculate the probability density of them for the DS-UI. In addition, we
propose a dual-supervised stochastic gradient-based variational Bayes (DS-SGVB)
algorithm for the MoGMM-FC layer optimization. Unlike conventional SGVB and
optimization algorithms in other UI methods, the DS-SGVB not only models the
samples in the specific class for each Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the
MoGMM, but also considers the negative samples from other classes for the GMM
to reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the inter-class margins
simultaneously for enhancing the learning ability of the MoGMM-FC layer in the

using packet trace data from a large IoT test-bed, showing that all models need
to be updated over time to avoid significant degradation in accuracy. In order

different altitudes, currently represent one the most attractive technological
options to solve coverage and latency constraints associated with the NTN
paradigm. However, there are still several issues to be resolved for proper
network design. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different
multi-layered non-terrestrial configurations, and provide guidelines on the
optimal working point(s) for which it is possible to achieve a good compromise
between improved system flexibility and network performance, with respect to a
baseline standalone deployment.

approach, which can convert an arbitrary source speaker's voice to a target
speaker with non-native accent. This problem is challenging as each target
speaker only has training data in native accent and we need to disentangle
accent and speaker information in the conversion model training and re-combine
them in the conversion stage. In our recognition-synthesis conversion
framework, we manage to solve this problem by two proposed tricks. First, we
use accent-dependent speech recognizers to obtain bottleneck features for
different accented speakers. This aims to wipe out other factors beyond the
linguistic information in the BN features for conversion model training.
Second, we propose to use adversarial training to better disentangle the
speaker and accent information in our encoder-decoder based conversion model.
Specifically, we plug an auxiliary speaker classifier to the encoder, trained
with an adversarial loss to wipe out speaker information from the encoder
output. Experiments show that our approach is superior to the baseline. The
proposed tricks are quite effective in improving accentedness and audio quality
and speaker similarity are well maintained.

effectively switched by a linear down-chirp microwave field pulse (DCMWP) in
zero temperature limit. However, finite temperature is ubiquitous in practice.
Here, we study the effect of finite temperature on the DCMWP-induced
magnetization reversal based on the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation. It is found that any one of the three controlling parameters of a
DCMWP, i.e. the amplitude, chirp rate, or initial frequency, decreases with
increasing temperature while the other two are fixed. The maximal temperature
at which the reversal can happen increases with enlarging the system size.
These phenomena are related to the facts that the energy barrier induced by
anisotropy increases with the system volume, and the effective magnetization
decreases with temperature. We also provide a set of optimal parameters for
practical realization of our proposal. These findings may provide a way to
realize low-cost and fast magnetization reversal with a wide operating
temperature.

this by restricting the allowable covers in the definition of Hausdorff
dimension, but in a wider variety of ways than in the definition of the
intermediate dimensions. We also extend the theory from Euclidean space to a
wider class of metric spaces. We investigate relationships between the
$\Phi$-intermediate dimensions and other notions of dimension, and study many

a sharp general lower bound for the intermediate dimensions that is positive

semi-supervised learning methods: (1) with the presence of in-domain
pretraining LM on U, open-domain LM pretraining is unnecessary; (2) both the
in-domain pretraining strategy and the pseudo-label based strategy introduce
significant performance boosts, with the former performing better with larger

small, while joint training on the combination of pseudo labels D' and the
original dataset D yields better performances when D is large. Using
semi-supervised learning strategies, we are able to achieve a performance of

estimation methods, recovering temporally consistent and smooth 3D human motion
from a video is still challenging. Several video-based methods have been
proposed; however, they fail to resolve the single image-based methods'
temporal inconsistency issue due to a strong dependency on a static feature of
the current frame. In this regard, we present a temporally consistent mesh
recovery system (TCMR). It effectively focuses on the past and future frames'
temporal information without being dominated by the current static feature. Our
TCMR significantly outperforms previous video-based methods in temporal
consistency with better per-frame 3D pose and shape accuracy. We also release
the codes. For the demo video, see https://youtu.be/WB3nTnSQDII. For the codes,

explained as a reflection structure of charmed-strange meson
$D_{s2}^{*}(2573)$, which is produced from the open-charm decay of $Y(4660)$
with a $D_s^*$ meson. Furthermore, we predicted the angular distribution of

undergoing extreme-UV photoevaporation in order to better characterise the dust
properties in thermal winds (e.g. size distribution, flux rate, trajectories).
Our semi-analytic approach allows us to rapidly calculate these dust properties
without resorting to expensive hydrodynamic simulations. We find that
photoevaporation creates a vertical gas flow within the disc that assists
turbulence in supplying dust to the ionisation front. We examine both the
delivery of dust to the ionisation front and its subsequent entrainment in the
overlying wind. We derive a simple analytic criterion for the maximum grain
size that can be entrained and show that this is in good agreement with the
results of previous simulations where photoevaporation is driven by a range of
radiation types. We show that, in contrast to the case for magnetically driven
winds, we do not expect large scale dust transport within the disc to be
effected by photoevaporation. We also show that the maximum size of grains that
can be entrained in the wind ($s_{\rm max}$) is around an order of magnitude
larger than the maximum size of grains that can be delivered to the front by
advection alone ($s_{\rm crit} \lesssim 1$ $\mu{\rm m}$ for Herbig Ae/Be stars
and $\lesssim 0.01$ $\mu{\rm m}$ for T Tauri stars). We further investigate how
larger grains, up to a limiting size $s_{\rm limit}$, can be delivered to the
front by turbulent diffusion alone. In all cases, we find $s_{\rm max} \gtrsim

can be entrained in the wind and that most entrained dust follows trajectories
close to that of the gas.

February and the end of October showed a similar course of the reproductive
rate compared to the nationwide figures. Expectably larger statistical
fluctuations were observed in the summer, mainly due to lower case numbers. The

separating regions of hexagons with different orientations. These states arise
from local orientation mismatch between two stable hexagon patterns, one of
which forms the localised grain and the other its background, and do not

Maxwell point, underlining the importance of retaining pinning when analysing
patterns with defects, an effect omitted from the amplitude-phase description.

also by an external influential entity referred to as a marketer. The
influential entity tries to sway the overall opinion as close as possible to a
desired opinion by using a specific influence budget. We assume that the
exogenous influences of the entity happen during discrete-time advertising
campaigns; consequently, the overall closed-loop opinion dynamics becomes a
linear-impulsive (hybrid) one. The main technical issue addressed is finding
how the marketer should allocate its budget over time (through marketing
campaigns) and over space (among the agents) such that the agents' opinion be
as close as possible to the desired opinion. Our main results show that the
marketer has to prioritize certain agents over others based on their initial
condition, their influence power in the social graph and the size of the
cluster they belong to. The corresponding space-time allocation problem is
formulated and solved for several special cases of practical interest. Valuable
insights can be extracted from our analysis. For instance, for most cases, we
prove that the marketer has an interest in investing most of its budget at the
beginning of the process and that budget should be shared among agents

amplitudes of closed strings at one-loop level (i.e. at genus one) in a
ten-dimensional Minkowski background using a special class of functions called
modular graph forms. These allow for a systematic evaluation of the low-energy
expansion and satisfy many non-trivial algebraic and differential relations. We
study these relations in detail, leading to basis decompositions for a large
number of modular graph forms which greatly reduce the complexity of the
expansions of the integrals appearing in the amplitude. One of the results of
this thesis is a Mathematica package which automatizes these simplifications.
We use these techniques to compute the leading low-energy orders of the
scattering amplitude of four gluons in the heterotic string at one-loop level.
  Furthermore, we study a generating function which conjecturally contains the
torus integrals of all perturbative closed-string theories. We write this
generating function in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein
series and use this approach to arrive at a more rigorous characterization of
the space of modular graph forms than was possible before.
  For tree-level string amplitudes, the single-valued map of multiple zeta
values maps open-string amplitudes to closed-string amplitudes. The definition
of a suitable one-loop generalization, a so-called elliptic single-valued map,
is an active area of research and we provide a new perspective on this topic
using our generating function of torus integrals.

achieve the same security level with shorter parameters by using trace

exploration policy using either the weighted variance of return sequences or
the weighted temporal difference (TD) error. We demonstrate that the variance
of the return sequence for a specific state-action pair is an important
information source that can be leveraged to guide exploration in reinforcement
learning. The intuition is that fluctuation in the return sequence indicates
greater uncertainty in the near future returns. This divergence occurs because
of the cyclic nature of value-based reinforcement learning; the evolving value
function begets policy improvements which in turn modify the value function.
Although both variance and TD errors capture different aspects of this
uncertainty, our analysis shows that both can be valuable to guide exploration.
We propose a two-stream network architecture to estimate weighted variance/TD

organic refractory materials in the solar system, in cometary nuclei and on the
surface of centaurs, Kuiper-belt and trans-neptunian objects. In these
astrophysical environments, organic materials can be formed because of the
interaction of frozen volatile compounds with cosmic rays, stellar/solar
particles, and favoured by thermal processing. The analysis of laboratory
analogues of such materials gives information on their properties,
complementary to observations. Aims. We present new experiments to contribute
in the understanding of the chemical composition of organic refractory
materials in space. Methods. We bombard frozen water, methanol and ammonia
mixtures with 40 keV H$^+$ and we warm the by-products up to 300~K. The
experiments allow the production of organic residues that we analyse by means
of infrared spectroscopy and by Very High Resolution Mass Spectrometry to study
their chemical composition and their high molecular diversity, including the
presence of hexamethylenetetramine and its derivatives. Results. We find that
the accumulated irradiation dose plays a role in determining the residue's
composition. Conslusions. Based on the laboratory doses, we estimate the
astrophysical timescales to be short enough to induce an efficient formation of

  Limiting the Critic's Hypothesis Space to RKHS",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mutual information (MI) is an information-theoretic measure of dependency
between two random variables. Several methods to estimate MI, from samples of
two random variables with unknown underlying probability distributions have
been proposed in the literature. Recent methods realize parametric probability
distributions or critic as a neural network to approximate unknown density
ratios. The approximated density ratios are used to estimate different
variational lower bounds of MI. While these methods provide reliable estimation
when the true MI is low, they produce high variance estimates in cases of high
MI. We argue that the high variance characteristic is due to the uncontrolled
complexity of the critic's hypothesis space. In support of this argument, we
use the data-driven Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space associated
with the critic's architecture to analyse generalization error bound of
variational lower bound estimates of MI. In the proposed work, we show that it
is possible to negate the high variance characteristics of these estimators by
constraining the critic's hypothesis space to Reproducing Hilbert Kernel Space
(RKHS), which corresponds to a kernel learned using Automated Spectral Kernel
Learning (ASKL). By analysing the aforementioned generalization error bounds,
we augment the overall optimisation objective with effective regularisation

enforcing proper bias variance tradeoff on four variational lower bounds,

double-blackbody model plus a power-law component detectable up to ~25 keV. The
unabsorbed X-ray flux decreased from ~5e-11 to ~2.5e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 one

magnetic field ~5.5e14 G at pole, a spin-down luminosity ~2.4e32 erg s^-1, and
a characteristic age ~24 kyr. The spin modulation pattern appears highly pulsed
in the soft X-ray band, and becomes smoother at higher energies. Several short
X-ray bursts were detected during our campaign. No evidence for periodic or
single-pulse emission was found at radio frequencies in observations performed
with the Sardinia Radio Telescope and Parkes. According to magneto-thermal
evolutionary models, the real age of SGR J1830-0645 is close to the

larger, ~1e15 G.

typically assume some form of sparsity for the regression functions. In this
work, we introduce a debiased inverse propensity score weighting (DIPW) scheme
for average treatment effect estimation that delivers $\sqrt{n}$-consistent
estimates when the propensity score follows a sparse logistic regression model;
the outcome regression functions are permitted to be arbitrarily complex. We
further demonstrate how confidence intervals centred on our estimates may be
constructed. Our theoretical results quantify the price to pay for permitting
the regression functions to be unestimable, which shows up as an inflation of
the variance of the estimator compared to the semiparametric efficient variance
by a constant factor, under mild conditions. We also show that when outcome
regressions can be estimated faster than a slow $1/\sqrt{ \log n}$ rate, our
estimator achieves semiparametric efficiency. As our results accommodate
arbitrary outcome regression functions, averages of transformed responses under
each treatment may also be estimated at the $\sqrt{n}$ rate. Thus, for example,
the variances of the potential outcomes may be estimated. We discuss extensions
to estimating linear projections of the heterogeneous treatment effect function
and explain how propensity score models with more general link functions may be
handled within our framework. An R package \texttt{dipw} implementing our

materials, and most soft biological materials, play an important role in our
daily lives. From a mechanical viewpoint, soft materials can easily achieve
large deformations due to their low elastic moduli; meanwhile, surface
instabilities, including wrinkles, creases, folds, and ridges, among others,
are often observed. In particular, soft dielectrics subject to electrical
stimuli can achieve significantly large deformations that are often accompanied
by instabilities. While instabilities are often thought to cause failures in
the engineering context and carry a negative connotation, they can also be
harnessed for various applications such as surface patterning, giant actuation
strain, and energy harvesting. In the biological world, instability and
bifurcation phenomena often precede important events such as endocytosis, cell

this important field. A multidisciplinary audience may lack the background in
one or more areas that are needed to carry out the requisite modeling or even
understand papers in the literature. Furthermore, combining electrostatics
together with large deformations brings its own challenges. In this article, we
provide a tutorial on the basics of stability and bifurcation analysis in the
context of soft electromechanical materials. The aim of the article is to use
simple examples and ``gently"" lead a reader, unfamiliar with either stability
analysis or electrostatics of deformable media, to develop the ability to
understand the pertinent literature that already exists and position them to
embark on state-of-the-art research on this topic.

  Constraints for B5G Networks","Accepted for publication in IEEE Access, November 2020",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a millimeter wave-NOMA (mmWave-NOMA) system that takes
into account the end-user signal processing capabilities, an important
practical consideration. The implementation of NOMA in the downlink (DL)
direction requires successive interference cancellation (SIC) to be performed
at the user terminals, which comes at the cost of additional complexity. In
NOMA, the weakest user only has to decode its own signal, while the strongest
user has to decode the signals of all other users in the SIC procedure. Hence,
the additional implementation complexity required of the user to perform SIC
for DL NOMA depends on its position in the SIC decoding order. Beyond
fifth-generation (B5G) communication systems are expected to support a wide
variety of end-user devices, each with their own processing capabilities. We
envision a system where users report their SIC decoding capability to the base
station (BS), i.e., the number of other users signals a user is capable of
decoding in the SIC procedure. We investigate the rate maximization problem in
such a system, by breaking it down into a user clustering and ordering problem
(UCOP), followed by a power allocation problem. We propose a NOMA minimum exact
cover (NOMA-MEC) heuristic algorithm that converts the UCOP into a cluster
minimization problem from a derived set of valid cluster combinations after
factoring in the SIC decoding capability. The complexity of NOMA-MEC is
analyzed for various algorithm and system parameters. For a homogeneous system
of users that all have the same decoding capabilities, we show that this
equates to a simple maximum number of users per cluster constraint and propose
a lower complexity NOMA-best beam (NOMA-BB) algorithm. Simulation results
demonstrate the performance superiority in terms of sum rate compared to
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and traditional NOMA

services in social networks can help enterprises to analyze the feedback from
customers and take corresponding actions for improvement. To mitigate
large-scale annotations on the target domain, domain adaptation (DA) provides
an alternate solution by learning a transferable model from other labeled
source domains. Existing multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) methods either
fail to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are
related to sentiment, neglect the correlations of different sources and the
distribution difference among different sub-domains even in the same source, or
cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training stages.
In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level MDA framework, named
curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN), to
address the above issues. Specifically, C-CycleGAN consists of three
components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input from
different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate
domain generator with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the
gap across source and target domains, and (3) task classifier trained on the
intermediate domain for final sentiment classification. C-CycleGAN transfers
source samples at instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer to
the target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing
discriminative features. Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting
mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different source samples in each
training stage. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
and achieve substantial gains over state-of-the-art DA approaches. Our source

To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach based on Tacotron. First,
we plug two emotion classifiers -- one after the reference encoder, one after
the decoder output -- to enhance the emotion-discriminative ability of the
emotion embedding and the predicted mel-spectrum. Second, we adopt style loss
to measure the difference between the generated and reference mel-spectrum. The
emotion strength in the synthetic speech can be controlled by adjusting the
value of the emotion embedding as the emotion embedding can be viewed as the

combined effects of string and $f(R)$ gravity corrections on the inflationary
dynamics of canonical scalar field inflation, imposing the constraint that the
speed of the primordial gravitational waves is equal to that of light's.
Particularly, we study the inflationary dynamics of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity in the presence of $\alpha R^2$ corrections, where $\alpha$ is a free
coupling parameter. As it was the case in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, the realization that the gravitational waves propagate through
spacetime with the velocity of light, imposes the constraint that the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ obeys the differential equation
$\ddot\xi=H\dot\xi$, where $H$ is the Hubble rate. Subsequently, a relation for
the time derivative of the scalar field is extracted which implies that the
scalar functions of the model, which are the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the
scalar potential, are interconnected and simply designating one of them
specifies the other immediately. In this framework, it is useful to freely
designate $\xi(\phi)$ and extract the corresponding scalar potential from the
equations of motion but the opposite is still feasible. We demonstrate that the
model can produce a viable inflationary phenomenology and for a wide range of
the free parameters. Also, a mentionable issue is that when the coupling
parameter $\alpha$ of the $R^2$ correction term is $\alpha<10^{-3}$ in Planck
Units, the $R^2$ term is practically negligible and one obtains the same
equations of motion as in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, however the

theoretically that the exchange interaction between the impurity magnetic

persisting even at zero electron spin polarization. We describe two microscopic
mechanisms behind this effect, namely the exchange interaction assisted
skew-scattering and the conversion of the SHE induced transverse spin current
to the charge one owing to the difference between the spin-up and spin-down
conductivities. We propose an essentially all-electric scheme based on a

Data, doi: 10.17632/mf27c92nc3.1]. This consists of trajectories of single
particles falling through a highly viscous fluid and rebounding off the bottom
fluid tank wall. The resulting flow is in the transitional regime between
creeping and turbulent flows. This type of configuration is particularly
challenging for numerical methods due to the large change of the fluid domain
and the contact between the wall and particle. In the numerical simulations we
consider both rigid body and linear elasticity models for the falling
particles. In the first case, we compare results obtained with the well
established Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) approach and a moving domain
CutFEM method together with a simple and common approach for contact avoidance.
For the full fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem with contact, we use a
fully Eulerian approach in combination with a unified FSI-contact treatment
using Nitsche's method. For higher computational efficiency we use the
geometrical symmetry of the experimental set up to reformulate the FSI system
into two spatial dimensions. Finally, we show full three dimensional ALE
computations to study the effects of small perturbations in the initial state
of the particle to investigate deviations from a perfectly vertical fall
observed in the experiment. The methods are implemented in open-source finite
element libraries and the results are made freely available to aide

for cluster comparison. The adjustment of the $ARI$ is based on a
hypergeometric distribution assumption which is unsatisfying from a modeling
perspective as (i) it is not appropriate when the two clusterings are
dependent, (ii) it forces the size of the clusters, and (iii) it ignores
randomness of the sampling. In this work, we present a new ""modified"" version
of the Rand Index. First, we redefine the $MRI$ by only counting the pairs
consistent by similarity and ignoring the pairs consistent by difference,
increasing the interpretability of the score. Second, we base the adjusted
version, $MARI$, on a multinomial distribution instead of a hypergeometric
distribution. The multinomial model is advantageous as it does not force the
size of the clusters, properly models randomness, and is easily extended to the
dependant case. We show that the $ARI$ is biased under the multinomial model
and that the difference between the $ARI$ and $MARI$ can be large for small $n$
but essentially vanish for large $n$, where $n$ is the number of individuals.
Finally, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute all these quantities
($(A)RI$ and $M(A)RI$) by relying on a sparse representation of the contingency
table in our \texttt{aricode} package. The space and time complexity is linear
in the number of samples and importantly does not depend on the number of

discrete models of spacetime, in particular those represented by a triangular
Regge lattice. We consider a finite-dimensional system whose evolution is
realized by a series of discrete-time evolution steps governed by Hamiltonian
equations of motion that are linear in the canonical coordinates. The evolution
is allowed to be irregular, which produces constraints as well as
non-uniqueness of solutions. We provide two independent and fundamentally
different approaches to canonical quantization of this system, including
detailed description of the evolution maps, measurement and path integrals. It
is argued that some irregular discrete systems may be most naturally described

flagellar filaments. These semi-rigid filaments repeatedly join ('bundle') and
separate ('unbundle'), resulting in a two-gait random walk-like motion of the
cell. In this process, hydrodynamic interactions between the filaments are
known to play an important role and can be categorised into two distinct types:
direct interactions mediated through flows that are generated through the
actuation of the filaments themselves, and indirect interactions mediated
through the motion of the cell body (i.e. flows induced in the swimming frame
that result from propulsion). To understand the relative importance of these
two types of interactions, we study a minimal singularity model of flagellar
bundling. Using hydrodynamic images, we solve for the flow analytically and
compute both direct and indirect interactions exactly as a function of the
length of the flagellar filaments and their angular separation. We show (i)
that the generation of thrust by flagella alone is sufficient to drive the
system towards a bundled state through both types of interaction; (ii) that
indirect advection dominates for long filaments and at wide separation, i.e.
primarily during the early stages of the bundling process; and (iii) that, in
contrast, direct interactions dominate when flagellar filaments are in each
other's wake, which we characterise mathematically. We further introduce a
numerical elastohydrodynamic model that allows us to compute the dynamics of
the helical axes of each flagellar filament while analysing direct and indirect
interactions separately. With this we show (iv) that the shift in balance
between direct and indirect interactions is non-monotonic during the bundling
process, with a peak in direct dominance, and that different sections of the
flagella are affected by these changes to different extents.

discovered a nuclear spiral of radius 1""=45pc. Within it, we found a decoupled

mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral and they present the same
misalignment in the molecular torus. At the nucleus, the HCN/HCO$^+$ and HCN/CS
ratios indicate the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The molecular
gas shows regular rotation, within a radius of 400pc, except for the misaligned
disk inside the nuclear spiral arms. The computations of the torques exerted on
the gas by the barred stellar potential reveal that the gas within a radius of
100pc is feeding the nucleus on a timescale of five rotations or on an average
timescale of ~60Myr. Some non-circular motions are observed towards the center,
corresponding to the nuclear spiral arms. We cannot rule out that small extra
kinematic perturbations could be interpreted as a weak outflow attributed to
AGN feedback. The molecular outflow detected at $\geqslant$250pc in the NE
direction is likely due to supernovae feedback and it is connected to the
kpc-scale superwind.

prognosis and treatment planning. With recent advances in deep learning,
Artificial Intelligence-enabled brain tumor grading systems can assist
radiologists in the interpretation of medical images within seconds. The
performance of deep learning techniques is, however, highly depended on the
size of the annotated dataset. It is extremely challenging to label a large
quantity of medical images given the complexity and volume of medical data. In
this work, we propose a novel transfer learning based active learning framework
to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining stability and robustness of the
model performance for brain tumor classification. We employed a 2D slice-based
approach to train and finetune our model on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) training dataset of 203 patients and a validation dataset of 66 patients
which was used as the baseline. With our proposed method, the model achieved
Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of 82.89% on a
separate test dataset of 66 patients, which was 2.92% higher than the baseline
AUC while saving at least 40% of labeling cost. In order to further examine the
robustness of our method, we created a balanced dataset, which underwent the
same procedure. The model achieved AUC of 82% compared with AUC of 78.48% for
the baseline, which reassures the robustness and stability of our proposed

Typically, preterm infants have to be strictly monitored since they are highly
susceptible to health problems like hypoxemia (low blood oxygen level), apnea,
respiratory issues, cardiac problems, neurological problems as well as an
increased chance of long-term health issues such as cerebral palsy, asthma and
sudden infant death syndrome. One of the leading health complications in
preterm infants is bradycardia - which is defined as the slower than expected
heart rate, generally beating lower than 60 beats per minute. Bradycardia is
often accompanied by low oxygen levels and can cause additional long term
health problems in the premature infant. The implementation of a non-parametric
method to predict the onset of bradycardia is presented. This method assumes no
prior knowledge of the data and uses kernel density estimation to predict the
future onset of bradycardia events. The data is preprocessed, and then analyzed
to detect the peaks in the ECG signals, following which different kernels are
implemented to estimate the shared underlying distribution of the data. The
performance of the algorithm is evaluated using various metrics and the
computational challenges and methods to overcome them are also discussed. It is
observed that the performance of the algorithm with regards to the kernels used
are consistent with the theoretical performance of the kernel as presented in a
previous work. The theoretical approach has also been automated in this work
and the various implementation challenges have been addressed.

significant tool on many graph-based applications recently. Inspired by
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), GCNs generate the embeddings of nodes by
aggregating the information of their neighbors layer by layer. However, the
high computational and memory cost of GCNs due to the recursive neighborhood
expansion across GCN layers makes it infeasible for training on large graphs.
To tackle this issue, several sampling methods during the process of
information aggregation have been proposed to train GCNs in a mini-batch
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) manner. Nevertheless, these sampling
strategies sometimes bring concerns about insufficient information collection,
which may hinder the learning performance in terms of accuracy and convergence.
To tackle the dilemma between accuracy and efficiency, we propose to use
aggregators with different granularities to gather neighborhood information in
different layers. Then, a degree-based sampling strategy, which avoids the
exponential complexity, is constructed for sampling a fixed number of nodes.
Combining the above two mechanisms, the proposed model, named Mix-grained GCN
(MG-GCN) achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, training
speed, convergence speed, and memory cost through a comprehensive set of
experiments on four commonly used benchmark datasets and a new Ethereum

  Dynamics of Racist Online Communities",,,,,"cs.CL cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The (((echo))) symbol -- triple parenthesis surrounding a name, made it to
mainstream social networks in early 2016, with the intensification of the U.S.
Presidential race. It was used by members of the alt-right, white supremacists
and internet trolls to tag people of Jewish heritage -- a modern incarnation of
the infamous yellow badge (Judenstern) used in Nazi-Germany. Tracking this
trending meme, its meaning, and its function has proved elusive for its
semantic ambiguity (e.g., a symbol for a virtual hug).
  In this paper we report of the construction of an appropriate dataset
allowing the reconstruction of networks of racist communities and the way they
are embedded in the broader community. We combine natural language processing
and structural network analysis to study communities promoting hate. In order
to overcome dog-whistling and linguistic ambiguity, we propose a multi-modal
neural architecture based on a BERT transformer and a BiLSTM network on the
tweet level, while also taking into account the users ego-network and meta
features. Our multi-modal neural architecture outperforms a set of strong
baselines. We further show how the the use of language and network structure in
tandem allows the detection of the leaders of the hate communities. We further
study the ``intersectionality'' of hate and show that the antisemitic echo
correlates with hate speech that targets other minority and protected groups.
Finally, we analyze the role IRA trolls assumed in this network as part of the
Russian interference campaign. Our findings allow a better understanding of
recent manifestations of racism and the dynamics that facilitate it.

correlation and Granger causality at different timescales. We find that both
Granger causality and correlation consistently recover known seasonal
precipitation responses to the sea surface temperature pattern associated with
the El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation. Such findings are robust across multiple
time resolutions. In addition, we identify candidates for unexplored
teleconnection responses.

in the field of manipulating light propagation. However, the unusual
electromagnetic properties also put extremely high demands on its compositional
materials. Limited by the finite relative permittivity of the natural
materials, the effective permittivity of the constructed hyperbolic
metamaterials is also confined to a narrow range. Here, based on the proposed
concept of structure-induced spoof surface plasmon, we prove that arbitrary
materials can be selected to construct the hyperbolic metamaterials with
independent relative effective permittivity components. Besides, the
theoretical achievable ranges of the relative effective permittivity components
are unlimited. As proofs of the method, three novel hyperbolic metamaterials
are designed with their functionalities validated numerically and
experimentally by specified directional propagation. To further illustrate the
superiority of the method, an all-metal low-loss hyperbolic metamaterial filled
with air is proposed and demonstrated. The proposed methodology effectively
reduces the design requirement for hyperbolic metamaterials and provides new
ideas for the scenarios where large permittivity coverage is needed such as
microwave and terahertz focus, super-resolution imaging, electromagnetic
cloaking, and so on.

  vaccination strategies","Supplementary material is included in the manuscript PDF",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Due to its high lethality amongst the elderly, the safety of nursing homes
has been of central importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. With test
procedures becoming available at scale, such as antigen or RT-LAMP tests, and
increasing availability of vaccinations, nursing homes might be able to safely
relax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections (meaning
an average of one or less secondary infections per index case). Here, we
develop a detailed agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. The
model is microscopically calibrated to high-resolution data from nursing homes
in Austria, including detailed social contact networks and information on past
outbreaks. We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends
critically on the timespan between test and test result, the detection
threshold of the viral load for the test to give a positive result, and the
screening frequencies of residents and employees. Under realistic conditions
and in absence of an effective vaccine, we find that preventive screening of
employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks in nursing homes,
provided that turnover times and detection thresholds of the tests are low
enough. If vaccines that are moderately effective against infection and
transmission are available, control is achieved if 80% or more of the
inhabitants are vaccinated, even if no preventive testing is in place and
residents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on
vaccine efficacy against infection, retention of testing infrastructures,
regular voluntary screening and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to
enable early identification of new variants of concern.
