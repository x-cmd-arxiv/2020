for modelling a variety of problems including, since recently, hydrogen
embrittlement and stress corrosion cracking. In this work, we demonstrate the
potential of phase field-based multi-physics models in transforming the
engineering assessment and design of structural components in
hydrogen-containing environments. First, we present a theoretical and numerical
framework coupling deformation, diffusion and fracture, which accounts for
inertia effects.Several constitutive choices are considered for the crack
density function, including choices with and without an elastic phase in the
damage response. The material toughness is defined as a function of the
hydrogen content using an atomistically-informed hydrogen degradation law. The
model is numerically implemented in 2D and 3D using the finite element method.
The resulting computational framework is used to address a number of case
studies of particular engineering interest. These are intended to showcase the
model capabilities in: (i) capturing complex fracture phenomena, such as
dynamic crack branching or void-crack interactions, (ii) simulating
standardised tests for critical components, such as bolts, and (iii) enabling
simulation-based paradigms such as Virtual Testing or Digital Twins by coupling
model predictions with inspection data of large-scale engineering components.
The evolution of defects under in-service conditions can be predicted, up to
the ultimate failure. By reproducing the precise geometry of the defects, as
opposed to re-characterising them as sharp cracks, phase field modelling
enables more realistic and effective structural integrity assessments.

acquiring factive epistemic states such as knowledge. However, much of this
work leaves unclear what entity is the subject of these epistemic states.
Furthermore, by focusing only on states like knowledge, we overlook progress in
intermediate cases between ignorance and knowledge -- for example, many now
celebrated theories were initially so controversial that they were not known.
This paper develops an improved framework for thinking about intellectual
progress. Firstly, I argue that we should think of progress relative to the
epistemic position of an intellectual community rather than individual
inquirers. Secondly, I show how focusing on the extended process of inquiry
(rather than the mere presence or absence of states like knowledge) provides a
better evaluation of different types of progress. This includes progress
through formulating worthwhile questions, acquiring new evidence, and
increasing credence on the right answers to these questions. I close by
considering the ramifications for philosophical progress, suggesting that my
account supports rejecting the most negative views while allowing us to
articulate different varieties of optimism and pessimism.

evaporate outward much more quickly than the outer one evaporates inward
through the Hawking effect. This suggests a revised picture of a
semiclassically self-consistent evaporation in which the dominant dynamical
effect comes from the inner horizon. We also look at backreaction on
backgrounds which resemble gravitational collapse, where the inner horizon
moves toward the origin. There we find that, depending on the nature of the
background dynamics, horizon-related semiclassical effects can become dominant
and invert the collapse.

an irritant to be overcome. Here we suggest that noise could play a functional
role in synaptic pruning, allowing the brain to probe network structure and
determine which synapses are redundant. We construct a simple, local,
unsupervised plasticity rule that either strengthens or prunes synapses using
only synaptic weight and the noise-driven covariance of the neighboring
neurons. For a subset of linear and rectified-linear networks, we prove that
this rule preserves the spectrum of the original matrix and hence preserves
network dynamics even when the fraction of pruned synapses asymptotically
approaches 1. The plasticity rule is biologically-plausible and may suggest a

The configuration entropy rate exhibits a distinct minimum at a specific scale
factor that corresponds to the epoch, beyond which the dark energy takes a
driving role in the accelerated expansion of the Universe. We find that the
location of the minimum and magnitude of the entropy rate at the minimum are
sensitive to the parameters of the models. We find the best fit relations
between these quantities and the parameters of each model. We propose that
these relations can be used to constrain the parameters of the holographic dark
energy models from the future measurements of the configuration entropy at
multiple redshifts. Further, the Barrow holographic dark energy model is based
on Barrow entropy which modifies the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, to
capture the deformation of the black-hole surface due to quantum gravitational
effects. We find that the location and amplitude of the minimum of the
configuration entropy rate is strongly sensitive to the deformation exponent
$\Delta$ in the Barrow model. Our study suggests that signatures of the quantum
gravitational effects on the future event horizon may be detected from the

environments has been significantly advanced with the recent progress in
end-to-end neural network architectures. However, the performance of such
systems in reverberant environments is yet to be explored. A core problem in
reverberant speech separation is about the training and evaluation metrics.
Standard time-domain metrics may introduce unexpected distortions during
training and fail to properly evaluate the separation performance due to the
presence of the reverberations. In this paper, we first introduce the
""equal-valued contour"" problem in reverberant separation where multiple outputs
can lead to the same performance measured by the common metrics. We then
investigate how ""better"" outputs with lower target-specific distortions can be
selected by auxiliary autoencoding training (A2T). A2T assumes that the
separation is done by a linear operation on the mixture signal, and it adds an
loss term on the autoencoding of the direct-path target signals to ensure that
the distortion introduced on the direct-path signals is controlled during
separation. Evaluations on separation signal quality and speech recognition
accuracy show that A2T is able to control the distortion on the direct-path
signals and improve the recognition accuracy.

state-of-the-art performance in many machine learning tasks. The core principle
of DL methods consists in training composite architectures in an end-to-end
fashion, where inputs are associated with outputs trained to optimize an
objective function. Because of their compositional nature, DL architectures
naturally exhibit several intermediate representations of the inputs, which
belong to so-called latent spaces. When treated individually, these
intermediate representations are most of the time unconstrained during the
learning process, as it is unclear which properties should be favored. However,
when processing a batch of inputs concurrently, the corresponding set of
intermediate representations exhibit relations (what we call a geometry) on
which desired properties can be sought. In this work, we show that it is
possible to introduce constraints on these latent geometries to address various
problems. In more details, we propose to represent geometries by constructing
similarity graphs from the intermediate representations obtained when

present an autoencoder with latent space penalization, which discovers finite
dimensional manifolds underlying the partial differential equations of physics.
We test this method on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (K-S), Korteweg-de Vries (KdV),
and damped KdV equations. We show that the resulting optimal latent space of
the K-S equation is consistent with the dimension of the inertial manifold. The
results for the KdV equation imply that there is no reduced latent space, which
is consistent with the truly infinite dimensional dynamics of the KdV equation.
In the case of the damped KdV equation, we find that the number of active
dimensions decreases with increasing damping coefficient. We then uncover a
nonlinear basis representing the manifold of the latent space for the K-S
equation.

results for compact Riemann surfaces, three manifolds, and manifolds with
cusps, where $n$ stands for the dimension of the space, and $\rho$ is the

images, videos and audio signals that are difficult to distinguish from natural

motivates the problem of tracking the provenance of signals, i.e., being able
to determine the original source of a signal. Watermarking the signal at the

brittle and watermark detection mechanisms can easily be bypassed by applying
post-processing transformations (cropping images, shifting pitch in the audio

Adversarial Training), a framework for learning transformation-resilient
watermark detectors that are able to detect a watermark even after a signal has
been through several post-processing transformations. Our detection method can
be applied to domains with continuous data representations such as images,
videos or sound signals. Experiments on watermarking image and audio signals
show that our method can reliably detect the provenance of a signal, even if it
has been through several post-processing transformations, and improve upon
related work in this setting. Furthermore, we show that for specific kinds of
transformations (perturbations bounded in the L2 norm), we can even get formal

Booking[dot]com, Expedia, or Trivago allow travelers searching for
accommodations using either their desired location as a search query or near a
particular landmark. Since the popularity of different locations in a city
varies, certain locations may get more queries than other locations. Thus, the
exposure received by different establishments at these locations may be very
different from their intrinsic quality as captured in their ratings.
  Today, many small businesses (shops, hotels, or restaurants) rely on such
online platforms for attracting customers. Thus, receiving less exposure than
that is expected can be unfavorable for businesses. It could have a negative
impact on their revenue and potentially lead to economic starvation or even
shutdown. By gathering and analyzing data from three popular platforms, we
observe that many top-rated hotels and restaurants get less exposure vis-a-vis
their quality, which could be detrimental for them. Following a meritocratic
notion, we define and quantify such exposure disparity due to location-based
searches on these platforms. We attribute this exposure disparity mainly to two
kinds of biases -- Popularity Bias and Position Bias. Our experimental
evaluation on multiple datasets reveals that although the platforms are doing
well in delivering distance-based results, exposure disparity exists for
individual businesses and needs to be reduced for business sustainability.

shell-model counterpart of the Bohr-Mottelson model by embedding the latter in
the microscopic shell-model theory of atomic nucleus within the framework of
the recently proposed fully microscopic proton-neutron symplectic model (PNSM).
For this purpose, another shell-model coupling scheme of the PNSM is considered
in which the basis states are classified by the algebraic structure $SU(1,1)
\otimes SO(6)$. It is shown that the configuration space of the PNSM contains a
six-dimensional subspace that is closely related to the configuration space of
the generalized quadrupole-monopole Bohr-Mottelson model and its dynamics
splits into radial and orbital motions. The group $SO(6)$ acting in this space,
in contrast, e.g., to popular IBM, contains an $SU(3)$ subgroup which allows to
introduce microscopic shell-model counterparts of the exactly solvable limits
of the Bohr-Mottelson model that closely parallel the relationship of the
original Wilets-Jean and rotor models. The Wilets-Jean-type dynamics in the
present approach, in contrast to the original collective model formulation, is
governed by the microscopic shell-model intrinsic structure of the symplectic
bandhead which defines the relevant Pauli allowed $SO(6)$, and hence $SU(3)$,
subrepresentations. The original Wilets-Jean dynamics of the generalized
Bohr-Mottelson model is recovered for the case of closed-shell nuclei, for
which the symplectic bandhead structure is trivially reduced to the scalar or

rely on streaming (or beam) instabilities of the relativistic pair plasma in a
pulsar magnetosphere. However, it is still not clear whether a streaming
instability by itself is sufficient to explain the observed coherent radio
emission. Due to the relativistic conditions that are present in the pulsar
magnetosphere, kinetic instabilities could be quenched. Moreover, uncertainties
regarding specific model-dependent parameters impede conclusions concerning
this question. We aim to constrain the possible parameter range for which a
streaming instability could lead to pulsar radio emission, focusing on the
transition between strong and weak beam models, beam drift speed, and
temperature dependence of the beam and background plasma components. We solve a
linear relativistic kinetic dispersion relation appropriate for pulsar
conditions in a more general way than in previous studies, considering a wider
parameter range. The analytical results are validated by comparison with
relativistic kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations. We obtain
growth rates as a function of background and beam densities, temperatures, and
streaming velocities while finding a remarkable agreement of the linear
dispersion predictions and numerical simulation results in a wide parameter
range. Monotonous growth is found when increasing the beam-to-background
density ratio. With growing beam velocity, the growth rates firstly increase,
reach a maximum and decrease again for higher beam velocities. A monotonous
dependence on the plasma temperatures is found, manifesting in an asymptotic
behaviour when reaching colder temperatures. We show that the generated waves
are phase-coherent by calculating the fractional bandwidth. We provide an
explicit parameter range of plasma conditions for efficient pulsar radio

reconfiguration problem on connected partitions of a connected graph $G$. A
partition of $V(G)$ is \emph{connected} if every part induces a connected

same size, possibly with some slack $s$. A \emph{Balanced Connected
$k$-Partition with slack $s$}, denoted \emph{$(k,s)$-BCP}, is a partition of

$|n_i-n/k|\leq s$, each of which induces a connected subgraph (when $s=0$, the
$k$ parts are perfectly balanced, and we call it \emph{$k$-BCP} for short).
  A \emph{recombination} is an operation that takes a $(k,s)$-BCP of a graph

When $s$ is unbounded, the transformation is always possible using at most
$6(k-1)$ recombinations. (2) If $G$ is Hamiltonian, the transformation is
possible using $O(kn)$ recombinations for any $s \ge n/k$, and (3) we provide

lattice points whose absolute values of their norms are at most $r^2$. We then
prove that it is impossible to walk to infinity if the walk remains within some
bounded distance from the asymptotes. Lastly, we perform a few moat
calculations to show that the longest walk is likely to stay close to the
asymptotes; hence, we conjecture that there is no walk to infinity on
$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ primes with steps of bounded length.

the time evolution of the state of excitable cells, are the cornerstone of
modeling in neuro- and cardiac electrophysiology. Modern ionic models can have
tens of state variables and hundreds of tunable parameters. Fitting ionic
models to experimental data, which usually covers only a limited subset of
state variables, remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we describe a
recurrent neural network architecture designed specifically to encode ionic
models. The core of the model is a Gating Neural Network (GNN) layer, capturing
the dynamics of classic (Hodgkin-Huxley) gating variables. The network is
trained in two steps: first, it learns the theoretical model coded in a set of
ODEs, and second, it is retrained on experimental data. The retrained network
is interpretable, such that its results can be incorporated back into the model
ODEs. We tested the GNN networks using simulated ventricular action potential
signals and showed that it could deduce physiologically-feasible alterations of
ionic currents. Such domain-specific neural networks can be employed in the
exploratory phase of data assimilation before further fine-tuning using
standard optimization techniques.

logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from

between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones.
Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results.
After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved
96.64% sensitivity and 35.06% specificity. As such, the sensitivity of our
identifier increased by 1.26% while specificity increased by 13.19% in absolute

Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to

identify a threshold transition in the capacity as the density of network nodes
increases---below a critical density, the rate is almost zero, while above the
threshold the rate increases linearly with the density. Surprisingly, above the
threshold the typical communication capacity between two nodes is independent
of the distance between them, due to multi-path routing enabled by the quantum

the end-to-end capacity saturates to constants as the number of nodes

remote software execution, in resource-constrained MCU-s, e.g., MSP430 and AVR

proofs of remote software execution (PoX). In turn, PoX can be implemented very
efficiently and securely in low-end MCU-s. Consequently, our design achieves
the lowest hardware overhead of any CFA architecture (i.e., two orders of

explored using the readily available monolingual data in either or both of the

back-translation that utilizes the translations of the target language
monolingual data to increase the amount of the training data. The quality of

shown to determine the performance of the back-translation approach. Despite

Rectification is strong if the radius of the nanopore is small compared to the
screening length of the electrolyte so that both cations and anions have
depletion zones in the respective regions. The depths of these depletion zones
is sensitive to sign of the external voltage. In this work, we are interested
in the effect of the presence of strong ionic correlations (both between ions
and between ions and surface charge) due to the presence of multivalent ions
and large surface charges. We show that strong ionic correlations cause leakage
of the coions, a phenomenon that is absent in mean field theories. In this
modeling study, we use both the mean-field Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) theory
and a particle simulation method, Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo (LEMC), to show
that phenomena such as overcharging and charge inversion cannot be reproduced
with PNP, while LEMC is able to produce nonmonotonic dependence of currents and
rectification as a function of surface charge strength.

landscape of subgraph finding problems in the CONGEST model of distributed
computing. However, so far, very few tight bounds are known in this area. For
triangle (i.e., 3-clique) listing, an optimal $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$-round
distributed algorithm has been constructed by Chang et al.~[SODA 2019, PODC
2019]. Recent works of Eden et al.~[DISC 2019] and of Censor-Hillel et
al.~[PODC 2020] have shown sublinear algorithms for $K_p$-listing, for each $p
\geq 4$, but still leaving a significant gap between the upper bounds and the
known lower bounds of the problem.
  In this paper, we completely close this gap. We show that for each $p \geq
4$, there is an $\tilde{O}(n^{1 - 2/p})$-round distributed algorithm that lists
all $p$-cliques $K_p$ in the communication network. Our algorithm is
\emph{optimal} up to a polylogarithmic factor, due to the $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1
- 2/p})$-round lower bound of Fischer et al.~[SPAA 2018], which holds even in
the CONGESTED CLIQUE model. Together with the triangle-listing algorithm by
Chang et al.~[SODA 2019, PODC 2019], our result thus shows that the round
complexity of $K_p$-listing, for all $p$, is the same in both the CONGEST and
CONGESTED CLIQUE models, at $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{1 - 2/p})$ rounds.
  For $p=4$, our result additionally matches the $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2})$
lower bound for $K_4$-\emph{detection} by Czumaj and Konrad [DISC 2018],
implying that the round complexities for detection and listing of $K_4$ are
equivalent in the CONGEST model.

method for solving the nonlinear systems arising from incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. When the Reynolds number is relatively high, these
systems often involve millions of degrees of freedom (DOFs), and the nonlinear
systems are difficult to converge, partially due to the strong asymmetry of the
system and the saddle-point structure. In this work, we propose to alleviate
these issues by leveraging a multilevel ILU preconditioner called HILUCSI,
which is particularly effective for saddle-point problems and can enable robust
and rapid convergence of the inner iterations in Newton-GMRES. We further use
Picard iterations with the Oseen systems to hot-start Newton-GMRES to achieve
global convergence, also preconditioned using HILUCSI. To further improve
efficiency and robustness, we use the Oseen operators as physics-based
sparsifiers when building preconditioners for Newton iterations and introduce
adaptive refactorization and iterative refinement in HILUCSI. We refer to the
resulting preconditioned hybrid Newton-GMRES as HILUNG. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of HILUNG by solving the standard 2D driven-cavity problem with
Re 5000 and a 3D flow-over-cylinder problem with low viscosity. We compare
HILUNG with some state-of-the-art customized preconditioners for INS, including
two variants of augmented Lagrangian preconditioners and two physics-based
preconditioners, as well as some general-purpose approximate-factorization
techniques. Our comparison shows that HILUNG is much more robust for solving
high-Re problems and it is also more efficient in both memory and runtime for
moderate-Re problems.

function of a real variable, and show that it serves in at least two important
problems, namely, the uniform convergence of Fourier series and computation of
certain $K$-functionals. To be more specific, let $\nu$ be a nondecreasing
concave sequence of positive real numbers and $1\leq p<\infty$. Using our new
tool, we first define a Banach space, denoted $V_p[\nu]$, that is intermediate
between the Wiener class $BV_p$ and $L^\infty$, and prove that it satisfies a
Helly-type selection principle. We also prove that the Peetre $K$-functional
for the couple $(L^\infty,BV_p)$ can be expressed in terms of the modulus of
$p$-variation. Next, we obtain equivalent sharp conditions for the uniform
convergence of the Fourier series of all functions in each of the classes
$V_p[\nu]$ and $H^\omega\cap V_p[\nu]$, where $\omega$ is a modulus of
continuity and $H^\omega$ denotes its associated Lipschitz class. Finally, we
establish optimal embeddings into $V_p[\nu]$ of various spaces of functions of
generalized bounded variation. As a by-product of these latter results, we
infer embedding results for certain symmetric sequence spaces.

the correlation with S\'{e}rsic index, putting its mass at the high end of the
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 range. These estimates are independent of the Broad Line

attention in intelligent vehicle fields, owing to its mutual communication
ability for vehicle control. By exerting continuous torque on the steering

vehicle. However, current haptic guidance steering systems demonstrate some
deficiencies in assisting lane changing. This study explored a new steering
interaction method, including the design and evaluation of an intention-based
haptic shared steering system. Such an intention-based method can support both
lane keeping and lane changing assistance, by detecting a driver lane change
intention. By using a deep learning-based method to model a driver decision
timing regarding lane crossing, an adaptive gain control method was proposed
for realizing a steering control system. An intention consistency method was
proposed to detect whether the driver and the system were acting towards the
same target trajectories and to accurately capture the driver intention. A
driving simulator experiment was conducted to test the system performance.
Participants were required to perform six trials with assistive methods and one
trial without assistance. The results demonstrated that the supporting system
decreased the lane departure risk in the lane keeping tasks and could support a
fast and stable lane changing maneuver.

adversarial targets can be changed dynamically by attacker, traditional

We evaluate our algorithm on different datasets, and demonstrate that our

examine spatial patterns of impact and total recovery effort and utilized these
measures to quantify community resilience. The results showed that certain POI
categories such as building materials and supplies dealers and grocery stores
were the most resilient elements of the community compared to the other POI
categories. On the other hand, categories such as medical facilities and
entertainment were found to have lower resilience values. This result suggests
that these categories were either not essential for community recovery or that
the community was not able to access these services at normal levels
immediately after the hurricane. In addition, the spatial analyses revealed
that many areas in the community with lower levels of resilience experienced
extensive flooding. However, some areas with low resilience were not flooded
extensively, suggesting that spatial reach of the impacts goes beyond flooded
areas. The results demonstrate the importance of the approach proposed in our

place/manner of articulatory features, the speech enhancement (SE) process can
be guided to consider the articulatory properties of the input speech when
performing enhancement to attain performance improvements. Thus, the contextual
information of articulatory attributes has additional information that can
further benefit SE. This study proposed an SE system that improved performance
by optimizing contextual articulatory information in enhanced speech through
joint training of the SE model with an end-to-end automatic speech recognition
(E2E-ASR) model and predicting the sequence of broad phone classes (BPCs)
instead of the phoneme/word sequences. We developed two strategies to train the
SE system based on BPC-based ASR: multi-task learning and deep-feature training
strategies. Experimental results from speech denoising, speech dereverberation,
and impaired speech enhancement tasks confirmed that the contextual
articulatory information facilitates the SE system to improve enhancement
results. Moreover, in contrast to another SE system trained with monophonic
ASR, the BPC-based ASR (providing contextual articulatory information) can
achieve superior SE performance at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
levels.

computation paradigm and iterative learning algorithms that proceed in rounds.
We aim to reduce the communication complexity of Byzantine-tolerant DML
algorithms in the single-hop radio network. Inspired by the CGC filter
developed by Gupta and Vaidya, PODC 2020, we propose a gradient descent-based
algorithm, Echo-CGC. Our main novelty is a mechanism to utilize the broadcast
properties of the radio network to avoid transmitting the raw gradients (full
$d$-dimensional vectors). In the radio network, each worker is able to overhear
previous gradients that were transmitted to the parameter server. Roughly
speaking, in Echo-CGC, if a worker ""agrees"" with a combination of prior
gradients, it will broadcast the ""echo message"" instead of the its raw local
gradient. The echo message contains a vector of coefficients (of size at most
$n$) and the ratio of the magnitude between two gradients (a float). In
comparison, the traditional approaches need to send $n$ local gradients in each
round, where each gradient is typically a vector in an ultra-high dimensional
space ($d\gg n$). The improvement on communication complexity of our algorithm
depends on multiple factors, including number of nodes, number of faulty
workers in an execution, and the cost function. We numerically analyze the
improvement, and show that with a large number of nodes, Echo-CGC reduces
$80\%$ of the communication under standard assumptions.

coherent-structures, has resisted clear description. A major limitation has
been the lack of tools to identify instantaneous spatial organization, while
unravelling the superposition of structures. To address this, we present a
generalized correlation framework, using: (i) correlation measures to identify
instantaneous vector-field patterns, and (ii) a Helmholtz-decomposition based
structure-disentanglement paradigm. After examples using canonical flows, we
apply these methods to homogeneous isotropic turbulence fields. We show that
high kinetic energy ($E_k$) regions manifest as interspersed, localized,
velocity-jets, contrary to the prevalent view of high $E_k$ regions as large
swirling structures (eddies). High enstrophy ($\omega^2$) regions form small
vorticity-jets, invariably surrounded by swirling-velocity. The jet-like and
swirling-velocity structures are spatially exclusive. Decomposing the
Biot-Savart contributions from different levels and regions of the
vorticity-field reveals the organization of velocity-field structures. High
$E_k$ jets are neither self-induced (due to their low vorticity contents), nor
induced by strong vorticity, being almost entirely induced, non-locally, by the
permeating intermediate range (rms level) vorticity. High $\omega^2$ swirls,
instead, are a superposition of self-induced swirling-velocity along with a
background-induced flow. Moreover, intermediate vorticity dominantly induces
the velocity-field everywhere. This suggests that turbulence organization could
emerge from non-local and non-linear field interactions, dominated by
permeating intermediate vorticity, leading to an alternative description of
turbulence, contrary to the notion of a strict structural hierarchy. The tools
presented can be readily applied to generic vector and scalar fields associated
with diverse phenomena.

  Atmosphere",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The dynamics of positive and negative streamers is numerically simulated in
atmospheric pressure air. It is shown that positive and negative streamers
behave in radically different ways when decelerating and stopping. When the
head potential drops, the negative streamer transits to the mode in which the
propagation is due to the forward electron drift. In this case, the radius of
the ionization wave front increases, whereas the electric field at the streamer
head decreases further and the streamer stops. The only advancement mechanism
for a positive streamer with decreasing head potential is a decrease in the
effective radius of the ionization wave, leading to a local increase in the
electric field. This mechanism compensates for the decrease in the efficiency
of gas photoionization at small head diameters. The local electric field at the
streamer head can exceed the runaway threshold when the head potential
decreases to ~1.2 kV in atmospheric pressure air. In this case, pulsed
generation of a beam of runaway electrons directed into the channel of a
stopping positive streamer can occur. The energy of the formed pulsed electron
beam can vary from 700 V (when increasing the photoionization rate by a factor
of 10 with respect to the value in atmospheric pressure air) to 2.6 kV (in air
with an absorbing additive that reduces the photoionization rate by a factor of
1000). It is possible that this behavior of decelerating positive streamers can
explain the observed bursts of X-ray radiation during the streamer propagation.

explained from the aspect of energy. Then, the differences of nonlinearities of

theoretically. Variations of the detuning index and damping ratio that exist in

numbers of plane-wave and twisted photons created by a charged point particle
crossing the cholesteric plate are derived. The selection rules for the twisted
photons radiated at the harmonic $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ are established. In the
paraxial regime, the projection of the orbital angular momentum of a radiated
twisted photon obeys the selection rule $l=\pm(2n+1)$. In the approximation of
a small anisotropy of the permittivity tensor, the selection rule becomes
$m=\pm 2n$, where $m$ is the projection of the total angular momentum of a
radiated twisted photon. The sign ""$\pm$"" in these selection rules is related
to the choice of the forward or reflected waves in the cholesteric and is
realized at the different energies of radiated photons. As the examples, the
radiation of optical twisted photons by electrons with the Lorentz factors

(CcGAN), the first generative model for image generation conditional on
continuous, scalar conditions (termed regression labels). Existing conditional
GANs (cGANs) are mainly designed for categorical conditions (eg, class labels);
conditioning on regression labels is mathematically distinct and raises two
fundamental problems:(P1) Since there may be very few (even zero) real images
for some regression labels, minimizing existing empirical versions of cGAN
losses (aka empirical cGAN losses) often fails in practice;(P2) Since
regression labels are scalar and infinitely many, conventional label input
methods are not applicable. The proposed CcGAN solves the above problems,
respectively, by (S1) reformulating existing empirical cGAN losses to be
appropriate for the continuous scenario; and (S2) proposing a naive label input
(NLI) method and an improved label input (ILI) method to incorporate regression
labels into the generator and the discriminator. The reformulation in (S1)
leads to two novel empirical discriminator losses, termed the hard vicinal
discriminator loss (HVDL) and the soft vicinal discriminator loss (SVDL)
respectively, and a novel empirical generator loss. The error bounds of a
discriminator trained with HVDL and SVDL are derived under mild assumptions in
this work. Two new benchmark datasets (RC-49 and Cell-200) and a novel
evaluation metric (Sliding Fr\'echet Inception Distance) are also proposed for
this continuous scenario. Our experiments on the Circular 2-D Gaussians, RC-49,
UTKFace, Cell-200, and Steering Angle datasets show that CcGAN is able to
generate diverse, high-quality samples from the image distribution conditional
on a given regression label. Moreover, in these experiments, CcGAN
substantially outperforms cGAN both visually and quantitatively.

the branching fraction of the quasi-two-body decay $B\to RP_3$, with $R$ and
$P_3$ being an intermediate resonant state and a pseudoscalar meson,
respectively. However, the above factorization is valid only in the zero width
limit. We consider a correction parameter $\eta_R$ from finite width effects.
Our main results are: (i) We present a general framework for computing $\eta_R$
and show that it can be expressed in terms of the normalized differential rate
and determined by its value at the resonance. (ii) We introduce a form factor
$F(s_{12},m_R)$ for the strong coupling involved in the $R(m_{12})\to P_1P_2$

small in vector meson productions, but prominent in the $K_2^*(1430)$,
$\sigma/f_0(500)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ resonances. (iii) We evaluate $\eta_R$ in
the theoretical framework of QCD factorization (QCDF) and in the experimental
parameterization (EXPP) for three-body decay amplitudes. In general,
$\eta_R^{\rm QCDF}$ and $\eta_R^{\rm EXPP}$ are similar for vector mesons, but
different for tensor and scalar resonances. A study of the differential rates
enables us to understand the origin of their differences. (iv) Finite-width
corrections to $Br(B^-\to RP)_{\rm NWA}$ obtained in the narrow width
approximation are generally small, less than 10\%, but they are prominent in
$B^-\to\sigma/f_0(500)\pi^-$ and $B^-\to \overline K_0^{*0}(1430)\pi^-$ decays.
The EXPP of the normalized differential rates should be contrasted with the
theoretical predictions from QCDF calculation as the latter properly takes into
account the energy dependence in weak decay amplitudes.

that MHD processes induce the penetration of protons below the convective
boundary, when the third dredge up occurs. There, the 13C(alpha,n)16O neutron
source can subsequently operate, merging its effects with those of the
22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction, activated at the temperature peaks characterizing
AGB stages. This work has three main scopes. i) We provide a grid of abundance
yields, as produced through our MHD mixing scheme, uniformly sampled in mass
and metallicity. From it, we deduce that the solar s process distribution, as
well as the abundances in recent stellar populations, can be accounted for,
without the need of the extra primary like contributions suggested in the past.
ii) We formulate analytical expressions for the mass of the 13C pockets
generated, in order to allow easy verification of our findings. iii) We compare
our results with observations of evolved stars and with isotopic ratios in
presolar SiC grains, also noticing how some flux tubes should survive turbulent
disruption, carrying C rich materials into the winds even when the envelope is
O rich. This wind phase is approximated through the G component of AGB s

model of data streams, Ben-Eliezer et. al. (PODS 2020, best paper award) show
how to convert a non-robust algorithm into a robust one with a roughly
$1/\varepsilon$ factor overhead. This was subsequently improved to a
$1/\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ factor overhead by Hassidim et. al. (NeurIPS 2020, oral
presentation), suppressing logarithmic factors. For general functions the
latter is known to be best-possible, by a result of Kaplan et. al. (CRYPTO

stream algorithms for a large class of streaming problems, with no overhead in
the approximation factor. Our class of streaming problems includes the most
well-studied problems such as the $L_2$-heavy hitters problem, $F_p$-moment
estimation, as well as empirical entropy estimation. We substantially improve
upon all prior work on these problems, giving the first optimal dependence on
the approximation factor.
  As in previous work, we obtain a general transformation that applies to any
non-robust streaming algorithm and depends on the so-called twist number.
However, the key technical innovation is that we apply the transformation to
what we call a difference estimator for the streaming problem, rather than an
estimator for the streaming problem itself. We then develop the first
difference estimators for a wide range of problems. Our difference estimator
methodology is not only applicable to the adversarially robust model, but to
other streaming models where temporal properties of the data play a central

certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction w.r.t. perturbations.
However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples around decision
boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to worse standard
performance. Our studies suggest that one might consider ways that build AR
into NNs in a gentler way to avoid the problematic regularization.

planar and parabolic mirrors. The motivation is to have a settlement with
artificial gravity that allows growth beyond Earth's living area, while also
providing easy intra-settlement travel for the inhabitants and reasonably low
population density of 500 /km$^2$. To enable gardens and trees, a 1.5 m thick
soil is used. The soil is upgradable to 4 m if more energy is expended in the
manufacturing phase. The mass per person is $10^7$ kg, most of which is lightly

propellantless, achieving this goal is possible at least in principle. Lifting
the materials from Ceres is energetically cheap compared to processing them

both $E,F$ are infinite dimensional , in $B(E,F)$ there are not more elementary
transformations in matrices so that lose the way to discuss the path
connectedness of such sets in $B^+(E,F)$ as $\Phi_{m,n}=\{T\in B(E,F): \dim
N(T)=m<\infty \ \mbox{and} \ \mathrm{codim}R(T)=n<\infty\},$ $F_k=\{T\in

five theorems on projections and splitting subspaces in Banach spaces instead
of the elementary transformation. Let $\Phi $ denote any one of $F_k ,k<\infty$
and $\Phi_{m,n}$ with either $m>0$ or $n>0.$ Using these theorems we prove
$\Phi$ is path connected.Also these theorems bear an equivalent relation in
$B^+(E,F)$, so that the following general result follows: the equivalent class
$\widetilde{T}$ generated by $T\in B^+(E,F)$ with either $\dim N(T)>0$ or
$\mathrm{codim} R(T)>0$ is path connected. (This equivalent relation in
operator topology appears for the first time.) As applications of the theorems
we give that $\Phi $ is a smooth and path connected submanifold in $B(E,F)$
with the tangent space $T_X\Phi =\{T\in B(E,F): TN(X)\subset R(X)\}$ at any $
X\in {\Phi },$ and prove that
$B(\mathbf{R}^m,\mathbf{R}^n)=\bigcup^{\min\{n,m\}}\limits_{k=0}F_k $ possesses
the following properties of geometric and topology : $F_k ( k <\min\{ m,n\})$
is a smooth and path connected subhypersurface in $B(E,F)$, and specially,
$\dim F_k=(m+n-k)k, k=0,1, \cdots , \min\{m.n\}.$ Of special interest is the
dimensional formula of $F_k \, \, k=0,1, \cdots , \min\{m.n\},$ which is a new
result in algebraic geometry. In view of the proofs of the above theorems it
can not be too much to say that Theorems $1.1-1.5$ provide the rules of finding

infinite-dimensional generalization of the Maximum Entropy property of Gaussian
densities on Euclidean space. We then give closed form formulas for the optimal
entropic transport plan, entropic 2-Wasserstein distance, and Sinkhorn
divergence between two Gaussian measures on a Hilbert space, along with the
fixed point equations for the barycenter of a set of Gaussian measures. Our
formulations fully exploit the regularization aspect of the entropic

infinite-dimensional setting, both the entropic 2-Wasserstein distance and
Sinkhorn divergence are Fr\'echet differentiable, in contrast to the exact
2-Wasserstein distance, which is not differentiable. Our Sinkhorn barycenter
equation is new and always has a unique solution. In contrast, the
finite-dimensional barycenter equation for the entropic 2-Wasserstein distance
fails to generalize to the Hilbert space setting. In the setting of reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), our distance formulas are given explicitly in
terms of the corresponding kernel Gram matrices, providing an interpolation

Instead studies often assume highly correlated average spatial signal
signatures (i.e. directional clusters) between FDD duplex links. These
assumptions, however, only represent use of antennas with the same radiation
pattern over the duplex band, leading to illumination of the same cluster. In
this paper, we investigate pattern reciprocity, over the duplex band, for
practical user handsets. We first show how a population of measured
contemporary phones exhibits noticeable duplex pattern divergence. We then show
measured complex pattern duplex divergence of a mock-up phone, where
depolarization comes on top of gain differences. Thus we reveal a significant

that the HFA description of the ground state properties of the model is

fairness has become an important aspect of machine learning algorithms. The
issue is that human biases towards certain groups of population, defined by
sensitive features like race and gender, are introduced to the training data
through data collection and labeling. Two important directions of fairness
ensuring research have focused on (i) instance weighting in order to decrease
the impact of more biased instances and (ii) adversarial training in order to
construct data representations informative of the target variable, but
uninformative of the sensitive attributes. In this paper we propose a Fair
Adversarial Instance Re-weighting (FAIR) method, which uses adversarial
training to learn instance weighting function that ensures fair predictions.
Merging the two paradigms, it inherits desirable properties from both --
interpretability of reweighting and end-to-end trainability of adversarial
training. We propose four different variants of the method and, among other

discriminative reasoning over commonsense KBs. As a first step toward the
latter, this paper proposes NegatER, a framework that ranks potential negatives
in commonsense KBs using a contextual language model (LM). Importantly, as most
KBs do not contain negatives, NegatER relies only on the positive knowledge in
the LM and does not require ground-truth negative examples. Experiments
demonstrate that, compared to multiple contrastive data augmentation
approaches, NegatER yields negatives that are more grammatical, coherent, and

challenging KB completion task and confirming that the positive knowledge in
LMs can be ""re-purposed"" to generate negative knowledge.

concentration of MNPs at tumor sites. Here, we report how the in vitro heating
power of magnetically soft MnFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles can be enhanced by
intracellular low-dimensional clusters through a strategy that includes: a) the
design of the MNPs to retain N\'eel magnetic relaxation in high viscosity
media, and b) culturing MNP-loaded cells under magnetic fields to produce
elongated intracellular agglomerates. Our direct in vitro measurements
demonstrated that the specific loss power (SLP) of elongated agglomerates
($SLP=576\pm33$ W/g) induced by culturing BV2 cells in situ under a dc magnetic
field was increased by a factor of 2 compared to the $SLP=305\pm25$ W/g
measured in aggregates freely formed within cells. A numerical mean-field model
that included dipolar interactions quantitatively reproduced the SLPs of these
clusters both in phantoms and in vitro, suggesting that it captures the
relevant mechanisms behind power losses under high-viscosity conditions. These
results indicate that in situ assembling of MNPs into low-dimensional
structures is a sound possible way to improve the heating performance in MFH.

wind siting strategies on the design of the European power system. To this end,
a two-stage method is proposed. In the first stage, a highly-granular siting
problem identifies a suitable set of sites where offshore wind plants could be
deployed according to a pre-specified criterion. Two siting schemes are
analysed and compared within a realistic case study. These schemes essentially
select a pre-specified number of sites so as to maximise their aggregate power
output and their spatiotemporal complementarity, respectively. In addition, two
variants of these siting schemes are provided, wherein the number of sites to
be selected is specified on a country-by-country basis rather than Europe-wide.
In the second stage, the subset of previously identified sites is passed to a
capacity expansion planning (CEP) framework that sizes the power generation,
transmission and storage assets that should be deployed and operated in order
to satisfy pre-specified electricity demand levels at minimum cost. Results
show that the complementarity-based siting criterion leads to system designs
which are up to 5% cheaper than the ones relying the power output-based
criterion when offshore wind plants are deployed with no consideration for
country-based deployment targets. On the contrary, the power output-based
scheme leads to system designs which are consistently 2% cheaper than the ones
leveraging the complementarity-based siting strategy when such constraints are
enforced. The robustness of the results is supported by a sensitivity analysis
on offshore wind capital expenditure and inter-annual weather variability,
respectively.

need to be accomplished by multiple drones in collaboration. In some
transportation tasks, two drones are required to lift the load together, which
brings even more significant challenges to the control problem because the
transportation system is underactuated and it contains very complex dynamic
coupling. When transporting bar-shaped objects, the load's attitude, the rope's
swing motion, as well as the distance between the drones, should be carefully
considered to ensure the security of the system. So far, few works have been
implemented for double drone transportation systems to guarantee their
transportation performance, especially in the aforementioned aspect. In this
paper, a nonlinear cooperative control method is proposed, with both rigorous
stability analysis and experimental results demonstrating its great
performance. Without the need to distinguish the identities between the leader
and the follower, the proposed method successfully realizes effective control
for the two drones separately, mainly owning to the deep analysis for the
system dynamics and the elaborate design for the control law. By utilizing
Lyapunov techniques, the proposed controller achieves simultaneous positioning
and mutual distance control of the drones, meanwhile, it efficiently eliminates
the swing of the load. Flight experiments are presented to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed nonlinear cooperative control strategy.

  Firstly, we use the step-by-step evaluation metric to assess the relative
contributivities of participants in a Federated Learning process. Next, we
introduce 2CP, a framework comprising two novel protocols for Blockchained
Federated Learning, which both reward contributors with shares in the final
model based on their relative contributivity. The Crowdsource Protocol allows
an actor to bring a model forward for training, and use their own data to
evaluate the contributions made to it. Potential trainers are guaranteed a fair
share of the resulting model, even in a trustless setting. The Consortium
Protocol gives trainers the same guarantee even when no party owns the initial
model and no evaluator is available.
  We conduct experiments with the MNIST dataset that reveal sound
contributivity scores resulting from both Protocols by rewarding larger
datasets with greater shares in the model. Our experiments also showed the
necessity to pair 2CP with a robust model aggregation mechanism to discard low
quality inputs coming from model poisoning attacks.

we attempt to enhance data efficiency of the end-to-end alignment network

creating difficulties for training. We propose to employ (1) layer-wise
adaptive rate scaling (LARS) to align the magnitudes of gradient updates in
different layers and balance the pace of learning and (2) sequence-wise batch
normalization (SBN) to align the internal feature distributions from different

these technique closes the performance gap when the pretraining on the LSMDC

empirical comparisons and analysis reveal that these techniques improve
optimization and regularize the network more effectively than two different

acoustofluidic device that forms a levitating cell aggregation (one layer) in a
cylindrical chamber of 10 {\mu}L volume that operates at 1 MHz frequency. The
integrated system comprises a lab-on-a-chip device and a confocal Raman

carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that polystyrene microparticles
are assembled and held standstill, enabling a full Raman spectrum to be taken
of a single particle in less than a minute. The signal-to-background ratio is
improved by a thousandfold when compared with conventional Raman acquisition.
The Raman-acoustofluidic system is showcased for obtaining the spectrum of a

adaptation gaze estimation to eliminate the impact of inter-personal diversity.
In domain adaption, we design an embedding representation with prediction
consistency to ensure that the linear relationship between gaze directions in
different domains remains consistent on gaze space and embedding space.
Specifically, we employ source gaze to form a locally linear representation in
the gaze space for each target domain prediction. Then the same linear
combinations are applied in the embedding space to generate hypothesis
embedding for the target domain sample, remaining prediction consistency. The
deviation between the target and source domain is reduced by approximating the
predicted and hypothesis embedding for the target domain sample. Guided by the
proposed strategy, we design Domain Adaptation Gaze Estimation Network(DAGEN),
which learns embedding with prediction consistency and achieves
state-of-the-art results on both the MPIIGaze and the EYEDIAP datasets.

Especially when the mass of fermion is small enough and the coupling is strong

step during pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses. While covariate selection
criteria have been studied extensively, the choice of the functional
relationship between covariates and parameters, however, has received much less
attention. Often, a simple particular class of covariate-to-parameter
relationships (linear, exponential, etc.) is chosen ad hoc or based on domain
knowledge, and a statistical evaluation is limited to the comparison of a small
number of such classes. Goodness-of-fit testing against a nonparametric
alternative provides a more rigorous approach to covariate model evaluation,
but no such test has been proposed so far. In this manuscript, we derive and
evaluate nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests for parametric covariate models,
the null hypothesis, against a kernelized Tikhonov regularized alternative,
transferring concepts from statistical learning to the pharmacological setting.
The approach is evaluated in a simulation study on the estimation of the
age-dependent maturation effect on the clearance of a monoclonal antibody.
Scenarios of varying data sparsity and residual error are considered. The
goodness-of-fit test correctly identified misspecified parametric models with
high power for relevant scenarios. The case study provides proof-of-concept of
the feasibility of the proposed approach, which is envisioned to be beneficial
for applications that lack well-founded covariate models.

typical supervised deep neural network~(DNN)-based techniques learn a mapping

used targets are the desired signal magnitude, a time-frequency mask such as
the Wiener gain, or the interference power spectral density and
signal-to-interference ratio that can be used to compute a time-frequency mask.
In this paper, we propose to incorporate multi-task learning in such DNN-based
enhancement techniques by using speech presence probability (SPP) estimation as
a secondary task assisting the target estimation in the main task. The
advantage of multi-task learning lies in sharing domain-specific information
between the two tasks (i.e., target and SPP estimation) and learning more
generalizable and robust representations. To simultaneously learn both tasks,
we propose to use the adaptive weighting method of losses derived from the
homoscedastic uncertainty of tasks. Simulation results show that the
dereverberation and noise reduction performance of a single-task DNN trained to
directly estimate the Wiener gain is higher than the performance of single-task
DNNs trained to estimate the desired signal magnitude, the interference power
spectral density, or the signal-to-interference ratio. Incorporating the
proposed multi-task learning scheme to jointly estimate the Wiener gain and the
SPP increases the dereverberation and noise reduction further.

at the SuperKEKB collider, the effective lifetime may be prolonged up to 2.6

multi-infeed high voltage direct current (MIDC) systems is a rigorous
theoretical extension of traditional short circuit ratio (SCR), which allows
the considerable experience of using SCR to be extended to MIDC systems.
However, gSCR was originally derived based on the assumption of homogeneous
MIDC systems, where all HVDC converters have an identical control
configuration, which poses challenges to the applications of gSCR to
inhomogeneous MIDC systems. To weaken this assumption, this letter applies
modal perturbation theory to explore the possibility of applying gSCR in
inhomogeneous MIDC systems. Results of numerical experiments show that, in
inhomogeneous MIDC systems, the previously proposed gSCR can still be used
without modification, but critical gSCR (CgSCR) needs to be redefined by
considering the characteristics of HVDC converter control configurations.
Accordingly, the difference between gSCR and redefined CgSCR can effectively
quantify the pertinent ac grid strength in terms of static voltage stability
margin. The performance of our proposed method is demonstrated in a
triple-infeed inhomogeneous LCC-HVDC system.

stochastic policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning. Prior
investigations in the literature focused on temporal difference (TD) learning
by employing nonsmooth finite time analysis motivated by stochastic subgradient
descent leading to certain limitations. These encompass the requirement of
analyzing a modified TD algorithm that involves projection to an a-priori
defined Euclidean ball, achieving a non-optimal convergence rate and no clear
way of deriving the beneficial effects of parallel implementation. Our approach
remedies these shortcomings in the broader context of stochastic VIs and in
particular when it comes to stochastic policy evaluation. We developed a
variety of simple TD learning type algorithms motivated by its original version
that maintain its simplicity, while offering distinct advantages from a
non-asymptotic analysis point of view. We first provide an improved analysis of
the standard TD algorithm that can benefit from parallel implementation. Then
we present versions of a conditional TD algorithm (CTD), that involves periodic
updates of the stochastic iterates, which reduce the bias and therefore exhibit
improved iteration complexity. This brings us to the fast TD (FTD) algorithm
which combines elements of CTD and the stochastic operator extrapolation method
of the companion paper. For a novel index resetting policy FTD exhibits the
best known convergence rate. We also devised a robust version of the algorithm
that is particularly suitable for discounting factors close to 1.

cosmology models, they remain out of the mainstream because of their possible

VSL as a viable theory, it should inherit the success of special relativity
including Maxwell equations and thermodynamics at least. Thus, we adopt that
the speed of light, $\tilde c$ varies for the cosmic time not for the local
time, i.e., $\tilde c[z]$ where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. When one
describes the background FLRW universe, one can define the constant-time
hypersurface by using physical quantities such as temperature, density, and
$\tilde c$. It is because they evolve in time, and the homogeneity of the
Universe demands that they must equal at the equal cosmic time. The variation
of $\tilde c$ accompanies the joint variations of all related physical
constants in order to satisfy the Lorentz invariance, thermodynamics, and
Bianchi identity. We call this VSL model as a ""minimally extended VSL (meVSL)"".
We derive cosmological observables of meVSL and obtain the constraints on the
variation of $\tilde c$ by using the current observations. Interestingly, $z$
and all geometrical distances except the luminosity distance of meVSL are the
same as those of general relativity. However, the Hubble parameter of meVSL is
rescaled as $H = (1+z)^{-b/4} H^{(\rm GR)}$ which might be used as a solution
for the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. In this manuscript, we
provide the main effects of meVSL on various cosmological observations

learning of chaotic systems from the perspective of synchronization-based state

of the proposed bounded BAT algorithm was verified experimentally by solving a
benchmark set of problems.

  Contest and Conference",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper explores the link between education and the decision to start
smoking as well as the decision to quit smoking. Data is gathered from IPUMS
CPS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Probit analysis (with the
use of probability weight and robust standard error) indicates that every
additional year of education will reduce the 2.3 percentage point of the
smoking probability and will add 3.53 percentage point in quitting likelihood,
holding home restriction, public restriction, cigarette price, family income,
age, gender, race, and ethnicity constant. I believe that tobacco epidemic is a
serious global issue that may be mitigated by using careful regulations on
smoking restriction and education.

  Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020",,,,"physics.ao-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurately forecasting the weather is a key requirement for climate change
mitigation. Data-driven methods offer the ability to make more accurate
forecasts, but lack interpretability and can be expensive to train and deploy
if models are not carefully developed. Here, we make use of two historical
climate data sets and tools from machine learning, to accurately predict
temperature fields. Furthermore, we are able to use low fidelity models that
are cheap to train and evaluate, to selectively avoid expensive high fidelity
function evaluations, as well as uncover seasonal variations in predictive
power. This allows for an adaptive training strategy for computationally
efficient geophysical emulation.

  Entities and Associated Negation Constraints","Proceedings of EMNLP 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State of the art research for date-time entity extraction from text is task
agnostic. Consequently, while the methods proposed in literature perform well
for generic date-time extraction from texts, they don't fare as well on task
specific date-time entity extraction where only a subset of the date-time
entities present in the text are pertinent to solving the task. Furthermore,
some tasks require identifying negation constraints associated with the
date-time entities to correctly reason over time. We showcase a novel model for
extracting task-specific date-time entities along with their negation
constraints. We show the efficacy of our method on the task of date-time
understanding in the context of scheduling meetings for an email-based digital
AI scheduling assistant. Our method achieves an absolute gain of 19\% f-score
points compared to baseline methods in detecting the date-time entities
relevant to scheduling meetings and a 4\% improvement over baseline methods for
detecting negation constraints over date-time entities.

  Mechanism",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Because the expansion path of U-Net may ignore the characteristics of small
targets, intermediate supervision mechanism is proposed. The original mask is
also entered into the network as a label for intermediate output. However,
U-Net is mainly engaged in segmentation, and the extracted features are also
targeted at segmentation location information, and the input and output are
different. The label we need is that the input and output are both original
masks, which is more similar to the refactoring process, so we propose another
intermediate supervision mechanism. However, the features extracted by the
contraction path of this intermediate monitoring mechanism are not necessarily
consistent. For example, U-Net's contraction path extracts transverse features,
while auto-encoder extracts longitudinal features, which may cause the output
of the expansion path to be inconsistent with the label. Therefore, we put
forward the intermediate supervision mechanism of shared-weight decoder module.
Although the intermediate supervision mechanism improves the segmentation
accuracy, the training time is too long due to the extra input and multiple
loss functions. For one of these problems, we have introduced tied-weight
decoder. To reduce the redundancy of the model, we combine shared-weight
decoder module with tied-weight decoder module.

  Multi-Dimensional Attention and Cascade Multi-Scale Convolution",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning-based medical image segmentation technology aims at automatic
recognizing and annotating objects on the medical image. Non-local attention
and feature learning by multi-scale methods are widely used to model network,
which drives progress in medical image segmentation. However, those attention
mechanism methods have weakly non-local receptive fields' strengthened
connection for small objects in medical images. Then, the features of important
small objects in abstract or coarse feature maps may be deserted, which leads
to unsatisfactory performance. Moreover, the existing multi-scale methods only
simply focus on different sizes of view, whose sparse multi-scale features
collected are not abundant enough for small objects segmentation. In this work,
a multi-dimensional attention segmentation model with cascade multi-scale
convolution is proposed to predict accurate segmentation for small objects in
medical images. As the weight function, multi-dimensional attention modules
provide coefficient modification for significant/informative small objects
features. Furthermore, The cascade multi-scale convolution modules in each
skip-connection path are exploited to capture multi-scale features in different
semantic depth. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets: KiTS19,
Pancreas CT of Decathlon-10, and MICCAI 2018 LiTS Challenge, demonstrating
better segmentation performances than the state-of-the-art baselines.
