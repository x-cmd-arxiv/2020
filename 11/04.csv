approximation which uses the standard $P_N$ equations with a closure that is
based on the asymptotic solution of the exact Boltzmann equation for a
homogeneous problem, in space and time. The asymptotic $P_N$ approximation for
radiative transfer requires careful treatment regarding the closure equation.
Specifically, the mean number of particles that are emitted per collision
($\omega_{\mathrm{eff}}$) can be larger than one due to inner or outer
radiation sources and the coefficients of the closure must be extended for
these cases. Our approximation is tested against a well-known radiative
transfer benchmark. It yields excellent results, with almost correct particle
velocity that controls the radiative heat-wave fronts.

matrices or graphs as main input objects, e.g. numerical simulations on meshes.
Large inputs are abundant these days and require parallel processing for memory
size and speed. To optimize the execution of such simulations on cluster
systems, the input problem needs to be distributed suitably onto the processing
units (PUs). More and more frequently, such clusters contain different CPUs or
a combination of CPUs and GPUs. This heterogeneity makes the load distribution
problem quite challenging. Our study is motivated by the observation that
established partitioning tools do not handle such heterogeneous distribution
problems as well as homogeneous ones.
  In this paper, we first formulate the problem of balanced load distribution
for heterogeneous architectures as a multi-objective, single-constraint
optimization problem. We then split the problem into two phases and propose a
greedy approach to determine optimal block sizes for each PU. These block sizes
are then fed into numerous existing graph partitioners, for us to examine how
well they handle the above problem. One of the tools we consider is an
extension of our own previous work (von Looz et al, ICPP'18) called Geographer.
Our experiments on well-known benchmark meshes indicate that only two tools
under consideration are able to yield good quality. These two are Parmetis
(both the geometric and the combinatorial variant) and Geographer. While
Parmetis is faster, Geographer yields better quality on average.

surgical systems due to their long, thin shape, flexibility, and compliance
making them easily steerable in narrow or tortuous environments. Many
commercial TSM-based medical devices have non-linear phenomena resulting from
their composition such as backlash hysteresis and dead zone, which lead to a
considerable challenge for achieving precise control of the end effector pose.
However, many recent works in the literature do not consider the combined
effects and compensation of these phenomena, and less focus on practical ways
to identify model parameters in realistic conditions. This paper proposes a
simplified piecewise linear model to construct both backlash hysteresis and
dead zone compensators together. Further, a practical method is introduced to
identify model parameters using motor current from a robotic controller for the
TSM. Our proposed methods are validated with multiple Intra-cardiac
Echocardiography (ICE) catheters, which are typical commercial example of TSM,
by periodic and non-periodic motions. Our results show that the errors from
backlash hysteresis and dead zone are considerably reduced and therefore the
accuracy of robotic control is improved when applying the presented methods.

$\mathrm{FeSe_{1-x}S_x}$ near an Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP)
\cite{zhang17}. Notably, the peak occurs at sub-temperature frequencies, and
softens as $T^{\alpha}$ when temperature is decreased toward the QCP, with
$\alpha>1$. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of the
low-frequency Raman response using a memory matrix approach. We show that such
a quasi-elastic peak is associated with the relaxation of an Ising-nematic
deformation of the Fermi surface. Specifically, we find that the peak frequency
is proportional to $ \tau^{-1}\chi^{-1}$, where $\chi$ is the Ising-nematic
thermodynamic susceptibility, and $\tau^{-1}$ is the decay rate of the nematic
deformation due to an interplay between impurity scattering and
electron-electron scattering mediated by critical Ising-nematic fluctuations.
We argue that the critical fluctuations play a crucial role in determining the
observed temperature dependence of the frequency of the quasi-elastic peak. At
frequencies larger than the temperature, we find that the Raman response is
proportional to $\omega^{1/3}$, consistently with earlier predictions
\cite{klein18a}.

tasked a network to perform contrastive audio-visual spatial alignment of
360{\deg} video and spatial audio. The ability to perform spatial alignment is
enhanced by reasoning over the full spatial content of the 360{\deg} video

animal behavior. All of these fields have developed methods for rating
competitors and ranking them accordingly. A tournament is intransitive if it is
not consistent with any ranking. Intransitive tournaments contain
rock-paper-scissor type cycles. The discrete Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
(HHD) is well adapted to describing intransitive tournaments. It separates a
tournament into perfectly transitive and perfectly cyclic components, where the
perfectly transitive component is associated with a set of ratings. The size of
the cyclic component can be used as a measure of intransitivity. Here we show
that the HHD arises naturally from two classes of tournaments with simple
statistical interpretations. We then discuss six different sets of assumptions
that define equivalent decompositions. This analysis motivates the choice to
use the HHD among other existing methods. Success in competition is typically
mediated by the traits of the competitors. A trait-performance model assumes
that the probability that one competitor beats another can be expressed as a
function of their traits. We show that, if the traits of each competitor are
drawn independently and identically from a trait distribution then the expected
degree of intransitivity in the network can be computed explicitly. Using this
result we show that increasing the number of pairs of competitors who could
compete promotes cyclic competition, and that increasing the correlation in the
performance of $A$ against $B$ with the performance of $A$ against $C$ promotes
transitive competition. The expected size of cyclic competition can thus be
understood by analyzing this correlation. An illustrative example is provided.

adversarial actions to enable organizations to preemptively mitigate these

so that the radius of the curtain's curvature exceeds its thickness. The Weber

representing a steady curtain with a stationary capillary wave superposed on
it. These solutions describe a rich variety of behaviours: in addition to
arching downwards, curtains can zigzag downwards, self-intersect, and even rise
until the initial supply of the liquid's kinetic energy is used up. The last

based on internal sensors. However, the decision of a reasonable strategy is
not only determined by its intrinsic signals, but also very strongly by
environmental information, especially the terrain. Due to the dynamically
changing of the construction site and the consequent absence of a high
definition map, the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offering the
terrain information for construction machines is still challenging. Current
SLAM technologies proposed for mobile machines are strongly dependent on costly
or computationally expensive sensors, such as RTK GPS and cameras, so that
commercial use is rare. In this study, we proposed an affordable SLAM method to
create a multi-layer gird map for the construction site so that the machine can
have the environmental information and be optimized accordingly. Concretely,
after the machine passes by, we can get the local information and record it.
Combining with positioning technology, we then create a map of the interesting
places of the construction site. As a result of our research gathered from
Gazebo, we showed that a suitable layout is the combination of 1 IMU and 2
differential GPS antennas using the unscented Kalman filter, which keeps the
average distance error lower than 2m and the mapping error lower than 1.3% in
the harsh environment. As an outlook, our SLAM technology provides the
cornerstone to activate many efficiency improvement approaches.

  Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential in various

and building on initial efforts in supporting test case prioritization with RL
techniques, we perform here a comprehensive investigation of RL-based test case
prioritization in a CI context. To this end, taking test case prioritization as
a ranking problem, we model the sequential interactions between the CI
environment and a test case prioritization agent as an RL problem, using three
alternative ranking models. We then rely on carefully selected and tailored
state-of-the-art RL techniques to automatically and continuously learn a test
case prioritization strategy, whose objective is to be as close as possible to
the optimal one. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the best RL
solutions provide a significant accuracy improvement over previous RL-based
work, with prioritization strategies getting close to being optimal, thus
paving the way for using RL to prioritize test cases in a CI context.

formation; it measures the clustering of galaxies or other density field
tracers. Estimators of the 2pcf, including the standard Landy-Szalay (LS)
estimator, evaluate the 2pcf in hard-edged separation bins, which is
scientifically inappropriate and results in a poor trade-off between bias and
variance. We present a new 2pcf estimator, the Continuous-Function Estimator,
which generalizes LS to a continuous representation and obviates binning in
separation or any other pair property. Our estimator, inspired by the
mathematics of least-squares fitting, replaces binned pair counts with
projections onto basis functions; it outputs the best linear combination of
basis functions to describe the 2pcf. The choice of basis can take into account
the expected form of the 2pcf, as well as its dependence on pair properties
other than separation. We show that the Continuous-Function Estimator with a
cubic-spline basis better represents the shape of the 2pcf compared to LS. We
also estimate directly the baryon acoustic scale, using a small number of
physically-motivated basis functions. Critically, this leads to a reduction in
the number of mock catalogs required for covariance estimation, which is
currently the limiting step in many 2pcf analyses. We discuss further
applications of the Continuous-Function Estimator, including determination of
the dependence of clustering on galaxy properties and searches for potential
inhomogeneities or anisotropies in large-scale structure.

dwarfs, with short rotation periods. Their phased light curves have one or more
broad flux dips or multiple arcuate structures which are not explicable by
photospheric spots or eclipses by solid bodies. Now, using TESS data, we have
searched for this type of variability in the other major sections of Sco-Cen,
Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL) and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC). We identify 28
stars with the same light curve morphologies. We find no obvious difference
between the Upper Sco and the UCL/LCC representatives of this class in terms of
their light curve morphologies, periods or variability amplitudes. The physical
mechanism behind this variability is unknown, but as a possible clue we show
that the rapidly rotating mid-M dwarfs in UCL/LCC have slightly different
colors from the slowly rotating M dwarfs - they either have a blue excess (hot
spots?) or a red excess (warm dust?).
  One of the newly identified stars (TIC242407571) has a very striking light
curve morphology. At about every 0.05 in phase are features that resemble
icicles, The ""icicles"" arise because there is a second periodic system whose
main feature is a broad flux dip. Using a toy model, we show that the observed
light curve morphology results only if the ratio of the two periods and the
flux dip width are carefully arranged.

order to maximize the downlink sum-rate, the optimal precoding matrix (at the

to address the uncertainty of mmWave channels and maintain line-of-sight links

on quantile regression optimization, is proposed to learn the propagation
environment of mmWave communications, and, then, optimize the location of the
UAV-IR so as to maximize the long-term downlink communication capacity.
Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based deployment of the

materials are often replaced by a zero-thickness interface model. Commonly
accepted interface models intuitively assume that the interface layer is
situated exactly in the middle of its associated interphase. Furthermore, it
has been reported in the literature that this assumption is necessary to
guarantee the balance of angular momentum on the interface. While the interface
coincides with the mid-layer of a uniform interphase, we argue that this
assumption fails to sufficiently capture the behavior of graded or
inhomogeneous interphases. This contribution extends the formulation of the
general interface model to account for arbitrary interface positions. The issue
of angular momentum balance on general interfaces is critically revisited. It
is proven that the interface position does not necessarily have to coincide
with the mid-layer in order to satisfy the angular momentum balance. The
analysis here leads to a unique definition of the controversially discussed
interface configuration. The presented general interface model is essentially
based upon the weighted average operator instead of the commonly accepted
classical average operator. The framework is geometrically exact and suitable
for finite deformations. The significance of the interface position is
demonstrated via a series of examples where the interface position is
identified based on a full resolution interphase.

cosmic rays (UHECRs) provides a new way to explore sources of cosmic rays. One
of the highest energy neutrino events detected by IceCube, tagged as IC35, is
close to the UHECR anisotropy region detected by Pierre Auger Observatory. The
nearby starburst galaxy (SBG), NGC 4945, is close to this anisotropic region
and inside the mean angular error of the IC35 event. Considering the hypernovae
contribution located in the SB region of NGC 4945, which can accelerate protons
up to $\sim 10^{17} \, {\rm eV}$ and inject them into the interstellar medium,
we investigate the origin of this event around this starburst galaxy. We show
that the interaction of these protons with the SB region's gas density could
explain Fermi-LAT gamma-ray and radio observations if the magnetic field's
strength in the SB region is the order of $\sim \rm mG$. Our estimated PeV
neutrino events, in ten years, for this source is approximately 0.01
($4\times10^{-4}$) if a proton spectral index of 2.4 (2.7) is considered, which
would demonstrate that IC35 is not produced in the central region of this SBG.
Additionally, we consider the superwind region of NGC 4945 and show that
protons can hardly be accelerated in it up to UHEs.

potentials, intensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been
carried out for matter-wave solitons, coherent structures, modulational

objects of fundamental interest in the vast realm of nonlinear physics and soft
condensed-matter physics. Ubiquitous models, which are relevant to the
description of diverse nonlinear media are provided by the nonlinear
Schrodinger (NLS), alias Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations. In many settings,
nontrivial solitons and coherent structures, which do not exist or are unstable
in free space, can be created or stabilized by means of various management
techniques, which are represented by NLS and GP equations with spatiotemporal
coefficients in front of linear or nonlinear terms. Developing this direction
of research in various settings, efficient schemes of the spatiotemporal
modulation of coefficients in the NLS/GP equations have been designed to
engineer desirable robust nonlinear modes. This direction and related ones are
the main topic of the present review. A broad and important theme is the
creation and control of 1D solitons in BEC by means of combination of the
temporal or spatial modulation of the nonlinearity strength and a time-varying
trapping potential. An essential ramification of this topic is analytical and
numerical analysis of MI of continuous-wave states, and control of the
nonlinear development of MI. In addition to that, the review also includes some
topics that do not directly include spatiotemporal modulation but address
physically important phenomena which demonstrate similar soliton dynamics.
These are soliton motion in binary BEC, three-component solitons in spinor BEC,
and dynamics of two-component solitons under the action of spin-orbit coupling.

equations arising from many scientific applications. The solver performance
within a single node is memory bound, due to the low arithmetic intensity of
its computational kernels. To reduce the amount of data movement, and thus, to
improve performance, we investigated the effect of using a mix of single and
double precision while retaining double-precision accuracy. Previous efforts
have explored reduced precision in the preconditioner, but the use of reduced
precision in the solver itself has received limited attention. We found that
GMRES only needs double precision in computing the residual and updating the
approximate solution to achieve double-precision accuracy, although it must
restart after each improvement of single-precision accuracy. This finding holds
for the tested orthogonalization schemes: Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) and
Classical Gram-Schmidt with Re-orthogonalization (CGSR). Furthermore, our
mixed-precision GMRES, when restarted at least once, performed 19% and 24%
faster on average than double-precision GMRES for MGS and CGSR, respectively.
Our implementation uses generic programming techniques to ease the burden of
coding implementations for different data types. Our use of the Kokkos library
allowed us to exploit parallelism and optimize data management. Additionally,
KokkosKernels was used when producing performance results. In conclusion, using
a mix of single and double precision in GMRES can improve performance while
retaining double-precision accuracy.

recent work of the authors (STOC 2020) who presented such a result for the
manifold of rank $k$-projections which is a specific adjoint orbit of the
unitary group $\mathrm{U}(n)$. Our result relies on the ellipsoid method-based
framework proposed in prior work; however, to apply it to the general setting
of compact Lie groups, we need tools from Lie theory. For instance, properties
of the adjoint representation are used to find the defining equalities of the
minimal affine space containing the convex hull of $\mathcal{O}(F)$, and to
establish a bound on the optimal dual solution. Also, the Harish-Chandra
integral formula is used to obtain an evaluation oracle for the dual objective
function. While the Harish-Chandra integral formula allows us to write certain
integrals over the adjoint orbit of a Lie group as a sum of a small number of
determinants, it is only defined for elements of a chosen Cartan subalgebra of
the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G.$ We show how it can be applied to our
setting with the help of Kostant's convexity theorem. Further, the convex hull
of an adjoint orbit is a type of orbitope, and the orbitopes studied in this

extending the maximum entropy framework to a class of spectrahedra.

becomes anisotropic because the drift introduces a preferred direction of

individual trajectories display a high level of variability, which is
responsible for the macroscopic properties of the diffusing front. Overall, the
interplay between drift, diffusion and crowded environment, as measured by the

subjected to stressful wind and wave induced loads, they are more prone than
onshore counterparts to experience faults and failure. In particular, the pitch
system may experience Pitch Actuator Stuck (PAS) type of faults, which will
result in a complete loss of control authority. In this paper, a novel fast and
adaptive solution is developed by integrating a model-based Fault Diagnosis
(FD) scheme and the Subspace Predictive Repetitive Control (SPRC). The FD role
is to quickly detect and isolate the failed pitch actuator. Based on the fault
isolation results, a pre-tuned adaptive SPRC is switched online in place of the
existing one, whose initial values of the parameters has been tuned offline to
match the specific faulty case. After that, SPRC employs subspace
identification to continuously identify a linear model of the wind turbine over
a moving time window, and thereby formulate an adaptive control law to
alleviate the PAS-induced loads. Results show that the developed architecture
allows to achieve a considerable reduction of the PAS-induced blade loads. More
importantly, the time needed to reduce the PAS-induced loads are significantly
shortened, thus avoiding further damage to other components during the adaption
time and allowing continued power generation.

data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9fb$^{-1}$, collected
with the LHCb detector in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies
of 7, 8 and 13TeV. The decays $B^0_s \rightarrow J/\psi K^{\ast0}
\bar{K}^{\ast0}$ and $B^0_s \rightarrow \chi_{c1}(3872)K^+K^-$, where the
$K^+K^-$ pair does not originate from a $\phi$ meson, are observed for the
first time. Precise measurements of the ratios of branching fractions between
intermediate $\chi_{c1}(3872)\phi$, $J/\psi K^{\ast0}\bar{K}^{\ast0}$,
$\psi(2S)\phi$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)K^+K^-$ states are reported. A structure,
denoted as $X(4740)$, is observed in the $J/\psi\phi$ mass spectrum and,
assuming a Breit-Wigner parameterisation, its mass and width are determined to
be \begin{eqnarray*} m_{X(4740)} & = & 4741 \pm 6 \pm 6\,{\mathrm{MeV}}/c^2 \,,
\\ \Gamma_{X(4740)} & = & 53 \pm 15 \pm 11\,{\mathrm{MeV}} \,, \end{eqnarray*}
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. In
addition, the most precise single measurement of the mass of the $B^0_s$ meson
is performed and gives a value of
  $$ m_{B^0_s} = 5366.98 \pm 0.07 \pm 0.13\,{\mathrm{MeV}}/c^2\,. $$

  Finite-Time Performance",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-time-scale stochastic approximation, a generalized version of the popular
stochastic approximation, has found broad applications in many areas including
stochastic control, optimization, and machine learning. Despite its popularity,
theoretical guarantees of this method, especially its finite-time performance,
are mostly achieved for the linear case while the results for the nonlinear
counterpart are very sparse. Motivated by the classic control theory for
singularly perturbed systems, we study in this paper the asymptotic convergence
and finite-time analysis of the nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic
approximation. Under some fairly standard assumptions, we provide a formula
that characterizes the rate of convergence of the main iterates to the desired
solutions. In particular, we show that the method achieves a convergence in
expectation at a rate $\mathcal{O}(1/k^{2/3})$, where $k$ is the number of
iterations. The key idea in our analysis is to properly choose the two step
sizes to characterize the coupling between the fast and slow-time-scale
iterates.

  evaluation on longitudinal diffusion MRI","SPIE Medical Imaging 2021 (oral)",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Analysis of longitudinal changes in imaging studies often involves both
segmentation of structures of interest and registration of multiple timeframes.
The accuracy of such analysis could benefit from a tailored framework that
jointly optimizes both tasks to fully exploit the information available in the
longitudinal data. Most learning-based registration algorithms, including joint
optimization approaches, currently suffer from bias due to selection of a fixed
reference frame and only support pairwise transformations. We here propose an
analytical framework based on an unbiased learning strategy for group-wise
registration that simultaneously registers images to the mean space of a group
to obtain consistent segmentations. We evaluate the proposed method on
longitudinal analysis of a white matter tract in a brain MRI dataset with 2-3
time-points for 3249 individuals, i.e., 8045 images in total. The
reproducibility of the method is evaluated on test-retest data from 97
individuals. The results confirm that the implicit reference image is an
average of the input image. In addition, the proposed framework leads to
consistent segmentations and significantly lower processing bias than that of a
pair-wise fixed-reference approach. This processing bias is even smaller than
those obtained when translating segmentations by only one voxel, which can be
attributed to subtle numerical instabilities and interpolation. Therefore, we
postulate that the proposed mean-space learning strategy could be widely
applied to learning-based registration tasks. In addition, this group-wise
framework introduces a novel way for learning-based longitudinal studies by
direct construction of an unbiased within-subject template and allowing
reliable and efficient analysis of spatio-temporal imaging biomarkers.

  with Semantic Clues","11 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-geometric mobility hazards such as rover slippage and sinkage posing
great challenges to costly planetary missions are closely related to the
mechanical properties of terrain. In-situ proprioceptive processes for rovers
to estimate terrain mechanical properties need to experience different slip as
well as sinkage and are helpless to untraversed regions. This paper proposes to
predict terrain mechanical properties with vision in the distance, which
expands the sensing range to the whole view and can partly halt potential
slippage and sinkage hazards in the planning stage. A semantic-based method is
designed to predict bearing and shearing properties of terrain in two stages
connected with semantic clues. The former segmentation phase segments terrain
with a light-weighted network promising to be applied onboard with competitive
93% accuracy and high recall rate over 96%, while the latter inference phase
predicts terrain properties in a quantitative manner based on human-like
inference principles. The prediction results in several test routes are 12.5%
and 10.8% in full-scale error and help to plan appropriate strategies to avoid
suffering non-geometric hazards.

(opto)electronic applications. Here, we present a set-up able to transform a
conventional scanning electron microscope into a tool for structural analysis
of a wide range of LMs. An hybrid pixel electron detector below the sample
makes it possible to record two dimensional (2d) diffraction patterns for every
probe position on the sample surface (2d), in transmission mode, thus
performing a 2d+2d=4d STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy)
analysis. This offers a field of view up to 2 mm2, while providing spatial
resolution in the nm range, enabling the collection of statistical data on
grain size, relative orientation angle, bilayer stacking, strain, etc. which
can be mined through automated open-source data analysis software. We
demonstrate this approach by analyzing a variety of LMs, such as mono- and
multi-layer graphene, graphene oxide and MoS2, showing the ability of this
method to characterize them in the tens of nm to mm scale. This wide field of
view range and the resulting statistical information are key for large scale
applications of LMs.

algorithm that utilizes simulated kinematic parameters variation. Our
algorithm, Multi-Policy Bayesian Optimization, trains an ensemble of universal

(WLM) in which input sentences at training time go through the same
modifications as in MLM, plus two additional modifications, namely inserting

sentence in addition to the modifications in MLMs, hence the word ""warped"" in
the name. The insertion and drop modification of the input text during training
of WLM resemble the types of noise due to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

computational results we show that natural language understanding systems built
on top of WLMs perform better compared to those built based on MLMs, especially

favorable Doppler shift that allowed us to avoid contamination by telluric CO2
features. The highest excitation lines involve levels at an energy of ~7000 K.
The detected lines are narrow (average deconvolved width ~2.5 km/s) and weak
(usually <10% the continuum). A ro-vibrational diagram shows that there are
three different populations, warm, hot, and very hot, with rotational
temperatures of ~550, 1150, and 1600 K, respectively. From this diagram, we
derive a lower limit for the column density of ~2.2E+16 cm^{-2}. Further
calculations based on a model of the R Leo envelope suggest that the total
column density can be as large as 7.0E+17 cm^{-2} and the abundance with

of challenges to network planning. Vulnerability to blockages and high path
loss at mmWave frequencies require careful planning of the network to achieve
the desired service quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
geometry-based framework for deploying mmWave base stations (gNBs) in urban
environments by considering first-order reflection effects. We also provide a
solution for the optimum deployment of passive metallic reflectors (PMRs) to
extend radio coverage to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. In particular, we
perform visibility analysis to find the direct and indirect visibility regions,
and using these, we derive a geometry-and-blockage-aided path loss model. We
then formulate the network planning problem as two independent optimization
problems, placement of gNB(s) and PMRs, to maximize the coverage area with a
certain quality-of-service constraint and minimum cost. We test the efficacy of
our proposed approach using a generic map and compare our simulation results
with the ray-tracing solution. Our simulation results show that considering the
first-order reflections in planning the mmWave network helps reduce the number
of PMRs required to cover the NLoS area and the gNB placement aided with PMRs
requires fewer gNBs to cover the same area, which in turn reduces the
deployment cost.

$\gamma$-rays by annihilations. We first study the formation of the halos and
find that their density profile prior to WIMP annihilations evolves to a
characteristic power-law form. Because of the wide range of PBH masses
considered, our analysis forges an interesting link between previous approaches
to this problem. We then consider the effect of the WIMP annihilations on the
halo profile and the associated generation of $\gamma$-rays. The observed
extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background implies that the PBH DM fraction is
$f^{}_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-9}\,( m_{\chi} / {\rm TeV} )^{1.1}$ in
the mass range $2 \times 10^{-12}\,M_{\odot}\,( m_{\chi} / {\rm TeV} )^{-3.2}
\lesssim M \lesssim 5 \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}\,( m_{\chi} / {\rm TeV}

This limit is independent of $M$ and therefore applies for any PBH mass
function. For $M \lesssim 2\times 10^{-12}\,M_{\odot}\,( m_{\chi}/ {\rm TeV}
)^{-3.2}$, the constraint on $f^{}_{\rm PBH}$ is a decreasing function of $M$
and PBHs could still make a significant DM contribution at very low masses. We
also consider constraints on WIMPs if the DM is mostly PBHs. If the merging
black holes recently discovered by LIGO/Virgo are of primordial origin, this
would rule out the standard WIMP DM scenario. More generally, the WIMP DM
fraction cannot exceed $10^{-4}$ for $M > 10^{-9}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{\chi} >
10\,$GeV. There is a region of parameter space, with $M \lesssim
10^{-11}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{\chi} \lesssim 100\,$GeV, in which WIMPs and PBHs
can both provide some but not all of the DM, so that one requires a third DM
candidate.

dense circumstellar material (CSM) is present. Indeed, recent photometric

CSM may be present more often than previously expected. If true, this should
also affect the features of SBO. We present an exploration of the impact of
such CSM interaction on the SBO width and luminosity using both analytic and

then compare this modeling to PS1-13arp, a SN that showed an early UV excess

single-component, time-reversal symmetric superconductor, likely with
$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ symmetry. However, due to the strong strain inhomogeneities
generated by dislocations, a slowly-decaying sub-leading pairing state
contributes to the condensate in significant portions of the sample. As it
phase winds around the dislocation, time-reversal symmetry is locally broken.
Global phase locking and TRSB occur at a sharp Ising transition that is not
accompanied by a change of the single-particle gap and yields a very small heat
capacity anomaly. Our model thus explains the puzzling absence of a measurable
heat capacity anomaly at the TRSB transition in strained samples, and the
dilute nature of the time-reversal symmetry broken state probed by muon spin

(optical, X-ray, strong- and weak-lensing) observations of the twenty-two most
massive ($\sim10^{14.7}\,M_\odot$) relaxed clusters in the BAHAMAS simulations.
We find that observable measures of shape are rounder. Even when moments of
inertia are projected into 2D and evaluated at matched radius, they
overestimate ellipticity by 56\% (compared to observable strong lensing) and
430\% (compared to observable weak lensing). Therefore, we propose matchable
quantities and test them using observations of eight relaxed clusters from the
{\emph Hubble Space Telescope} and {\emph Chandra X-Ray Observatory}. We also

In real clusters, the ellipticity and orientation angle at all radii are
strongly correlated. In simulated clusters, the ellipticity of inner
($<r_{\mathrm{vir}}/20$) regions becomes decoupled: for example with greater
misalignment of the central cluster galaxy. This may indicate overly efficient
implementation of feedback from active galactic nuclei. Future exploitation of

the final mass of SMSs is weakly constrained by existing models, in spite of
the importance this quantity plays in the consistency of the direct collapse
scenario. We estimate the final masses of spherical SMSs in the whole parameter

stellar evolution with rapid accretion. From these hydrostatic structures, we
determine ab initio the conditions for GR instability, and compare the results
with the predictions of full stellar evolution. We show that hylotropic models
predict the onset of GR instability with high precision. The mass of the
convective core appears as a decisive quantity. The lower it is, the larger is
the total mass required for GR instability. Typical conditions for GR
instability are a total mass >10^5 Msun with a core mass >10^4 Msun. If the
core mass remains below 10^4 Msun, total masses in excess of 10^6-10^7 Msun can
be reached. Our results confirm that spherical SMSs forming in primordial,

star-forming disks with exponential light distributions. They are typically
also associated with thin and flat morphologies, blue colors, and dynamically
cold stars moving along circular orbits within co-planar thin gas disks.
However, the latter features do not necessarily always imply the former, in
fact, a variety of different kinematic configurations do exist. In this work,
we use the cosmological hydrodynamical IllustrisTNG Simulation to study the
nature and origin of dynamically hot, sometimes even counter-rotating,
star-forming disk galaxies in the lower stellar mass range (between $5\times
10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and $2\times 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We find
that being dynamically hot arises in most cases as an induced transient state,
for example due to galaxy interactions and merger activities, rather than as an
age-dependent evolutionary phase of star-forming disk galaxies. The dynamically
hot but still actively star-forming disks show a common feature of hosting
kinematically misaligned gas and stellar disks, and centrally concentrated
on-going star formation. The former is often accompanied by disturbed gas
morphologies, while the latter is reflected in low gas and stellar spins in
comparison to their dynamically cold, normal disk counterparts. Interestingly,
observed galaxies from MaNGA with kinematic misalignment between gas and stars
show remarkably similar general properties as the IllustrisTNG galaxies, and
therefore are plausible real-world counterparts. In turn, this allows us to
make predictions for the stellar orbits and gas properties of these misaligned

this paper, we compute the partition function of near-BPS black holes in
supergravity where the emergent, broken, symmetry is $PSU(1,1|2)$. To reliably
compute this partition function, we show that the gravitational path integral
can be reduced to that of a $\mathcal N=4$ supersymmetric extension of the
Schwarzian theory, which we define and exactly quantize. In contrast to the
non-supersymmetric case, we find that black holes in supergravity have a mass
gap and a large extremal black hole degeneracy consistent with the
Bekenstein-Hawking area. Our results verify several string theory conjectures,

1927+654, followed by a dip of 3 orders of magnitude in the X-ray luminosity,
is controlled by a change in the accretion rate and an inversion of magnetic
flux in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Before the changing-look event,
strong magnetic flux on the black hole powers X-ray emission via the
Blandford-Znajek process while the UV emission is produced by a radiatively
inefficient magnetized disk. An advection event, bringing flux of the opposite
polarity, propagates inward leading, first, to a rise in the UV/optical
luminosity and, then, to a dip in the X-ray luminosity when it reaches the
black hole. We estimate the timescale for magnetic flux advection and find that
the observed timescale between the beginning of the changing-look event and the
minimum in the X-ray luminosity, $\approx200$ days, is in agreement with the
time needed to cancel the magnetic flux in a MAD extending to
$\approx180\:r_g$. Although flux inversion events might be rare due to the
large ratio of flux-to-mass that is needed, we argue that AGN showing an
unusually high ratio of X-ray to UV luminosity are prime candidates for such
events. We also suggest that similar events may lead to jet interruptions in
radio-loud objects.

by strategic individuals who can modify their features at a cost. A learner can
only partially observe the features, and aims to classify individuals with
respect to a quality score. The goal is to design an evaluation mechanism that
maximizes the overall quality score, i.e., welfare, in the population, taking
any strategic updating into account. We further study the algorithmic aspect of
finding the welfare maximizing evaluation mechanism under two specific settings
in our model. When scores are linear and mechanisms use linear scoring rules on
the observable features, we show that the optimal evaluation mechanism is an
appropriate projection of the quality score. When mechanisms must use linear
thresholds, we design a polynomial time algorithm with a (1/4)-approximation
guarantee when the underlying feature distribution is sufficiently smooth and
admits an oracle for finding dense regions. We extend our results to settings
where the prior distribution is unknown and must be learned from samples.

models causes the frequencies of their normal modes of oscillation to differ
from those of actual stars with matching interior structures. These frequency
differences are referred to as the asteroseismic surface term. Global stellar
properties estimated via detailed constraints on individual mode frequencies
have previously been shown to be robust with respect to different
parameterisations of this surface term. It has also been suggested that this
may be true of a broader class of nonparametric treatments. We examine
systematic differences in inferred stellar properties with respect to different
surface-term treatments, both for a statistically large sample of main-sequence
stars, as well as for a sample of red giants, for which no such
characterisation has previously been done. For main-sequence stars, we
demonstrate that while masses and radii, and hence ages, are indeed robust to
the choice of surface term, the inferred initial helium abundance $Y_0$ is
sensitive to the choice of surface correction. This implies that
helium-abundance estimates returned from detailed asteroseismology are
methodology-dependent. On the other hand, for our red giant sample,
nonparametric surface corrections return dramatically different inferred
stellar properties than parametric ones. The nature of these differences
suggests that such nonparametric methods should be preferred for evolved stars;
this should be verified on a larger sample.

$s\in[-0.80,0.95]$. The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at
the ${\sim}10^{-3}$ level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a
single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass
and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude
more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the
waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an
information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As
demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter
estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog

systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous
analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend
on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the
analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by
third-generation detectors. Future applications include the analysis of

increase in interest and prevalence for its adoption to tackle financial
services tasks. One particular question that often arises as a barrier to
adopting deep learning for financial services is whether the developed
financial deep learning models are fair in their predictions, particularly in
light of strong governance and regulatory compliance requirements in the
financial services industry. A fundamental aspect of fairness that has not been
explored in financial deep learning is the concept of trust, whose variations
may point to an egocentric view of fairness and thus provide insights into the
fairness of models. In this study we explore the feasibility and utility of a
multi-scale trust quantification strategy to gain insights into the fairness of
a financial deep learning model, particularly under different scenarios at
different scales. More specifically, we conduct multi-scale trust
quantification on a deep neural network for the purpose of credit card default
prediction to study: 1) the overall trustworthiness of the model 2) the trust
level under all possible prediction-truth relationships, 3) the trust level
across the spectrum of possible predictions, 4) the trust level across
different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, and education), and 5)
distribution of overall trust for an individual prediction scenario. The
insights for this proof-of-concept study demonstrate that such a multi-scale
trust quantification strategy may be helpful for data scientists and regulators
in financial services as part of the verification and certification of
financial deep learning solutions to gain insights into fairness and trust of

technological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used
functions within traffic modelling, the volume delay function, has seen little
in the way of change since it was developed in the 1960's. Traditionally
macroscopic methods have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular
journey time. The general nature of these functions enables their ease of use
and gives widespread applicability. However, they lack the ability to consider
individual road characteristics (i.e. geometry, presence of traffic furniture,
road quality and surrounding environment). This research investigates the
feasibility to reconstruct the model using two different data sources, namely
the traffic speed from Google Maps' Directions Application Programming
Interface (API) and traffic volume data from automated traffic counters (ATC).
Google's traffic speed data are crowd-sourced from the smartphone Global
Positioning System (GPS) of road users, able to reflect real-time,
context-specific traffic condition of a road. On the other hand, the ATCs
enable the harvesting of the vehicle volume data over equally fine temporal
resolutions (hourly or less). By combining them for different road types in
London, new context-specific volume-delay functions can be generated. This
method shows promise in selected locations with the generation of robust
functions. In other locations it highlights the need to better understand other
influencing factors, such as the presence of on road parking or weather events.

beamforming in reverberant indoor environments is addressed in this paper. We
propose that more generic solutions should cope with time-varying dynamic
scenarios with moving microphone array or sources such as those found in
voice-based human-robot interaction or smart speaker applications. The
effectiveness of ordinary source separation methods based on statistical models
such as ICA and NMF depends on the analysis window size and cannot handle
reverberation environments. To address these limitations, a short-term source
separation method based on a temporal convolutional network in combination with
compact bilinear pooling is presented. The proposed scheme is virtually
independent of the analysis window size and does not lose effectiveness when
the analysis window is shortened to 1.6s, which in turn is very interesting to
tackle the source separation problem in time-varying scenarios. Also,
improvements in WER as high as 80% were obtained when compared to ICA and NMF
with multi-condition reverberant training and testing, and with time-varying
SNR experiments to simulate a moving target speech source. Finally, the
experiment with the estimation of the clean signal employing the proposed
scheme and a clean trained ASR provided a WER 13% lower than the one obtained
with the corrupted signal and a multi-condition trained ASR. This surprising
result contradicts the widely adopted practice of using multi-condition trained
ASR systems and reinforce the use of speech enhancement methods for user
profiling in HRI environments.

reasonably good matches to available data on high-redshift luminosity
functions. However, these prescriptions are primarily phenomenological, with
only crude connections to the physics of galaxy evolution. Here we introduce a
set of galaxy models that are based on a simple physical framework but
incorporate more sophisticated models of feedback, star formation, and other
processes. We apply these models to the high-redshift regime, showing that most
of the generic predictions of the simplest models remain valid. In particular,
the stellar mass--halo mass relation depends almost entirely on the physics of
feedback (and is thus independent of the details of small-scale star formation)
and the specific star formation rate is a simple multiple of the cosmological
accretion rate. We also show that, in contrast, the galaxy's gas mass is
sensitive to the physics of star formation, although the inclusion of
feedback-driven star formation laws significantly changes the naive
expectations. While these models are far from detailed enough to describe every
aspect of galaxy formation, they inform our understanding of galaxy formation
by illustrating several generic aspects of that process, and they provide a
physically-grounded basis for extrapolating predictions to faint galaxies and
high redshifts currently out of reach of observations. If observations show
violations from these simple trends, they would indicate new physics occurring
inside the earliest generations of galaxies.

order to help fill some of these gaps, we use a population-level dataset of the
social networks of 1,181 U.S. institutions of higher education, ranging from
2008 to 2019, to provide a detailed view of how the structure of college
networks changes over time. The most prominent feature in the evolution of
these networks is the burst in friending activity when students first enter
college. Ties formed during this period play a strong role in shaping the
structure of the networks overall and the students' position within them.
Subsequent starts and breaks from instruction further affect the volume of new
tie formation. Homophily in tie formation likewise shows variation in time.
Same-gender ties are more likely to form when students settle into housing,
while sharing a major spurs friendships as students progress through their
degree. Properties of the college, such as whether many students live on
campus, also modulate these effects. Ties that form in different contexts and
at different points in students' college lives vary in their likelihood of
remaining close years after graduation. Together, these findings suggest that

many data-driven applications, and largely depends on good data representation.
Drawing on literature regarding representation learning, studies suggest that
one key characteristic of good latent representations is the ability to produce
semantically mixed outputs when decoding linear interpolations of two latent
representations. We propose the Mixing Consistent Deep Clustering method which
encourages interpolations to appear realistic while adding the constraint that
interpolations of two data points must look like one of the two inputs. By
applying this training method to various clustering (non-)specific autoencoder
models we found that using the proposed training method systematically changed
the structure of learned representations of a model and it improved clustering
performance for the tested ACAI, IDEC, and VAE models on the MNIST, SVHN, and
CIFAR-10 datasets. These outcomes have practical implications for numerous
real-world clustering tasks, as it shows that the proposed method can be added
to existing autoencoders to further improve clustering performance.

with optical dipole trap depth. Thus, simulations included the Stark shift
based on the known polarizability of the free atoms and assuming their
polarizability remains the same in the bound state. Somewhat surprisingly, we
found that, while including the Stark shift does lead to minor statistical
changes, it does not change the resonance statistics and, therefore, is not

fundamental problem in causal inference. To avoid bias, the effect estimator

significantly increasing the number of data samples required to accurately
estimate the effect due to the increased dimensionality. In this work, we
consider the setting where out of a large number of covariates $X$ that satisfy
strong ignorability, an unknown sparse subset $S$ is sufficient to include to
achieve zero bias, i.e. $c$-equivalent to $X$. We propose a common objective
function involving outcomes across treatment cohorts with nonconvex joint
sparsity regularization that is guaranteed to recover $S$ with high probability
under a linear outcome model for $Y$ and subgaussian covariates for each of the

using only the largest in a sequence of weighted estimators reduces test

greater power in practice. Weights allow for standardization in order to
control for estimator dispersion. In a nonlinear parametric regression

distinctive systems exchanging quanta of energy. By contrast, for very large
coupling strength, the systems hybridize and form compounds that cannot be
described in terms of light or matter only. In this Thesis, we study some
exotic properties which arise in this regime. In particular, we are interested
in the possibility to engineer quantum phase transitions in these systems. One
direction we explore is the study of two-photon coupling, a mechanism in which
matter creates or absorb photons by pairs. This mechanism creates a rich phase
diagram containing both phase transitions and instabilities. A second topic is
the use of these transitions for sensing applications. Indeed, near the
critical point, the system becomes extremely sensitive to external
perturbations. We study a setup in which a single qubit is coupled to a bosonic
field. We show that even this finite-size system displays a phase transition,
which can be used to measure the frequency of the qubit and the field with
improved accuracy. This protocol could be used to develop small-scale sensors.
Finally, we study how the ability of a system to perform certain metrological
tasks could be used to characterize and quantify nonclassicality, by using the
formalism of resource theories. The first three chapters present the main
concepts and key results in the fields of ultrastrong light-matter coupling,
superradiant phase transitions, and quantum metrology. I have strived to write

First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the
early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an
algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the
onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a
hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity
optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed
solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the
problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize
the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize
this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose
an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we
derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model
with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for
non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed
framework in numerical experiments involving a model of Covid-19 applied to a
real human contact network.

complex medical data with high accuracy in noisy real-life environments, but
little is known about DL's utility in non-invasive biometric monitoring during
pregnancy. A recently established self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to DL
provides emotional recognition from electrocardiogram (ECG). We hypothesized
that SSL will identify chronically stressed mother-fetus dyads from the raw
maternal abdominal electrocardiograms (aECG), containing fetal and maternal
ECG. Chronically stressed mothers and controls matched at enrolment at 32 weeks
of gestation were studied. We validated the chronic stress exposure by
psychological inventory, maternal hair cortisol and FSI. We tested two variants
of SSL architecture, one trained on the generic ECG features for emotional
recognition obtained from public datasets and another transfer-learned on a
subset of our data. Our DL models accurately detect the chronic stress exposure
group (AUROC=0.982+/-0.002), the individual psychological stress score
(R2=0.943+/-0.009) and FSI at 34 weeks of gestation (R2=0.946+/-0.013), as well
as the maternal hair cortisol at birth reflecting chronic stress exposure
(0.931+/-0.006). The best performance was achieved with the DL model trained on
the public dataset and using maternal ECG alone. The present DL approach
provides a novel source of physiological insights into complex multi-modal
relationships between different regulatory systems exposed to chronic stress.
The final DL model can be deployed in low-cost regular ECG biosensors as a
simple, ubiquitous early stress detection and monitoring tool during pregnancy.

trapped in local optima when the loss landscape is multi-modal. A directional
Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach was recently proposed in (Zhang et al., 2020)
and used to define a truly nonlocal gradient, referred to as the DGS gradient,
for high-dimensional black-box optimization. Promising results show that
replacing the traditional local gradient with the DGS gradient can
significantly improve the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing
highly multi-modal loss functions. However, the optimal performance of the DGS
gradient may rely on fine tuning of two important hyper-parameters, i.e., the
smoothing radius and the learning rate. In this paper, we present a simple, yet
ingenious and efficient adaptive approach for optimization with the DGS
gradient, which removes the need of hyper-parameter fine tuning. Since the DGS
gradient generally points to a good search direction, we perform a line search
along the DGS direction to determine the step size at each iteration. The
learned step size in turn will inform us of the scale of function landscape in
the surrounding area, based on which we adjust the smoothing radius accordingly
for the next iteration. We present experimental results on high-dimensional
benchmark functions, an airfoil design problem and a game content generation
problem. The AdaDGS method has shown superior performance over several the

choose between matching a pair of requests or delaying them to be matched later

providing an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm that is defined through a series of

  Thereafter we consider the problem given an underlying $n$-points metric. The

whether there exists a solution with small competitive ratio given concave
delays. We show this to be true by extending our single location algorithm and
proving $O(\log n)$ competitiveness. Finally, we turn our focus to the
bichromatic case, wherein requests have polarities and only opposite polarities
may be matched. We show how to alter our former algorithms to again achieve
$O(1)$ and $O(\log n)$ competitiveness for the single location and for the

we then leverage an off-the-shelf pose detector to detect body poses on the

detect possible violations of the social distancing rules. We validate our

been in the center of attention of current colliders such as the CERN Large

Unfortunately, existing multicores and GPUs are unable to harness this

employs a redundant data representation that significantly lowers the memory

generalized time-frequency transform to a higher dimensional time-frequency

approximate such methods using a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach. We consider
cases where the time-frequency representation is redundant, having feature axes
in addition to the time and frequency axes. The proposed QMC method allows
sampling both efficiently and evenly such redundant time-frequency
representations. Indeed, 1) the number of samples required for a certain
accuracy is log-linear in the resolution of the signal space, and depends only
weakly on the dimension of the redundant time-frequency space, and 2) the
quasi-random samples have low discrepancy, so they are spread evenly in the
redundant time-frequency space. One example of such redundant representation is
the localizing time-frequency transform (LTFT), where the time-frequency plane
is enhanced by a third axis. This higher dimensional time-frequency space
improves the quality of some time-frequency signal processing tasks, like the
phase vocoder (an audio signal processing effect). Since the computational
complexity of the QMC is log-linear in the resolution of the signal space, this
higher dimensional time-frequency space does not degrade the computation
complexity of the proposed QMC method. The proposed QMC method is more
efficient than standard Monte Carlo methods, since the deterministic QMC sample
points are optimally spread in the time-frequency space, while random samples
are not.

trace them to their accretion event. We find that the true NSCs accreted by the

face image and to obtain the e-passport. An e-passport with a morphed face
images can be used by both the malicious actor and the accomplice to cross the
border as the morphed face image can be verified against both of them. This can
result in a significant threat as a malicious actor can cross the border
without revealing the track of his/her criminal background while the details of
accomplice are recorded in the log of the access control system. This survey
aims to present a systematic overview of the progress made in the area of face
morphing in terms of both morph generation and morph detection. In this paper,
we describe and illustrate various aspects of face morphing attacks, including
different techniques for generating morphed face images but also the
state-of-the-art regarding Morph Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms based on a
stringent taxonomy and finally the availability of public databases, which
allow to benchmark new MAD algorithms in a reproducible manner. The outcomes of
competitions/benchmarking, vulnerability assessments and performance evaluation
metrics are also provided in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, we discuss
the open challenges and potential future works that need to be addressed in
this evolving field of biometrics.

cache-replacement algorithm. Previous work demonstrated that the competitive
ratio of a large class of online algorithms, including Least-Recently-Used
(LRU), grows with the length of the input. Furthermore, even offline algorithms
like Furthest-In-Future, the optimal algorithm in single-core caching, cannot
compete in the multicore setting. These negative results motivate a more
in-depth comparison of multicore caching algorithms via alternative analysis
measures. Specifically, the power of the adversary to adapt to online
algorithms suggests the need for a direct comparison of online algorithms to
each other.
  In this paper, we introduce cyclic analysis, a generalization of bijective
analysis introduced by Angelopoulos and Schweitzer [JACM'13]. Cyclic analysis
captures the advantages of bijective analysis while offering flexibility that
makes it more useful for comparing algorithms for a variety online problems. In
particular, we take the first steps beyond worst-case analysis for analysis of
multicore caching algorithms. We use cyclic analysis to establish relationships
between multicore caching algorithms, including the advantage of LRU over all
other multicore caching algorithms in the presence of locality of reference.

  Estimation in Multi-Agent Interactions","Submitted to ICRA2021",,,,"cs.RO cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-robot interactions (HRI) can be modeled as dynamic or differential
games with incomplete information, where each agent holds private reward
parameters. Due to the open challenge in finding perfect Bayesian equilibria of
such games, existing studies often consider approximated solutions composed of
parameter estimation and motion planning steps, in order to decouple the belief
and physical dynamics. In parameter estimation, current approaches often assume
that the reward parameters of the robot are known by the humans. We argue that
by falsely conditioning on this assumption, the robot performs non-empathetic
estimation of the humans' parameters, leading to undesirable values even in the
simplest interactions. We test this argument by studying a two-vehicle
uncontrolled intersection case with short reaction time. Results show that when
both agents are unknowingly aggressive (or non-aggressive), empathy leads to
more effective parameter estimation and higher reward values, suggesting that
empathy is necessary when the true parameters of agents mismatch with their
common belief. The proposed estimation and planning algorithms are therefore
more robust than the existing approaches, by fully acknowledging the nature of
information asymmetry in HRI. Lastly, we introduce value approximation
techniques for real-time execution of the proposed algorithms.

coupling to the environment leads to decoherence, which is traditionally
modeled with a Lindblad equation for the system's density matrix. Starting from
a pure state, such a system approaches a steady state (mixed or otherwise) in
an underdamped or overdamped manner. This transition occurs at an eigenvalue
degeneracy of a Lindblad superoperator, called an exceptional point (EP), where
corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recent years have seen an explosion of
interest in creating exceptional points in a truly quantum domain, driven by
the enhanced sensitivity and topological features EPs have shown in their
classical realizations. Here, we present Floquet analysis of a prototypical
qubit whose drive or dissipator strengths are varied periodically. We consider
models with a single dissipator that generate global loss (phase damping) or
mode-selective loss (spontaneous emission). In all cases, we find that periodic
modulations lead to EP lines at small dissipator strengths, and a rich EP
structure in the parameter space. Our analytical and numerical results show
that extending Lindblad Liouvillians to the Floquet domain is a new,
potentially preferred route to accessing exceptional points in the transient
dynamics towards the Lindblad steady state.

obtaining moire-free ground-truth in natural scenes is difficult but needed for
training. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive learning method for
demoireing a high-frequency image, with the help of an additional defocused
moire-free blur image. Given an image degraded with moire artifacts and a
moire-free blur image, our network predicts a moire-free clean image and a blur
kernel with a self-adaptive strategy that does not require an explicit training
stage, instead performing test-time adaptation. Our model has two sub-networks
and works iteratively. During each iteration, one sub-network takes the moire
image as input, removing moire patterns and restoring image details, and the
other sub-network estimates the blur kernel from the blur image. The two
sub-networks are jointly optimized. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can produce high-quality

particular spoofing attacks might generalize badly for unseen attacks. To
overcome these two issues, we develop a novel search space consisting of

propose a novel two-stage deep learning (DL) framework, where the first stage
identifies and crops the thalamus regions from the whole brain MRI and the
second stage performs per-voxel regression on the cropped volume to localize
the targets at the finest resolution scale. To address the issue of data
scarcity, we train the models with the pseudo labels which are created based on
the available labeled data using multi-atlas registration. To assess the
performance of the proposed framework, we validate two sampling-based
uncertainty estimation techniques namely Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDO) and
Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) on the second-stage localization network.
Moreover, we propose a novel uncertainty estimation metric called maximum
activation dispersion (MAD) to estimate the image-wise uncertainty for
localization tasks. Our results show that the proposed method achieved more
robust localization performance than the traditional multi-atlas method and TTA
could further improve the robustness. Moreover, the epistemic and hybrid
uncertainty estimated by MAD could be used to detect the unreliable
localizations and the magnitude of the uncertainty estimated by MAD could
reflect the degree of unreliability for the rejected predictions.

TRAPPIST-1 planets form an unique benchmark system that has gathered the

sub-programs incorporating the latest type objects (T_eff < 3000K): Program1:
365 dwarfs that are small and nearby enough to make possible the detailed
atmospheric characterisation of an `Earth-like' planet with the upcoming JWST,
Program2: 171 dwarfs of M5-type and later for which a significant detection of
a planet similar to TRAPPIST-1b should be within reach of the exoplanet transit
survey TESS, and Program3: 1121 dwarfs later than M6-type that aims to perform
a statistical census of short-period planets around ultracool dwarf stars. Our
compound target list includes 1657 photometrically classified late-type dwarfs.
260 of these targets are classified for the first time as possible nearby
ultracool dwarf stars. Our general observational strategy is to monitor each
target for 100 to 200hr with our telescope network, by efficiently using the
synergy with TESS for our Program2 and a fraction of the targets of Program1.

them being amenable for atmospheric characterisation with JWST and other future
giant telescopes which will improve drastically our understanding of the

approach are performed to investigate the interactions between propagating
shock waves and dispersed evaporating water droplets in two-phase gas-droplet
flows. Two-way coupling for interphase exchanges of mass, momentum and energy
is adopted. Parametric study on shock attenuation, droplet evaporation, motion
and heating is conducted, through considering various initial droplet diameters
(5-20 {\mu}m), number densities (2.5 x 1011 - 2 x 1012 1/m3) and incident shock
Mach numbers (1.17-1.9). It is found that the leading shock may be attenuated
to sonic wave and even subsonic wave when droplet volume fraction is large
and/or incident shock Mach number is low. Attenuation in both strength and
propagation speed of the leading shock is mainly caused by momentum transfer to
the droplets that interact at the shock front. Total pressure recovery is
observed in the evaporation region, whereas pressure loss results from shock
compression, droplet drag and pressure gradient force behind the shock front.
Recompression of the region between the leading shock and two-phase contact
surface is observed when the following compression wave is supersonic. After a
critical point, this region gets stable in width and interphase exchanges in
mass, momentum, and energy. However, the recompression phenomenon is sensitive
to droplet volume fraction and may vanish with high droplet loading. For an
incident shock Mach number of 1.6, recompression only occurs when the initial
droplet volume fraction is below 3.28 x 10-5.

an arbitrary, but complete, set of solution variables while preserving the
structure of the governing equations. Least-squares-based minimization is
leveraged to guarantee symmetrization and discrete consistency with the
full-order model (FOM). Two levels of scaling are used to achieve the
conditioning required to effectively handle problems with extremely disparate
physical phenomena, characterized by extreme stiffness in the system of
equations. The formulation -- referred to as model-form preserving
least-squares with variable transformation (MP-LSVT) -- provides global
stabilization for both implicit and explicit time integration schemes. To
achieve computational efficiency, a pivoted QR decomposition is used with
oversampling, and adapted to the MP-LSVT method. The framework is demonstrated
in representative two- and three-dimensional reacting flow problems, and the
MP-LSVT is shown to exhibit improved stability and accuracy over standard
projection-based ROM techniques. Physical realizability and local stability are
promoted by enforcing limiters in both temperature and species mass fractions.
These limiters are demonstrated to be important in eliminating regions of
spurious burning, thus enabling the ROMs to provide accurate representations of
the heat release rate and flame propagation speed. In the 3D application, it is
shown that more than two orders of magnitude acceleration in computational
efficiency can be achieved, while also providing reasonable future-state
predictions. A key contribution of this work is the development and
demonstration of a comprehensive ROM formulation that targets highly
challenging multi-scale transport-dominated problems.

model of the environment is involved, from methods that are completely
model-free such as model-free RL, to methods that require a known model such as
optimal control, with other methods such as model-based RL somewhere in the
middle. On one end of the spectrum, model-free RL can learn control policies
for high-dimensional (hi-dim), complex robotic tasks through trial-and-error
without knowledge of a model of the environment, but tends to require a large
amount of data. On the other end, ""classical methods"" such as optimal control
generate solutions without collecting data, but assume that an accurate model
of the system and environment is known and are mostly limited to problems with
low-dimensional (lo-dim) state spaces. In this paper, we bring the two ends of
the spectrum together. Although models of hi-dim systems and environments may
not exist, lo-dim approximations of these systems and environments are widely
available, especially in robotics. Therefore, we propose to solve hi-dim,
complex robotic tasks in two stages. First, assuming a coarse model of the
hi-dim system, we compute a lo-dim value function for the lo-dim version of the
problem using classical methods (eg. value iteration and optimal control).
Then, the lo-dim value function is used as a baseline function to warm-start
the model-free RL process that learns hi-dim policies. The lo-dim value
function provides global guidance for model-free RL, alleviating the data
inefficiency of model-free RL. We demonstrate our approach on two robot
learning tasks with hi-dim state spaces and observe significant improvement in
policy performance and learning efficiency. We also give an empirical analysis
of our method with a third task.

aspects associated with the statistical fairness criterion of independence
(statistical parity). To this end, we consider previous work, which discusses

which centers on morality. The most natural moral extension is that
independence needs to be fulfilled if and only if differences in predictive
features (e.g. high school grades and standardized test scores are predictive
of performance at university) between socio-demographic groups are caused by
unjust social disparities or measurement errors. Through two counterexamples,
we demonstrate that this extension is not universally true. This means that the
question of whether independence should be used or not cannot be satisfactorily
answered by only considering the justness of differences in the predictive
features.

nonlinear system dynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the
ability to deal with state and input constraints. However, it involves solving
a PDE, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with
respect to the number of state variables, limiting its direct use to
small-scale systems. We propose DeepReach, a method that leverages new
developments in sinusoidal networks to develop a neural PDE solver for
high-dimensional reachability problems. The computational requirements of
DeepReach do not scale directly with the state dimension, but rather with the
complexity of the underlying reachable tube. DeepReach achieves comparable
results to the state-of-the-art reachability methods, does not require any
explicit supervision for the PDE solution, can easily handle external
disturbances, adversarial inputs, and system constraints, and also provides a
safety controller for the system. We demonstrate DeepReach on a 9D
multi-vehicle collision problem, and a 10D narrow passage problem, motivated by
autonomous driving applications.

snapshot obtained by a coherent antenna array is a well-known problem, which
can be addressed by sparse signal reconstruction methods, where the DOAs are
estimated from the peaks of the recovered high-dimensional signal. In this
paper, we consider a more challenging DOA estimation task where the array is
composed of non-coherent sub-arrays (i.e., sub-arrays that observe different
unknown phase shifts due to using low-cost unsynchronized local oscillators).
We formulate this problem as the reconstruction of a joint sparse and low-rank
matrix and solve its convex relaxation. While the DOAs can be estimated from
the solution of the convex problem, we further show how an improvement is
obtained if instead one estimates from this solution the phase shifts, creates
""phase-corrected"" observations and applies another final (plain, coherent)
sparsity-based DOA estimation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
approach outperforms strategies that are based on non-coherent processing of
the sub-arrays as well as other sparsity-based methods.

  Acknowledgments",,,,"cs.DC cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning recommendation models have grown to the terabyte scale.
Traditional serving schemes--that load entire models to a single server--are
unable to support this scale. One approach to support this scale is with
distributed serving, or distributed inference, which divides the memory
requirements of a single large model across multiple servers.
  This work is a first-step for the systems research community to develop novel
model-serving solutions, given the huge system design space. Large-scale deep
recommender systems are a novel workload and vital to study, as they consume up
to 79% of all inference cycles in the data center. To that end, this work
describes and characterizes scale-out deep learning recommendation inference
using data-center serving infrastructure. This work specifically explores
latency-bounded inference systems, compared to the throughput-oriented training
systems of other recent works. We find that the latency and compute overheads
of distributed inference are largely a result of a model's static embedding
table distribution and sparsity of input inference requests. We further
evaluate three embedding table mapping strategies of three DLRM-like models and
specify challenging design trade-offs in terms of end-to-end latency, compute
overhead, and resource efficiency. Overall, we observe only a marginal latency
overhead when the data-center scale recommendation models are served with the
distributed inference manner--P99 latency is increased by only 1% in the best
case configuration. The latency overheads are largely a result of the commodity
infrastructure used and the sparsity of embedding tables. Even more
encouragingly, we also show how distributed inference can account for
efficiency improvements in data-center scale recommendation serving.

work proposed distributed, heterogeneous MVX systems that leverage different

However, existing distributed MVX system designs suffer from high performance
overhead due to time-consuming network transactions for the MVX system's
operations. This paper presents dMVX, a novel hybrid distributed MVX design,
which incorporates new techniques that significantly reduce the overhead of MVX
systems in a distributed setting. Our key insight is that we can intelligently
reduce the MVX operations that use expensive network transfers. First, we can
limit the monitoring of system calls that are not security-critical. Second, we
observe that, in many circumstances, we can also safely cache or avoid
replication operations needed for I/O related system calls. Our evaluation
shows that dMVX reduces the performance degradation from over 50% to 3.1% for

filaments and eddies which dominate submesoscale (0.1 - 10 km) dynamics are
found to play a crucial role which is quantified here. These coherent
structures are generated and sustained through nonlinear evolution of
baroclinic instability. The collective motion of particles helps identify
common features of transport at the front. It is found that the particles in
the central region organize into inclined lobes, each associated with an eddy,
and the filaments associated with the heavy- and light-edges of the front
transfer edge particles to the lobes. This flux of new particles into the lobe
causes local particles to adjust, which leads to slumping of the front. The
particle motion in the vertical shows multiple time scales -- a fast time scale
with O(10) m vertical displacement within an hour and a slower near-inertial
time scale, comparable to the intrinsic time scale of the growing instability.
The fast time scale motions typically occur in the vortex filaments. The
overall slumping process is slower than what one might anticipate from the
large magnitude of vertical velocity in the filaments and requires a sustained
correlation over time between the lateral and the vertical motion. By tracking

biogeochemical processes within aquatic sediments, which ultimately affect
water quality and nutrient cycling at the watershed scale. The impact of
three-dimensional (3D) and small-scale bed form topographies on hyporheic
exchange and solute mixing is investigated in the present work. The effect of
bed form morphologies on the development of zones of enhanced reaction rates
(i.e., hot spots) is also studied. A computational fluid dynamics model to
simulate river flow over bed forms is combined with a subsurface flow and
multicomponent reactive solute transport model. A wide variety of bed form
topographies are generated using geometric models by varying parameters
controlling curvature as well as bed form wavelength and amplitude. Our results
show that the pressure distribution at the sediment-water interface is strongly
affected by the bed form geometry. Higher phase shifts in bed form shapes
result in overall higher average velocity, larger zones of enhanced pressure
and reaction rates, and higher amounts of solute exchange. Moreover, the bed
form shapes control the reaction process for a wide range of sediment
conductivities. This study advances the understanding of the effects of complex
and small scale morphological features on hyporheic exchange processes.

environment with interference speakers and surrounding noise, given the target
speaker's reference information. Most speaker extraction systems achieve
satisfactory performance on the premise that the test speakers have been
encountered during training time. Such systems suffer from performance
degradation given unseen target speakers and/or mismatched reference voiceprint
information. In this paper we propose a novel strategy named Iterative Refined
Adaptation (IRA) to improve the robustness and generalization capability of
speaker extraction systems in the aforementioned scenarios. Given an initial
speaker embedding encoded by an auxiliary network, the extraction network can
obtain a latent representation of the target speaker, which is fed back to the
auxiliary network to get a refined embedding to provide more accurate guidance
for the extraction network. Experiments on WSJ0-2mix-extr and WHAM! dataset
confirm the superior performance of the proposed method over the network
without IRA in terms of SI-SDR and PESQ improvement.

information to constrain the extrapolation problem. In this constrained
extrapolation problem (CEP) the goal is to find classes of approximants that
give well converged results already for low perturbative truncation orders.
First, we show that standard Pad\'{e} and Borel methods are too restrictive to
give satisfactory results for this CEP. A generalization of Borel extrapolation
is given by the so-called Maximum Entropy extrapolation method (MaxEnt).
However, we show that MaxEnt requires extensive elaborations to be applicable
to the dilute Fermi gas and is thus not practical for the CEP in this case.
Instead, we propose order-dependent-mapping extrapolation (ODME) as a simple,
practical, and general method for the CEP. We find that the ODME approximants
for the ground-state energy of the dilute Fermi gas are robust with respect to
changes of the mapping choice and agree with results from quantum Monte Carlo
simulations within uncertainties.

Besides, DACP owes an excellent property that its computation time is not
influenced by the required number of eigenvalues. Numerical experiments on
Ising spin chain and spin glass shards show the correctness and effciency of
the proposed method. As our results demonstrate, DACP is a factor of 30 faster

correct gauge group is not the full $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb R)$, but a subgroup
$\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb R)_{\partial}$ of gauge transformations that go to
$\text{U}(1)$ local rotations on the boundary. We find four possible classes of

each boundary component independently. Class I has five inequivalent variants,
corresponding to geodesic boundaries of fixed length, cusps, conical defects of
fixed angle or large cylinder-shaped asymptotic regions with boundaries of
fixed lengths and extrinsic curvatures one or greater than one. Class II
precisely reproduces the usual JT gravity. In particular, the crucial extrinsic
curvature boundary term of the usual second order formulation is automatically
generated by the gauge theory boundary term. Class III is a more exotic

cancellation. Different devices may introduce various ref-delay in practice.
Ref-delay inconsistency slows down the convergence of adaptive filters, and
also degrades the performance of deep learning models due to 'unseen'
ref-delays in the training set. In this paper, a multi-task network is proposed
to address both ref-delay estimation and echo cancellation tasks. The proposed
architecture consists of two convolutional recurrent networks (CRNNs) to
estimate the echo and enhanced signals separately, as well as a fully-connected
(FC) network to estimate the echo path delay. Echo signal is first predicted,
and then is combined with reference signal together for delay estimation. At
the end, delay compensated reference and microphone signals are used to predict
the enhanced target signal. Experimental results suggest that the proposed
method makes reliable delay estimation and outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art solutions in inconsistent echo path delay scenarios, in terms
of echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and perceptual evaluation of speech

much attention, such as the variational auto-encoder with non-negative matrix

represent clean speech by shallow models such as Gaussians with a low-rank
covariance, the new approach employs deep generative models to represent the
clean speech, which often provides a better prior. Despite the clear advantage
in theory, we argue that deep priors must be used with much caution, since the
likelihood produced by a deep generative model does not always coincide with
the speech quality. We designed a comprehensive study on this issue and
demonstrated that based on deep speech priors, a reasonable SE performance can
be achieved, but the results might be suboptimal. A careful analysis showed
that this problem is deeply rooted in the disharmony between the flexibility of
deep generative models and the nature of the maximum-likelihood (ML) training.

ideas and propose a model for quantum metamorphism between two DTCs of
different periodicity, a 2T and 4T-DTC. In our model the conditions for

no specific symptoms of early DR lead to a delayed diagnosis, which results in

ophthalmologists need to focus on the discriminative parts of the fundus

among classes is subtle and gradual. Hence, we consider automatic image grading
of DR as a fine-grained classification task, and construct a bilinear model to
identify the pathologically discriminative areas. In order to leverage the
ordinal information among classes, we use an ordinal regression method to
obtain the soft labels. In addition, other than only using a categorical loss
to train our network, we also introduce the metric loss to learn a more
discriminative feature space. Experimental results demonstrate the superior

(SZ)-bright diffuse enhancement toward M31, which might be a Local Hot Bridge
connecting the Milky Way (MW) with M31. We subtract the Galactic emission from
the all-sky O VII and O VIII emission line measurement survey, and find that
the emission of these two ions is enhanced within $r\approx20^\circ$ around
M31. The mean emission enhancements are $5.6\pm 1.3$ L.U., and $2.8\pm0.6$ L.U.
for O VII and O VIII, respectively ($>4\sigma$ for both ions). We also extract
the SZ signal around M31, which suggests a surface brightness $y$ of
$2-4\times10^{-7}$, an enhancement $>2.5\sigma$ (and a best fit of
$5.9\sigma$). These three measurements trace the hot gas with a temperature
$\log~T({\rm K})> 6$, showing similar plateau shapes (flat within
$\approx15^\circ$, and zero beyond $\approx30^\circ$). A single-phase
assumption leads to a temperature of $\log~T({\rm K})=6.34\pm0.03$, which is
determined by the O VII/O VIII line ratio. Combining X-ray and SZ measurements,
we suggest that this feature is unlikely to be the hot halo around M31 (too
massive) or in the MW (too high pressure and X-ray bright). The plateau shape
may be explained by a cylinder connecting the MW and M31 (the Local Hot
Bridge). We constrain its length to be about 400 kpc, with a radius of 120 kpc,
a density of $\approx 2\times10^{-4}-10^{-3} ~\rm cm^{-3}$, and a metallicity
of $0.02-0.1~ Z_\odot$. The baryon mass is $\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\odot$, and the

employ the original architecture of attention-based ASR for ISR tasks by
treating a full-utterance ASR as the teacher model and the ISR as the student
model. We design an alternative student network that, instead of using a
thinner or a shallower model, keeps the original architecture of the teacher
model but with shorter sequences (few encoder and decoder states). Using
attention transfer, the student network learns to mimic the same alignment
between the current input short speech segments and the transcription. Our

distinguishing characteristic of this setting is that the robot has influence

a goal specification of the sorts of event sequences that may be of interest.
This paper examines variants of such problems when the robot aims to collect
sets of observations to meet a rich specification of their sequential

a variant of a hidden Markov model, and specify the event sequences of interest
as a regular language, developing a vocabulary of `mutators' that enable
sophisticated requirements to be expressed. Under different suppositions about

channel state information is obtained by using pilot sequences and the BSs are
deployed randomly. First, we study the channel estimation accuracy and its
impact on the SE as the BS density increases and the network becomes densified.
Second, we consider the special case of uncorrelated channels for which the
stochastic geometry framework helps us to simplify the SE expressions and
obtain the minimum value of antenna-UE ratio over which the pilot contamination
is dominant rather than the inter- and intra-cell interference. Finally, we
provide some insights into the obtained SE for the spatially correlated

result in non-increasing SE in terms of the BS density, their area SE increases
exponentially as the network becomes densified. Moreover, we conclude that in

from states to actions. The main difference between AQL and SPAQL is that the
latter learns time-invariant policies, where the mapping from states to actions
does not depend explicitly on the time step. This paper also proposes the SPAQL
with terminal state (SPAQL-TS), an improved version of SPAQL tailored for the
design of regulators for control problems. The time-invariant policies are
shown to result in a better performance than the time-variant ones in both

the action space is finite, as is the case with the Cartpole problem. SPAQL-TS
solves the OpenAI Gym Cartpole problem, while also displaying a higher sample

nature, with examples ranging from animal foraging to the transport of vesicles
within cells. Most theoretical studies take a searcher-centric viewpoint,
focusing on the first passage time (FTP) problem to find a target. This single
search-and-capture event then triggers a downstream process or provides the
searcher with some resource such as food. In this paper we take a
target-centric viewpoint, by considering the accumulation of resources in one
or more targets due to multiple rounds of search-and-capture events combined
with resource degradation; whenever a searcher finds a target it delivers a
resource packet to the target, after which it escapes and returns to its
initial position. The searcher is then resupplied with cargo and a new search
process is initiated after a random delay. It has previously been show how
queuing theory can be used to derive general expressions for the steady-state
mean and variance of the resulting resource distributions. Here we apply the
theory to some classical FPT problems involving diffusion in simple geometries
with absorbing boundaries, including concentric spheres, wedge domains, and
branching networks. In each case, we determine how the resulting Fano factor
depends on the degradation rate, the delay distribution, and various geometric
parameters. We thus establish that the Fano factor can deviate significantly
from Poisson statistics and exhibits a non-trivial dependence on model
parameters, including non-monotonicity and crossover behavior. This indicates
the non-trivial nature of the higher-order statistics of resource accumulation.

longer have to experience long latency in running their desired programs
locally, but can pay to offload computation tasks to the edge server. Given its
limited storage space, it is important for the edge server at the base station
(BS) to determine which service programs to cache by meeting and guiding WDs'
offloading decisions. In this paper, we propose an MEC service pricing scheme
to coordinate with the service caching decisions and control WDs' task
offloading behavior. We propose a two-stage dynamic game of incomplete
information to model and analyze the two-stage interaction between the BS and
multiple associated WDs. Specifically, in Stage I, the BS determines the MEC
service caching and announces the service program prices to the WDs, with the
objective to maximize its expected profit under both storage and computation
resource constraints. In Stage II, given the prices of different service
programs, each WD selfishly decides its offloading decision to minimize
individual service delay and cost, without knowing the other WDs' desired
program types or local execution delays. Despite the lack of WD's information
and the coupling of all the WDs' offloading decisions, we derive the optimal
threshold-based offloading policy that can be easily adopted by the WDs in
Stage II at the Bayesian equilibrium. Then, by predicting the WDs' offloading
equilibrium, we jointly optimize the BS' pricing and service caching in Stage I
via a low-complexity algorithm. In particular, we study both the uniform and
differentiated pricing schemes. For differentiated pricing, we prove that the
same price should be charged to the cached programs of the same workload.

planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars with radial velocity
technics. Astrometry is in principle less sensitive to stellar activity because
the situation is more favourable: the stellar astrometric signal is expected to
be fainter than the planetary astrometric signal compared to radial velocities.
We quantify the effect of stellar activity on high-precision astrometry when
Earth-mass planets are searched for in the habitable zone around old
main-sequence solar-type stars. We used a very large set of magnetic activity
synthetic time series to characterise the properties of the stellar astrometric
signal. We then studied the detectability of exoplanets based on different
approaches: first based on the theoretical level of false positives derived
from the synthetic time series, and then with blind tests for old main-sequence
F6-K4 stars. The amplitude of the signal can be up to a few times the solar
value depending on the assumptions made for activity level, spectral type, and
spot contrast. The detection rates for 1 MEarth planets are very good, however,
with extremely low false-positive rates in the habitable zone for stars in the
F6-K4 range at 10 pc. The standard false-alarm probability using classical
bootstrapping on the time series strongly overestimates the false-positive
level. This affects the detection rates. We conclude that if technological
challenges can be overcome and very high precision is reached, astrometry is
much more suitable for detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone
around nearby solar-type stars than radial velocity, and detection rates are
much higher for this range of planetary masses and periods when astrometric
techniques are used than with radial velocity techniques.

including applications to concrete problems. It is known that quantum
algorithms based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) can compute an integral
with a smaller number of iterative calls of the quantum circuit which
calculates the integrand, than classical methods call the integrand subroutine.
However, the issues about the iterative operations in the integrand circuit
have not been discussed so much. That is, in the high-dimensional integration,
many random numbers are used for calculation of the integrand and in some cases
similar calculations are repeated to obtain one sample value of the integrand.
In this paper, we point out that we can reduce the number of such repeated
operations by a combination of the nested QAE and the use of pseudorandom
numbers (PRNs), if the integrand has the separable form with respect to
contributions from distinct random numbers. The use of PRNs, which the authors
originally proposed in the context of the quantum algorithm for Monte Carlo, is
the key factor also in this paper, since it enables parallel computation of the
separable terms in the integrand. Furthermore, we pick up one use case of this
method in finance, the credit portfolio risk measurement, and estimate to what
extent the complexity is reduced.

computer vision tasks despite large computation overhead against efficient
deployment. Structured (channel) pruning is usually applied to reduce the model
redundancy while preserving the network structure, such that the pruned network
can be easily deployed in practice. However, existing structured pruning
methods require hand-crafted rules which may lead to tremendous pruning space.
In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Annealing Indicator Search (DAIS)
that leverages the strength of neural architecture search in the channel
pruning and automatically searches for the effective pruned model with given
constraints on computation overhead. Specifically, DAIS relaxes the binarized
channel indicators to be continuous and then jointly learns both indicators and
model parameters via bi-level optimization. To bridge the non-negligible
discrepancy between the continuous model and the target binarized model, DAIS
proposes an annealing-based procedure to steer the indicator convergence
towards binarized states. Moreover, DAIS designs various regularizations based
on a priori structural knowledge to control the pruning sparsity and to improve
model performance. Experimental results show that DAIS outperforms
state-of-the-art pruning methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

poisoning attacks that inject a backdoor into the global model. These attacks
are effective even when performed by a single client, and undetectable by most
existing defensive techniques. In this paper, we propose Backdoor detection via
Feedback-based Federated Learning (BAFFLE), a novel defense to secure FL
against backdoor attacks. The core idea behind BAFFLE is to leverage data of
multiple clients not only for training but also for uncovering model poisoning.
We exploit the availability of diverse datasets at the various clients by
incorporating a feedback loop into the FL process, to integrate the views of
those clients when deciding whether a given model update is genuine or not. We
show that this powerful construct can achieve very high detection rates against
state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, even when relying on straightforward methods
to validate the model. Through empirical evaluation using the CIFAR-10 and
FEMNIST datasets, we show that by combining the feedback loop with a method
that suspects poisoning attempts by assessing the per-class classification
performance of the updated model, BAFFLE reliably detects state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks with a detection accuracy of 100% and a false-positive rate
below 5%. Moreover, we show that our solution can detect adaptive attacks aimed
at bypassing the defense.

circular milling behaviour, both in shallow pools at the beach and in Petri

experiment and theory, from a fluid dynamical viewpoint, focusing on the effect
that an established circular mill has on the surrounding fluid. Unlike systems
such as confined bacterial suspensions and collections of molecular motors and
filaments that exhibit spontaneous circulatory behaviour, and which are
modelled as force dipoles, the front-back symmetry of individual worms
precludes a stresslet contribution. Instead, singularities such as source
dipoles and Stokes quadrupoles are expected to dominate. A series of models is
analyzed to understand the contributions of these singularities to the
azimuthal flow fields generated by a mill, in light of the particular boundary
conditions that hold for flow in a Petri dish. A model that treats a circular
mill as a rigid rotating disc that generates a Stokes flow is shown to capture
basic experimental results well, and gives insights into the emergence and
stability of multiple mill systems.

super-asymptotic giant branch stars with a degenerate O+Ne+Mg core, and
electron capture onto Ne and Mg nuclei should initiate core collapse. However,
no supernovae have unequivocally been identified from an electron-capture

necessitate accounting for the curvature of the Sun, both in interpreting
systematic trends introduced in measurements as well as the sensitivity kernel

Additionally the inverse problem that relates measurements to model parameters
needs to be well-posed to obtain accurate inferences, which necessitates a
sparse set of parameters. Further, the sensitivity functions need to be
computationally easy to evaluate. In this work we address these issues by
demonstrating that the sensitivity kernels for flow velocities may be computed
efficiently in a basis of vector spherical harmonics. We are also able to
account for line-of-sight projections in Doppler measurements, as well as
center-to-limb differences in line-formation heights. We show that given the
assumed spherical symmetry of the background model, it is often cheap to
simultaneously compute the kernels for pairs of observation points that are
related by a rotation. Such an approach is therefore particularly well-suited
to inverse problems for large-scale flows in the Sun, such as meridional

few theoretical studies of FNs, even in equilibrium. In this paper, we study
the non-equilibrium phenomenon of domain growth after a thermal quench (or
coarsening) in this coupled system. Our modeling is based on coupled
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations for two order parameters: the
LC tensor order parameter ${\bf Q}$, and the magnetization ${\bf M}$. We
consider both shallow and deep quenches from a high-temperature disordered
phase. The system coarsens by the collision and annihilation of topological
defects. We focus on slaved coarsening, where a disordered ${\bf Q}$ (or ${\bf
M}$) field is driven to coarsen by an ordered ${\bf M}$ (or ${\bf Q}$) field.
We present detailed results for the morphologies and growth laws, which exhibit
unusual features purely due to the magneto-nematic coupling. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study of non-equilibrium phenomena in FNs.

Unrestricted use of herbicide for weed removal alters biodiversity and cause

selective chemical treatment of these regions. Advances in analyzing farm

of these approaches are based on supervised learning methods which requires
huge amount of manually annotated images. As a result, these supervised
approaches are economically infeasible for the individual farmer because of the
wide variety of plant species being cultivated. In this paper, we propose a
deep learning-based semi-supervised approach for robust estimation of weed

acquired from autonomous robots. This weed density and distribution can be
useful in a site-specific weed management system for selective treatment of

infected regions are identified using a fine-tuned CNN, eliminating the need
for designing hand-crafted features. The approach is validated on two datasets

consists of carrot plant images and the (2) Sugar Beets dataset. The proposed
method is able to localize weed-infested regions a maximum recall of 0.99 and

language of Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT). As an interesting specific
case, we map the large deviations of current in the ASEP to the large
deviations of activity in the SSEP, thereby uncovering a regime of
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang in the distribution of activity in the SSEP. At large
activity, particle configurations exhibit hyperuniformity [Jack et al., PRL 114

the hyperuniform regime by evaluating the small wavenumber asymptotic behavior

results a conjecture for a correlation function in spin chains at any fixed
total magnetization (in the thermodynamic limit). In addition, we generalize
the mapping to the case of two open ASEPs with boundary reservoirs, and we
apply it in the WASEP limit in the MFT formalism. This mapping also allows us
to find a symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transition (DPT) in the WASEP

nuclear experiments, they provide a scope for studying the nature of dense
matter under extreme conditions. The composition of the inner core of neutron
stars is highly uncertain, and it is speculated that exotic forms of matter
such as hyperons may appear there. Gravitational waves emitted by unstable
oscillation modes in neutron stars contain information about their interior
composition and therefore allow us to probe the interior directly. Recently, a
systematic investigation of f-mode oscillations in neutron stars revealed the
role of the uncertainty in nuclear saturation parameters, particularly the
effective nucleon mass, on its frequency. In this work, we study the influence
of the appearance of hyperons on f-mode oscillation frequencies and therefore
on the emission of gravitational waves. We also speculate whether a future
detection of f-mode frequencies could provide a possibility of probing the
presence of hyperons in the neutron star core.

of polarimeter optimized for the measurement of the B-mode polarization of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is one of the major challenges of
observational cosmology. The signal is expected to be of the order of a few
tens of nK, prone to instrumental systematic effects and polluted by various
astrophysical foregrounds which can only be controlled through multichroic
observations. QUBIC is designed to address these observational issues with a
novel approach that combines the advantages of interferometry in terms of
control of instrumental systematic effects with those of bolometric detectors
in terms of wide-band, background-limited sensitivity. The QUBIC synthesized
beam has a frequency-dependent shape that results in the ability to produce
maps of the CMB polarization in multiple sub-bands within the two physical
bands of the instrument (150 and 220 GHz). These features make QUBIC
complementary to other instruments and makes it particularly well suited to
characterize and remove Galactic foreground contamination. In this article,
first of a series of eight, we give an overview of the QUBIC instrument design,
the main results of the calibration campaign, and present the scientific
program of QUBIC including not only the measurement of primordial B-modes, but
also the measurement of Galactic foregrounds. We give forecasts for typical
observations and measurements: with three years of integration on the sky and
assuming perfect foreground removal as well as stable atmospheric conditions
from our site in Argentina, our simulations show that we can achieve a
statistical sensitivity to the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio (including
primordial and foreground B-modes) $\sigma(r)=0.015$.

evaluate the quality of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ layers, via in-situ monitoring of
the perovskite layer charge carrier dynamics during the thermal annealing
crystallization process, by means of time-resolved femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy (TAS). In particular, CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ films were
deposited on two types of polymeric hole transport layers (HTL),
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and
poly-(triarylamine) (PTAA), that are known to provide different carrier
transport characteristics in perovskite solar cells. In order to monitor the
evolution of the perovskite charge carrier dynamics during the crystallization
process, the so-formed CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$/HTL architectures were studied
in-situ by TAS at three different annealing temperatures, i.e. 90, 100 and 110
oC. It is revealed that the annealing time period required in order to achieve
the optimum perovskite film quality in terms of the decay dynamics strongly
depends on the annealing temperature, as well as, on the employed HTL. For both
HTLs, the required period decreases as higher annealing temperature is used,
while, for the more hydrophobic PTAA polymer, longer annealing periods were
required in order to obtain the optimum charge carrier dynamics. The
correlation of the TAS finding with the structural and morphological features
of the perovskite films is analysed and provides useful insights on the charge
extraction dynamics and recombination processes in perovskite optoelectronic

non-hydrostatic variation of the disc scale height around each orbit. As a
complement to numerical simulations carried out by other groups, we investigate
the dynamical structure of TDE discs using the nonlinear theory of eccentric
accretion discs. In particular, we study the variation of physical quantities

structure, as well as viscous dissipation and radiative cooling. The solutions
include a structure similar to the nozzle-like structure seen in simulations.

metal/oxide interfaces is a key element in building out-of-plane magnetized
magnetic tunnel junctions for spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access
memory (STT-MRAM). Size downscaling renders magnetic properties more sensitive
to thermal effects. Thus, understanding the temperature dependence of the
magnetic anisotropy is crucial. In this work, we theoretically address the
correlation between temperature dependence of PMA and magnetization in typical
Fe/MgO-based structures. In particular, the possible mechanisms behind the
experiments reporting deviations from the Callen and Callen scaling power law
are analyzed. At ideal interfaces, first-principles calculations reveal (i)
small high-order anisotropy constants compared to first order and (ii) enhanced
exchange constants. Considering these two intrinsic effects in the atomistic
simulations, the temperature-dependence of the total and layer-resolved
anisotropy are found to follow the Callen and Callen scaling power law, thus
ruling out an intrinsic microscopic mechanism underlying deviations from this
law. Besides, two possible extrinsic macroscopic mechanisms are unveiled namely
the influence of the dead layer, often present in the storage layer of STT-MRAM
cells, and the spatial inhomogeneities of the interfacial magnetic anisotropy.
About the first mechanism, we show that the presence of a dead layer tends to
reduce the scaling exponents. In the second mechanism, increasing the
percentage of inhomogeneity in the interfacial PMA is revealed to decrease the
scaling exponent. These results allow us to explain the difference in scaling
exponents relating anisotropy and magnetization thermal variations reported in

Galactic radiation, in the context of Cosmic Microwave Background experiments

(GANs) to learn and reproduce complex features present in a set of images, with
the goal of simulating realistic and non-Gaussian foreground radiation at
sub-degree angular scales. This is of great importance in order to estimate the
foreground contamination to lensing reconstruction, de-lensing and primordial
B-modes, for future CMB experiments. We applied this algorithm to Galactic
thermal dust emission in both total intensity and polarization. Our results
show how ForSE is able to generate small scale features (at 12 arc-minutes)
having as input the large scale ones (80 arc-minutes). The injected structures
have statistical properties, evaluated by means of the Minkowski functionals,
in good agreement with those of the real sky and which show the correct
amplitude scaling as a function of the angular dimension. The obtained thermal
dust Stokes Q and U full sky maps as well as the ForSE package are publicly

then unifying them over the same structure. It represents information at the
semantic level only, where labelled patterns are aggregated into a
'type-set-match' form. It is described that the aggregations can be used to
match across regions with potentially different functionality and therefore
give the structure a required amount of flexibility. The theory is that if the
model stores information which can be transposed in consistent ways, then that
will result in knowledge and some level of intelligence. As part of the design,
patterns have to become distinct and that is realised by unique paths through
shared aggregated structures. An ensemble-hierarchy relation also helps to
define uniqueness through local feedback that may even be an action potential.
The earlier models are still consistent in terms of their proposed
functionality, but some of the architecture boundaries have been moved to match
them up more closely. After pattern optimisation and tree-like aggregations,
the two main models differ only in their upper, more intelligent level. One
provides a propositional logic for mutually inclusive or exclusive pattern
groups and sequences, while the other provides a behaviour script that is
constructed from node types. It can be seen that these two views are
complimentary and would allow some control over behaviours, as well as
memories, that might get selected.

the network is assumed to be a tree or an anonymous ring, or a general graph,
and the sizes of RPLSs' labels are analyzed. We also address the question of

an RPLS for any distributed task for a family of graphs with unique identities.
For the case of anonymous networks (even for the special case of rings),
interestingly, it is known that no token passing algorithm is possible even if
the number n of nodes is known. Nevertheless, we show that an RPLS is possible.

and journalistic fact checking. In the last two decades, numerous algorithms
have been proposed for obtaining information on the source camera and
distribution history of an image. For a fair ranking of these techniques, it is
important to rigorously assess their performance on practically relevant test
cases. To this end, a number of datasets have been proposed. However, we argue
that there is a gap in existing databases: to our knowledge, there is currently
no dataset that simultaneously satisfies two goals, namely a) to cleanly
separate scene content and forensic traces, and b) to support realistic
post-processing like social media recompression. In this work, we propose the
Forchheim Image Database (FODB) to close this gap. It consists of more than
23,000 images of 143 scenes by 27 smartphone cameras, and it allows to cleanly
separate image content from forensic artifacts. Each image is provided in 6
different qualities: the original camera-native version, and five copies from
social networks. We demonstrate the usefulness of FODB in an evaluation of
methods for camera identification. We report three findings. First, the
recently proposed general-purpose EfficientNet remarkably outperforms several
dedicated forensic CNNs both on clean and compressed images. Second,
classifiers obtain a performance boost even on unknown post-processing after
augmentation by artificial degradations. Third, FODB's clean separation of
scene content and forensic traces imposes important, rigorous boundary
conditions for algorithm benchmarking.

adjustable parameters by curing the shortcoming of classical models. We uncover
that the abnormally low hole mobility in Si originating from a combination of
the strong interband scattering resulting from its weak spin-orbit coupling and
the intensive participation of optical phonons in hole-phonon scattering. In
contrast, the strong spin-orbit coupling in Ge leads to a negligible interband
scattering; the strong bond and light atom mass in diamond give rise to high
optical phonons frequency, preventing their participation in scattering. Based
on these understandings rooted into the fundamental atomic properties, we

understand what properties are well-constrained and why. We conclude that
existing astrometric measurements cannot constrain the spin of the Galactic
Center black hole. Extrapolating to the precision and cadence of future
experiments, we anticipate that the black hole spin can be measured with the
known star S2. Our calculations show that we can measure the dimensionless
black hole spin to a precision of $\sim$0.1 with weekly measurements of the
orbit of S2 for 40 years using the GRAVITY telescope's best resolution at the
Galactic Center. An analytic expression is derived for the measurement
uncertainty of the black hole spin using the Fisher matrix in terms of
observation strategy, star's orbital parameters, and instrument resolution.
From it, we conclude that highly eccentric orbits can provide better
constraints on the spin and that an orbit with a higher eccentricity is more
favorable even when the orbital period is longer. We also apply it to S62,
S4711, and S4714 and show whether they can constrain the black hole spin sooner
than S2. If in addition, future measurements include the discovery of a new,
tighter stellar orbit, then future data could conceivably enable tests of
strong field gravity, by directly measuring the black hole quadrupole moment.

fact that autoregressive flow architectures define an ordering over variables,
analogous to a causal ordering, to show that they are well-suited to performing
a range of causal inference tasks, ranging from causal discovery to making
interventional and counterfactual predictions. First, we show that causal
models derived from both affine and additive autoregressive flows with fixed
orderings over variables are identifiable, i.e. the true direction of causal
influence can be recovered. This provides a generalization of the additive
noise model well-known in causal discovery. Second, we derive a bivariate
measure of causal direction based on likelihood ratios, leveraging the fact
that flow models can estimate normalized log-densities of data. Third, we
demonstrate that flows naturally allow for direct evaluation of both
interventional and counterfactual queries, the latter case being possible due
to the invertible nature of flows. Finally, throughout a series of experiments

is more reliable than the Gaia DR2 parallax. The helium content of HD27130 and
thus of the Hyades is found to be $Y=0.27$ but with significant model

discriminate the generated image and output a scalar, which inevitably lose the

to fill the missing regions, and the detector using weakly supervised learning
localizes the position of artifacts in a pixel-wise manner. Such position
information makes the generator pay attention to artifacts and further enhance
them. More importantly, we explicitly insert the output of the detector into
the reconstruction loss with a weighting criterion, which balances the weight
of the adversarial loss and reconstruction loss automatically rather than
manual operation. Experiments on multiple public datasets show the superior

and effectiveness. In recent years, many code search studies have leveraged
different techniques, such as deep learning and information retrieval
approaches, to retrieve expected code from a large-scale codebase. However,
there is a lack of a comprehensive comparative summary of existing code search
approaches. To understand the research trends in existing code search studies,
we systematically reviewed 81 relevant studies. We investigated the publication
trends of code search studies, analyzed key components, such as codebase,
query, and modeling technique used to build code search tools, and classified
existing tools into focusing on supporting seven different search tasks. Based
on our findings, we identified a set of outstanding challenges in existing
studies and a research roadmap for future code search research.

detection, e.g., MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. However, these detectors fail in
certain application scenarios, e.g., tiny object detection. In this paper, we
argue that the top-down connections between adjacent layers in FPN bring
two-side influences for tiny object detection, not only positive. We propose a
novel concept, fusion factor, to control information that deep layers deliver
to shallow layers, for adapting FPN to tiny object detection. After series of
experiments and analysis, we explore how to estimate an effective value of
fusion factor for a particular dataset by a statistical method. The estimation
is dependent on the number of objects distributed in each layer. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on tiny object detection datasets, e.g., TinyPerson
and Tiny CityPersons. Our results show that when configuring FPN with a proper
fusion factor, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains
over the baseline on tiny object detection datasets. Codes and models will be

$q_{R,A}(x)=0$ for $x<R$ and $q_{R,A}(x)=A$ for $x>R$, where $A>0$ and $R>0$

species of the S-bearing chemistry, in protoplanetary disks. To analyse the
observed distributions in light of the H2CS binding energy, in order to discuss
the role of thermal desorption in enriching the gas disk component. Methods: In
the context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in the Taurus
star forming region (ALMA-DOT), we observed five Class I or early Class II
sources with the o-H2CS(7_1,6-6_1,5) line on a 40 au scale. We estimated the
binding energy (BEs) of H2CS using quantum mechanical calculations, for the
first time, for an extended, periodic, crystalline ice. Results: We imaged H2CS
in two rotating molecular rings in the HL Tau and IRAS04302+2247 disks. The
outer radii are about 140 au (HL Tau), and 115 au (IRAS 04302+2247). The
edge-on geometry of IRAS 04302+2247 reveals that H2CS emission peaks, at radii
of 60-115 au, at z = +- 50 au from the equatorial plane. The column densities
are about 10^14 cm^-2. For HL Tau, we derive, for the first time, the
[H2CS]/[H] abundance in a protoplanetary disk (about 10^-14). The BEs of H2CS
computed for extended crystalline ice and amorphous ices is 4258 K and
3000-4600 K, respectively, implying a thermal evaporation where dust
temperature is larger than 50-80 K. Conclusions: H2CS traces the so-called warm
molecular layer, a region previously sampled using CS, and H2CO.
Thioformaldehyde peaks closer to the protostar than H2CO and CS, plausibly due
to the relatively high-excitation level of observed 7_1,6-6_1,5 line (60 K).
The H2CS BEs implies that thermal desorption dominates in thin, au-sized, inner
and/or upper disk layers, indicating that the observed H2CS emitting up to
radii larger than 100 au is likely injected in the gas due to non-thermal
processes.

to the large computational complexity of deformable registration of volumetric
images, conventional iterative methods usually face the tradeoff between the
registration accuracy and the computation time in practice. In order to boost
the registration performance in both accuracy and runtime, we propose a fast
convolutional neural network. Specially, to efficiently utilize the memory
resources and enlarge the model capacity, we adopt additive forwarding instead
of channel concatenation and deepen the network in each encoder and decoder
stage. To facilitate the learning efficiency, we leverage skip connection
within the encoder and decoder stages to enable residual learning and employ an
auxiliary loss at the bottom layer with lowest resolution to involve deep
supervision. Particularly, the low-resolution auxiliary loss is weighted by an
exponentially decayed parameter during the training phase. In conjunction with
the main loss in high-resolution grid, a coarse-to-fine learning strategy is
achieved. Last but not least, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on the
segmentation prior to improve the registration performance in Dice score.
Comparing to the auxiliary loss using average Dice score, the proposed
multi-label segmentation loss does not induce additional memory cost in the
training phase and can be employed on images with arbitrary amount of
categories. In the experiments, we show FDRN outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art registration methods for brain MR images by resorting to the
compact network structure and efficient learning. Besides, FDRN is a
generalized framework for image registration which is not confined to a
particular type of medical images or anatomy.

  Conclusions. We warn against uncritically relying on transitions, which are
strongly affected by direct or indirect line-overlap effects. The predicted
UV-continuum depression for the coolest grid-models needs to be checked, both
observationally, and regarding the underlying atomic data. Wind lines from
""super-ionized"" ions such as OVI can, in principle, be used to constrain the

explicit (smooth, non-formal) universal formula $S_\pi$ for integrating any
Poisson structure $\pi$ on a coordinate space. The second result involves the
relation to semiclassical quantization. We show that the formal Taylor
expansion of $S_{t\pi}$ around $t=0$ yields an extract of Kontsevich's star

by Cattaneo, Dherin and Felder in [6]. The third result involves the relation
to semiclassical aspects of the Poisson Sigma model. We show that $S_\pi$ can
be obtained by non-perturbative functional methods, evaluating a certain
functional on families of solutions of a PDE on a disk, for which we show
existence and classification.

subset selection (BASS), is proposed for learning efficacious sampling patterns
(SPs) with the purpose of reducing scan time in large-dimensional parallel MRI.
Methods: BASS is applicable when Cartesian fully-sampled k-space data of
specific anatomy is available for training and the reconstruction method is
specified, learning which k-space points are more relevant for the specific
anatomy and reconstruction in recovering the non-sampled points. BASS was
tested with four reconstruction methods for parallel MRI based on low-rankness
and sparsity that allow a free choice of the SP. Two datasets were tested, one
of the brain images for high-resolution imaging and another of knee images for
quantitative mapping of the cartilage. Results: BASS, with its low
computational cost and fast convergence, obtained SPs 100 times faster than the
current best greedy approaches. Reconstruction quality increased up to 45\%
with our learned SP over that provided by variable density and Poisson disk
SPs, considering the same scan time. Optionally, the scan time can be nearly
halved without loss of reconstruction quality. Conclusion: Compared with
current approaches, BASS can be used to rapidly learn effective SPs for various
reconstruction methods, using larger SP and larger datasets. This enables a
better selection of efficacious sampling-reconstruction pairs for specific MRI
problems.

Moreover, we empirically argue against the strict dependency between the

generated automatically by the system to conduct DL serving benchmarks.
Finally, developers can leverage many analysis tools and models in our system

addition, a two-tier scheduler is incorporated to avoid unnecessary
interference and improve average job compilation time by up to 1.43x
(equivalent of 30\% reduction). Our system design follows the best practice in
DL clusters operations to expedite day-to-day DL service evaluation efforts by

supports the existence of pronounced 'SDAK dips' on basal surfaces near -4 C

edge-associated surface diffusion greatly reduces the nucleation barrier on
narrow facet surfaces relative to that found on broad facets. The remarkable

that these two SDAK features arise from essentially the same physical mechanism
occurring at different temperatures on the two principal facets. When applied

the multi-IRS aided downlink communication in a massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system, where a multi-antenna BS simultaneously serves
multiple remote single-antenna users with orthogonal beams reflected by
multiple IRSs. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) link between each pair of
selected IRSs, a multi-hop cascaded LoS link can be established between the BS
and each user via their cooperative beam routing. Under this setup, we optimize
the selected IRSs and their beam routing path for each user, along with the
BS/IRS active/passive beamforming such that the minimum received signal power
among all users is maximized, subject to a new multi-beam routing path
separation constraint for avoiding the inter-user/route interference. To tackle
this problem, we first derive the optimal BS/IRS active/passive beamforming in
closed-form for any given beam routes and show the beam routing optimization is
NP-complete by recasting it as an equivalent graph-optimization problem. To
solve this challenging problem, we then propose an efficient recursive
algorithm to partially enumerate the feasible solutions, which effectively
balances the performance-complexity trade-off by tuning its design parameter.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve

probabilities. The basic assumptions are simple: One world exists. Humans can
understand its properties by formulating laws based on probabilities. Our
probabilistic setting only employs the notions of a probability distribution,
observables and their expectation values, which are computed according to the
classical statistical rule. Time is an ordering structure among observables.
Understanding the probabilistic laws enables humans to make predictions for
future events. Also space, spacetime and geometry emerge as structures among
observables.
  Within the classical statistical system the time structure induces the
concepts of wave functions, density matrices, non-commuting operators and many
other aspects of quantum physics. The classical density matrix encodes the
probabilistic information of a time-local subsystem. Subsystems are typically
correlated with their environment, offering a much richer structure than
discussed commonly. We pay particular attention to subsystems with incomplete
statistics and probabilistic observables.
  Quantum systems are particular time-local subsystems that follow an unitary
evolution law. All laws of quantum mechanics are derived from the basic law for
expectation values in classical statistics. In particular, we discuss entangled
quantum systems in terms of classical probability distributions. In our
approach quantum field theories have to be described by an overall probability
distribution for the whole Universe for all times. The fundamental functional
integral for quantum field theories should define a probability distribution,
underlying the functional integral with Minkowski signature.
  While this work remains in the context of theoretical physics, the concepts
developed here apply to a wide area of science.

  Meta-Risk Minimization","Submitted",,,,"cs.LG cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Meta-learning automatically infers an inductive bias by observing data from a
number of related tasks. The inductive bias is encoded by hyperparameters that
determine aspects of the model class or training algorithm, such as
initialization or learning rate. Meta-learning assumes that the learning tasks
belong to a task environment, and that tasks are drawn from the same task
environment both during meta-training and meta-testing. This, however, may not
hold true in practice. In this paper, we introduce the problem of transfer
meta-learning, in which tasks are drawn from a target task environment during
meta-testing that may differ from the source task environment observed during
meta-training. Novel information-theoretic upper bounds are obtained on the
transfer meta-generalization gap, which measures the difference between the
meta-training loss, available at the meta-learner, and the average loss on
meta-test data from a new, randomly selected, task in the target task
environment. The first bound, on the average transfer meta-generalization gap,
captures the meta-environment shift between source and target task environments
via the KL divergence between source and target data distributions. The second,
PAC-Bayesian bound, and the third, single-draw bound, account for this shift
via the log-likelihood ratio between source and target task distributions.
Furthermore, two transfer meta-learning solutions are introduced. For the
first, termed Empirical Meta-Risk Minimization (EMRM), we derive bounds on the
average optimality gap. The second, referred to as Information Meta-Risk
Minimization (IMRM), is obtained by minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. IMRM is
shown via experiments to potentially outperform EMRM.

theory; in principle they allow us to solve counterfactuals, which are at the
top rung of the ladder of causation. But they often contain latent variables
that limit their application to special settings. This appears to be a
consequence of the fact, proven in this paper, that causal inference is NP-hard
even in models characterised by polytree-shaped graphs. To deal with such a
hardness, we introduce the causal EM algorithm. Its primary aim is to
reconstruct the uncertainty about the latent variables from data about
categorical manifest variables. Counterfactual inference is then addressed via
standard algorithms for Bayesian networks. The result is a general method to
approximately compute counterfactuals, be they identifiable or not (in which
case we deliver bounds). We show empirically, as well as by deriving credible
intervals, that the approximation we provide becomes accurate in a fair number

and the controller, the notion of invariance entropy quantifies the smallest
average rate of information above which a given compact subset of the state
space can be made invariant. There exist different versions of this quantity
for deterministic and uncertain systems, which are equivalent in the
deterministic case. In this work, we present algorithms for the numerical
computation of these two quantities. In particular, given a subset $Q$ of the
state set, we first partition it. Then a controller, in the form of a lookup
table that assigns a set of control values to each cell of the partition, is
computed to enforce invariance of $Q$. After determinizing the controller, a
weighted directed graph is constructed. For deterministic systems, the
logarithm of the spectral radius of a transition matrix obtained from the graph
gives an upper bound of the entropy. For uncertain systems, the maximum mean
cycle weight of the graph upper bounds the entropy. With three deterministic
examples, for which the exact value of the invariance entropy is known or can
be estimated by other means, we demonstrate that the upper bound obtained by
our algorithm is of the same order of magnitude as the actual value.
Additionally, our algorithm provides a static coder-controller scheme
corresponding to the obtained data-rate bound. Finally, we present the computed
upper bounds of invariance entropy for an uncertain linear control system as
well.

different kinds of human behavior can greatly help institutions for improving

the financial system that lead them to achieve their goals. In this paper, we
tackle these tasks as a behavior-traces classification task. An observer agent
tries to learn characterizing other agents by observing their behavior when
taking actions in a given environment. The other agents can be of several types
and the goal of the observer is to identify the type of the other agent given a
trace of observations. We present CABBOT, a learning technique that allows the
agent to perform on-line classification of the type of planning agent whose
behavior is observing. In this work, the observer agent has partial and noisy
observability of the environment (state and actions of the other agents). In
order to evaluate the performance of the learning technique, we have generated
a domain-independent goal-based simulator of agents. We present experiments in
several (both financial and non-financial) domains with promising results.

using a hybrid loss function that merges ultra-high model compression with
robust adversarial training. This training strategy dynamically adjusts
inter-layer connectivity based on per-layer normalized momentum computed from
the hybrid loss function. In contrast to existing robust pruning frameworks
that require multiple training iterations, the proposed learning strategy
achieves an overall target pruning ratio with only a single training iteration
and can be tuned to support both irregular and structured channel pruning. To
evaluate the merits of DNR, experiments were performed with two widely accepted
models, namely VGG16 and ResNet-18, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 as well as with
VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet. Compared to the baseline uncompressed models, DNR
provides over20x compression on all the datasets with no significant drop in

show that DNR consistently finds compressed models with better clean and

ignited a lot of research on team formation, where experts acquiring different
skills form teams to complete tasks. The core idea in this line of work has
been the strict requirement that the team of experts assigned to complete a
given task should contain a superset of the skills required by the task.
However, in many applications the required skills are often a wishlist of the
entity that posts the task and not all of the skills are absolutely necessary.
Thus, in our setting we relax the complete coverage requirement and we allow
for tasks to be partially covered by the formed teams, assuming that the
quality of task completion is proportional to the fraction of covered skills
per task. At the same time, we assume that when multiple tasks need to be
performed, the less the load of an expert the better the performance. We
combine these two high-level objectives into one and define the BalancedTA
problem. We also consider a generalization of this problem where each task
consists of required and optional skills. In this setting, our objective is the
same under the constraint that all required skills should be covered. From the

billion years. For the first several hundred million years of its existence, it
was a dark, opaque void. After that, the hydrogen atoms comprising most of the
""ordinary"" matter began to condense and ionize, eventually forming the first
stars that would illuminate the sky. Details of how these ""primordial"" stars
formed have been widely debated, but remain elusive. A central issue in this
process is the mechanism by which the primordial gas (mainly hydrogen and
helium atoms) collected via the action of dark matter cools and further
accretes to fusion densities. Current models invoke collisional excitation of
H$_2$ molecular rotations and subsequent radiative rotational transitions
allowed by the weak molecular quadrupole moment. In this article, we review the
salient considerations, and present some new ideas, bases on recent
spectroscopic observations of neutral H$_3$ Rydberg electronic state emission
in the mid-infrared.

brains. We do not yet understand how it is done with limited neural resources.
The challenges of spatial cognition are discussed under the criteria: (a)
scaling of computational costs; (b) feature binding; (c) precise calculation of
spatial displacements; (d) fast learning of invariant patterns; and (e)
exploiting the strong Bayesian prior of object constancy. The leading current
models of spatial cognition are Hierarchical Bayesian models of vision, and
Deep Neural Nets. These are typically fully distributed models, which compute
using direct communication links between a set of modular knowledge sources,
and no other essential components. Their distributed nature leads to
difficulties with the criteria (a) - (e). I discuss an alternative model of
spatial cognition, which uses a single central position aggregator to store
estimated locations of each object or feature, and applies constraints on
locations in an iterative cycle between the aggregator and the knowledge
sources. This model has advantages in addressing the criteria (a) - (e). If
there is an aggregator in mammalian brains, there are reasons to believe that
it is in the thalamus. I outline a possible neural realisation of the
aggregator function in the thalamus.

organizational group chat. In recent years, organizational group chat is on the
rise enabling asynchronous text-based collaboration between co-workers in
different locations and time zones. Finding answers to questions is often
critical for work efficiency. However, group chat is characterized by
intertwined conversations and 'always on' availability, making it hard for
users to pinpoint answers to questions they care about in real-time or search
for answers in retrospective. In addition, structural and lexical
characteristics differ between chat groups, making it hard to find a 'one model
fits all' approach. Our Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based clustering
approach termed Ans-Chat implicitly learns discussion patterns as a means for
answer identification, thus eliminating the need to channel-specific tagging.
Empirical evaluation shows that this solution outperforms other approached.

  Communications",,,,,"cs.NI cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this paper is to promote the idea that including semantic and
goal-oriented aspects in future 6G networks can produce a significant leap
forward in terms of system effectiveness and sustainability. Semantic
communication goes beyond the common Shannon paradigm of guaranteeing the
correct reception of each single transmitted packet, irrespective of the
meaning conveyed by the packet. The idea is that, whenever communication occurs
to convey meaning or to accomplish a goal, what really matters is the impact
that the correct reception/interpretation of a packet is going to have on the
goal accomplishment. Focusing on semantic and goal-oriented aspects, and
possibly combining them, helps to identify the relevant information, i.e. the
information strictly necessary to recover the meaning intended by the
transmitter or to accomplish a goal. Combining knowledge representation and
reasoning tools with machine learning algorithms paves the way to build
semantic learning strategies enabling current machine learning algorithms to
achieve better interpretation capabilities and contrast adversarial attacks. 6G
semantic networks can bring semantic learning mechanisms at the edge of the
network and, at the same time, semantic learning can help 6G networks to
improve their efficiency and sustainability.

This logic, studied in its classical version by Steinsvold, Fan, Gilbert and

given world, but we still believe in it (or we think that it should be
accepted). Another interpretations are also possible: e.g. that we do not
accept F but it is imposed on us by a kind of council or advisory board. From
the mathematical point of view, the idea is expressed by an adequate form of
modal operator W which is interpreted in relational frames with neighborhoods.
We discuss monotonicity of forcing, soundness, completeness and several other
issues. We present also some simple systems in which confirmation of previously
accepted formula is modelled.
