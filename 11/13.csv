subdivision scheme that improves the accuracy of the classical (stationary and
nonstationary) methods. The refinement rules are formulated via the reproducing
property of exponential polynomials. An exponential polynomial has a shape
parameter so that it may be adapted to the characteristic of the given data. In
this study, we propose a method of selecting the shape parameter, so that it
enables the associated scheme to achieve an improved approximation order (that
is, {\em three}), while the classical methods attain the second order accuracy.
An analysis of convergence and smoothness of the proposed scheme is conducted.
The proposed scheme is shown to have the same smoothness as the classical
Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm, that is, $C^1$. Finally, some numerical
examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the new corner-cutting
algorithm.

symmetry of the relativistic quantum vacuum are all the combined symmetries.
These symmetries emerge as a result of the symmetry breaking of the more
fundamental $P$, $T$ and Lorentz symmetries of the original vacuum, which is
invariant under separate groups of the coordinate transformations and spin
rotations. The condensed matter vacua (ground states) suggest two possible
scenarios of the origin of the combined Lorentz symmetry, both are realized in
the superfluid phases of liquid $^3$He: the $^3$He-A scenario and the $^3$He-B
scenario. In these scenarios the gravitational tetrads are considered as the
order parameter of the symmetry breaking in the quantum vacuum. The $^3$He-B
scenarios applied to the Minkowski vacuum leads to the continuous degeneracy of
the Minkowski vacuum with respect to the $O(3,1)$ spin rotations. The symmetry
breaking leads to the corresponding topological objects, which appear due to
the nontrivial topology of the manifold of the degenerate Minkowski vacua, such
as torsion strings. The 4-fold degeneracy of the Minkowski vacuum with respect
to discrete $P$ and $T$ symmetries suggests that the Weyl fermions are
described by four different tetrad fields: the tetrad for the left-handed
fermions, the tetrad for the right-handed fermions, and the tetrads for their
antiparticles. This may lead to the gravity with several metric fields, so that
the parity violation may lead to the breaking of equivalence principle. Finally
we considered the application of the gravitational tetrads for the solution of
the cosmological constant problem.

the parameter ${S_{8}=\sigma_{8}\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ between the
analysis of shear power spectra and two-point correlation functions, derived
from the same shear catalogs. It is not a priori clear whether the measured
discrepancies are consistent with statistical fluctuations. In this paper, we
investigate this issue in the context of the forthcoming analyses from the
third year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3). We analyze DES-Y3 mock
catalogs from Gaussian simulations with a fast and accurate importance sampling
pipeline. We show that the methodology for determining matching scale cuts in
harmonic and real space is the key factor that contributes to the scatter
between constraints derived from the two statistics. We compare the published
scales cuts of the KiDS, Subaru-HSC and DES surveys, and find that the
correlation coefficients of posterior means range from over 80% for our
proposed cuts, down to 10% for cuts used in the literature. We then study the
interaction between scale cuts and systematic uncertainties arising from
multiple sources: non-linear power spectrum, baryonic feedback, intrinsic
alignments, uncertainties in the point-spread function, and redshift
distributions. We find that, given DES-Y3 characteristics and proposed cuts,
these uncertainties affect the two statistics similarly; the differential
biases are below a third of the statistical uncertainty, with the largest
biases arising from intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. While this work
is aimed at DES-Y3, the tools developed can be applied to Stage-IV surveys
where statistical errors will be much smaller.

reconstruct undersampled parallel transmit field maps for the body and brain.
  Methods: Using synthetic data, body, and brain measurements of relative
transmit maps, three different approaches to a joint transmit-receive low-rank
tensor completion algorithm are evaluated. These methods included: (i) virtual
coils using the product of receive and transmit sensitivities, (ii)
joint-receiver coils that enforces a low rank structure across receive coils of
all transmit modes, and (iii) transmit low rank (TxLR) that uses a low rank
structure for both receive and transmit modes simultaneously. The performance
of each are investigated for different noise levels and different acceleration
rates on an 8-channel parallel transmit 7T system.
  Results: The virtual coils method broke down with increasing noise levels or
acceleration rates greater than two producing RMS error greater than 0.1. The
joint receiver coils method worked well up to acceleration factors of four,
beyond which the RMS error exceeded 0.1. While TxLR enabled an eight-fold
acceleration with most RMS errors remaining below 0.1.
  Conclusion: This work demonstrates that under-sampling factors of up to
eight-fold are feasible for transmit array mapping and can be reconstructed
using calibrationless parallel imaging methods.

the outflow velocity and the logarithmic X-ray flux and intrinsic Doppler
broadening with v_int = 10^4 km/s. The models were generated by calculating the
fractional excess variance of count spectra from a Monte Carlo simulation. We
find evidence that the outflow in PDS 456 is structured, i.e., that there exist
two or more layers with outflow velocities 0.27-0.30 c, 0.41-0.49 c, and
0.15-0.20 c for a possible third layer, which agrees well with the literature.

provide an estimate for the strength of the correlation between the outflow

front is focused on the study of stellar population properties of UV weak and
upturn systems, by making use of catalogues from GAMA-DR3. The results show
that the fraction of UV upturn systems rises up to z~0.25, followed by a
decline which remains to be confirmed. By stratifying the sample into emission
line classes, the galaxies classified as retired/passive -- the ones associated
with evolved stellar phases -- dominate the behaviour with z and logM*. By
analysing the stellar populations of both types of systems, different
characteristics emerge such as median ages, metallicities, and time since last
burst of star formation. These results seem to indicate that UV upturn systems
have narrower star-formation histories, higher metallicities, and slightly
older populations.

(0.6K<T<1K) magnetic relaxation is associated with monopole motion along the

relaxation time upon cooling indicates reduced monopole conductivity driven by
decreasing monopole concentration and mobility as in a semiconductor. At higher

the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at multiple IRSs are jointly
optimized, while taking into account the minimum required quality-of-service
(QoS) of multiple users. First, two novel algorithms, namely a penalty-based
alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm and an inner approximation (IA)
algorithm, are developed to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated
optimization problem when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available.
Unlike existing designs that cannot ensure convergence, the proposed
penalty-based AltMin and IA algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a
stationary point and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the design problem,
respectively. Second, the impact of imperfect knowledge of the CSI of the

non-convex robust optimization problem is formulated and the penalty-based
AltMin algorithm is extended to obtain a stationary solution. Simulation
results reveal a key trade-off between the speed of convergence and the
achievable total transmit power for the two proposed algorithms. In addition,
we show that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total

particularly as a basis for secure instant messaging. In comparison to
traditional decentralized communication systems, Matrix replaces pure message
passing with a replicated data structure. This data structure, which we extract
and call the Matrix Event Graph (MEG), depicts the causal history of messages.
We show that this MEG represents an interesting and important replicated data
type for general decentralized applications that are based on causal histories
of publish-subscribe events: we show that a MEG possesses strong properties
with respect to consistency, byzantine attackers, and scalability. First, we
show that the MEG provides Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC), and that it is
available under partition, by proving that the MEG is a Conflict-Free
Replicated Data Type for causal histories. While strong consistency is
impossible here as shown by the famous CAP theorem, SEC is among the best known
achievable trade-offs. Second, we discuss the implications of byzantine
attackers on the data type's properties. We note that the MEG, as it does not
strive for consensus, can cope with $n > f$ environments with $n$ total
participants of which $f$ show byzantine faults. Furthermore, we analyze
scalability: Using Markov chains we study the width of the MEG, defined as the
number of forward extremities, over time and observe an almost optimal
evolution. We conjecture that this property is inherent to the underlying
spatially inhomogeneous random walk.

overview of the most relevant milestones of instance retrieval. We then apply
them to a semantic image retrieval task and find that they perform inferior to
much less sophisticated and more generic methods in a setting that requires
image understanding. Following this, we review existing approaches to closing

it's functionality and overall performance. Many industrial applications rely
on task-specific gripper designs to ensure the system's robustness and
accuracy. However, the process of manual hardware design is both costly and
time-consuming, and the quality of the resulting design is dependent on the
engineer's experience and domain expertise, which can easily be out-dated or
inaccurate. The goal of this work is to use machine learning algorithms to
automate the design of task-specific gripper fingers. We propose Fit2Form, a 3D
generative design framework that generates pairs of finger shapes to maximize
design objectives (i.e., grasp success, stability, and robustness) for target
grasp objects. We model the design objectives by training a Fitness network to
predict their values for pairs of gripper fingers and their corresponding grasp
objects. This Fitness network then provides supervision to a 3D Generative
network that produces a pair of 3D finger geometries for the target grasp
object. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D generative design
framework generates parallel jaw gripper finger shapes that achieve more stable
and robust grasps compared to other general-purpose and task-specific gripper
design algorithms. Video can be found at https://youtu.be/utKHP3qb1bg.

that variables in a given cluster are linear combinations of a small number of

defined by the number of clusters, the partition of variables into these
clusters and the 'cluster dimensions', i.e. the vector of dimensions of linear
subspaces spanning each of the clusters. The optimal model is selected using
the approximate Bayesian criterion based on the Laplace approximations and
using a non-informative uniform prior on the number of clusters. To solve the
problem of the search over a huge space of possible models we propose an
extension of the ClustOfVar algorithm which was dedicated to subspaces of
dimension only 1, and which is similar in structure to the $K$-centroid
algorithm. We provide a complete methodology with theoretical guarantees,
extensive numerical experimentations, complete data analyses and
implementation. Our algorithm assigns variables to appropriate clusterse based
on the consistent Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and estimates the
dimensionality of each cluster by the PEnalized SEmi-integrated Likelihood
Criterion (PESEL), whose consistency we prove. Additionally, we prove that each
iteration of our algorithm leads to an increase of the Laplace approximation to
the model posterior probability and provide the criterion for the estimation of
the number of clusters. Numerical comparisons with other algorithms show that
VARCLUST may outperform some popular machine learning tools for sparse subspace
clustering. We also report the results of real data analysis including TCGA
breast cancer data and meteorological data. The proposed method is implemented

recent ATLAS result on $t\bar t H$ production has also reported an excess in
the charge asymmetry in the same-sign dilepton channel with two or more
$b$-tagged jets. Motivated by these tantalizing discrepancies, we study a

up-type quarks via right-handed currents: $t_R\gamma^\mu \bar t_R$,
$t_R\gamma^\mu \bar c_R$, and $t_R \gamma^\mu \bar u_R$. The latter vertex
allows to translate the charge asymmetry at the LHC initial state protons to a
final state with top quarks which, decaying to a positive lepton and a $b$-jet,
provides a crucial contribution to some of the observed discrepancies. Through
an analysis at a detector level, we select the region in parameter space of our
model that best reproduces the data in the aforementioned $t\bar t H$ study,
and in a recent ATLAS $t\bar t t \bar t$ search. We find that our model
provides a better fit to the experimental data than the Standard Model for a
New Physics scale of approximately $\sim$500 GeV, and with a hierarchical
coupling of the $Z'$ boson that favours the top quark and the presence of FCNC
currents. In order to estimate the LHC sensitivity to this signal, we design a
broadband search featuring many kinematic regions with different
signal-to-background ratio, and perform a global analysis. We also define
signal-enhanced regions and study observables that could further distinguish
signal from background. We find that the region in parameter space of our model

with random arrival order and independent sampling of items. In the problem we
consider, a decision maker (DM) initially gets to sample each of $N$ items
independently with probability $p$, and can observe the relative rankings of
these sampled items. Then, the DM faces the remaining items in an online
fashion, observing the relative rankings of all revealed items. While scanning
the sequence the DM makes irrevocable stop/continue decisions and her reward
for stopping the sequence facing the item with rank $i$ is $Y_i$. The goal of
the DM is to maximize her reward. We start by studying the case in which the
values $Y_i$ are known to the DM, and then move to the case in which these
values are adversarial.
  For the former case, we write the natural linear program that captures the
performance of an algorithm, and take its continuous limit. We prove a
structural result about this continuous limit, which allows us to reduce the
problem to a relatively simple real optimization problem. We establish that the
optimal algorithm is given by a sequence of thresholds $t_1\le t_2\le\cdots$
such that the DM should stop if seeing an item with current ranking $i$ after
time $t_i$. Additionally we are able to recover several classic results in the
area such as those for secretary problem and the minimum ranking problem. For
the adversarial case, we obtain a similar linear program with an additional
stochastic dominance constraint. Using the same machinery we are able to pin
down the optimal competitive ratios for all values of $p$. Notably, we prove
that as $p$ approaches 1, our guarantee converges linearly to 0.745, matching
that of the i.i.d.~prophet inequality. Also interesting is the case $p=1/2$,
where our bound evaluates to $0.671$, which improves upon the state of the art.

supercurrent is observed in the current-voltage characteristics, which can be
controlled by a bottom gate. The excess current of 0.68 indicates a high
junction transparency. Under microwave radiation, pronounced integer Shapiro
steps are observed suggesting a sinusoidal current-phase relation. Owing to the
large critical field of Nb, the Josephson supercurrent can be maintained to
magnetic fields exceeding 1 T. Our results show that in-situ prepared Nb/InAs

  We investigate existing ideograph-based sub-character decomposition

including e.g. speeding up algorithms for cuts and Laplacian solvers. These
powerful notions have recently been extended to hypergraphs, which are much
richer and may offer new applications. However, the current bounds on the size
of hypergraph sparsifiers are not as tight as the corresponding bounds for
graphs.
  Our first result is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a hypergraph on
$n$ vertices with maximum hyperedge size $r$, outputs an $\epsilon$-spectral
sparsifier with $O^*(nr)$ hyperedges, where $O^*$ suppresses $(\epsilon^{-1}
\log n)^{O(1)}$ factors. This size bound improves the two previous bounds:
$O^*(n^3)$ [Soma and Yoshida, SODA'19] and $O^*(nr^3)$ [Bansal, Svensson and
Trevisan, FOCS'19]. Our main technical tool is a new method for proving
concentration of the nonlinear analogue of the quadratic form of the Laplacians
for hypergraph expanders.
  We complement this with lower bounds on the bit complexity of any compression
scheme that $(1+\epsilon)$-approximates all the cuts in a given hypergraph, and
hence also on the bit complexity of every $\epsilon$-cut/spectral sparsifier.
These lower bounds are based on Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi graphs, and a particular
instantiation yields an $\Omega(nr)$ lower bound on the bit complexity even for
fixed constant $\epsilon$. This is tight up to polylogarithmic factors in $n$,
due to recent hypergraph cut sparsifiers of [Chen, Khanna and Nagda, FOCS'20].
  Finally, for directed hypergraphs, we present an algorithm that computes an
$\epsilon$-spectral sparsifier with $O^*(n^2r^3)$ hyperarcs, where $r$ is the
maximum size of a hyperarc. For small $r$, this improves over $O^*(n^3)$ known
from [Soma and Yoshida, SODA'19], and is getting close to the trivial lower
bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ hyperarcs.

M5-branes parallel to MO9-planes on $A_1$-singularities is accurately encoded
in the higher gauge theory for higher gauge group of the equivariant homotopy
type of the Z/2-equivariant A-infinity-loop group of twistor space.
  In this formulation, the flux forms of the heterotic gauge field, the B-field
on the M5-brane, and of the C-field in the M-theory bulk are all unified into
the character image of a single cocycle in equivariant twistorial Cohomotopy
theory; and that cocycle enforces the quantization condition on all fluxes: the
integrality of the gauge flux, the half-shifted integrality of the C-field flux
and the integrality of the dual C-field flux (i.e., of the Page charge in the
bulk and of the Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane). This result is in line with the
Hypothesis H that M-brane charges are quantized in J-twisted Cohomotopy theory.

equivariant twisted non-abelian character map via an equivariant twisted
non-abelian de Rham theorem, which we prove; and, second, the computation of
the equivariant relative minimal model of the Z/2-equivariant

metastable electroweak (EW) vacuum surrounded by a deep global AdS or a runaway
Minkowski minimum. Furthermore, fine-tuning is the only explanation for the
Higgs relaxing in its present local minimum. In this paper, assuming no new
physics beyond the SM, we study the universal effect of gravity on the Higgs
dynamics in the early universe. A generic two-parameter model is considered in
which the Higgs is non-minimally coupled to a higher-curvature theory of
gravity. The coupling between the Higgs field and the Weyl field in the
Einstein frame has genuine predictions. In a broad region in the parameter
space, the effective Higgs mass is large and it initially takes over through
fast oscillations. This epoch is followed by the Weyl field slowly rolling a
plateau-like potential. This framework generically predicts that the Higgs
self-coupling in the EW vacuum is enhanced, compared to the SM predictions,
through couplings to the gravity sector. Moreover, when the Higgs is settled in
the EW vacuum, all other scalar flat directions would be lifted via
gravitational effects mediated by the Weyl field.

trivial ground state, an example being Chern insulators formed by Dirac bosons
with a gap at finite energies. However, in contrast to electrons, there is no
particle-number conservation law for collective excitations. This gives rise to
particle number-nonconserving many-body interactions whose influence on
single-particle topology is an open issue of fundamental interest in the field
of topological quantum materials. Taking magnons in ferromagnets as an example,
we uncover topological magnon insulators that are stabilized by interactions
through opening Chern-insulating gaps in the magnon spectrum. This can be
traced back to the fact that the particle-number nonconserving interactions
break the effective time-reversal symmetry of the harmonic theory. Hence,
magnon-magnon interactions are a source of topology that can introduce chiral
edge states, whose chirality depends on the magnetization direction.
Importantly, interactions do not necessarily cause detrimental damping but can
give rise to topological magnons with exceptionally long lifetimes. We identify
two mechanisms of interaction-induced topological phase transitions---one
driven by an external field, the other by temperature---and show that they
cause unconventional sign reversals of transverse transport signals, in
particular of the thermal Hall conductivity. We identify candidate materials
where this many-body mechanism is expected to occur, such as the metal-organic

this problem, the goal is to draw an input graph $G$ in the plane so as to
minimize the number of crossings between the images of its edges. Despite
extensive work, non-trivial approximation algorithms are only known for
bounded-degree graphs. Even for this special case, the best current algorithm
achieves a $\tilde O(\sqrt n)$-approximation, while the best current negative
result is APX-hardness. All current approximation algorithms for the problem
build on the same paradigm: compute a set $E'$ of edges (called a
\emph{planarizing set}) such that $G\setminus E'$ is planar; compute a planar
drawing of $G\setminus E'$; then add the drawings of the edges of $E'$ to the
resulting drawing. Unfortunately, there are examples of graphs, in which any
implementation of this method must incur $\Omega (\text{OPT}^2)$ crossings,
where $\text{OPT}$ is the value of the optimal solution. This barrier seems to
doom the only known approach to designing approximation algorithms for the
problem, and to prevent it from yielding a better than $O(\sqrt
n)$-approximation.
  In this paper we propose a new paradigm that allows us to overcome this
barrier. We show an algorithm that, given a bounded-degree graph $G$ and a
planarizing set $E'$ of its edges, computes another set $E''$ with $E'\subseteq
E''$, such that $|E''|$ is relatively small, and there exists a near-optimal
drawing of $G$ in which only edges of $E''$ participate in crossings. This
allows us to reduce the Crossing Number problem to \emph{Crossing Number with
Rotation System} -- a variant in which the ordering of the edges incident to
every vertex is fixed as part of input. We show a randomized algorithm for this
new problem, that allows us to obtain an $O(n^{1/2-\epsilon})$-approximation
for Crossing Number on bounded-degree graphs, for some constant $\epsilon>0$.

delocalization in string space such as participation ratios and corresponding
entropies obtained from the wave function amplitudes in string space. The
saturation of the string-space information entropy is accompanied by the
vanishing of OTOCs. Together these signal irreversibility and chaos, which we
take to be the defining properties of good classical ciphers. More precisely,
we define a good cipher by requiring that the OTOCs vanish to exponential
precision and that the string entropies saturate to the values associated with
a random permutation, which are computed explicitly in the paper. We argue that
these conditions can be satisfied by $n$-bit block ciphers implemented via
random reversible circuits with ${\cal O}(n \log n)$ gates arranged on a tree

the magnetic insulator induces an exchange field in the superconductor, which
leads to a splitting in the semiconductor by proximity effect, and (2) the
magnetic insulator acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier between the
superconductor and the semiconductor. We show that the spin splitting in the
superconductor alone cannot induce a topological transition in the
semiconductor. To overcome this limitation, we propose to use a spin-filter
barrier that enhances the magnetic exchange and provides a mechanism for a
topological phase transition. Moreover, the spin-dependent tunneling introduces
a strong dependence on the band alignment, which can be crucial in
quantum-confined systems. This mechanism opens up a route towards networks of
topological wires with fewer constraints on device geometry compared to
previous devices that require external magnetic fields.

such that points of same color lie on the same side of the hyperplane. We
measure the quality of such a hyperplane by its margin $\gamma(w)$, defined as
minimum distance between any of the points $x_i$ and the hyperplane. In this
paper, we prove that the margin function $\gamma$ satisfies a nonsmooth
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality with exponent $1/2$. This result has
far-reaching consequences. For example, let $\gamma^{opt}$ be the maximum
possible margin for the problem and let $w^{opt}$ be the parameter for the
hyperplane which attains this value. Given any other separating hyperplane with
parameter $w$, let $d(w):=\|w-w^{opt}\|$ be the euclidean distance between $w$

deduce that $(\gamma^{opt}-\gamma(w)) / R \le d(w) \le

the maximum distance of the points $x_i$ from the origin. Consequently, for any

Physics. The predictions of a BSM scenario need to be compared with
experimental data and the Standard Model values in order to identify the model
that fits better what we observe in particle colliders. BSM predictions require
very involved and error prone calculations of amplitudes, cross-sections and
Wilson coefficients. Calculations at the one-loop level are often necessary for
these quantities since some phenomenologically important processes may not
occur at tree-level, such as Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in flavor
physics that vanish at the tree-level. One-loop calculations have to be done
analytically which is very time consuming and in practice rarely done for
general BSM models. Here we present MARTY, a public and open-source C++ code.
MARTY is the very first independent program able to calculate automatically
amplitudes, squared amplitudes and Wilson coefficients at the one-loop level
for general BSM models. This type of calculations requires a computer algebra
system and could only be done, up to now, using Mathematica, a commercial and
closed software for symbolic manipulations. MARTY does not rely on Mathematica
since it re-implements its own computer algebra system also in C++, called CSL.
MARTY will considerably ease BSM studies as by automating the analytical
calculations the main task of the user would be the model building part. Once
interfaced with other phenomenological codes in particle physics, MARTY will be
incredibly efficient to make detailed predictions for general BSM models
automatically.

ability to move the wavefunction across the wire section. We find that the
topological phase is achieved in significant portions of the phase diagram only
in configurations where the Al and EuS layers overlap on some wire facet, due
to the rather local direct induced spin polarization and the appearance of an
extra indirect exchange field through the superconductor. While of obvious
relevance for the explanation of recent experiments, tunable proximity effects
are of interest in the broader field of superconducting spintronics.

The first separation between adaptive and non-adaptive symmetric hypothesis
testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower

Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio observations for a snapshot campaign of 25
local AGNs that form a volume-complete sample with hard X-ray (14-195 keV)
luminosities above $10^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$, out to a distance of 40 Mpc. Despite
achieving an observation depth of $\sim20$ $\mu$Jy, we find that 16 of 25 AGNs
in our sample are not detected with the VLBA on milli-arcsecond (sub-parsec)
scales, and the corresponding core radio luminosity upper limits are
systematically below predictions from the Fundamental Plane of black hole
activity. Using archival Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) radio measurements, our
sample jumps back onto the Fundamental Plane, suggesting that extended radio
emission is responsible for the apparent correlation between radio emission,
X-ray emission, and black hole mass. We suggest that this discrepancy is likely
due to extra-nuclear radio emission produced via interactions between the AGN
and host environment. We compare VLBA observations of AGNs to VLA observations
of nearby Galactic black holes (GBHs) and we find a mass-independent
correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities of black holes of
$L_\mathrm{6cm}$/$L_\mathrm{2-10 keV}$ $\sim$ 10$^{-6}$, in line with
predictions for coronal emission, but allowing for the possibility of truly
radio silent AGNs.

the Dirichlet problem associated to an elliptic real second-order
divergence-form (possibly degenerate, not necessarily symmetric) elliptic

that we call additive Carleson perturbations, we introduce
scalar-multiplicative and antisymmetric Carleson perturbations, which both
allow non-trivial differences at the boundary. Second, we consider domains
which admit an elliptic PDE in a broad sense: we count as examples the 1-sided
NTA (a.k.a. uniform) domains satisfying the capacity density condition, the
1-sided chord-arc domains, the domains with low-dimensional Ahlfors-David
regular boundaries, and certain domains with mixed-dimensional boundaries; thus
our methods provide a unified perspective on the Carleson perturbation theory
of elliptic operators.
  Our proofs do not introduce sawtooth domains or the extrapolation method. We
also present several applications to some Dahlberg-Kenig-Pipher operators,
free-boundary problems, and we provide a new characterization of $A_{\infty}$

of upcoming measurements of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). This measurement can be confounded by modelling uncertainties
related to so-called ""baryonic effects"" on the clustering of matter, arising
from gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback from active galactic nuclei and
supernovae. In particular, a wrong assumption about the form of baryonic
effects on CMB lensing can bias a neutrino mass measurement by a significant
fraction of the statistical uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate three
methods for mitigating this bias: (1) restricting the use of small-scale CMB
lensing information when constraining neutrino mass; (2) using an external
tracer to remove the low-redshift contribution to a CMB lensing map; and (3)
marginalizing over a parametric model for baryonic effects on large-scale
structure. We test these methods using Fisher matrix forecasts for experiments
resembling the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, using a variety of recent
hydrodynamical simulations to represent the range of possible baryonic effects,
and using cosmic shear measured by the Rubin Observatory's LSST as the tracer
in method (2). We find that a combination of (1) and (2), or (3) on its own,
will be effective in reducing the bias induced by baryonic effects on a
neutrino mass measurement to a negligible level, without a significant increase
in the associated statistical uncertainty.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) can provide important insights into the physical
conditions very close to their central supermassive black holes. The
temperature of the Comptonizing plasma that forms the corona is manifested
through a high-energy cutoff that has been difficult to directly constrain even
in the brightest AGN because it requires high-quality data at energies above 10
keV. In this paper we present a large collection of coronal cutoff constraints
for obscured AGN based on a sample of 130 AGN selected in the hard X-ray band
with Swift/BAT and observed nearly simultaneously with NuSTAR and Swift/XRT. We
find that under a reasonable set of assumptions regarding partial constraints
the median cutoff is well constrained to 290$\pm$20 keV, where the uncertainty
is statistical and given at the 68% confidence level. We investigate the
sensitivity of this result to our assumptions and find that consideration of
various known systematic uncertainties robustly places the median cutoff
between 240 keV and 340 keV. The central 68% of the intrinsic cutoff
distribution is found to be between about 140 keV and 500 keV, with estimated
uncertainties of 20 keV and 100 keV, respectively. In comparison with the
literature, we find no clear evidence that the cutoffs in obscured and
unobscured AGN are substantially different. Our analysis highlights the
importance of carefully considering partial and potentially degenerate
constraints on the coronal high-energy cutoff in AGN.

all observables anisotropically. As in the separate universe, both the long
tidal and density modes can be absorbed by an effective anisotropic background,
on which the interaction and evolution of the short modes change accordingly.
We further develop the tidal simulation method, including proper corrections to
the second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) to generate initial
conditions of the simulations. We measure the linear tidal responses of the
matter power spectrum, at high redshift from our modified 2LPT, and at low
redshift from the tidal simulations. Our results agree qualitatively with
previous works, but exhibit quantitative differences in both cases. We also
measure the linear tidal response of the halo shapes, or the shape bias, and
find its universal relation with the linear halo bias, for which we provide a
fitting formula. Furthermore, analogous to the assembly bias, we study the
secondary dependence of the shape bias, and discover for the first time
dependence on halo concentration and axis ratio. Our results provide useful
insights for studies of the intrinsic alignment as source of either
contamination or information. These effects need to be correctly taken into
account when one uses intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes as a precision

and break down under small adversarial perturbations.
  We observe a basic connection between perturbation resilience and
\emph{certifying algorithms} that are based on certificates of upper bounds on
sparse eigenvalues of random matrices. In contrast to other techniques, such
certifying algorithms, including the brute-force maximum likelihood estimator,
are automatically robust against small adversarial perturbation.
  We use this connection to obtain the first polynomial-time algorithms for
this problem that are resilient against additive adversarial perturbations by
obtaining new efficient certificates for upper bounds on sparse eigenvalues of
random matrices. Our algorithms are based either on basic semidefinite
programming or on its low-degree sum-of-squares strengthening depending on the
parameter regimes. Their guarantees either match or approach the best known
guarantees of \emph{fragile} algorithms in terms of sparsity of the unknown
vector, number of samples and the ambient dimension.
  To complement our algorithmic results, we prove rigorous lower bounds
matching the gap between fragile and robust polynomial-time algorithms in a
natural computational model based on low-degree polynomials (closely related to
the pseudo-calibration technique for sum-of-squares lower bounds) that is known
to capture the best known guarantees for related statistical estimation

bias model and likelihood on the inferred initial conditions. We find that the
cross-correlation coefficient between true and inferred phases reacts weakly to
all ingredients above, and is well predicted by the theoretical expectation
derived from a Gaussian model on a broad range of scales. The bias in the
amplitude of the inferred initial conditions, on the other hand, depends
strongly on the bias model and the likelihood. We conclude that the bias model
and likelihood hold the key to an unbiased cosmological inference. Together
they must keep the systematics -- which arise from the sub-grid physics that
are marginalized over -- under control in order to obtain an unbiased
inference.

parameters only, i.e. mass and spin, that change through cosmic time in
response to accretion and merger events. While most numerical simulations
accurately track the BH mass, spin evolution is rarely taken into account. In
this work, we implement and validate a self-consistent sub-grid model for the
evolution of the BH mass and spin via gas accretion in the hydrodynamics code
GIZMO. The model assumes that accretion from resolved scales does not occur
instantaneously, but is mediated by a sub-grid geometrically thin
$\alpha$-disc. After validating our model semi-analytically, we test it in an
idealized environment consisting of a circumnuclear disc, where gas accretion
onto the accretion disc is consistently determined by GIZMO. In the absence of
any accretion-related feedback, the spin evolution closely traces that observed
in the semi-analytical models and depends on the free parameters of our
implementation, such as the initial BH spin, angular momentum of the accretion
disc, and the radius at which the gas inflow circularises. In GIZMO, we also
couple our model with the biconical-outflow model presented in a companion
paper, wherein the feedback axis is always aligned with the BH spin. In this
last case, the evolution of the central BH differs significantly from the
previous cases, since the feedback process modifies the gas dynamics and its
inflow rates from resolved scales. Such an interaction cannot be modeled by
simple semi-analytical models and should be treated using full N-body
hydrodynamical simulations.

We aim to determine the dominant mechanisms governing PSB evolution in both the
field and in galaxy clusters. Using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation
suite Magneticum Pathfinder, we identify 647 PSBs with $z \sim 0$ stellar mass
$M_* \geq 5 \cdot 10^{10} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. We track their galactic
evolution, merger history, and black hole activity over a time-span of 3.6Gyr.
Additionally, we study cluster PSBs identified at different redshifts and
cluster masses. Independent of environment and redshift, we find that PSBs,
like SF galaxies, have frequent mergers. At z=0, 89% of PSBs have experienced
mergers and 65% had at least one major merger within the last 2.5Gyr, leading
to strong star formation episodes. In fact, 23% of z=0 PSBs were rejuvenated
during their starburst. Following the mergers, field PSBs are generally
shutdown via a strong increase in AGN feedback (power output $P_{AGN,PSB} \geq
10^{56}\,$erg/Myr). We find agreement with observations for both stellar mass
functions and z = 0.9 line-of-sight phase space distributions of PSBs in galaxy
clusters. Finally, we find that $z \lesssim 0.5$ cluster PSBs are predominantly
infalling, especially in high mass clusters and show no signs of enhanced AGN
activity. Thus, we conclude that the majority of cluster PSBs are shutdown via
an environmental quenching mechanism such as ram-pressure stripping, while
field PSBs are mainly quenched by AGN feedback.

dressed with the imaginary part of the self-energy. We find that the dressing
from loops exponentially dampens the propagator when one of the endpoints is in
the IR region, rendering this region opaque to propagation. This suppression
may have implications for field-theoretical model-building in AdS. We argue
that in the effective theory (EFT) paradigm, opacity of the IR region induced
by higher dimensional operators censors the region of EFT breakdown. This
confirms earlier expectations from the literature. Specializing to AdS$_5$, we
determine a universal contribution to opacity from gravity.

mass is converted to energy and released into the surrounding medium, in a
process loosely referred to as AGN feedback. Most numerical simulations include
AGN feedback as a sub-grid model, wherein energy or momentum (or both) is
coupled to the nearby gas. In this work, we implement a new momentum-driven
model in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO, in which accretion from large scales is
mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc model, and gas particles are
stochastically kicked over a bi-conical region, to mimic observed kinetic
winds. The feedback cone's axis can be set either parallel to the angular
momentum of the gas surrounding the BH or to the BH spin direction, which is
self-consistently evolved within the accretion-disc model. Using a
circumnuclear disc (CND) as a test bed, we find that (i) the conical shape of
the outflow is always visible and is weakly dependent on the launching
orientation and aperture, resulting in comparable mass inflows and outflows;
(ii) the cone's orientation is also similar amongst our tests, and it is not
always the same as the initial value, due to the interaction with the CND
playing a crucial role in shaping the outflow; and (iii) the velocity of the

luminosity for a shock on the circumplanetary disc. We extend this to the
planet-surface shock. We calculate the global spectral energy distribution
(SED) of accreting planets by combining our model emission spectra with
photospheric SEDs, and predict the line-integrated flux for several hydrogen
lines, especially H alpha, but also H beta, Pa alpha, Pa beta, Pa gamma, Br
alpha, and Br gamma. We apply our non-equilibrium emission model to the surface
accretion shock for a wide range of accretion rates Mdot and masses M_p . Fits
to formation calculations provide radii and effective temperatures. Extinction
by the surrounding material is neglected, which is arguably often relevant. We
find that the line luminosity increases monotonically with Mdot and M_p ,
depending mostly on Mdot and weakly on M_p for the relevant range of
parameters. The Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen continua can exceed the photosphere.
The H beta line is fainter by 0 to 1 dex than H alpha, whereas other lines are
weaker (by 1 to 3 dex). Shocks on the planet or the CPD surface are
distinguishable at very high spectral resolution, but the planet surface shock
likely dominates if both are present. Applied to recent non-detections of H
alpha, our models imply looser constraints on the Mdot of putative planets than
when extrapolating fits from the stellar regime. These hydrogen-line luminosity
predictions are useful for interpreting (non-)detections of accreting planets.

characterization in terms of order parameters. In this paper, we develop a
unified framework based on variational iPEPS for the quantitative study of both
topological and conventional phase transitions through entanglement order
parameters. To this end, we employ tensor networks with suitable physical
and/or entanglement symmetries encoded, and allow for order parameters
detecting the behavior of any of those symmetries, both physical and
entanglement ones. First, this gives rise to entanglement-based order
parameters for topological phases. These topological order parameters allow to
quantitatively probe topological phase transitions and to identify their
universal behavior. We apply our framework to the study of the Toric Code model
in different magnetic fields, which in some cases maps to the (2+1)D Ising
model. We identify 3D Ising critical exponents for the entire transition,
consistent with those special cases and general belief. However, we moreover
find an unknown critical exponent beta=0.021. We then apply our framework of
entanglement order parameters to conventional phase transitions. We construct a
novel type of disorder operator (or disorder parameter), which is non-zero in
the disordered phase and measures the response of the wavefunction to a
symmetry twist in the entanglement. We numerically evaluate this disorder

dissipates energy, causing the system to evolve towards a circular orbit with
aligned and synchronized stellar spins. However, for stars with self-excited
pulsations, we demonstrate that tidal interaction with unstable pulsation modes
can transfer energy in the opposite direction, forcing the spins of the stars
away from synchronicity, and potentially pumping the eccentricity and
spin-orbit misalignment angle. This ""inverse"" tidal process only occurs when
the tidally forced mode amplitude is comparable to the mode's saturation
amplitude, and it is thus most likely to occur in main sequence gravity mode
pulsators with orbital periods of a few days. We examine the long-term
evolution of inverse tidal action, finding the stellar rotation rate can
potentially be driven to a very large or very small value, while maintaining a
large spin-orbit misalignment angle. Several recent asteroseismic analyses of
pulsating stars in close binaries have revealed extremely slow core rotation
periods, which we attribute to the action of inverse tides.

paramount importance in order to understand the complexity of dust effects and
the reciprocal interrelations among stellar mass, dust attenuation, stellar
age, and metallicity. Benefiting from uniquely deep FUV spectra of >500
star-forming galaxies at redshifts 2<z<5 extracted from the VANDELS survey and
stacked in bins of stellar mass (M*) and UV continuum slope (beta), we estimate
their stellar metallicities Z* from stellar photospheric absorption features at
1501 and 1719 Angstrom, which are calibrated with Starburst99 models and are
largely unaffected by stellar age, dust, IMF, nebular continuum or interstellar
absorption. Comparing them to photometric based spectral slopes in the range
1250-1750 Angstrom, we find that the stellar metallicity increases by ~0.5 dex
from beta ~ -2 to beta ~ -1 (1 < A(1600) < 3.2), and a dependence with beta
holds at fixed UV absolute luminosity M(UV) and stellar mass up to 10^(9.65)
Msun. As a result, the metallicity is a fundamental ingredient for properly
rescaling dust corrections based on M(UV) and M*. Using the same absorption
features, we analyze the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and find it is
consistent with the previous VANDELS estimation based on a global fit of the
FUV spectra. Similarly, we do not find a significant evolution between z=2 and
z=3.5. Finally, the slopes of our MZR and Z*-beta relation are in agreement
with the predictions of well-studied semi-analytic models of galaxy formation
(SAM), while some tensions with observations remain as to the absolute
metallicity normalization. The relation between UV slope and stellar
metallicity is fundamental for the exploitation of large volume surveys with
next-generation telescopes and for the physical characterization of galaxies in
the first billion years of our Universe.

dominate the clump population above $M_{\rm c}\gtrsim 10^{7.6}\ \rm{M_\odot}$.
LLCs tend to be found closer to the galactic centre, indicating clump migration
to the centre or preferential formation at smaller radii. The LLCs are found to
reside in high mass galaxies, indicating better clump survivability under
supernova feedback there, due to clumps being more massive in these galaxies.

difficult to solve. For this reason, the design space is usually pruned by
using heuristics and past experience. As an alternative, the current research
explores some properties of $\Delta V$ matrices which provide the minimum
$\Delta V$ values for a transfer between two celestial bodies for various times
of departure and transfer duration values. These can assist in solving
multi-rendezvous problems in an automated way. The paper focuses on the problem
of, given a set of candidate objects, how to find the sequence of $N$ objects
to rendezvous with that minimizes the total $\Delta V$ required. Transfers are
considered as single algebraic objects corresponding to $\Delta V$ matrices,
which allow intuitive concatenation via a generalized summation. Waiting times,
both due to mission requirements and prospects for cheaper and faster future
transfers, are also incorporated in the $\Delta V$ matrices. A transcription of
the problem as a shortest path search on a graph can utilize a range of
available efficient shortest path solvers. Given an efficient $\Delta V$ matrix
estimator, the new paradigm proposed here is believed to offer an alternative
to the pruning techniques currently used.

understanding how the connectivity of the magnetic field affects the spatial

fluctuating magnetic field, which modifies their distributions. We develop a
formalism in which the differential equation describing the field line random
walk contains both effects due to localized magnetic displacements and a
non-stochastic contribution from the large-scale expansion. We use this
formalism together with a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the
inner-heliospheric solar wind, which includes a turbulence transport model, to
estimate the diffusive spreading of magnetic field lines that originate in
different regions of the solar atmosphere. We first use this model to quantify
field line spreading at 1 au, starting from a localized solar source region,
and find rms angular spreads of about 20{\deg} - 60{\deg}. In the second
instance, we use the model to estimate the size of the source regions from
which field lines observed at 1 au may have originated, thus quantifying the
uncertainty in calculations of magnetic connectivity; the angular uncertainty
is estimated to be about 20{\deg}. Finally, we estimate the filamentation
distance, i.e., the heliocentric distance up to which field lines originating
in magnetic islands can remain strongly trapped in filamentary structures. We
emphasize the key role of slab-like fluctuations in the transition from
filamentary to more diffusive transport at greater heliocentric distances.

collisionless tearing modes, driven by electron inertia and accounting for
equilibrium electron temperature anisotropy in a strong guide field regime. For
this purpose, a new gyrofluid model is derived and subsequently simplified to
make the derivation of the dispersion relation treatable analytically. The main
simplifying assumptions consist in assuming cold ions, neglecting electron
finite Larmor radius effects, decoupling ion gyrocenter fluctuations and
considering $\beta_{\perp_e} \ll 1$, with $\beta_{\perp_e}$ indicating the
ratio between the perpendicular electron thermal pressure and the magnetic
pressure exerted by the guide field. This simplified version of the gyrofluid
model is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. The dispersion
relation is obtained by applying the theory of asymptotic matching and does not
predict an enhancement of the growth rate as the ratio $\Theta_e$, between
perpendicular and parallel equilibrium electron temperatures, increases. This
indicates a significant difference with respect to the case of absent or
moderate guide field. For an equilibrium magnetic shear length of the order of
the perpendicular sonic Larmor radius and at a fixed $\beta_{\perp_e}$, we
obtain that the tearing mode in the strong guide field regime gets actually
weakly damped, as $\Theta_e$ increases. In the isotropic limit $\Theta_e=1$,
the dispersion relation reduces to a previously known formula. The analytical
predictions are tested against numerical simulations showing a very good
quantitative agreement. We also provide a detailed discussion of the range of
validity of the derived dispersion relation and of the compatibility among the
different adopted assumptions.

stars that merge within a Hubble time, as well as many other compact binaries,
are expected to form via common envelope evolution. Yet five decades of
research on common envelope evolution have not yet resulted in a satisfactory
understanding of the multi-spatial multi-timescale evolution for the systems
that lead to compact binaries. In this paper, we report on the first successful
simulations of common envelope ejection leading to binary neutron star
formation in 3D hydrodynamics. We simulate the dynamical inspiral phase of the
interaction between a 12$M_\odot$ red supergiant and a 1.4$M_\odot$ neutron
star for different initial separations and initial conditions. For all of our
simulations, we find complete envelope ejection and final orbital separations
of $a_{\rm f} \approx 1.3$-$5.1 R_\odot$ depending on the simulation and
criterion, leading to binary neutron stars that can merge within a Hubble time.
We find $\alpha_{\rm CE}$-equivalent efficiencies of $\approx 0.1$-$2.7$
depending on the simulation and criterion, but this may be specific for these
extended progenitors. We fully resolve the core of the star to $\lesssim 0.005
R_\odot$ and our 3D hydrodynamics simulations are informed by an adjusted 1D
analytic energy formalism and a 2D kinematics study in order to overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of simulating these systems. The framework we
develop in this paper can be used to simulate a wide variety of interactions
between stars, from stellar mergers to common envelope episodes leading to GW
sources.

finite-horizon decision task has a unique steady state under any behavior
policy, and that the marginal distribution of the agent's input indeed
converges to the steady-state distribution in essentially all episodic learning
processes. This observation supports an interestingly reversed mindset against
conventional wisdom: While the existence of unique steady states was often
presumed in continual learning but considered less relevant in episodic
learning, it turns out their existence is guaranteed for the latter. Based on
this insight, the paper unifies episodic and continual RL around several
important concepts that have been separately treated in these two RL
formalisms. Practically, the existence of unique and approachable steady state
enables a general way to collect data in episodic RL tasks, which the paper
applies to policy gradient algorithms as a demonstration, based on a new
steady-state policy gradient theorem. Finally, the paper also proposes and
experimentally validates a perturbation method that facilitates rapid
steady-state convergence in real-world RL tasks.

spacecraft during 2007-2016 to investigate the generic features of the CME
sheath and the magnetic ejecta (ME) and dependencies of average physical
parameters of the sheath on the ME. We classify the MEs into three categories,
focusing on whether a ME drives both a shock and sheath, or only a sheath, or
neither, near 1 AU. We also reevaluate our initial classification through an
automated algorithm and visual inspection. We observe that even for leading
edge speeds greater than 500 km/s, 1 out of 4 MEs do not drive shocks near 1
AU. MEs driving both shocks and sheaths are the fastest and propagate in high
magnetosonic solar wind, whereas MEs driving only sheaths are the slowest and
propagate in low magnetosonic solar wind. Our statistical and superposed epoch
analyses indicate that all physical parameters are more enhanced in the sheath
regions following shocks than in sheaths without shocks. However, differences
within sheaths become statistically less significant for similar driving MEs.
We also find that the radial thickness of ME-driven sheaths apparently has no
clear linear correlation with the speed profile and associated Mach numbers of
the driver.

Pierre Auger Observatory to complement the study of ultra-high-energy cosmic
rays (UHECR) by measuring the muon content of extensive air showers (EAS). It
consists of an array of 61 water Cherenkov detectors on a denser spacing in
combination with underground scintillation detectors used for muon density
measurement. Each detector is composed of three scintillation modules, with 10
m$^2$ detection area per module, buried at 2.3 m depth, resulting in a total
detection area of 30 m$^2$. Silicon photomultiplier sensors (SiPM) measure the
amount of scintillation light generated by charged particles traversing the
modules. In this paper, the design of the front-end electronics to process the
signals of those SiPMs and test results from the laboratory and from the Pierre
Auger Observatory are described. Compared to our previous prototype, the new
electronics shows a higher performance, higher efficiency and lower power
consumption, and it has a new acquisition system with increased dynamic range
that allows measurements closer to the shower core. The new acquisition system
is based on the measurement of the total charge signal that the muonic
component of the cosmic ray shower generates in the detector.

The method greatly improves the convergence of the standard Jacobi iteration by
applying a sequence of $M$ well-chosen overrelaxation and underrelaxation
factors in each cycle of the algorithm to effectively attenuate the solution
error. In previous work, optimal SRJ schemes (sets of relaxation factors) have
been derived to accelerate convergence for specific discretizations of elliptic
PDEs. In this work, we develop a family of SRJ schemes which can be applied to
solve elliptic PDEs regardless of the specific discretization employed. To
achieve favorable convergence, we train an algorithm to select which scheme in
this family to apply at each cycle of the linear solve process, based on
convergence data collected from applying these schemes to the one-dimensional
Poisson equation. The automatic selection heuristic that is developed based on
this limited data is found to provide good convergence for a wide range of
problems.

the unique, nonlinear response to temperature of many molecular absorption

techniques are well-suited to this nonuniformity measurement, yet present
analysis approaches use only isolated features rather than a full broadband
spectral measurement. In this work, we develop a constrained spectral fitting
technique called E""-binning to fit an absorption spectrum arising from a
nonuniform environment. The information extracted from E""-binning is then input
to the inversion approach from the previous paper in this series (Malarich and
Rieker, JQSRT 107455) to determine the temperature distribution. We demonstrate
this approach by using dual frequency comb laser measurements to resolve
convection cells in a tube furnace. The recovered temperature distributions at
each measurement height agree with an existing natural convection model.
Finally, we show that for real-world measurements with noise and absorption
model error, increasing the bandwidth and the number of measured absorption
transitions may improve the temperature distribution precision. We make the
fitting code publicly available for use with any broadband absorption

As in the classical case, our definition is syntactic: we use an appropriate

the class of models defined by a partial theory. We demonstrate the
expressivity of such equational theories by considering a number of examples,
including partial combinatory algebras and cartesian closed categories.
Moreover, despite the increase in expressivity of the syntax we retain a
well-behaved notion of semantics: we show that our categories of models are
precisely locally finitely presentable categories, and that free models exist.

noise power spectral density (PSD), but find the need for an additional
lognormal component in the noise model for the 30 and 44\,GHz bands. We
implement an optimal Wiener-filter (or constrained realization) gap-filling
procedure to account for masked data. We then use this procedure to both
estimate the gapless correlated noise in the time-domain, $n_\mathrm{corr}$,
and to sample the noise PSD parameters, $\xi^n = \{\sigma_0, f_\mathrm{knee},
\alpha, A_\mathrm{p}\}$. In contrast to previous \textit{Planck} analyses, we
assume piecewise stationary noise only within each pointing period (PID), not
throughout the full mission, but we adopt the LFI Data Processing Center (DPC)
results as priors on $\alpha$ and $f_\mathrm{knee}$. On average, we find
best-fit correlated noise parameters that are mostly consistent with previous
results, with a few notable exceptions. However, a detailed inspection of the
time-dependent results reveals many important findings. First and foremost, we
find strong evidence for statistically significant temporal variations in all
noise PSD parameters, many of which are directly correlated with satellite
housekeeping data. Second, while the simple $1/f$ model appears to be an
excellent fit for the LFI 70 GHz channel, there is evidence for additional
correlated noise not described by a $1/f$ model in the 30 and 44 GHz channels,

flare emission originates from both hot (millions of Kelvin) plasma and
nonthermal accelerated particles, giving insight into flare energy release. The
Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) utilizes direct focusing optics
to attain much higher sensitivity in the HXR range than that of previous
indirect imagers. This paper presents eleven NuSTAR microflares from two active
regions (AR 12671 on 2017 August 21, and AR 12712 on 2018 May 29). The
temporal, spatial, and energetic properties of each are discussed in context
with previously published HXR brightenings. They are seen to display several
'large-flare' properties, such as impulsive time profiles and earlier peaktimes
in higher energy HXRs. For two events where active region background could be
removed, microflare emission did not display spatial complexity: differing
NuSTAR energy ranges had equivalent emission centroids. Finally, spectral
fitting showed a high energy excess over a single thermal model in all events.
This excess was consistent with additional higher-temperature plasma volumes in
10/11 microflares, and consistent only with an accelerated particle
distribution in the last. Previous NuSTAR studies focused on one or a few
microflares at a time, making this the first to collectively examine a sizable
number of events. Additionally, this paper introduces an observed variation in
the NuSTAR gain unique to the extremely low-livetime (<1%) regime, and
establishes a correction method to be used in future NuSTAR solar spectral
analysis.

computational framework---to study the response of a plastic material due to
the presence and transport of a chemical species in the host material. Such a
modeling framework is important to a wide variety of problems ranging from
Li-ion batteries, moisture diffusion in cementitious materials, hydrogen
diffusion in metals, to consolidation of soils under severe loading-unloading
regimes. The mathematical model incorporates experimental observations reported
in the literature on how (elastic and plastic) material properties change
because of the presence and transport of a chemical species. Also, the model
accounts for one-way (transport affects the deformation but not vice versa) and
two-way couplings between deformation and transport subproblems. The resulting
coupled equations are not amenable to analytical solutions; so, we present a
robust computational framework for obtaining numerical solutions. Given that
popular numerical formulations do not produce nonnegative solutions, the
computational framework uses an optimized-based nonnegative formulation that
respects physical constraints (e.g., nonnegative concentrations). For
completeness, we will also show the effect and propagation of the negative
concentrations, often produced by contemporary transport solvers, into the
overall predictions of deformation and concentration fields. Notably,
anisotropy of the diffusion process exacerbates these unphysical violations.
Using representative numerical examples, we will discuss how the concentration
field affects plastic deformations of a degrading solid. Based on these
numerical examples, we also discuss how plastic zones spread because of
material degradation. To illustrate how the proposed computational framework
performs, we report various performance metrics such as optimization iterations
and time-to-solution.

simultaneously by combining shallow and deep cavities. This enables resonant
unit cells to be read out in the spatial absorption pattern of the array at
multiple spectral points, and the resulting information is then translated into
the refractive index of the analytes. The proposed technique gives
complementary information compared with the current nanophotonic techniques
based on molecular absorption, including the ability of the refractive index
measurement, the ultra-broadband measurable spectral range, and the small
volume of the analyte required, thereby pushing the potential for
refractometric sensing technologies into the infrared frequencies.

Surprisingly, both open- and closed-loop optimal controllers include an

the outcome may often be available in patients' health records, presenting an
opportunity to recruit patients selectively and estimate the mean outcome
efficiently. In this paper, we propose a two-phase sampling design that
leverages available information on auxiliary covariates in EHR data. A key
challenge in using EHR data for multi-phase sampling is the potential selection
bias, because EHR data are not necessarily representative of the target

derive an optimal two-phase sampling method that improves efficiency over

achieve. Explainable AI (XAI) has successfully increased transparency for
modern AI systems through a variety of measures, however, XAI research has not

possibilities and more efficient solutions to many real-world applications.
However, their integration had been slower than expected, partly due to the
need for new tools to take full advantage of these robots.
  As far as we know, all the groups currently working on the fully-actuated
multirotors develop new full-pose (6-D) tools and methods to use their robots,
which is inefficient, time-consuming, and requires many resources.
  We propose a way of bridging the gap between the tools already available for
underactuated robots and the new fully-actuated vehicles. The approach can
extend the existing underactuated flight controllers to support the
fully-actuated robots, or enhance the existing fully-actuated controllers to
support existing underactuated flight stacks. We introduce attitude strategies
that work with the underactuated controllers, tools, planners and remote
control interfaces, all while allowing taking advantage of the full actuation.
Moreover, new methods are proposed that can properly handle the limited lateral
thrust suffered by many fully-actuated UAV designs. The strategies are
lightweight, simple, and allow rapid integration of the available tools with
these new vehicles for the fast development of new real-world applications.
  The real experiments on our robots and simulations on several UAV
architectures with different underlying controller methods show how these
strategies can be utilized to extend existing flight controllers for
fully-actuated applications. We have provided the source code for the PX4
firmware enhanced with our proposed methods to showcase an example flight
controller for underactuated multirotors that can be modified to seamlessly
support fully-actuated vehicles while retaining the rest of the flight stack
unchanged.

Such SNS SQUIDs can be operated under a finite voltage bias with performance

Sciences. Traditional predictions use statistical information on recurrence
intervals, but those predictions are not accurate enough. In a recent paper, a
machine learning approach was proposed and applied to data of laboratory
earthquakes. The machine learning algorithm utilizes continuous measurements of
radiated energy through acoustic emissions and the authors were able to
successfully predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes. Here, we reproduced
their model which was applied to a gouge layer of glass beads and applied it to
a data set obtained using a gouge layer of salt. In this salt experiment
different load point velocities were set, leading to variable recurrence times.
The machine learning technique we use is called random forest and uses the
acoustic emissions during the interseismic period. The random forest model
succeeds in making a relatively reliable prediction for both materials, also
long before the earthquake. Apparently there is information in the data on the
timing of the next earthquake throughout the experiment. For glass beads energy
is gradually and increasingly released whereas for salt energy is only released
during precursor activity, therefore the important features used in the
prediction are different. We interpret the difference in results to be due to
the different micromechanics of slip. The research shows that a machine
learning approach can reveal the presence of information in the data on the
timing of unstable slip events (earthquakes). Further research is needed to
identify the responsible micromechanical processes which might be then be used
to extrapolate to natural conditions.

this metric to be differentiable and therefore suitable as an auxiliary loss

allowing applications to expose the available concurrency to a runtime system
tasked with coordinating the execution. While MPI has long provided support for
multi-threaded communication and non-blocking operations, it falls short of
adequately supporting APMs as correctly and efficiently handling MPI
communication in different models is still a challenge. Meanwhile, new
low-level implementations of light-weight, cooperatively scheduled execution
contexts (fibers, aka user-level threads (ULT)) are meant to serve as a basis
for higher-level APMs and their integration in MPI implementations has been
proposed as a replacement for traditional POSIX thread support to alleviate
these challenges.

distinguish different concepts in the parallel software stack. We argue that
the proposed tight integration of fiber implementations with MPI is neither

portable communication abstraction. We propose MPI Continuations as an
extension to the MPI standard to provide callback-based notifications on
completed operations, leading to a clear separation of concerns by providing a
loose coupling mechanism between MPI and APMs. We show that this interface is
flexible and interacts well with different APMs, namely OpenMP detached tasks,
OmpSs-2, and Argobots.

combined with the unobservable BRT process, the Uncertain EVT's predicted VaR
can foresee the risk of large financial losses, outperforms the original EVT

variables (IV) estimand as a weighted average of conditional local average
treatment effects (LATEs). I focus on a practically relevant situation in which
additional covariates are required for identification while the reduced-form
and first-stage regressions implicitly restrict the effects of the instrument
to be homogeneous, and are thus possibly misspecified. I show that the weights
on some conditional LATEs are negative and the IV estimand is no longer
interpretable as a causal effect under a weaker version of monotonicity, i.e.
when there are compliers but no defiers at some covariate values and defiers
but no compliers elsewhere. The problem of negative weights disappears in the
overidentified specification of Angrist and Imbens (1995) and in an alternative
method, termed ""reordered IV,"" that I also outline. Even if all weights are
positive, the IV estimand in the just identified specification is not
interpretable as the unconditional LATE parameter unless the groups with
different values of the instrument are roughly equal sized. I illustrate my
findings in an application to causal effects of college education using the
college proximity instrument. The benchmark estimates suggest that college
attendance yields earnings gains of about 60 log points, which is well outside
the range of estimates in the recent literature. I demonstrate, however, that
this result is driven by the presence of negative weights. Corrected estimates
indicate that attending college causes earnings to be roughly 20% higher.

  Turbulence",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For safety purposes, reliable reignition of aircraft engines in the event of
flame blow-out is a critical requirement. Typically, an external ignition
source in the form of a spark is used to achieve a stable flame in the
combustor. However, such forced turbulent ignition may not always successfully
relight the combustor, mainly because the state of the combustor cannot be
precisely determined. Uncertainty in the turbulent flow inside the combustor,
inflow conditions, and spark discharge characteristics can lead to variability
in sparking outcomes even for nominally identical operating conditions. Prior
studies have shown that of all the uncertain parameters, turbulence is often
dominant and can drastically alter ignition behavior. For instance, even when
different fuels have similar ignition delay times, their ignition behavior in
practical systems can be completely different. In practical operating
conditions, it is challenging to understand why ignition fails and how much
variation in outcomes can be expected. The focus of this work is to understand
relight variability induced by turbulence for two different aircraft fuels,
namely Jet-A and a variant named C1. A detailed, previously developed
simulation approach is used to generate a large number of successful and failed
ignition events. Using this data, the cause of misfire is evaluated based on a
discriminant analysis that delineates the difference between turbulent initial
conditions that lead to ignition or failure. It was determined that the cause
of ignition failure is different for the two fuels. While it was found that
Jet-A is influenced by fuel entrainment, C1 was found to be more sensitive to
small scale turbulence features. A larger variability is found in the ignition
modes of C1, which can be subject to extreme events induced by kernel
breakdown.

Mid-level representations encode invariances about the world, and we show that

better: both to harder problems and to larger domain shifts. In practice, this

they help accelerate DNN trainings in practice. In this paper, we provide an
empirical study of the regularization effect of these training techniques on

successful DNN trainings consistently obey a certain regularity principle that
regularizes the model update direction to be aligned with the trajectory
direction. Theoretically, we show that such a regularity principle leads to a
convergence guarantee in nonconvex optimization and the convergence rate
depends on a regularization parameter. Empirically, we find that DNN trainings
that apply the training techniques achieve a fast convergence and obey the
regularity principle with a large regularization parameter, implying that the
model updates are well aligned with the trajectory. On the other hand, DNN
trainings without the training techniques have slow convergence and obey the
regularity principle with a small regularization parameter, implying that the
model updates are not well aligned with the trajectory. Therefore, different
training techniques regularize the model update direction via the regularity
principle to facilitate the convergence.

along with the electromagnetic transients coming from the aftermath of the
merger in GW170817. However, much is still unknown about the post-merger
dynamics that connects these two sets of observables. This includes if, and
when, the post-merger remnant star collapses to a black hole, and what are the
necessary conditions to power a short gamma-ray burst, and other observed
electromagnetic counterparts. Observing the collapse of the post-merger neutron
star would shed led on these questions, constraining models for the short
gamma-ray burst engine and the hot neutron star equation of state. In this
work, we explore the scope of using gravitational wave detectors to measure the
timing of the collapse either indirectly, by establishing the shut-off of the
post-merger gravitational emission, or---more challengingly---directly, by
detecting the collapse signal. For the indirect approach, we consider a
kilohertz high-frequency detector design that utilises a previously studied
coupled arm cavity and signal recycling cavity resonance. This design would
give a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.5\,-\,8.6 (depending on the variation of
waveform parameters) for a collapse gravitational wave signal occurring at
10\,ms post-merger of a binary at 50\,Mpc and with total mass $2.7 M_\odot$.
For the direct approach, we propose a narrow-band detector design, utilising
the sensitivity around the frequency of the arm cavity free spectral range. The
proposed detector achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3\,-\,1.9, independent
of the collapse time. This detector is limited by both the fundamental
classical and quantum noise with the arm cavity power chosen as 10\,MW.

can be switched from zero to one by a small reduction in density, simply tuned
by a gate bias, in a two-dimensional electron system. This phenomenon arises
fundamentally as a result of electron-electron interaction in an itinerant,
dilute electron system. Essentially, the kinetic energy favors an equal
distribution of electrons over the available valleys, whereas the interaction
between electrons prefers single-valley occupancy below a critical density. The
gate-bias-tuned transition we observe is accompanied by a sudden, two-fold
change in sample resistance, making the phenomenon of interest for potential
valleytronic transistor device applications. Our observation constitutes a
quintessential demonstration of valleytronics in a very simple experiment.

recognition (CSR) still lags behind due to 1) the speech and language
characteristics of children's voice are substantially different from those of
adults and 2) sizable open dataset for children speech is still not available

Speech Recognition Challenge (CSRC), as a flagship satellite event of IEEE SLT
2021 workshop. The challenge will release about 400 hours of Mandarin speech

introduced significant privacy risks to users in a smart home environment.
Beyond the notable risk of eavesdropping, intruders can adopt machine learning
techniques to infer sensitive information from audio recordings on these
devices, resulting in a new dimension of privacy concerns and attack variables
to smart home users. Techniques such as sound masking and microphone jamming
have been effectively used to prevent eavesdroppers from listening in to
private conversations. In this study, we explore the problem of adversaries
spying on smart home users to infer sensitive information with the aid of
machine learning techniques. We then analyze the role of randomness in the
effectiveness of sound masking for mitigating sensitive information leakage. We
propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based approach for privacy
preservation in smart homes which generates random noise to distort the
unwanted machine learning-based inference. Our experimental results demonstrate
that GANs can be used to generate more effective sound masking noise signals
which exhibit more randomness and effectively mitigate deep learning-based
inference attacks while preserving the semantics of the audio samples.

burst arising from a neutron star merger, has challenged our understanding of
the angular structure of relativistic jets. Studies of the jet propagation
usually assume that the jet is ejected from the central engine with a top-hat
structure and its final structure, which determines the observed light curve
and spectra, is primarily regulated by the interaction with the nearby
environment. However, jets are expected to be produced with a structure that is
more complex than a simple top-hat, as shown by global accretion simulations.
We present numerical simulations of short GRBs launched with a wide range of
initial structures, durations and luminosities. We follow the jet interaction
with the merger remnant wind and compute its final structure at distances
$\gtrsim 10^{11}$~cm from the central engine. We show that the final jet
structure, as well as the resulting afterglow emission, depend strongly on the
initial structure of the jet, its luminosity and duration. While the initial
structure at the jet is preserved for long-lasting SGRBs, it is strongly
modified for jets barely making their way through the wind. This illustrates
the importance of combining the results of global simulations with propagation
studies in order to better predict the expected afterglow signatures from
neutron star mergers. Structured jets provide a reasonable description of the
GRB 170817A afterglow emission with an off-axis angle $\theta_{\rm obs} \approx
22.5^\circ$.

between 15 and 35 degrees. After considering projection effects, our results
could suggest that the outflows tend to be misaligned with the magnetic fields
by 50+/-15 degrees in three-dimensional space and are less likely (but not
ruled out) randomly oriented with respect to the magnetic fields. There is no
correlation between the misalignment and the bolometric temperatures in our
sample. In several sources, the small-scale (1000-3000 au) magnetic fields is
more misaligned with the outflows than their large-scale magnetic fields,
suggesting that the small-scale magnetic field has been twisted by the
dynamics. In comparison with turbulent MHD simulations of core formation, our
observational results are more consistent with models in which the energy
densities in the magnetic field and the turbulence of the gas are comparable.

these algorithms inject bias from data and environment leading to inequitable

formalizations of fairness have been proposed that can be categorized into
group fairness and individual fairness. Group fairness requires that different
groups should be treated similarly which might be unfair to some individuals
within a group. On the other hand, individual fairness requires that similar
individuals be treated similarly. However, individual fairness remains
understudied due to its reliance on problem-specific similarity metrics. We
propose a metric-free individual fairness and a cooperative contextual bandits

to maximize it. The advantage of treating fairness as a reward is that the

  vane using large eddy simulations",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The shape of the trailing edge of a gas turbine nozzle guide vane has a
significant effect on the downstream stagnation pressure loss and heat transfer
over the surface of the vane. Traditionally, adjoint-based design optimization
methods for turbomachinery components have used low-fidelity simulations like
Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes. To reliably capture the complex flow phenomena
involved in turbulent flow over a turbine vane, high-fidelity simulations like
large eddy simulation (LES) are required. In this paper, an adjoint-based
trailing edge shape optimization using LES is performed to reduce pressure loss
and heat transfer over the surface of the vane. The chaotic dynamics of
turbulence limits the effectiveness of the adjoint method for long-time
averaged objective functions computed from LES. A viscosity stabilized unsteady
adjoint method is used to obtain gradients of the design objective function
with reasonable accuracy. A gradient utilizing Bayesian optimization is used to
robustly handle noise in the objective function and gradient evaluations. The
trailing edge shape is parameterized using a linear combination of $5$ convex
designs. Results from the optimization, performed on the supercomputer Mira,
are compared with optimal designs generated using derivative-free design
optimization of the same problem.

the first part, we study the Bose-Einstein condensation of microcavity
exciton-polaritons in different artificial lattices. Bose-Einstein condensation
is a quantum phase transition, which allows the system to macroscopically
occupy its ground state and develop coherence spontaneously. Often studied in
microcavities, which are optical cavities that trap light at specific
wavelengths, exciton-polaritons are a kind of quasiparticle arising from the
strong coupling between quantum well excitons and cavity photons. By
periodically aligning cavity pillars in different patterns, one can achieve
different artificial lattice structures. With this setup, we apply the
driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equations to investigate the different
consequences of the condensation by changing the pumping schemes and the design
of the trapping potentials. Topics include multivalley condensation, phase
selection and intermittency of exciton-polariton condensation, flat band
condensation, and exciton-polariton topological insulators. In the second part
of this thesis, we focus on the electron-scattering properties of a hybrid
Bose-Fermi system. We consider a system consisting of a spatially separated
two-dimensional electron gas layer and an exciton gas layer that interacts via
Coulomb forces. We study the temperature dependence of the system's resistivity

enter in the colour superconducting phase. This evolution was already
considered in \cite{zhitnitsky5}, where it is concluded that a large chemical
potential $\mu$ is induced on the bulk of the object. The baryon number
accumulated at the domain wall surrounding the object is taken as predominant
in \cite{zhitnitsky5}, and it is suggested that internal and external fluxes
are compensated and can be neglected. In the present work, the possibility that
the bulk contribution to the baryon number may be relevant at initial stages
and that the object may emit a large amount of neutrinos due to quark-antiquark
annihilations is taken into account. The outcome is a more violent contraction
of the object and, perhaps, a more effective cooling. Therefore, the resulting
objects may have a smaller size. Even taking into account these corrections, it
is concluded that the cosmological applications of these objects are not
spoiled. These applications are discussed along the text.

considering both the algorithm's run-time complexity and enforcement of the

approach using the well-known Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm
that enforces both CBF and the robot Kinodynamic constraints to generate a

control signals that resulted in the obstacle-free path. The approach also
allows considering model uncertainties by incorporating the robust CBF
constraints into the proposed framework. Thus, the resulting path is free of
any obstacles and accounts for the model uncertainty from robot dynamics and
perception. Result analysis indicates that the proposed method outperforms
various conventional RRT-based path planners, guaranteeing a safety-critical

these both are expensive to implement. One method to reduce the size of the DNN
is to quantize the pre-trained model by using a low-bit expression for weights
and activations, using fine-tuning to recover the drop in accuracy. However, it
is generally difficult to train neural networks which use low-bit expressions.
One reason is that the weights in the middle layer of the DNN have a wide
dynamic range and so when quantizing the wide dynamic range into a few bits,
the step size becomes large, which leads to a large quantization error and
finally a large degradation in accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper
makes the following three contributions without using any additional learning
parameters and hyper-parameters. First, we analyze how batch normalization,
which causes the aforementioned problem, disturbs the fine-tuning of the
quantized DNN. Second, based on these results, we propose a new pruning method
called Pruning for Quantization (PfQ) which removes the filters that disturb
the fine-tuning of the DNN while not affecting the inferred result as far as
possible. Third, we propose a workflow of fine-tuning for quantized DNNs using
the proposed pruning method(PfQ). Experiments using well-known models and
datasets confirmed that the proposed method achieves higher performance with a
similar model size than conventional quantization methods including
fine-tuning.

The formulation uses the sensor information about the observable environment
and prior knowledge of the confinement boundary. The conventional Independent
Actor-Critic (IAC) method fails to converge due to sparseness in the reward.
The effect becomes evident when operating in such a dynamic environment with a
large area. In SR2L, along with the developed reward function, we use the
scaffolding reflection method to improve the convergence significantly while
increasing its efficiency. In SR2L, a motion planner is used as a scaffold for
the actor-critic network to observe, compare and learn the action-reward pair.
It enables the evader to achieve the required objective while using lesser
resources and time. Convergence studies show that SR2L learns faster and
converges to higher rewards as compared to IAC. Extensive Monte-Carlo
simulations show that a SR2L consistently outperforms conventional IAC and the
motion planner itself as the baselines.

temperature of ~40 K across the 70 au radius pebble disk, indicative of
emission from a warm, elevated molecular layer. Tentatively, DCN is present at
even higher temperatures. Both DCO+ and DCN present substantial emission
cavities in the inner disk, while in the outer disk the DCO+ and DCN
morphologies diverge: most DCN emission originates from a narrow ring peaking
around 30~au, with some additional diffuse DCN emission present at larger
radii, while DCO+ is present in a broad structured ring that extends past the
pebble disk. Based on parametric disk abundance models, these emission patterns
can be explained by a near-constant DCN abundance exterior to the cavity, and
an increasing DCO+ abundance with radius. There appears to be an active
deuterium fractionation chemistry in multiple disk regions around TW Hya, but
not in the cold planetesimal-forming midplane and in the inner disk. More
observations are needed to explore whether deuterium fractionation is actually

distribution of local factors that facilitate such spatial interactions. One
known limitation of the Harris and Wilson model is that it can have multiple
locally stable equilibria, leading to a dependence of predictions on the

global potential maximizers. Unlike local stability under deterministic
dynamics, the stochastic stability approach allows a unique and unambiguous

different problems and the gradient information on different variables, a

this paper, we are mainly interested in two notions related to syzygies: one is
the property $\mathbf{N}_{d,p}~(d\ge 2, ~p\geq 1)$, which means that $X$ is
$d$-regular up to $p$-th step in the minimal free resolution and the other is a
new notion $\mathrm{ND}(l)$ which generalizes the classical ""being
nondegenerate"" to the condition that requires a general finite linear section
not to be contained in any hypersurface of degree $l$.
  First, we introduce condition $\mathrm{ND}(l)$ and consider examples and
basic properties deduced from the notion. Next we prove sharp upper bounds on
the graded Betti numbers of the first non-trivial strand of syzygies, which
generalize results in the quadratic case to higher degree case, and provide
characterizations for the extremal cases. Further, after regarding some
consequences of property $\mathbf{N}_{d,p}$, we characterize the resolution of
$X$ to be $d$-linear arithemetically Cohen-Macaulay as having property
$\mathbf{N}_{d,e}$ and condition $\mathrm{ND}(d-1)$ at the same time. From this
result, we obtain a syzygetic rigidity theorem which suggests a natural
generalization of syzygetic rigidity on $2$-regularity due to
Eisenbud-Green-Hulek-Popescu to a general $d$-regularity.

photocurrent that depends on the light helicity. Recent studies have shown that
helicity dependent photocurrent (HDP) emerges due to light induced spin current
and the inverse spin Hall effect of semimetal thin films. We have studied HDP
in metal/semimetal bilayers. Compared to Bi single layer films, we find the HDP
is enhanced in metal/Bi bilayers. For the bilayers, the sign of HDP under back
illumination reverses from that of front illumination. The back illumination
photocurrent is the largest for Ag/Bi bilayers among the bilayers studied.
Using a diffusive spin transport model, we show that the HDP sign reversal
under back illumination is caused by spin absorption and spin to charge
conversion at the interface. Such interfacial effects contribute to the HDP
enhancement under front illumination for the bilayers when the Bi layer
thickness is small. These results show that the HDP can be used to assess
interface states with strong spin orbit coupling.

third advanced LIGO and Virgo observation run (O3 run). The SPIIR pipeline uses
infinite impulse response (IIR) filters to perform extremely low-latency
matched filtering and this process is further accelerated with graphics
processing units (GPUs). It is the first online pipeline to select candidates
from multiple detectors using a coherent statistic based on the maximum network
likelihood ratio statistic principle. Here we simplify the derivation of this
statistic using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) technique and show that
single-detector signal-to-noise ratios from matched filtering can be directly
used to construct the statistic for each sky direction. Coherent searches are
in general more computationally challenging than coincidence searches due to
extra search over sky direction parameters. The search over sky directions
follows an embarrassing parallelization paradigm and has been accelerated using
GPUs. The detection performance is reported using a segment of public data from
LIGO-Virgo's second observation run. We demonstrate that the median latency of
the SPIIR pipeline is less than 9 seconds, and present an achievable roadmap to
reduce the latency to less than 5 seconds. During the O3 online run, SPIIR
registered triggers associated with 38 of the 56 non-retracted public alerts.
The extreme low-latency nature makes it a competitive choice for joint
time-domain observations, and offers the tantalizing possibility of making
public alerts prior to the merger phase of binary coalescence systems involving
at least one neutron star.

broken, while the reflection symmetry is maintained. On the contrary, in the
bilayer, the inversion symmetry is restored, but the reflection symmetry is
broken. As a consequence of these contrasting symmetries, here we show that
bilayer WS$_2$ exhibits a quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) that is linear
with the applied out-of-plane electric field, in contrary to a quadratic one
for a monolayer. The interplay between the unique layer degree of freedom in
the bilayer and the field driven partial inter-conversion between intra-layer
and inter-layer excitons generates a giant tunability of the exciton oscillator
strength. This makes bilayer WS$_2$ a promising candidate for an atomically
thin, tunable electro-absorption modulator at the exciton resonance,
particularly when stacked on top of a graphene layer that provides an
ultra-fast non-radiative relaxation channel. By tweaking the biasing
configuration, we further show that the excitonic response can be largely tuned
through electrostatic doping, by efficiently transferring the oscillator
strength from neutral to charged exciton. The findings are prospective towards
highly tunable, atomically thin, compact and light, on chip, reconfigurable

approach to the singularity. These are seen to be vanishing, thus showing that
all physical objects will be crushed to zero size near the singularity.
Consequently, although the critical collapse is considered to be a fine-tuning
problem, the naked singularity forming is gravitationally strong. This implies
that the spacetime cannot be extended beyond the singularity, thus making the
singularity genuine and physically interesting. These results imply that the

layers is then combined by building a fused similarity network. The fusion
consists in an unsupervised process that exploits the structural properties of
the layers. Subsequently, partial distance correlations are adopted for
measuring the contribution of each layer to the structure of the fused network.
Finally, the community morphology of the fused network is explored by using
modularity. In the three fields considered (i.e. economics, information and
library sciences and statistics) the major contribution to the structure of the
fused network arises from editors. This result suggests that the role of
editors as gatekeepers of journals is the most relevant in defining the
boundaries of scholarly communities. In information and library sciences and

most common ice-related mountain landforms (glaciers, debris-covered glaciers,
glacier forelands and rock glaciers) and on the challenges, threats and
opportunities carabids living in these habitats have to face in relation to the
ongoing climate warming. The suggested role of the ice-related alpine
landforms, as present climatic refugia for cold-adapted ground beetles, is
discussed. Finally, the needs to develop a large-scale High-alpine Biodiversity
Monitoring Program to describe how the current climate change is shaping the
distribution of high altitude specialists, is highlighted.

meteor's magnitude to the corresponding meteoroid's mass. However, lack of
sufficiently accurate verification methods or adequate laboratory tests leave
this parameter to be controversially discussed. In this work meteor/fireball
data obtained by the Fireball Recovery and InterPlanetary Observation Network
(FRIPON) was used to calculate the masses of the pre-atmospheric meteoroids
which could in turn be compared to the meteor brightnesses to assess their
luminous efficiencies. For that, deceleration-based formulas for the mass
computation were used. We have found ${\tau}$-values, as well as the shape
change coefficients, of 294 fireballs with determined masses in the range of
$10^{-6}$ kg - $100$ kg. The derived ${\tau}$-values have a median of
${\tau}_{median}$ = 2.17 %. Most of them are on the order of 0.1 % - 10 %. We
present how our values were obtained, compare them with data reported in the
literature, and discuss several methods. A dependence of ${\tau}$ on the
pre-atmospheric velocity of the meteor, $v_e$, is noticeable with a relation of
${\tau}=0.0023 \cdot v_e^{2.3}$. The higher luminous efficiency of fast meteors
could be explained by the higher energy released. Fast meteoroids produce
additional emission lines that radiate more efficiently in specific wavelengths
due to the appearance of the so-called second component of higher temperature.
Furthermore, a dependence of ${\tau}$ on the initial meteoroid mass, $M_e$, was
found, with negative linear behaviour in log-log space: ${\tau}=0.48 \cdot
M_e^{-0.47}$. This implies that the radiation of smaller meteoroids is more
efficient.

attention. Existing work in this literature usually models the user-item
interactions as a bipartite graph, where users and items are two isolated node
sets and edges between them indicate their interactions. Then, the unobserved
preference of users can be exploited by modeling high-order connectivity on the
bipartite graph. In this work, we propose to model user-item interactions as a
heterogeneous graph which consists of not only user-item edges indicating their
interaction but also user-user edges indicating their similarity. We develop
heterogeneous graph collaborative filtering (HGCF), a GCN-based framework which
can explicitly capture both the interaction signal and similarity signal
through embedding propagation on the heterogeneous graph. Since the
heterogeneous graph is more connected than the bipartite graph, the sparsity
issue can be alleviated and the demand for expensive high-order connectivity
modeling can be lowered. Extensive experiments conducted on three public
benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-arts. Further
analysis verifies the importance of user-user edges in the graph, justifying
the rationality and effectiveness of HGCF.

ball sliding on the axis of symmetry with a constant speed, and the vorticity
in the core is proportional to the distance from the symmetry axis. We use the
variational setting introduced by A. Friedman and B. Turkington (Trans. Amer.

constraints on vortex strength, impulse, and circulation. We match the set of
maximizers with the Hill's vortex via the uniqueness result of C. Amick and L.
Fraenkel (Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 1986). The matching process is done by an
approximation near exceptional points (so-called metrical boundary points) of

obtained by using a concentrated compactness method.

are ""rheo-acoustic"" materials, i.e., their mechanical and structural properties
can be tuned using high-power ultrasound, sound waves with submicron amplitude
and frequency larger than 20~kHz . The effects of high-power ultrasound on the
carbon black gel are demonstrated using two experiments: rheology coupled to
ultrasound to test for the gel mechanical response and a timeresolved ultra
small-angle X-ray scattering experiment (TRUSAXS) coupled to ultrasound to test
for structural changes within the gel. We show that high-power ultrasound above
a critical amplitude leads to a complex viscoelastic transient response of the
gels within a few seconds: a softening of its storage modulus accompanied by a
strong overshoot in its loss modulus. Under high-power ultrasound, the gel
displays a viscoelastic spectrum with glass-like features and a significant
decrease in its yield strain. Those effects are attributed to the formation of
intermittent micro-cracks in the bulk of the gel as evidenced by TRUSAXS.
Provided that the shear rate is not large enough to fully fluidize the sample,
high-power ultrasound also facilitates the flow of the gel, reducing its yield
stress as well as increasing the shear-thinning index, thanks again to the
formation of micro-cracks.

is likely reduced. We hypothesize that limiting the number of Hebbian learning

generalization across changes to the environment. We test this hypothesis by
decoupling the number of Hebbian learning rules from the number of synapses and
systematically varying the number of Hebbian learning rules. The results in
this paper suggest that simultaneously learning the Hebbian learning rules and
their assignment to synapses is a difficult optimization problem, leading to
poor performance in the environments tested. However, parallel research to ours
finds that it is indeed possible to reduce the number of learning rules by
clustering similar rules together. How to best implement a ""genomic bottleneck""
algorithm is thus an important research direction that warrants further
investigation.

neutrino experiment under construction in China, with the goal to determine the
neutrino mass hierarchy. The JUNO electronics readout system consists of an
underwater front-end electronics system and an outside-water back-end
electronics system. These two parts are connected by 100-meter Ethernet cables
and power cables. The back-end card (BEC) is the part of the JUNO electronics
readout system used to link the underwater boxes to the trigger system is
connected to transmit the system clock and triggered signals. Each BEC is
connected to 48 underwater boxes, and in total around 150 BECs are needed. It
is essential to verify the physical layer links before applying real connection
with the underwater system. Therefore, our goal is to build an automatic test
system to check the physical link performance. The test system is based on a
custom designed FPGA board, in order to make the design general, only JTAG is
used as the interface to the PC. The system can generate and check different
data pattern at different speeds for 96 channels simultaneously. The test
results of 1024 continuously clock cycles are automatically uploaded to PC
periodically. We describe the setup of the automatic test system of the BEC and
present the latest test results.

models trained from their local data. In this paper, we aim to answer how well
incentives recognize (in)accurate local models from honest and malicious users,

We first present a thorough survey on two contrasting perspectives: incentive
mechanisms to measure the contribution of local models by honest users, and
malicious users to deliberately degrade the overall model. We conduct
simulation experiments to empirically demonstrate if existing contribution
measurement schemes can disclose low-quality models from malicious users. Our
results show there exists a clear tradeoff among measurement schemes in terms
of the computational efficiency and effectiveness to distill the impact of
malicious participants. We conclude this paper by discussing the research

Due to the varying background and experience of crowd workers, the obtained

In this paper, we advocate using hybrid intelligence, i.e., combining deep

crowd-sourced data, especially in an on-line scenario. We first summarize the
state-of-the-art solutions that address the challenges of noisy labels from

improve the learning process. Moreover, with the help of an expert labeler as
well as classifiers, we cleanse aggregated labels of highly informative samples
to enhance the final classification accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our strategies on several image datasets, i.e. UCI and CIFAR-10, using SVM
and deep neural networks. Our evaluation shows that our on-line label
aggregation with confusion matrix estimation reduces the error rate of labels
by over 30%. Furthermore, relabeling only 10% of the data using the expert's

legitimate user when the transmitter knows the instantaneous channel state
information (CSI) of the legitimate link thanks to the channel reciprocity in
time division duplex (TDD) systems, but does not know the instantaneous CSI of
a potential eavesdropper. Three optimal decoding structures at the eavesdropper
are considered in a fast fading (FF) environment depending on the handshake
procedure between Alice and Bob. Closed-form approximations of the AN energy to
inject in order to maximize the SR of the communication are derived. In

a given SR are determined when Eve's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is infinite.
Furthermore, a waterfilling power allocation strategy is presented to further
enhance the secrecy of the scheme. Simulation results are presented to

the atmosphere, is a challenging task for adaptive optics (AO) systems of the
next generation of extremely large telescopes. Within the community of AO the
first choice solver is the so called Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM), which
directly applies the (regularized) generalized inverse of the system operator
to the data. For small telescopes this approach is feasible, however, for
larger systems such as the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the
atmospheric tomography problem is considerably more complex and the
computational efficiency becomes an issue. Iterative methods, such as the
Finite Element Wavelet Hybrid Algorithm (FEWHA), are a promising alternative.
FEWHA is a wavelet based reconstructor that uses the well-known iterative
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method as a solver. The number of
floating point operations and memory usage are decreased significantly by using
a matrix-free representation of the forward operator. A crucial indicator for
the real-time performance are the number of PCG iterations. In this paper, we
propose an augmented version of FEWHA, where the number of iterations is
decreased by $50\%$ using a Krylov subspace recycling technique. We demonstrate
that a parallel implementation of augmented FEWHA allows the fulfilment of the

binary system HD 41004 that are among the deepest images ever obtained at
150~MHz and 400 MHz in the search for radio emission from exoplanets. The HD
41004 binary system consists of a K1 V primary star and an M2 V secondary; both
stars are host to a massive planet or brown dwarf. Analogous to planets in our
solar system that emit at radio wavelengths due to their strong magnetic
fields, one or both of the planet or brown dwarf in the HD 41004 binary system
are also thought to be sources of radio emission. Various models predict
HD~41004Bb to have one of the largest expected flux densities at 150 MHz. The
observations at 150 MHz cover almost the entire orbital period of HD 41004Bb,
and about $20\%$ of the orbit is covered at 400 MHz. We do not detect radio
emission, setting 3$\sigma$ limits of 1.8 mJy at 150 MHz and 0.12 mJy at 400
MHz. We also discuss some of the possible reasons why no radio emission was
detected from the HD 41004 binary system.

polarized content, detecting such propaganda has received attention as a new
task for content analysis. Prior work has focused on supervised learning with
training data from the same domain. However, as propaganda can be subtle and
keeps evolving, manual identification and proper labeling are very demanding.
As a consequence, training data is a major bottleneck. In this paper, we tackle
this bottleneck and present an approach to leverage cross-domain learning,
based on labeled documents and sentences from news and tweets, as well as
political speeches with a clear difference in their degrees of being
propagandistic. We devise informative features and build various classifiers
for propaganda labeling, using cross-domain learning. Our experiments
demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, and identify difficulties and
limitations in various configurations of sources and targets for the transfer
step. We further analyze the influence of various features, and characterize
salient indicators of propaganda.

  isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic","13 pages, LaTeX. Major changes after peer-review rebuttal",,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public
conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over
350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking
Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet
network to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their
interaction over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We identify
several stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to
international groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national
elites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community
received disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was
leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the
attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled
by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing
politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in
the discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the
network. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an
increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder
for information from international health organizations or scientific
authorities to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged
time. These results may have implications for information dissemination along
the unfolding of long-term events like epidemic diseases on a world-wide scale.

  speech commands recognition","Accepted to IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the current state-of-the-art models in many
speech related tasks. There is a growing interest, though, for more
biologically realistic, hardware friendly and energy efficient models, named
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recently, it has been shown that SNNs can be
trained efficiently, in a supervised manner, using backpropagation with a
surrogate gradient trick. In this work, we report speech command (SC)
recognition experiments using supervised SNNs. We explored the
Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) neuron model for this task, and show that a model
comprised of stacked dilated convolution spiking layers can reach an error rate
very close to standard DNNs on the Google SC v1 dataset: 5.5%, while keeping a
very sparse spiking activity, below 5%, thank to a new regularization term. We
also show that modeling the leakage of the neuron membrane potential is useful,
since the LIF model outperformed its non-leaky model counterpart significantly.

"2011.06848","Oleg Szehr","Oleg Szehr, Dario Azzimonti, Laura Azzimonti","An exact kernel framework for spatio-temporal dynamics",,,,,"math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A kernel-based framework for spatio-temporal data analysis is introduced that
applies in situations when the underlying system dynamics are governed by a
dynamic equation. The key ingredient is a representer theorem that involves
time-dependent kernels. Such kernels occur commonly in the expansion of
solutions of partial differential equations. The representer theorem is applied
to find among all solutions of a dynamic equation the one that minimizes the
error with given spatio-temporal samples. This is motivated by the fact that
very often a differential equation is given a priori (e.g.~by the laws of
physics) and a practitioner seeks the best solution that is compatible with her

differ, causing a domain shift problem. Following this observation,
transductive ZSL (T-ZSL) assumes that unseen classes and their associated

T-ZSL approaches do not scale efficiently when the number of seen classes is
high, we tackle this problem with a new model for T-ZSL based upon CycleGAN.
Our model jointly (i) projects images on their seen class labels with a
supervised objective and (ii) aligns unseen class labels and visual exemplars
with adversarial and cycle-consistency objectives. We show the efficiency of
our Cross-Modal CycleGAN model (CM-GAN) on the ImageNet T-ZSL task where we

various distinct spectral states. Because of its softness and intrinsic low
flux above typically 50 keV, very little is known about the hard X/soft
gamma-ray (100-1000 keV) emission in Cygnus X-3. Using the whole INTEGRAL data
base, we aim to explore the 3-1000 keV spectra of Cygnus X-3. This allows to
probe this region with the highest sensitivity ever, and search for the
potential signature of a high-energy non-thermal component as sometimes seen in
other sources. Our work is based on state classification carried out in
previous studies with data from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. We extend this
classification to the whole INTEGRAL data set and perform a long-term
state-resolved spectral analysis. Six stacked spectra were obtained using 16
years of data from JEM-X, ISGRI, and SPI. We extract stacked images in three
different energy bands, and detect the source up to 200 keV. In the hardest
states, our phenomenological approach reveals the presence of an component > 50
keV in addition to the component usually interpreted as thermal Comptonization.
We apply a more physical model of hybrid thermal/nonthermal corona to
characterize this component and compare our results with those of previous
studies. Our modeling indicates a more efficient acceleration of electrons in
states where major ejections are observed. We find a dependence of the photon
index of the power law as a function of the strong orbital modulation of the
source in the Flaring InterMediate (FIM) state. This dependence could be due to
a higher absorption when Cygnus X-3 is behind its companion. However, the
uncertainties on the density column prevent us from drawing conclusions.

importance for the understanding of redox processes. This can be performed by

on zirconia. However, this approach has some limitations, such as difficulty
regulating oxygen partial pressure in some intermediate-pressure regions or the
possibility of influencing the redox process by gases that can also be
incorporated into the oxide or react with the surface via heterogeneous

oxygen partial pressure is controlled by dosing pure oxygen inside an
ultra-high vacuum chamber. To monitor the conductivity of the oxide under
investigation, we employ a dedicated four-probe measurement system that relies
on the application of a very small AC voltage, in combination with lock-in data
acquisition using highly sensitive electrometers, minimizing the
electrochemical polarization or electro-reduction and degradation effects. By
analyzing the model material SrTiO3, we demonstrate that its characteristic
redox behavior can be reproduced in good agreement with the theory when
performing simultaneous electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) and
high-temperature equilibrium conductivity (HTEC) measurements. We show that the
use of pure oxygen allows for a direct analysis of the characteristic oxygen

calculate the volume of the CME for the magnetic ejecta (flux-rope type

frontal rim). Working under the assumption that the CME mass is roughly equally
distributed within a specific volume, we expand the CME self-similarly and
calculate the CME density for distances close to the Sun (15-30 Rs) and at 1AU.
Specific trends are derived comparing calculated and in-situ measured proton
densities at 1AU, though large uncertainties are revealed due to the unknown
mass and geometry evolution: i) a moderate correlation for the magnetic
structure having a mass that stays rather constant (~0.56-0.59), and ii) a weak
correlation for the sheath density (~0.26) by assuming the sheath region is an
extra mass - as expected for a mass pile-up process - that is in its amount
comparable to the initial CME deprojected mass. High correlations are derived
between in-situ measured sheath density and the solar wind density (~ -0.73)
and solar wind speed (~0.56) as measured 24 hours ahead of the arrival of the
disturbance. This gives additional confirmation that the sheath-plasma indeed
stems from piled-up solar wind material. While the CME interplanetary
propagation speed is not related to the sheath density, the size of the CME may
play some role in how much material could be piled up.

redshift deviation between subsamples decreases with the redshift to ensure the

control problems. Without using a mathematical model, an optimal controller can
be learned from data evaluated by certain performance criteria through
trial-and-error. However, the data-based learning approach is notorious for not
guaranteeing stability, which is the most fundamental property for any control
system. In this paper, the classic Lyapunov's method is explored to analyze the
uniformly ultimate boundedness stability (UUB) solely based on data without
using a mathematical model. It is further shown how RL with UUB guarantee can
be applied to control dynamic systems with safety constraints. Based on the
theoretical results, both off-policy and on-policy learning algorithms are
proposed respectively. As a result, optimal controllers can be learned to
guarantee UUB of the closed-loop system both at convergence and during
learning. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on a series of robotic
continuous control tasks with safety constraints. In comparison with the
existing RL algorithms, the proposed method can achieve superior performance in
terms of maintaining safety. As a qualitative evaluation of stability, our
method shows impressive resilience even in the presence of external

of the clients. In HFCL, only the clients who have sufficient resources employ
FL; the remaining clients resort to CL by transmitting their local dataset to
PS. This allows all the clients to collaborate on the learning process
regardless of their computational resources. We also propose a sequential data
transmission approach with HFCL (HFCL-SDT) to reduce the training duration. The

Previous works either depend on customized hardware or need a priori learning

centimeter-level passive gesture tracking system that works with only three
commodityWiFi devices, without any extra hardware modifications or wearable
sensors. To this end, we first identify the Channel State Information (CSI)
measurement error sources in the physical layer process, and then denoise CSI
by the complex ratio between adjacent antennas. Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) is further adopted to separate the reflected signals from noises.
Benchmark experiments are conducted to verify that the phase changes of
denoised CSI are proportional to the length changes of dynamic path reflected
off the hand. In addition, we adopt the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)
algorithm to estimate the Angle-of-Arrivals (AoAs) of dynamic paths, and then
locate the initial position of hands with triangulation. We also propose a
novel static componnets elimination algorithm for tracking correction by
eliminating the components unrelated to motion. A prototype of CentiTrack is
fully realized and evaluated in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
show that CentiTrack is superior in terms of tracking accuracy, sensing range
and device cost, compared with the state-of-the-arts.

established as a potential probe for cosmological information, but the
application of cluster alignments for these purposes remains unexplored.
Clusters are observed to have a higher alignment amplitude than galaxies, but
because galaxies are much more numerous, the trade-off in detectability between
the two signals remains unclear. We present forecasts comparing cluster and
galaxy alignments for two extragalactic survey set-ups: a currently-available
low redshift survey (SDSS) and an upcoming higher redshift survey (LSST). For
SDSS, we rely on the publicly available redMaPPer catalogue to describe the
cluster sample. For LSST, we perform estimations of the expected number counts
while we extrapolate the alignment measurements from SDSS. Clusters in SDSS
have typically higher alignment signal-to-noise than galaxies. For LSST, the
cluster alignment signals quickly wash out with redshift due to a relatively
low number count and a decreasing alignment amplitude. Nevertheless, a
potential strong-suit of clusters is in their interplay with weak lensing:
intrinsic alignments can be more easily isolated for clusters than for
galaxies. The signal-to-noise of cluster alignment can in general be improved
by isolating close pairs along the line of sight.

to intersect with each other through a fixed intersection angle at each end. A
bigon ring is a novel multistable structure composed of a series of bigons
arranged to form a loop. We find that a bigon ring usually contains several
families of stable states and one of them is a multiply-covered loop, which is
similar to the folding behavior of a bandsaw blade. To model bigons and bigon
rings, we propose a numerical framework combining several existing techniques
to study mechanics of elastic networks consisting of thin strips. Each strip is
modeled as a Kirchhoff rod, and the entire strip network is formulated as a
two-point boundary value problem (BVP) that can be solved by a general-purpose
BVP solver. Together with numerical continuation, we apply the numerical
framework to study static equilibria and bifurcations of the bigons and bigon
rings. Both numerical and experimental results show that the intersection angle
and the aspect ratio of the strip's cross section contribute to the bistability
of a bigon and the multistability of a bigon ring; the latter also depends on
the number of bigon cells in the ring. The numerical results further reveal
interesting connections among various stable states in a bigon ring. Our
numerical framework can be applied to general elastic rod networks that may
contain flexible joints, naturally curved strips of different lengths, etc. The

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can severely affect their host galaxies. Recently
an ultraluminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) at $z=0.49$, AKARI J0916248+073034, was
found to have a galaxy-scale [OIII] $\lambda$5007 outflow with one of the
highest energy-ejection rates at $z<1.6$. However, the central AGN activity
estimated from its torus mid-IR (MIR) radiation is weak relative to the
luminous [OIII] emission. In this work we report the first NuSTAR hard X-ray
follow-up of this ULIRG to constrain its current AGN luminosity. The intrinsic
2-10 keV luminosity shows a 90% upper-limit of $3.0\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$
assuming Compton-thick obscuration ($N_{\rm H}=1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$),
which is only 3.6% of the luminosity expected from the extinction corrected
[OIII] luminosity. With the NuSTAR observation, we succeed to identify that
this ULIRG has a most extreme case of X-ray deficit among local ULIRGs. A
possible scenario to explain the drastic declining in both of the corona
(X-ray) and torus (MIR) is that the primary radiation from the AGN accretion
disk is currently in a fading status, as a consequence of a powerful nuclear
wind suggested by its powerful ionized outflow in the galaxy scale.

generalize the design and testing procedure to accommodate a time-dependent,
treatment dose trajectory, and generalize a dose-response relationship to a

whose size ranges from 10~nm to a few micrometers, suspended in a liquid. Such
gels are ubiquitous in everyday life applications, from food products to paints
or construction materials, in particular thanks to their ability to easily
""yield"", i.e., to turn from a solid to a liquid under the application of a weak
external load. Understanding and controlling the mechanical response of
colloidal gels is therefore of prime importance. Depending on the details of
the system, however, the resulting gel networks present different
microstructural organisations that may lead to widely different mechanical
responses. This raises important challenges in fully characterizing yielding
and in uncovering the mechanisms of nonlinear response in colloidal gels. In
this paper, we distinguish between two classes of colloidal gels showing
respectively reversible yielding, where the gel network reforms upon load
release, and irreversible yielding, where the network is fully destroyed
through fractures and phase separation. This broad, empirical distinction is
achieved through rheology and local experiments at a mesoscopic scale,
intermediate between the network characteristic size and the sample size. We
further discuss how the observables derived from creep and fatigue experiments
may be modelled to predict yielding and highlight open questions and future
research directions in the domain.

existence of pose models and our method is able to animate arbitrary objects
without the knowledge of the object's structure. Furthermore, both, the driving
video and the source image are only seen during test-time. Our method is based
on a shared mask generator, which separates the foreground object from its
background, and captures the object's general pose and shape. To control the
source of the identity of the output frame, we employ perturbations to
interrupt the unwanted identity information on the driver's mask. A
mask-refinement module then replaces the identity of the driver with the
identity of the source. Conditioned on the source image, the transformed mask
is then decoded by a multi-scale generator that renders a realistic image, in
which the content of the source frame is animated by the pose in the driving
video. Due to the lack of fully supervised data, we train on the task of
reconstructing frames from the same video the source image is taken from. Our

LongEst-chAiN (LEAN) method that prunes CNNs by using graph-based algorithms to
select relevant chains of convolutions. A CNN is interpreted as a graph, with
the operator norm of each operator as distance metric for the edges. LEAN
pruning iteratively extracts the highest value path from the graph to keep. In
our experiments, we test LEAN pruning on several image-to-image tasks,
including the well-known CamVid dataset, and a real-world X-ray CT dataset.
Results indicate that LEAN pruning can result in networks with similar
accuracy, while using 1.7-12x fewer convolutional filters than existing

Goemans, Harvey, Iwata, and Mirrokni (SODA'09) as an application of their
structural result. In the mentioned problem $n$ unsplittable resources have to
be assigned to $m$ players, each with a monotone submodular utility function
$f_i$. The goal is to maximize $\min_i f_i(S_i)$ where $S_1,\dotsc,S_m$ is a
partition of the resources. The result by Goemans et al. implies a polynomial
time $O(n^{1/2 +\varepsilon})$-approximation algorithm. Since then progress on
this problem was limited to the linear case, that is, all $f_i$ are linear
functions. In particular, a line of research has shown that there is a
polynomial time constant approximation algorithm for linear valuation functions
in the restricted assignment case. This is the special case where each player
is given a set of desired resources $\Gamma_i$ and the individual valuation
functions are defined as $f_i(S) = f(S \cap \Gamma_i)$ for a global linear
function $f$. This can also be interpreted as maximizing $\min_i f(S_i)$ with
additional assignment restrictions, i.e., resources can only be assigned to
certain players. In this paper we make comparable progress for the submodular
variant. Namely, if $f$ is a monotone submodular function, we can in polynomial
time compute an $O(\log\log(n))$-approximate solution.

The 10um silicate feature was weak, ~12.8% above the local continuum, and the
bolometric grain albedo was low (~14%). Comet Catalina is a carbon-rich object.
This material, which is well-represented by the optical constants of amorphous

for the finite element approximation of the spectrum of second-order elliptic
operators. The main idea is to reduce the stiffness of the problem by
subtracting a least-squares penalty on the gradient jumps across the mesh
interfaces from the standard stiffness bilinear form. This penalty bilinear
form is similar to the known technique used to stabilize finite element
approximations in various contexts. The penalty term is designed to dampen the
high frequencies in the spectrum and so it is weighted here by a negative
coefficient. The resulting approximation technique is called softFEM since it
reduces the stiffness of the problem. The two key advantages of softFEM over
the standard Galerkin FEM are to improve the approximation of the eigenvalues
in the upper part of the discrete spectrum and to reduce the condition number
of the stiffness matrix. We derive a sharp upper bound on the softness
parameter weighting the stabilization bilinear form so as to maintain
coercivity for the softFEM bilinear form. Then we prove that softFEM delivers
the same optimal convergence rates as the standard Galerkin FEM approximation
for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors. We next compare the discrete
eigenvalues obtained when using Galerkin FEM and softFEM. Finally, a detailed
analysis of linear softFEM for the 1D Laplace eigenvalue problem delivers a
sensible choice for the softness parameter. With this choice, the stiffness
reduction ratio scales linearly with the polynomial degree. Various numerical
experiments illustrate the benefits of using softFEM over Galerkin FEM.

take place in real time. This is challenging because (1) streams often have
high dimensionality, and (2) the data characteristics may change over time.
Existing approaches tend to focus on only one aspect, either high
dimensionality or the specifics of the streaming setting. For static data, a
common approach to deal with high dimensionality -- known as subspace search --
extracts low-dimensional, `interesting' projections (subspaces), in which
patterns are easier to find. In this paper, we address both Challenge (1) and
(2) by generalising subspace search to data streams. Our approach, Streaming
Greedy Maximum Random Deviation (SGMRD), monitors interesting subspaces in
high-dimensional data streams. It leverages novel multivariate dependency
estimators and monitoring techniques based on bandit theory. We show that the
benefits of SGMRD are twofold: (i) It monitors subspaces efficiently, and (ii)
this improves the results of downstream data mining tasks, such as outlier
detection. Our experiments, performed against synthetic and real-world data,

  Factors","10th Solar & Storage Integration Workshop, Nov 2020, online, France",,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are more and more competitive due to
their increasing performances and decreasing costs. Although certain battery
storage technologies may be mature and reliable from a technological
perspective, with further cost reductions expected, the economic concern of
battery systems is still a major barrier to be overcome before BESS can be
fully utilized as a mainstream storage solution in the energy sector. Since the
investment costs for deploying BESS are significant, one of the most crucial
issues is to optimally size the battery system to balance the trade-off between
using BESS to improve energy system performance and to achieve profitable
investment. Determining the optimal BESS size for a specific application is a
complex task because it relies on many factors, depending on the application
itself, on the technical characteristics of the battery system and on the
business model framework. This paper describes a generic simulation-based
analytical method which has been developed to determine the BESS optimal size
by taking into account both the application and the storage performance over
its lifetime. Its implementation and the associated results are presented for
two different BESS use cases: A smoothing and peak shaving application for PV
injection and an off-grid hybrid microgrid case. In order to provide a better
understanding of the most influencing drivers to consider during a BESS sizing
procedure, several sensitivity analyses have been carried out on these two
illustrative cases. The use of comparative scenarios led to quantify the degree
of impact on optimal sizing results of several factors among the following
topics: control strategy, forecast quality, degradation of battery performance
due to ageing, precision of technical modelling.

spline interpolation in geophysics, or non-linear time series problems, where
the system includes a linear and non-linear component. We discuss here the use
of a finite Determinantal Point Process (DPP) for approximating semi-parametric

novel representation of some finite DPPs. These authors formulated extended
L-ensembles that can conveniently represent partial-projection DPPs and suggest
their use for optimal interpolation. With the help of this formalism, we derive
a key identity illustrating the implicit regularization effect of determinantal
sampling for semi-parametric regression and interpolation. Also, a novel
projected Nystr\""om approximation is defined and used to derive a bound on the
expected risk for the corresponding approximation of semi-parametric
regression. This work naturally extends similar results obtained for kernel
ridge regression.

Calculating Boltzmann's entropy directly as the logarithm of the total number
of microstates for a current macrostate is difficult for large systems. In the
case of studying the diffusion of $k$-mers (linear segments of $k$ adjacent
cells) on a lattice, the complexity of counting the possible microstates grows
exponentially with the number of $k$-mers in the system. The obvious solution
to this problem is to obtain only an estimate for the entropy, as this is
faster to calculate. The 2D sliding window technique can be used to divide a
system of $k$-mers on a lattice into subsystems. We use Ma's ""coincidence""
method to estimate the total number of possible states for such subsystems. In
this study, the accuracy of Ma's method is studied in a simple combinatory
model, both experimentally and theoretically. We determine which definition of
""coincidence"" for this scheme leads to greater accuracy. Where complex
interactions between $k$-mers are ignored, Ma's estimate of the number of
possible states for a system of $k$-mers correlates well with the estimate
obtained using a ""naive"" method.

objects with colors that are consistent with the presence of small amounts of
water and were able to distinguish between surfaces that are predominately
composed of complex organics and amorphous silicates. We found that 86% of our
sample have characteristics that are consistent with a certain amount of water
ice, and the most common composition (73% of the objects) is a mixture of water
ice, amorphous silicates, and complex organics. 23% of our sample may include
other ices such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane or methanol.
Additionally, only small objects seem to have surfaces dominated by silicates.
This method is a unique tool for the identification of complex organics and to
obtain the surface composition of extremely faint objects. Also, this method
will be beneficial when using the James Webb Space Telescope for
differentiating groups within the trans-Neptunian population.

engineering, and environmental sciences are specified through a generative
process. However, in some cases, it may not be possible to write down the
likelihood for these models analytically. Approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) methods allow Bayesian inference in such situations. The procedures are
nonetheless typically computationally intensive. Recently, computationally
attractive empirical likelihood-based ABC methods have been suggested in the
literature. All of these methods rely on the availability of several suitable
analytically tractable estimating equations, and this is sometimes problematic.
We propose an easy-to-use empirical likelihood ABC method in this article.
First, by using a variational approximation argument as a motivation, we show
that the target log-posterior can be approximated as a sum of an expected joint
log-likelihood and the differential entropy of the data generating density. The
expected log-likelihood is then estimated by an empirical likelihood where the
only inputs required are a choice of summary statistic, it's observed value,
and the ability to simulate the chosen summary statistics for any parameter
value under the model. The differential entropy is estimated from the simulated
summaries using traditional methods. Posterior consistency is established for
the method, and we discuss the bounds for the required number of simulated
summaries in detail. The performance of the proposed method is explored in
various examples.

infer physically plausible cosmic structures, which accounts for the
non-Gaussian features of the gravitationally evolved matter distribution and
light-cone effects. We test and validate our framework with realistic simulated
shear data, demonstrating that the method recovers the unbiased matter
distribution and the correct lensing and matter power spectrum. While the
cosmology is fixed in this test, and the method employs a prior power spectrum,
we demonstrate that the lensing results are sensitive to the true power
spectrum when this differs from the prior. In this case, the density field
samples are generated with a power spectrum that deviates from the prior, and
the method recovers the true lensing power spectrum. The method also recovers
the matter power spectrum across the sky, but as currently implemented, it
cannot determine the radial power since isotropy is not imposed. In summary,
our method provides physically plausible inference of the dark matter
distribution from cosmic shear data, allowing us to extract information beyond
the two-point statistics and exploiting the full information content of the

parameters of a device to best match some desired device behavior. Many
instances of the photonic design problem can be naturally stated as a
mathematical optimization problem that is computationally difficult to solve
globally. Because of this, several heuristic methods have been developed to
approximately solve such problems. These methods often produce very good
designs, and, in many practical applications, easily outperform 'traditional'
designs that rely on human intuition. Yet, because these heuristic methods do
not guarantee that the approximate solution found is globally optimal, the
question remains of just how much better a designer might hope to do. This
question is addressed by performance bounds or impossibility results, which
determine a performance level that no design can achieve. We focus on
algorithmic performance bounds, which involve substantial computation to
determine. We illustrate a variety of both heuristic methods and performance
bounds on two examples. In these examples (and many others not reported here)
the performance bounds show that the heuristic designs are nearly optimal, and
can considered globally optimal in practice. This review serves to clearly set
up the photonic design problem and unify existing approaches for calculating
performance bounds, while also providing some natural generalizations and
properties.

To assuage these issues, several logistics companies are planning to launch air

on a daily basis at an affordable cost. This research is one of the first to
propose a centralized framework to dispatch and route flying taxis in a

operations. The feasibility of the proposed approach is tested using potential

of the experimentation suggest that the minimum number of air taxis required

rate of 66%. In addition, the impacts of commuter willingness to fly rate,
percentage of demand fulfillment, on-road travel limit, maximum customer wait
time, and arrival distribution on the optimal number of air taxis, utilization
rate, number of customers served and cost incurred per customer are examined.
Analyses show that the willingness to fly rate appears to have a linear
influence on the number of air taxis and the efficiency, while on-road travel
distance has an exponential impact on the performance measures. The routing and

worldwide. This type of distress is caused by permanent deformation and shear
failure of the asphalt mix under the repetition of heavy loads. The Hamburg
wheel tracking test (HWTT) is a widely used testing procedure designed to
accelerate, and to simulate the rutting phenomena in the laboratory. Rut depth,
as one of the outputs of the HWTT, is dependent on a number of parameters
related to mix design and testing conditions. This study introduces a new model
for predicting the rutting depth of asphalt mixtures using a deep learning
technique - the convolution neural network (CNN). A database containing a
comprehensive collection of HWTT results was used to develop a CNN-based
machine learning prediction model. The database includes 10,000 rutting depth
data points measured across a large variety of asphalt mixtures. The model has
been formulated in terms of known influencing mixture variables such as asphalt
binder high temperature performance grade, mixture type, aggregate size,
aggregate gradation, asphalt content, total asphalt binder recycling content,
and testing parameters, including testing temperature and number of wheel
passes. A rigorous validation process was used to assess the accuracy of the
model to predict total rut depth and the HWTT rutting curve. A sensitivity
analysis is presented, which evaluates the effect of the investigated variables
on rutting depth predictions by the CNN model. The model can be used as a tool
to estimate the rut depth in asphalt mixtures when laboratory testing is not
feasible, or for cost saving, pre-design trials.

  Generalizable Task Representation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In searching for a generalizable representation of temporally extended tasks,
we spot two necessary constituents: the utility needs to be non-Markovian to
transfer temporal relations invariant to a probability shift, the utility also
needs to be lifted to abstract out specific grounding objects. In this work, we
study learning such utility from human demonstrations. While inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL) has been accepted as a general framework of
utility learning, its fundamental formulation is one concrete Markov Decision
Process. Thus the learned reward function does not specify the task
independently of the environment. Going beyond that, we define a domain of
generalization that spans a set of planning problems following a schema. We
hence propose a new quest, Generalized Inverse Planning, for utility learning
in this domain. We further outline a computational framework, Maximum Entropy
Inverse Planning (MEIP), that learns non-Markovian utility and associated
concepts in a generative manner. The learned utility and concepts form a task
representation that generalizes regardless of probability shift or structural
change. Seeing that the proposed generalization problem has not been widely
studied yet, we carefully define an evaluation protocol, with which we
illustrate the effectiveness of MEIP on two proof-of-concept domains and one
challenging task: learning to fold from demonstrations.

  Learned from Patients with ARDS",,,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The world has been affected by COVID-19 coronavirus. At the time of this
study, the number of infected people in the United States is the highest
globally (7.9 million infections). Within the infected population, patients
diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more
life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure.
Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by
monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are
merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be
ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to
early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We
posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients
infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19
on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term
daily logs of blood pressure and heart rate associated with 70 ARDS patients
admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing
42506 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19
positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we
develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal
data. Using only the first eight days of the data, our deep learning model is
able to achieve 78.79% accuracy to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients
infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients.

guidance to human forecasters for short-term (e.g., 0-3 h) severe weather

from an ensemble of convection-allowing model forecasts requires calibration.
In this study, we compare the skill of a simple method using updraft helicity
against a series of machine learning (ML) algorithms for calibrating WoFS
severe weather guidance. ML models are often used to calibrate severe weather
guidance since they leverage multiple variables and discover useful patterns in
complex datasets. \indent Our dataset includes WoF System (WoFS) ensemble
forecasts available every 5 minutes out to 150 min of lead time from the
2017-2019 NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Forecasting Experiments (81
dates). Using a novel ensemble storm track identification method, we extracted
three sets of predictors from the WoFS forecasts: intra-storm state variables,
near-storm environment variables, and morphological attributes of the ensemble
storm tracks. We then trained random forests, gradient-boosted trees, and
logistic regression algorithms to predict which WoFS 30-min ensemble storm
tracks will correspond to a tornado, severe hail, and/or severe wind report.
For the simple method, we extracted the ensemble probability of 2-5 km updraft
helicity (UH) exceeding a threshold (tuned per severe weather hazard) from each
ensemble storm track. The three ML algorithms discriminated well for all three
hazards and produced more reliable probabilities than the UH-based predictions.
Overall, the results suggest that ML-based calibrations of dynamical ensemble
output can improve short term, storm-scale severe weather probabilistic
guidance

  transfer learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Roof falls due to geological conditions are major safety hazards in mining
and tunneling industries, causing lost work times, injuries, and fatalities.
Several large-opening limestone mines in the Eastern and Midwestern United
States have roof fall problems caused by high horizontal stresses. The typical
hazard management approach for this type of roof fall hazard relies heavily on
visual inspections and expert knowledge. In this study, we propose an
artificial intelligence (AI) based system for the detection roof fall hazards
caused by high horizontal stresses. We use images depicting hazardous and
non-hazardous roof conditions to develop a convolutional neural network for
autonomous detection of hazardous roof conditions. To compensate for limited
input data, we utilize a transfer learning approach. In transfer learning, an
already-trained network is used as a starting point for classification in a
similar domain. Results confirm that this approach works well for classifying
roof conditions as hazardous or safe, achieving a statistical accuracy of 86%.
However, accuracy alone is not enough to ensure a reliable hazard management
system. System constraints and reliability are improved when the features being
used by the network are understood. Therefore, we used a deep learning
interpretation technique called integrated gradients to identify the important
geologic features in each image for prediction. The analysis of integrated
gradients shows that the system mimics expert judgment on roof fall hazard
detection. The system developed in this paper demonstrates the potential of
deep learning in geological hazard management to complement human experts, and
likely to become an essential part of autonomous tunneling operations in those
cases where hazard identification heavily depends on expert knowledge.

rising temperatures have a direct positive impact on the viability of
mosquitoes in ecosystems, leading to their abundance and thus the risk of
exposure of human populations to these pathogens. This study quantifies the
consequences of global warming on the risk of epidemics of viruses transmitted
by the Aedes Albopictus mosquito in metropolitan France. This mosquito, which
is a vector for the Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, among others, arrived
in mainland France in 2004 and has since spread throughout the country. Thanks
to the association previously established between the probability of the
presence of the mosquito and the average temperature combined with a
mathematical model, the probability of an epidemic and the number of people who
could be infected and die during a season in each department are estimated. If
there is a high degree of heterogeneity in metropolitan France, nearly 2,000
